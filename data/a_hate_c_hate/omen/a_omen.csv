Apr 5 2024,negative,wow this was boring they took the original and made it even less exciting and driven this was not an improvement it was not scary or interesting at any point
Apr 5 2024,negative,if you havent seen the original omen its fine but if you have its a dreadful boring watch
Mar 5 2024,negative,contrived to the point of boring it is painful to see a character with so many pitfalls that they become unrelatable mess the fact the film presents its plot as a series of shocking revelations is hilarious considering the predictability
Oct 31 2023,positive,a competent retelling of the original film some scenes are very similar but the story firmly plants itself in a more modern setting fairly well done and quite enjoyable if youre a damien fan
Oct 30 2023,positive,i dont understand all the negative reviews production is well done supporting acting by thewlis postlewaite and farrow is especially good the kid playing damien is a little devil creepy flick
Oct 17 2023,negative,this is the kind of remake that makes people hate the notion of remakes boring miscast far too clean visually and lacking any kind of new or original input similar to the 1998 psycho this version does very little in the way of meriting its existence
Sep 3 2023,positive,better paced than the og stunning visuals damien wasnt as good as in the og but thats alr bc hes sillier more character depth for katy more character depth for keith the scene before his death is actually about him and we as the audience have a larger emotional reaction which helps us understand roberts sudden change of choice regarding damien
Aug 3 2023,positive,in my opinion it was quite a good film however some parts were poorly edited and looked highly unrealistic the jump scares were good plot of the movie was incredible the acting was ashtonishingly good i came to write a review because i was extremely disappointed with the ending i expected it to end so much differently than it did and it wasnt just bad because it wasnt what i expected the film finished like as though it was a discarded project and was just finished as quickly as possible super good film would definitely recommend watching however if you are experienced with horror films you will find a lot of the movie is very predictable and before an event happens you will know what is about to happen
May 18 2023,negative,absolutely terrible and unnecessary the real sacrilege here is the fac that this was remade at all at least use the original score fail
May 5 2023,negative,painful ending wasnt what i expected but the poor acting didnt help an already troubled story
Feb 25 2023,positive,one of the most chilling movies ive seen even the reboot does justice
Jan 28 2023,positive,a notefornote remake that unlike gus van zants remake of psycho absolutely blows the doors off the original every single performance schrieber and thewlis throw the wooden performances of peck and remick and warner to the curb even the kid is scarily better so much better than the original the cast toptobottom is simply head and shoulders above the original 
Sep 27 2022,neutral,wasnt terrible i found it entertaining almost a complete 11 of the original i just feel the original added a tad bit more the overall story
Sep 26 2022,positive,dont understand the negative reviews i was on the edge of my seat the entire time this movie is very dark performances by the cast were great film raises a thought provoking question would you kill a child if he was the antichrist would you kill your own child if he was the antichrist
Sep 16 2022,negative,this is a slick remake of something that didnt need to be remade it doesnt add much besides style and suffers from the same problems of the original what i wrote about that earlier film applies to this its essentially about a group of adults plotting to murder a child in the growing conviction that the child is the antichrist furthermore the wouldbe childkilling adults are the heroes of the piece these good guys are following the logic of a belief system that includes an omnipotent being who presumably approves of the proposed infanticide and could personally zap the kid out of existence with no effort but prefers to watch human minions running around like headless chickens failing to do the job on the other hand if the omnipotent being doesnt approve of the murder and the rise of the antichrist is destined to happen no matter what then the entire plot is as pointless as remaking the omen in the first place this story unintentionally has me rooting for the bad guy over the bungling fanatics trying to stop him  these holy minions who ought to tell their supernatural and allpowerful boss if you want a child murdered do it yourself and leave us out of it this kid is the son of the devil who you decided to create and who could also kill with no effort this is a mess entirely of your making so maybe youd want to lift a single finger for once and deal with the poor taste of evil kid must die movies in general and the fact that the story is one big theological plot hole undermines any technical competence this or the film on which its based may demonstrate
Aug 21 2022,positive,i love cast liev schreiber and julia styles but i wish they did not wash rinse repeat but this movie is better than the poltergeist remake and it is shot really well but overall i would give this movie a b
Aug 1 2022,negative,so not worth the 01 hour and 50 minutes ever filmed horrorstyle
Apr 28 2022,positive,it sure did scare as a boy oh wait i think that was the remake i cant keep track of what i watch anymore talk about overstuffed oreo cookies on sale only 999 buy now commercials advertising products constantly is exhausting i have consume fatigue i think im gonna live in a remote cabin in montana to get some peace and solace hey guys remember rembrandt paintings and the solar eclipse summer solstice once a millennium
Apr 8 2022,negative,what were they thinking
Oct 31 2021,negative,it was overwhelmingly mediocre the only character i actually liked was keith because he was the only one with any sense of urgency that also was willing to be proactive it was hard to see any chemistry between the main couple and the fact that the antichrist only actually killed his nanny directly was a little underwhelming when compared to the warner armageddon its hard to believe that the boy is the devil evil for sure but not the devil
Oct 15 2021,negative,the screenwriter of the original david seltzer puzzles me with his decision to keep everything the same except for a few jumpscare dream sequences that are slightly visually striking the promising cast and director are sorely wasting their talents on this slick but vapid thriller
Oct 11 2021,negative,why some filmmakers never learn that if there are no silenced you do not notice the noise where the original had a slow build to a climax this movie begins with a giant telescope in the vatican id that part of the your schriever cant act
Sep 25 2021,positive,i dont really understand the hatred of remakes that simply take an existing movie but give it the audiovisual presentation that the makers of the original only wish they had  yes it can be frustrating when the thematic elements could have been deeper than before and the remake opts out of doing this and with the omen this is certainly the case as it literally involves god and the devil as well as an atheist learning that the religion he dismissed was actually real as an atheist i actually find the whole atheist discovered that religion is real type of story when welldone to be very engaging  but this version of the omen looks and sounds quite great and for that i give it massive props  if youve ever been interested in the omen but never saw it go ahead and watch this version  its essentially the exact same movie but updated technologically and in many ways that could make it arguably superiorits just the safest of approaches  its not quite as copypaste as the psycho remake but not exactly up there with halloween or total recall either whatever one has to say about those remakes theyre just the same cannot be said  thats my point
Sep 16 2021,neutral,the remake of the original film really doesnt have much new to offer besides being set in the mid2000s
Sep 9 2021,positive,the one thing i remember about this movie when it came out is how heavily they marketed releasing the movie on june 6 2006 im sure they rushed to hit that date it feels like a movie like this is at a disadvantage from the start those who know the original will never stop comparing it and will never let it be its own work and for those with no ties to the original i dont know that this premise plays as well in the early 2000s as it did 30 years before satanic panic was no longer as rampant as it once was regardless i still think it was a good run at the story casting was decent and they modernized it in ways that still attempted to preserve the story im not sure what they could have done better
Apr 12 2021,negative,please take the time to google the word basura
Dec 1 2020,negative,terrible boring long horror movie starring liev shriver and some random girl this is another forgettable horror remake that i will never recommend what the flip hollywood make better movies
Dec 1 2020,negative,terrible boring long horror movie starring liev shriver and some random girl this is another forgettable horror remake that i will never recommend what the flip hollywood make better movies
Nov 8 2020,negative,this movie is so unbelievably bad and slow that you dont feel anything but wonders whats gonna happen next     the following 2 paragraphs contains spoiler    now we have a journalist who cant stop taking photos of a priest and that nonstop shutter likeare you in love with the priest or something in one scene the journalist washes the films showing you its a filmbased camera on the next hes examining it on his computer despite taking a photo in bright daylight the photo taken has so much noise this is abysmall whats the director thinking    then comes all the classic cliche of mysterious priest man who speaks something unclear instead of just speaking clearly whats going on then the mysterious child that the mother fears so much its as if the mother herself isnt normal in the first place why cant the writer think from a normal family view point then work on how weird the child is its almost like the child is adopted and is weird not like the parents raise him from a baby     spoiler ends    this movie is so bad that i have to really write a review on rt never done this before
Oct 22 2020,neutral, i admire this remake for its ambition but damnliev shrieber is too bland in the lead role here
May 1 2020,negative,the worst horror remake and dont even bother watched this garbage remake
Oct 28 2019,positive,dont know about everybody else but i think this movie aint too bad its creepy suspenseful and julia and leiv do a pretty good job 
Aug 9 2019,negative,forced story sometimes the visual effects are kind of cheap bad or even awful physics when father brennan runs under the rain the lightning striking on the fence makes no thunder and never affects him at all big plot holes very abundant for example they never tell us who are the ones that stole and killed roberts son or what evil cult is it in case theyre of course mrs baylock and father spiletto and other hypothetic people we never get to know that and i would have been great if they made it clear the movie bases a lot on what we call jump scares trying to scare us by sudden visual changes or scary sounds instead of keeping the suspense and scare us with some good quality idea
Jan 12 2019,negative,a poor imitation of a great original
Nov 20 2018,negative,totally unnecessary and extremely inferior remake of the scary 1976 classic this version is not scary it is badly put together and uninteresting
Sep 15 2018,negative,worst remake ever    the omen 2006 directed by john moore is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original horror classic the omen 1976 directed by richard donner this new remake is like if a child held a camera for 2 hours while someone tried to make an omen film the shaky camera work never stops moving truly atrocious cinematography the direction is uninspired as literally every shot of this movie is a rehash of the original except they managed to make it worse every time    gone is the brisk speed of the omen 1976 the pacing of the omen 2006 is nonexistent as they made a near 2 hour movie feel like 3 hours horrible editing that jumps randomly whether to a new scene or an awful and not scary jump scare make this movie drag they did not even get the iconic score from the omen to at least give you something to listen to as you wish you would die so you did not have to watch this terrible movie    worse than pointlessly remaking a classic shot for shot but worse is that they changed the dialogue to dumber phrasing that makes less sense the characters constantly refer to something that never happened on screen because they cut out parts of the original but characters act in this one as if these events took place its astonishing the number of changes they made for no reason that weaken the story this movie hardly even makes sense in a modern era let alone changing sequences to incoherent insanity    the acting is the worst part however liev schreiber is no gregory peck he is as bland as milquetoast and never even sounds like he is consciously speaking if he were speaking from his sleep throughout the entire film i would not be surprised the few times he tries to actually emote he overacts julia stiles is so bored and miserable in the omen 2006 that you almost feel bad for her almost she is lackluster and dull during the entire time she is on screen i cannot believe that they cast these two downgrades from the original as the leads there is no chemistry or enjoyment here    furthermore i just want to complain about how bad mia farrow is every time she is on screen she overacts and feels so out of place is this a parody of the omen or what its disgraceful to even have cast her lastly why would they waste pete postlehwaite david thewlis and michael gambon in this what an embarrassing movie    just awful please just watch the original trilogy of films and skip this one i hate this movie and i do not want you to subject yourself to a terrible omen film watch the original 1976 film instead i implore you
Jul 5 2018,positive,if youve never seen the original film 1976 you certainly wouldnt need to do so in order to experience the almost identical subject matter and dialogue this film 2006 in my opinion is only intended to modernize the original version my rating is based on how well the original themes and feel are recreated and or revisited the first half is nonstop scene for scene which leaves you feeling a bit numb through the second half of this richly evil film 
Feb 15 2018,negative,so unneeded poorly done in comparison to the original which used except directing and subtle terror to make giant impression this one relies in a faster pace to suit those who are impatient but loses everything but added melodrama and cheapness
Nov 15 2017,positive,the original omen is one of my favorite horror movies of all time while this remake is not bad it does not live up to the original it does not add anything except for a better look that said it is not a bad movie and if you did not see the original then you should be satisfied with it
Apr 19 2017,positive,ill have to rewatch this for a reviewrerating since my memory of a movie i saw a decade ago isnt the best
Aug 29 2016,negative,well where do i begin the directing is horrible the actor is laughable at times the film does suffer from trying to be the same of the original have all the same big moments the film at times seems to fight with itself on what it wants to be overall i dont recommend you check it out
Sep 22 2015,negative,the movie that should never have been made it is a wordforword copy of the original script just freshened up for the 2000s audience an audience one may presume that the studio thinks are morons i like the actors in the remake but this is just a pointless movie i guess if you never saw the original it would be just ok hence the 40 audience score unfortunately this remake is a testament to the complete lack of creativity in hollywood
Sep 12 2015,positive,regarding others complaints i think it is fair enough to say that this film does follow closely with the original to the point where a couple of conversations are very similar  however i dont consider that to be a major issue and either way it is a very good film on its own    i did see this before the original which i consider quite dated  so you could look at this as simply an updated version either way it isnt bad    also possibly due to the fact that this was one of the first horror films i saw but i found this to be quite scary and creepy particularly if you havent seen the original i definitely think this is worth watching
Sep 5 2015,negative,on its own its not very good and as the remake of the first iconic horror movie it palespales in comparison
Aug 23 2015,negative,there are only 4 things that happen in 2 hours    1 nanny hangs herself  2 bitch falls off a railing and has a concussion   3 man gets chased by dogs  4 boys mom gets an air bubble in her iv from the new nanny    the boy is the devil we get it takes them the whole movie to figure this shit out awful acting awful movie
Aug 12 2015,negative,lazily recycling the originals script nearly word for word the omen remake wastes its solid cast and production values by trying too hard to be like the original but it just comes off as forced and uninspired
Jul 28 2015,negative,if i was the owner of that mansion and that 2nd nanny told me that the dog has to stay id use common sense and fire her there on the spot dont care if the mutt attacks me its my ââ house â wow this was recycled scene after scene and half of them are done badly why was this necessary just because it was remade for the date 6606 nothing but a douchebag move on the part of the studio in order to make a quick buck
Jul 26 2015,negative,yet another needles remake or reboot or whatever you want to tag it  this one lacks all of the suspense and thrills of the original
Jul 23 2015,negative,a great cast and some impressive production values cant help this horrible remake of a classic horror film that just didnt need to be remade check out the original its much better although seamus daveyfitzpatrick the kid who plays damien is quite creepy as are the various dogs
Apr 20 2015,positive,maybe it doesnt have the stellar creepiness as its predecessor but the scenes are faster paced for todays add audiences and i felt it was slightly an improvement
Apr 11 2015,positive,its pretty much a shotforshot remake but it works its gorgeously filmed and there are quite a few times that i jumped
Apr 3 2015,positive,fox decided to remake the omen for the release date 060606 a neat little gimmick better yet they decided to only incorporate the events of the first film the one thats actually good
Feb 25 2015,positive,just one little lie so the wifey wont be sad that one deed is repaid with several deaths
Feb 16 2015,positive,the omen succeeds through psychological suspense rather than the cheap tactics of blood  gore
Feb 7 2015,negative,the omen is certainly not the worst horror remake ever made psycho stills holds that title the movie is stylish and gory and it has an eerily funny advantage to having been released on june 6th 2006 but the biggest issue with this one is that it doesnt do anything new it practically follows every plot line and bit of dialogue in the original by heart any changes are minor and insignificant though liev schrieber and julia stiles are good performers they dont hold a candle to gregory peck or lee remick perhaps the coolest most ironic trait the omen has going for it is mia farrow mother of rosemarys baby playing mrs baylock the nanny from hell she is good and makes the character her own but the character was much more terrifying in that we knew she was trouble from the beginning overall not awful but not okay either just mediocre
Feb 1 2015,positive,if it werent for the story gaps this movie could have been an a for the horror genre the superstition were creatively portrayed and the movie was consistent thanks to sets costumes directing and editing
Jan 30 2015,negative,why did this need to be remade  ugh
Jan 12 2015,negative,classic reboots almost never work and the omen only contributes to that statistic the plot is skewed and progresses with painful uncertainty as if its blindfolded the action is overly dramatic and stylized which takes away completely from the horror aspect which the filmmakers who have obviously seen the original must have insisted not to emphasize rather they chose to distract their audience with modern day special effects and unfulfilled promises of fear that must have cost millions but still look dirt cheap hiding disgracefully behind the name of a classic horror film
Dec 21 2014,neutral,technically proficient overall but its a bit too on the nose with its approach to remaking a classic  it does very little to stand on its own as a different film to the original and while liev schreiber is game in the role that gregory peck inhabited before julia stiles is out of place  she doesnt possess the gravitas of a mother or a woman of stature  she was simply too young for the role  the rest of the cast was quite good though especially david thewlis who is a spitting image of david warner as the photo journalist in the original    there didnt seem to be much of a point in revisiting this film though  its slick of course but what movie wasnt in 2006  its a by the book remake that borrows more than recreate with no scares or lasting effect that the prior classic had
Dec 14 2014,negative,a boring exact duplicate of the original film with timid performances from julia stiles and liev schreiber the only redeeming factors were mia farrow and michael gammon but even they cant save this train wreck
Dec 4 2014,positive,dont believe the music it lies
Oct 28 2014,positive,saw this one when this remake came out  not a bad storyline  i liked the actors in this one and liked much better the little differences than the original
Oct 21 2014,negative,john moores the omen is not as frightening as richard donners 1976 versionmoore resorts to scare tactics rather than impending horror
Oct 15 2014,negative,the movie just keeps on gathering steam for the first hour and so and when its time to launch the screams out of me in the closing minutes it simply fizzes out too soon too badlydissapointeddont watch it
Aug 20 2014,negative,one of the most uninspired and boring films ive seen a sad excuse for the horror genre
Jul 6 2014,positive,i havent yet seen the original but as soon as i get a chance im gonna see it im sure its gonna be better than this but this wasnt such a bad movie like everyone seems to think it has a good story and a few good plot twists which make the movie interesting and intense to watch i personally loved the character of keith jennings as a horror movie it delivers and i think horror fans should see it others might not enjoy it as much as fans but its an ok movie and has a quite evil feeling to it
Jun 18 2014,negative,cant believe i sat through this it never got any better
Jun 18 2014,negative,not necessary and not any good
May 21 2014,positive,an intense supernatural thriller the omen is a faithful remake that delivers all of the terror of the original  the plot is essentially the same an american diplomat is unwittingly tricked into adapting a child who turns out to be the antichrist  liev schreiber and julia stiles lead the cast and give exceptionally strong performances  the directing is also quite impressive and is able through effective pacing and editing to build tension and suspense especially well  though it lacks some of the atmosphere of the original this remake of the omen is just as powerful
Apr 22 2014,negative,i found this remake to be too by the book from the old one i found everything to be forced and the acting was over the top and overacted  there was nothing new no fresh takes at all most importantly it wasnt scary and it was unnecessary
Apr 9 2014,positive,this ok remake was released on the 6th june 2006  which was a fiendishly clever idea
Apr 5 2014,negative,this lame remake on an already unbearably boring fright flick can not be approached with enthusiam from the critic inside everyone no matter how hard they try
Mar 31 2014,negative,ugh what a pointless practically notefornote remake of the fantastic original that is horribly miscast and feels like everyone phoned it in for a paycheck i checked out of this thing after 25 minutes when i realized that i was just waiting for all the classic scenes and kills to rear their heads and see if theyre as effective as the original the answer is no john moore is a terrible director and tries to add stuttery images jump scares and a freakin dream sequence to scare you in the most cliche of ways the only delight i had watching this version was seeing mia farrow play the nanny but alas shes not given much to do and shes hardly on screen just watch the original
Mar 15 2014,positive,the omen is always great  remake it often
Jan 10 2014,neutral,the remake of the omen is style drenched and coated in as many slick visuals as humanly possible to count yet it pales in comparison to its superior predecessor the cast are all on the ball and deliver acceptable performances and some even extend the roles from the original and furnish the character with their own interpretation mia farrow as mrs bay lock yet despite these qualities the omen felt a little too remade the omen did nothing for itself in the sense of its storyline or the events that went down this bothered me somewhat as i believe remakes are better when they can mix it up and do things a little differently instead of re applying the originals exact structure with more polished effects and a modern look also the creepiness of the first film was due to the child seeming so innocent and oblivious to his papas influence yet here the child is shoved in our faces with sinister expressions and a seemingly planned arrangement in the story this i didnt like that said it makes up for its mistakes by being a very entertaining and interesting plot to revisit worth a viewing and a reviewing since audiences will definitely be conflicted by this oddity
Nov 24 2013,positive,this movie drags on for way too long gets quite boring after a while and gets predictable
Nov 4 2013,negative,a dull heavily watered down horror flick that never delivers any real scares and will consistently test the viewers attention span
Oct 27 2013,negative,bleh even david thewlis cant bring his agame and phones it in
Oct 27 2013,negative,has creepy potential but turns put very dull
Oct 18 2013,positive,pretty impressed i like it not as great as original but wasnt horrible and had some good pop out scenes especially with souround sound
Oct 9 2013,negative,less soul than the original but just as boring
Sep 24 2013,positive,good horror movie it was intense as it should be and it never got messed up the ending was surprising but very interesting at the same time
Sep 6 2013,negative,competent actors are miscast in rather poorly written roles in this remake of the 1976 film of the same name    its a load of boring laughable garbage
Aug 1 2013,negative,i thought is was more comical than scary
Jul 27 2013,positive,i thought it really lived up to the original plus the directing was amazing
Jul 11 2013,positive,not as good as the origiinal  but good
Jun 2 2013,negative,im not really a fan of horror movies but this is definitely one of the worst if not the worst horror films ive seen i saw this recently and it was so bad i stop watching an hour in i saw the movie from start to finish a few years ago and even then i found it equally awful the story is just ridiculous its about 5 year old damien who is the son of the devil and whose mother is a jackal how does that work everything is normal until damien reaches the age of 5 and bad things begin to happen    i found this film so boring and more pathetic as it went along i found the omen more funny than scary and all i wanted to do was give damien a slap and wish that the parents could call super nanny the acting was ok decent enough the film stars liev schrieber julia stiles and mia farrow but it was more about how awful the story was i just got really fed up with it and the ending is rubbish im not interested in seeing the old version either as the story itself is terrible    grade f
May 30 2013,negative,terrible frightening at times but saddened me that i wasted 103 minutes watching it
May 27 2013,negative,you can read my review of the remake of the omen here  
May 11 2013,negative,its just so pointless inferior to the original in almost every way i suppose if you havent seen the original this could be mildly interesting but why bother
Apr 23 2013,positive,in a time where gore has become the trend in horror this balances violence and creepiness a worthy reimagining of a theological horror classic the casting of mia farrow as the damiens nanny is more effective as it removes the characteristic predictability of the original played by billie whitelaw julia stiles and liev schreiber take lead on their performances as the troubled couple
Apr 17 2013,positive,as far as remakes go not bad at all as it stands this remake has sparked some remarkably eerie imagery and beautiful cinematography that has enough style to warrant its existence a great cast also will make this worth your while you cant go wrong with mia farrow as the crazy nanny
Apr 12 2013,negative,i hate to be harsh but this film was nowhere near as good as its predecessor the original omen movie was wellmade but not incredibly good this film is plain weak    the cast is downright bad im sorry but there were no performances here that deserve any special praise that is kind of a major problem for a film    the script was nothing special either the soundtrack was slightly below average and was definitely inferior to the masterful soundtrack of the original omen film    the visual appeal of this film is one of its attractions but it also draws attention to one of the biggest defects of the film there was a solid amount of money put into making this film visually appealing and the result is quite nice when it comes to cinematography the problem is that horrorthriller movies are not meant to be beautiful they are meant to be horrible and grotesque i think that grotesqueness is exactly what this film lacks the biggest difference is obviously the nanny in the original film that woman was creepy in this version she is too polished to elicit much more than sudden scares which quickly pass the whole movie felt like that the raining scenes were also very polished when i would have loved for them to be disarrayed and chaotic    summary this film is incredibly weak the trailer had a few interesting visuals which may fool some people into watching this they account for about 10 seconds of the film dont be fooled    not recommended at all
Apr 5 2013,positive,funny to me i laughed when 34 of the theater screamed
Mar 31 2013,positive,pretty good movie suspenseful builds up the terror rather than a bombardment of effects and a good set of performances from its three leads
Mar 25 2013,positive,ive never seen the original yet so ill give 4 stars for this classic horror remake
Mar 19 2013,positive,this is like almost  exactly the same as the old one just not as good lol sometimes they even have the same lineswhen that happens you know it fails
Mar 10 2013,negative,a bland and boring remake
Mar 9 2013,positive,not bad for a remake and if you havent seen the original it will prob be a better film i enjoyed it anyway
Mar 3 2013,positive,i love how they almost did it just like the original
Feb 27 2013,positive,in all honesty i actually liked this remake i have yet to see any of the original films but i found this remake to be a solid film with good direction good acting and enough interest and intrigue to keep it lively it does have its corny moments and the story could use more polish overall i like it and its pretty far from being a terrible remake in my opinion
Feb 17 2013,positive,the movie has its good points and its bad points i want to see this movie when it came out on 6606 but i wait to see it when it came on tv because i didnt want to waste money on it it is a ok movie  long and boring very cold and mind wondering
Feb 17 2013,positive,richard donners original the omen was as groundbreaking as his superman movie it was horrific in so many ways and yet it was a master class in filmmaking    june 6th 2006 was the release date set for the remake aka 060606  666 mark of the devil get it that seems to be the only reason anyone at 20th century fox thought remaking a horror classic was a good idea anyways    you know the story and to be honest nothing much has changed in fact it seems like they used the same script as the original thinking perhaps they would not go far wrong and in some senses they dont but in others its painfully obvious this was a really bad idea    julia stiles is very much mis cast here she does not play the part with any charm and she looks slightly bored throughout shame as she is pivotal to the story    liev schreiber fares slightly better but he is very emotionless throughout but carries the film a lot better than stiles he is helped by the great david thewlis who plays the photographer who finds clues to the goings on in his photographs thewlis plays his part well and believably and is probably the best actor on the piece mia farrow is pretty dull throughout her small role    so what about young damien himself well hes not in the same league as the original but hes damn close but hes just a little too cutesy to be scary never the less hes good    the film is good in a lot of areas the cinematography is amazing the colour palette is beautiful and the reds that director john moore uses to denote evil while over done add a richness to the tones of the film    speaking of director john moore his direction here is a little choppy in places but in terms of his direction of the camera and the films look he pulls off something perhaps a little bit more artistic than the original which is to be credited his choice of using prague or whatever european country to double as london is a really bad move its painfully obvious it isnt london and its clear when they cant be bothered to use the actual location they arent actually bothered about the film    if youve not seen the original see it before watching this its better in so many ways than this however give this a try david thewlis the cinematography and the general update of the proceedings do give this remake a little bit of charm and is actually one of the better remakes out there    if the film proves one thing its that children can be right evil little shits thats something that hasnt changed between the original and the remake
Feb 17 2013,negative,talk about dã cjã  vu this film had a great cast but unfortunately didnt do the flick any justice the movie was dead on scenefor scene from the original so instead of creating sort of a different story for this version the filmmakers chose to stick with what isthe omen holds no candle to the originalthats because it practically is the original
Feb 16 2013,positive,my birthday is the 060606 freeky bt wow
Jan 31 2013,positive,the opportunists at 20th century fox were finally given the perfect excuse for a major hollywood remake on 662006 the day the antichrist was reborn the omen comes as close to being a shotforshot remake as any film since gus van sants psycho which makes the motives behind the films making that much more clear none of the deaths serve to shock or surprise when they are all taken directly from the original without any reworking john moore directs based on david seltzers earlier screenplay as well with few variations just in case anyone had any doubts after the ambiguous ending of richard donners film moore has hired the evilest looking actor he could possibly find to fill the role of damien this along with the unnecessary nightmare sequences strips away what little mystery and suspense were left instead we are left with a boring retread of the same exact film as played by a halfhearted cast moore has given us no reason to choose to watch his version over the original so it is best left forgotten
Jan 28 2013,negative,doesnt compare to the original
Jan 18 2013,negative,ive always felt the original omen was one of the best horror films made the script is tight the pacing is perfect the tension and realization in the characters is gradual and believable and the suspense is taut this remake lacks all of that and its due to the direction the pacing is dragged out in certain scenes and the suspense of certain scenes is gone do yourself a favor and watch the original
Jan 15 2013,positive,some scenes are better than the original but in the end it is just another remake
Jan 6 2013,positive,kinda shocked at the ratings here i enjoyed it much more than the original and is actually one of my favourite horrors
Jan 2 2013,positive,this wasnt as good as the orginal but i think it followed the story pretty well it was a pretty good updated version
Dec 31 2012,positive,seen as a stand alone its not to bad but it never manages to explain why it had to be made brings nothing of reel interest to the story and feels more superficial than the original hollywood needs to learn to ask why why make a remake when the original is great and recorded in a pretty good quality
Dec 31 2012,negative,dumb somehow they manage to bring israel into it and it a major turn off
Dec 30 2012,neutral,some pluses and minuses for this horror film ive seen twice   the actings ok    but the story is childish and repeat of the original omen   the film has a rather suitably ominous atmosphere   but everything is so easy to guess    and the film has very little originality     basically a reasonably wellmade remake of the original religionrelated horror films which suffers from childish realization and predictability
Dec 29 2012,positive,you know its actually good  pretty evil
Dec 27 2012,positive,not as good as i hoped
Dec 23 2012,positive,very good horror movie and gregory peck was so good in it
Dec 20 2012,positive,i will never forget the scene where the dude gets decapitated by the plate glass
Dec 18 2012,negative,the only thing good about this movie was mia farrow  bottom line end of story
Dec 3 2012,positive,better than i expected
Dec 3 2012,positive,one of the better horror remakes
Dec 2 2012,positive,not as good as the original
Dec 2 2012,neutral,im pretty sure some of you at least remember the cult 1976 horror movie the omen a story about satan sending his son to earth named damien to the boys stepparents who find out the truth when they hire a nanny to be damiens caretaker and also both parents die the film was directed by richard donner who later directed superman and lethal weapon the film also formed a quadrilogy after and it even remains a classic today now we have the remake by the way this was during that 2000s era when that load of shitty remakes came out this is one of them dont worry that trend is still being continued even till this day now lets jump to this piece of confusing movie anyway the story is pretty much the same but unlike the original this movie has a slight new twist because of course most modern remakes try to put a new spin on the classic legend this one fails sadly its seems like a shotforshot remake of the original missing the atmosphere and creepiness of the original because yes the 1970s was when a lot of notable horror movies came out this movie was just a reference to psycho 1998 where they they try to stay so close to the original that they fail and they have such an amazing cast i like liev schrieber mia farrow david thewlis and michael gambon and how did they all end up in this disappointing remake overall this movie tried to be good but it fails around every corner it holds onto the omen 2006 gets a 4810
Nov 30 2012,positive,i saw people scream during this movie who arent scared easily
Nov 18 2012,negative,i didnt like it at all it scared the crap outta me in a bad way they had to clean up the mess
Nov 11 2012,positive,bafflingly pointlessly faithful remake minus the scares
Nov 9 2012,positive,extremely scary in a not so scary kind of way way deep sht here
Nov 3 2012,positive,this is a brillent film
Nov 1 2012,negative,there were moments in this film where it felt fresh even though it wasnt but it doesnt help the rest of the film since the characters rarely feel developed and their emotions felt forced the character of damian was hardly in it and the settings were just rather poor
Oct 29 2012,negative,the original was scarierthis should have been better
Oct 25 2012,negative,saw it not as scary this is a remake
Oct 24 2012,positive,this damian was creepier than the original and although i always enjoy a liev schreiber film id say i still prefer the original
Oct 22 2012,negative,why they remade this and had it suck so bad is beyond me
Oct 21 2012,negative,not as good as the original i was bored and it wasnt scary
Oct 21 2012,positive,ok remake like some of the updating on it but it still not better than the original
Oct 19 2012,negative,i could not get over the fact that julia stiles was so completely miscast in this movie that i couldnt even tell you if the movie was any good out not outside of that point
Oct 4 2012,negative,first one was better
Sep 10 2012,positive,very interesting and exciting wen u watched it for the 1st time and if u havent watcehd the orgianl onebut if compored to the orginal one this version is better because of the modern technology and better perfomance by liev schreiberbut the sad thing about this movie is julia stiles that i cud not really standbasically this movie is one of her best related to her other stupid moviesher performance was sooo cold even though this role requires strong acting but she failed to thatit would be a better mother if it was rachel weisz who was actually nominated 1st 4 this movie
Sep 7 2012,negative,more like a funny ass horrific piece of shit
Aug 29 2012,negative,the whole movie was just to find out what i already knew the kid is the antichrist
Aug 23 2012,positive,havnt seen the original yet but i thought this version was really good
Aug 20 2012,negative,let me begin by saving us both time and going on the record the orginal is unbeatable and worth the watch this is not anything in comparison the 2006 remake was a huge risk that was worth skipping the only reason the movie was remade is because of the release day 060606  need i explain anymore i wasnt the least bit scared or finding myself glued to the film i gave it a fair try i guess demons and the devil have never really appealed to me
Aug 20 2012,neutral,a very faithful remake to its original but in a more modern sense that actually works well although for sum reason theres just something missing that i cant seem to figure out its not as mind grabbing as its orignal maybe the original worked better for its time then this one does  i still enjoyed seamus daveyfitzpatricks portrayal of the antichrist child a performance that shows just how pale damien can make esther from orphan
Aug 15 2012,positive,while its about as good as the original it simply cannot replace the thrills are tonedown and the death scenes arent as shocking not to mention that theres barely anything new therefore if youve seen the original there are no surprises left in the end it feels like a cheap imitation while softly being a tribute
Aug 15 2012,neutral,some pluses and minuses for this horror film ive seen twice   the actings ok    but the story is childish and repeat of the original omen   the film has a rather suitably ominous atmosphere   but everything is so easy to guess    and the film has very little originality     basically a reasonably wellmade remake of the original religionrelated horror films which suffers from childish realization and predictability
Aug 13 2012,negative,mmmm never paid much attention to it
Aug 13 2012,neutral,soso remake of a good horror movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,64 not entirely as bad as most people say it is its got some pretty good performances from its cast here and there as well as some unique mystery elements  however it can never beat the classic
Aug 10 2012,positive,its a good movie that a child was born antichristit delivers good gore and thrills
Aug 9 2012,negative,the original with gregory peck was better
Aug 9 2012,positive,loved it just as gripping and graphic as the original
Aug 6 2012,negative,if you make a shotforshot remake the cast better be impeccable  this one missed the mark by a long shot
Aug 4 2012,negative,seen itwish i hadnt
Aug 4 2012,positive,the horror remakes are about the only movie that work out better
Jul 31 2012,negative,the original always wins
Jul 30 2012,neutral,very slow and not particularly scary im not sure what this movie was supposed to be actually you could probably place it in mildly suspenseful with a touch of vatican propaganda im not sure but overall the trailer was way better than the whole movie
Jul 28 2012,positive,more thrills than scares i overall was entertained
Jul 24 2012,positive,good effective remake i went and saw it at midnight on 6606 when it premiered which made it that much cooler worth checking out
Jul 20 2012,positive,scared the crap outa me
Jul 17 2012,positive,not as good as the classic
Jul 16 2012,positive,i believe more could have been done the child was really creepy yet innocent looking it was scary i enjoyed this version more than i did the original but i think a lot more could have been done with because the movie would have done better with a bit more fine tuning especially those parts that were faithful to the original that in this day and age viewers may find a bit silly
Jul 16 2012,negative,this remake cut off some of the great scenes from the first some memorable scenes were ruined in addition it never gave something new to see for the franchise
Jul 12 2012,negative,meh bad casting was one of the biggest issue here as well as the outdated filming technique that back fired i could see a lot of resemblance with the original but it was just not good enough to be compared to the classic the stupid premiãre date only made the film more notorious
Jul 10 2012,positive,saw this with my ex they have the same name i liked the movie i think i liked it more seeing how into it my ex was though
Jul 3 2012,negative,just watch the original
Jul 3 2012,positive,i think this movie is going to be the besti want to see it badly
Jul 3 2012,negative,this movie is so stupid
Jul 2 2012,positive,just like ebert and roeper ill give it thumbs up
Jul 1 2012,positive,i havent seen the original but this movie is one of the scariest ive ever seen it still haunts me to this day
Jul 1 2012,positive,this was an unnecessary scenetoscene update of the 1976 version of the omen but not the worst remake in the world
Jun 29 2012,positive,decent remake of the original but i still think one of the original deaths should not have been changed
Jun 24 2012,negative,wasnt as good as i thought it would be
Jun 23 2012,positive,this remake of the 1976 classic seriously is one of the best remakes ever made and it is one of the best horror films of 2006 as well the omen is a great film and i like the style of this movie its very dark and grimy from start to finish this movie has the same plot as the original omen and the plot of this movie is about a young couple name robert and katherine thorn who raise a new child name damien after katherine gives birth to him but soon the couple realized that theyre son is not who he is and he carries a birthmark in which it reveals that theyre son is the beast and robert thorn learns all of the mysteries by finding more clues about his own son and his true self as well like i said the omen is a really good horror film and it is one of the most appreciating remakes and worth a watch as wellfrom the start everything is perfect and all of the scenes are really good whats great about the omen is that this movie has the same feel as the original the only thing is that the movie is much more darker and scarier than the 1976 classic and the feel of this movie is really dark which i seriously like in the movie the characters are also good and the new damien is even darker than before while the evil nanny who is the apostle of the devil is very creepy thanks to the performance of mia farrow which i like a lot in the film this film seriously has all of the right things that every horror film needs and everything is in this movie that most horror remakes and other horror films are missing as well i was fascinated with the themes and tones of this film because the idea of this remake is that the film is scarier and darker than other horror films and it is true as well to the original 1976 classic only with more darker and deeper tones and themes that keeps the viewers interested from watching it other than that i also like the music in the film and the music makes the movie look dark and deep i was really fund of the soundtrack of this movie and marco beltramis music seriously creeps me out and the music is freaky as hell and i love the way marco beltrami uses his music in these kinds of films even on his work on the soundtrack for the thing prequel and the woman in black and i think marco beltramis song is way better in this movie and he has the best songs composed in this film since the woman in black i was also fund of the suspense and tension in this movie and to be honest i love the scares in this movie and i dont understand all of the negative reviews of this movie and i dont agree that this remake is completely plain dumb and this is in my opinion a fascinating and fabulous horror film that keeps you interested from watching more of it there are also some great scenes in this film that has the same kind of style in the original film mainly those are the death scenes only done in a very dark style which really interest me the priest death scene in this film is much more darker than the one in the original film and it also looks realistic and that death scene is really atmospheric and when he was running to the church that scene when hes running to the church is so atmospheric and the atmosphere is well used in the film a lot and i like the death scene of the priest in this movie the scene where the first nanny hangs herself is so creepy and really dark because the music in that scene makes it feel even darker and that scene seriously creeped me out a lot and i also like the most famous scene in the omen which is the decapitation scene and i think its probably the most thrilling and the most outstanding kill in the film and that death scene is so final destination like style because the way keith died is really final destination like a lot and i was also fascinated with the way he died and the decapitation looks realistic and i like that scene a lot and the death scenes in this film are really done in a darker and final destination style and who cant even escape death in the final destination films while in the omen who cant possibly escape satan the devil in the entire film which is really good and the omen seriously became a cult classic back in the 1970s now the acting is great the new actor who plays damien is creepy as hell even julia stiles and liev schreiber does a really good job with theyre work in the film as damiens parents and mia farrow also creeped me out when she played the evil nanny plus i also enjoy the performances of michael gambon and robert thewlis in the film and so far the performances from the casts are great director john moore did a good job with his work on this movie and i hope he makes more good movies again for someday and im hoping that he will do a really good job with his next film the fifth die hard movie and im willing to see it as well overall the omen gets a 1010 because this movie has a lot of darker and deeper tones and themes plus the film also has an amazing soundtrack from marco beltrami and this movie also has a lot of incredible scenes with tense and suspenceful moments as well im planning to watch the original 1976 classic and im going to make a review and compare both the remake and the original 1976 classic which is directed by comic book writer and artist richard donner
Jun 22 2012,positive,good sandler movie with a messagefun for kids also
Jun 19 2012,positive,this movie was really close to the original but it made enough changes to remain interesting and hold our attention  it explained everything with more detail and was missing some of the charm the first one had but overall it was a pretty good remake
Jun 18 2012,neutral,nothing to special about this one not really scary
Jun 14 2012,negative,not as good as original
Jun 10 2012,positive,netflix does not have this wtf
Jun 9 2012,positive,nearly identical to original  bravo to liev  julia  great performances
Jun 5 2012,positive,pretty good for a remake especially given how excellent the original was
Jun 1 2012,positive,not too sorry to say i liked it more than the original
May 31 2012,positive,for a remake its not bad
May 30 2012,negative,i though this movie was stupid  boring all this movie did was make me laugh
May 30 2012,positive,it was a good movie but not as scary as i thought it would be the kids apperance looked too innocent to be scary regardless of his demon possessed acting
May 28 2012,positive,evil lil boy but great movie 
May 25 2012,negative,robert thorn is a senior american diplomat whose wife katherine endures a difficult delivery where their newborn child has died thorn knows the news will devastate katherine who had suffered two previous miscarriages the hospital priest presents thorn with another child born that night whose mother died in childbirth the priest compels thorn to take the infant boy as his own katherine will never know the truth and their son which they name damien will be raised as their flesh and blood as the child turns five unsettling events begin to occur enter mrs baylock damiens new nanny who seems to have a preordained devotion to the child then tragedy strikes closer to home but only later does thorn comprehend the truth damien is no ordinary child he is the longprophesized antichrist now thorn must make the ultimate sacrifice to prevent the unspeakable terror that awaits the world    on the sixth of june 2006 it was said all hell would break loose and people on earth would be punished im afraid to say my friends that we was punished as the omen was released on the big screen the story was just incredibly boring and not entertaining in the slightest the characters were written very poorly and there wasnt really much point in having the characters in the movie as they were mostly either annoying stupid or just pointless the acting is very poor in the movie and could have been so much better the casting was just terrible and so wrong for the movie the writing was bad and the script was even worse all in all it has to be a serious contender for top 5 worst remakes    totally pointless and seriously idiotic the omen aims for nothing but cheap scares and it even fails miserably at doing that the characters were about as interesting as staring at a wall for eight hours the casting was pretty bad and the acting was unconvincing and poor it could have been much better in the right hands this could have been a decent remake but theyve totally screwed this up if it wasnt the writing it was the cast i thought that it was nonsensical garbage and pointless theres one positive i can think of and that was that i watched it on television for free so it didnt cost me a penny im quite happy about that because i would have been upset if i bought this on dvd if you like the new horror remakes or you like watching bad horror movies that make you laugh then this is for you however if you liked the original or you like original fresh horror movies avoid at all costs
May 23 2012,positive,this movie was great and scary but i liike scary movies
May 23 2012,negative,boring lame save your time and pass on this one
May 14 2012,positive,watch the original first i havent seen it personally but this one is good kind of typical ending but good all around
May 14 2012,negative,copied word for word from the original the only different is the actorsand since not many people can do better than gregory peck this remake was a failure from the beginning
May 12 2012,negative,was never actual a huge fan of the original but this remake was shocking total rush drop in order to gimmick it by releasing on 6606
May 9 2012,negative,ill give it a shitty rating because mr schreiber is one of my favorite actors
May 6 2012,positive,kinda boring for a movie about the devil i wasnt to impressed
May 3 2012,negative,everything that was good about original omen  the music the atmosphere the acting  everything was taken away in this absolutely horrible version better watch the old omen once again in stead of this piece of garbage
May 3 2012,neutral,again the first was better
Apr 28 2012,positive,this was interesting
Apr 27 2012,positive,omg i was scared out of my mind when i saw this movie id love to see it again
Apr 27 2012,positive,man this child was evil
Apr 25 2012,positive,pretty disturbing to someone with children
Apr 25 2012,positive,damien is all i have to say
Apr 22 2012,neutral,the lack of strength in the main characters the rhythm of the movie itself and how it slowly and kind of tiring way the movie unfolds makes it a dull and passable flick
Apr 18 2012,negative,a pointless almost shot for shot remake of the original classic which alot like gus van sants psycho sets the standard for displaying the fact you cant just copy something and get the same effect as the first time around its two biggest mistakes of which there are many are damien who tries to look murderess and creepy all the time instead of innocent and cherub like in the original way more creepy and of all the things it redoes jerry goldsmiths terrifying score isnt one of them shocking in all the wrong ways
Apr 17 2012,positive,this movie was a trip i even have it on dvd
Apr 17 2012,positive,this movie was alright but it was really funny to see my sister scream hahaha
Apr 17 2012,negative,just like the old one
Apr 16 2012,negative,save your mony this movie was gay
Apr 15 2012,negative,a bland carbon copy of the original
Apr 14 2012,positive,the omen remake didnt live up to the full force creepy and original than the classic but it sure did modernize most of the part where our modern eyes satisfies with up to date effects and styles to be entertaining
Apr 13 2012,positive,i actually liked this movie it was really scary it was slow at some parts but i loved how it was twisted really good
Apr 12 2012,negative,its not scary at all
Apr 11 2012,negative,scary movies arent really scary to me any more i just use to it
Apr 9 2012,positive,is this the newish one or old one
Apr 8 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Apr 7 2012,positive,i much preferred this version slicker much less wooden characters a very cute damien i suppose thats just the difference between how acting was done in the 70s vs now i dont think that im indoctrinated to current ways of acting as i watched a 1965 film the other day and loved it i just that maybe the original version of the omen was a bit pantsly done
Apr 5 2012,positive,just saw it last night and even though it was slow going it was still scary and a good movie  i would recomend it
Apr 4 2012,negative,robert our son has gas
Apr 3 2012,positive,a close enough remake of a classic its got a few scary moments and intersting
Apr 3 2012,neutral,a remake of the classic that is word for word exactly alike the original minus the creepy eeriness stiles and schreiber seem extremely miscast and damien isnt nearly as creepy as the original the omen remake isnt horrible but will be quickly forgotten
Apr 2 2012,negative,i wasent a big fan but it is worth watching once
Apr 2 2012,neutral,saw all the originals enough is enough
Mar 31 2012,positive,75    this is for you damien all of this is for youthe nanny amy huck    it was only a matter of time before this classic was remade schreiber and postlethwaite were good as well as mr lupins david thewlis of the harry potter series decapitatin not bad but the 70s version will always be the definitive omen
Mar 31 2012,positive,watched the omen and said that it was a good remakebut will stick with the originalpretty good disturbing images and good assemble castbut it was like just seeing the originalso he gave this movie an c
Mar 25 2012,positive,not too bad but not the best either worth a watch on a rainy night
Mar 20 2012,positive,creepiest movie i have ever seen
Mar 19 2012,neutral,pretty good a few good jumps
Mar 18 2012,negative,the omen fails miserably in evoking the emotions and fears of the original and the fault for this lies everywhere in nearly every frame of the filmand squarely on the shoulders of an inept director who it seems has never watched a horror film in his lifeit gets an extra star from me because liev schreiber was really quite good as robert thorn otherwise the film felt overwrought with extremely tired horror film clichã cs and a score that certainly left something to be desired in spite of my opinion that marco beltrami is normally a better composer than thisif not entirely original either
Mar 17 2012,positive,a scary horror filmso terrifying
Mar 11 2012,positive,hated for no reason whatsoever although it sticks very close to the original this is a good remake the acting directing script are all great it is a slow character piece not fastpaced and packed with jump scares its effectively creepy and casting mia farrow was the best move possible
Mar 6 2012,negative,it was ok the only thing i remember was its all for you damion and she jumps off the roof
Mar 4 2012,negative,so shy compared to the original
Mar 4 2012,positive,its a great horror movie just i didnt like much this story
Feb 27 2012,positive,this movie is verywell hard to say its really interesting
Feb 26 2012,negative,unnecessary remake of a classic this version of richard donners the omen is almost exactly like the original horror classic the only difference is is that everything is up to date style wise technology wise and so forth this remake is worthless and whats surprising is the impressive cast here not even a cast like this can save a dull film like this if youve seen the far superior original directed by richard donner skip this film im actually surprised that with the talent involved the filmmakers couldnt create a more effective remake instead this is a shot for shot clone and its boring dull and above all lacks any real horror because well its predictable there are some remakes that are good unfortunately this updated version of the omen isnt one of them the film is very much like gus van sants version of psycho the reason that this film is terrible is that the film doesnt do anything besides copying the original for what it is this is a mediocre horror film that is somewhat entertaining but lacks the fire of the classic the film simply misses the mark and this the type of film that really puts an emphasis on unoriginality despite the cast this film simply lacked the fire of the original its exactly the same film except its updated for modern times the reason the film fails is that we know right from the start what happens and the payoff just isnt like the original film if you do watch this youre watching the same film minus the original jolts that the classic omen delivered so well
Feb 25 2012,neutral,my once partner in crime has described this as a worthless pointless remake and to be honest he has a point an almost shot for shot remake that brings absolutely nothing to the table this move is ultimately unsatisfying and almost completely without merit its distracting enough although i fear my feelings for the movie may be tempered by my reverence for the original and so my opinion isnt exactly unbiased
Feb 21 2012,negative,the originals much better
Feb 19 2012,negative,i finally broke down and watched this piece of garbage that is actually an example of marketing genius it may not be as horrible as gus van sants remake of psycho but its close to it mia farrow is the only inspired casting for this film and she seems like the only person who actually put any effort into it  i guess we just dont have actors who have the combined grace respect dignity and strength that gregory peck commands with such ease
Feb 18 2012,positive,a very satisfying movie i didnt think it was as bad as some people say it was so creepy and intense at some parts that i couldnt help but be happy with it i havent seen the original so i cant compare the two but overall i have to say i was okay with this film
Feb 16 2012,positive,dameon its all 4 u i love that movie
Feb 9 2012,positive,ok not as good as the first one
Feb 8 2012,negative,waste of my life though the kid made me laugh at times
Feb 1 2012,positive,this was pretty good  not entirely scary though just alittle more on the whole religion aspect of things
Jan 31 2012,positive,a good moviebut nothing like the original movie
Jan 28 2012,positive,this is quite a good remake of the original the little boy who plays damian is really quite creepy and plays the part so well it has scares chills and thrills just like the original i really liked it and thought it was a good remake as i did expect it to not be as good as the original but it surprised me alot mia farrow was just as creepy as damians nanny
Jan 22 2012,positive,the omen remake may be a copy of the original but its direction and creepy feeling makes it a satisfying experience
Jan 20 2012,negative,oh dear god this film is boring rarely have i ever actually looked at the time while a film was playing with the omen i believe i was staring off at the clock every fifteen minutes  a period of time that felt more like an hour on each go slow to develop disappointing when it does and completely lacking the cinematic creepiness of its predecessor i could hardly believe that there existed a director who could literally bore me into slumber if there is a hell i imagine that this movie will be on a constant loop played for all the damned to suffer to eternally
Jan 14 2012,positive,not nearly as bad as i thought it would be far too many thunderstorms and too much rain didnt anyone notice nearly every frame on the story board saying rain thunder  the basic premise apart from the son of the devil bit about the swapping of the babies was very intriguing especially given how it turned out  i assume the for tv version had quite a bit of the gory stuff left out thank goodness
Jan 11 2012,positive,the kid in the original movie was much creepier
Jan 8 2012,negative,you have to see the original much better than this one
Jan 7 2012,negative,very very bad remake of this movie  i laughed duringwell pretty much all of this  the best parts of this movie were as follows  1 the dog attacking the photographer and robert thorn  2 how the photographer died i actually replayed this scene about 15 times before i finished watching the movie  2 how the psycho nanny died i once again replayed this scene about 15 times before i finished watching the movie
Dec 25 2011,positive,the first half is really well made but then it crumbles and becomes a mess
Dec 16 2011,negative,the dad was the most boring character ive ever seen in a movie the dialogue is so boring and goes on for so long i would rather watch battlefield earth
Dec 15 2011,positive,okay that one scene wthe dog in the cemetary made me jump but otherwise mediocre
Dec 15 2011,negative,not the original so not good
Dec 14 2011,positive,not bad and scarier than the old version
Dec 5 2011,negative,the omen fails to live up to its premise bringing nothing new to table
Dec 2 2011,positive,creepy dont you think it was bone chillin                              this movie freaked me out and thats why i enjoyed it so muchi dont often see good movies like this
Dec 1 2011,negative,sucked a remake that they made just for 6606
Dec 1 2011,positive,i saw this movie when it came out this was the first movie i watched with my girl friend of five years exactly 5 years later after we watched this movie in the theater we broke up it could curse you
Nov 28 2011,positive,a good remake  the plot line  is similar  i would not watch the old one first for it would ruin watching the remake  the movie is about a bad deceitful  deal where robert thorn lies to his wife that their child did not die during child birth and is sinisterly fooled into adopting the anti christ as his child  deceit tragedy  and death follow the child whose future  is to create ruin for the planet hence the movie is call the omen for the child creates omens for horrific events to come  can robert thorn correct the mistake he made  i believe liev schreiber played  a great role but it is hard to match gregory peck as an actor  still worth watching  i give the film four stars  the film is unerderated1
Nov 27 2011,positive,this was actually really sweet
Nov 24 2011,negative,this remake is horrible there is no reason to see it just watch the original
Nov 21 2011,positive,not as good as the original but its better than most of those shitty remakes out there cough friday the thirth cough
Nov 21 2011,negative,so lame and the poor child is going to go through so much crap growing up in school just for a lame movie
Nov 11 2011,positive,creepyi seriously hate the little kid
Nov 11 2011,positive,unfortunately i did not believe liev his acting small boy was affordable like a pappet he should not speak in film at all to make his character proper evil effects were good i loved them
Nov 8 2011,negative,basically the original with new actors just watch the original     average movie guy
Nov 6 2011,neutral,pales to the 1976 version
Nov 5 2011,negative,the original built more suspense but ive seen far worse remakes
Oct 28 2011,neutral,firstly this is a remake that is all that will be said on the matter    the omen should be a psychological horror the type that makes you question whether there is a little damien in your town on your street or even in your own house though what it does is all too generic to be really frightening    there are a few successful jump scenes accompanied with some rather disturbing imagery and a heavy use of murderous hounds and thatâtms about it the rest is just a wildgoose chase of biblical bullshit that becomes too geographically improbable that it renders ridiculous     liev schreiber whom i am a big fan of is brilliant once more as damienâtms âdadâ he really drags this movie out of the shitter whilst his wife played by julia stiles is beautifulâand that is all damien himself fails to menace with his jetblack bowl cut and his murderous grin    through all of its faults itâtms enjoyable and rather entertaining but is definitely not one to rewatch
Oct 22 2011,neutral,i liked this even less than the original
Oct 22 2011,negative,probably the most derivative movie remake out there that is not a shotbyshot
Oct 16 2011,positive,you knowi was actually a little disappointed in this onei was hoping itd be better than i thought it would but no ok the kid the omen who is the main cause in the movie is barely in half of the moviealthough he did play a great role the times he actually was in the film i also have to admit there were some pretty scary scenes in here really scary thats why ill give it some credit actually the whole first half of the movie were great the second half howevernot a fan but it still has some pretty scary momentsitll make you feel like you need to go to church afterwards
Oct 8 2011,negative,acting was not believable due to script  not impressed
Sep 26 2011,positive,it wasnt quite scary at all although it was interesting  it seems that the original was far better wanting to see that now too
Sep 25 2011,positive,didnt think it was 26 bad but it could have been alot better it has its fair share of good scares though
Sep 25 2011,negative,this is as close to a shot for shot remake as could be falling just short of what gus vansant did with his unnecessary psycho remake
Sep 23 2011,negative,the dream and afterlife sequences alone about 1 minute of the entire movie that is were brilliant
Sep 18 2011,positive,not as scary as i thought but quite interesting
Sep 18 2011,negative,very very pale copy of the original this movie basically copies the original scene for scene and still manages to suck terribly i dont understand how they managed to do that but its quite an achievement take a great movie copy it scene for scene and make it suck really     on another note this has some of the strangest directing choices ive seen
Sep 18 2011,negative,the 76 version was more scarier but maybe thats because i was a kid then this boy doesnt look scary he just looks cute
Sep 14 2011,neutral,the story about a poor kid that does not really fit in and the grownups responsible for looking after him all drop deadtalking about an unhappy childhood    oh yes and if you have seen the 30 year old damien there is no need to see this one
Sep 9 2011,positive, did i scare you mommy i didnt mean to 
Sep 6 2011,negative,cheap copy of an amazing original
Sep 5 2011,positive,a decent remake but at the end of the day a remake so thats a few points down
Sep 1 2011,negative,shot for shot remake with a couple of jump scares thrown in i found myself talking along with the movie word for word inflection for inflection unnecessary film
Aug 19 2011,positive,man this sure creeps the shit out of you  cant say i loved it but its got merits
Aug 18 2011,negative,watched it beacause of julia styles but didnt really like it sadly
Aug 12 2011,positive,couldnt decide between 35 or 4  im not sure how this is compared to the original but this was pretty good good actingetc
Aug 10 2011,positive,actually not a bad remake still cant beat the original though
Aug 2 2011,neutral,mediocre but excused by the fine cast and a handful of scary moments
Jul 28 2011,neutral,rosemarys baby mixed with final destination not enough focus on the horrific aspects of the situation and a little too long
Jul 28 2011,negative,the little kid is a dick  very plain movie
Jul 22 2011,negative,i actually thought this would be worse than it was well cast and i particularly liked the beginning dragging the story into a contemporary setting that said its still an unnecessary remake and the original is far superior but if you absolutely must watch a remake you could do worse
Jul 14 2011,negative,fuck this movie a disaster compared to the original classic
Jul 11 2011,negative,ending is awful for how bad the movie was they shouldnt have set it up for sequels
Jul 9 2011,negative,this movie is an insult
Jul 8 2011,negative,this was a pathetic remake
Jul 1 2011,negative,i loved the original omen film and therefore wanted to love this one but its really just an empty hollow shell of the original its far more stylish for sure but any thought or deep characters that inhabited the original are gone here its faster paced yes but the only good that does is to end this terrible film faster which is a compliment
Jun 30 2011,neutral,not as good as the original omen movie from the 70s but watchable
Jun 16 2011,neutral,the original was way better i dont get it why do all th really good movies get a remake it isnt necessary and a waist of money if you ask me a lot of directors tried but few succeeded  in making a great remake of horrormovie look at the remake of al the juon movies  yeah that was a great idea
Jun 8 2011,positive,although it is less violent than final destination it has a lot of the same vibe creepiness leading up to over the top death scenes  at times hilarious whether they intended it or not and with a few surprises the movie should keep most entertained
May 29 2011,positive,the 1st movie that ever really scared me the fact that they took scriptures from the bible  had such a great evil childi came out of seeing this movie the 1st time  it was windy as in the cemetery scene  it freaked me out
May 18 2011,positive,decent enough julia stiles was great but she exits the film midway and doesnt do much after that mia farrow played a great batshit crazy evil woman some really great death scenes too i just didnt get the ending
May 16 2011,positive,not as scary as the original
May 15 2011,negative,an uninspired rehash with stale acting boring
Apr 19 2011,negative,a very poor remake shouldnt have bothered at all
Apr 17 2011,negative,it was atmospheric had some good points but it was way too flawed to be good
Apr 13 2011,positive,scary yes  depressing yes  but still u got to watch till the end
Apr 2 2011,neutral,mia farrow was the highlight of this film its shot for shot but it misses the mark on so many levels
Apr 1 2011,positive,this is like almost  exactly the same as the old one just not as good lol sometimes they even have the same lineswhen that happens you know it fails
Mar 23 2011,neutral,incredibly dissapointing
Mar 19 2011,negative,i watched half of it and i had to stop it sucked
Mar 16 2011,negative,watch the original stay away from this
Mar 9 2011,positive,stylistic yet utterly devoid of life it is nonetheless enjoyable for a horror film
Mar 4 2011,positive,faithful remake of the 70s classic having seen the original some of  the suspense was gone still the movie is paced well with good acting  this is not a gorefest though one bloody scene stands out and is  pretty cool the biblical interpretations and my belief in christianity  lend much to making this a horror film worth watching
Feb 28 2011,neutral,mia farrow was the highlight of this film  its shot for shot but it misses the mark on so many levels
Feb 26 2011,negative,nowhere near as good as the original not as tense not as scary and luckily not quite as hyped
Feb 24 2011,positive,it was fun and creeppy
Feb 23 2011,positive,a remake thats fine on its own but fails in comparison to its predecessor
Feb 20 2011,positive,when i first witnessed this film i had never seen the original omen so i had nothing to compare this too which is probably a good thing my overall thoughts of this film is mostly positive i really enjoyed some of the performances and the overall presentation of the film 710
Feb 18 2011,negative,90 of this remake is recycled from the original and the other 10 is just trash liev schreiber cannot fill gregory pecks boots and the whole film descends into madness because of it david thewlis and pete postlethwaite turn in good performances but even they cant save it
Feb 17 2011,positive,not a bad remake in my opinion and liev schreiber however is no comparison to the great gregory peck but he did a well done job
Feb 17 2011,positive,john moore filled in the shoes left by richard donner the director of the original  the omen
Feb 13 2011,negative,this was unfortunate crap
Feb 9 2011,negative,i reviewed this at the behest of irukandji please come back irukandji    daniel 82325 and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up    and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practice and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people    and through his policy also he shall cause craft fraud deceit treachery to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand     daniel 72021 and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke very great things whose look was more stout than his fellows    i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them     daniel 72427 and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings    and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time    but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him     actingcharacters first off they butchered the character of damien damien is supposed to look creepy and he is supposed to have the air of the son of the devil however in this film he just looks like hes sick and perpetually about to throw up not really creepy so they cant really have a good movie if the central character is crap leiv schreiber i enjoyed slightly as robert thorn the chick who played mrs thorn was okay too however the one casting choice that i must pat the director on the back for is mia farrow as mrs baylock given her past in rosemarys baby i liked seeing her in this was she as creepy or evil as the original mrs baylock not even close the original mrs baylock seemed like a happy normal person but there was still something incredibly unsettling about her mia farrow just seemed totally happy with flashes of evil and really nuts at the end but they could have done a lot worse one thing i highly disliked is how there were four or five instances where a character starts to cry each time with good reason i must admit the character gets the cry face on half sobs two or three times pulls it together and thats the end of that 3510    plot in the very beginning the vatican is positive that the comet they have seen is a sign of the end times approaching however i quote matthew 2436 no one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father so the theology is a bit off there other than that it was a carbon copy of the original plot they tweaked one or two things here and there but there wasnt a scene in the film that wasnt in the original thats one thing i dont get why remake a film that is 95 exactly like the original why not just stick with the original i will say that there were two moments that made me jump so bravo there but the plot was overall pretty weak particularly with the changes that they made to it not the worst ive seen though 3510    screenplay here we go this is where the film really loses points in the original mrs baylock says to damien have no fear little one i am here to protect thee much more unsettling than what they changed it to which was dont worry im here to protect you lame lame lame lame lame if your going to remake it at least keep in the cool lines they butchered the screenplay absolutely butchered it 1510    likableness it had its moments to be sure but they were pretty rare it took a lot of the creepiness that was so prevalent in the original out of the remake whats the point i imagine they were trying to make it scarier for a modern audience but they just utterly failed the best parts were mia farrow as mrs baylock but we didnt see her too much it would probably be semientertaining for those who havent seen or know nothing about the original as i have seen it i feel that this one is incredibly weak plus some of the special effects used in the movie most prominently the mother falling i thought were incredibly poorly done plus where the heck is avi santini if youre going to have an omen movie you have to have the avi santini music somewhere  210    final score 10540 26 huh the exact tomatometer score s      trivia time 1 the remake is seen largely as a result of two things fox wanted to bring a remake of the film to the japanese market as creepy kids seem to be big boxoffice there but when john moore came on board he suggested redoing the story for the world and not just the asian market also the fact that the date june 6 2006 was approaching surely must have sparked some interest in doing a remake     2 the teaser in which seamus damien is seen slowly rocking on the swing dressed in red was the seamuss screen test for the role     3 the role of katherine thorn was originally offered to rachel weisz who declined because she was pregnant at the time other actresses considered for the part were laura linney hope davis and alicia witt before julia stiles who finally got the part stiles and mia farrow were both in a play together and stiles suggested to director john moore that they use farrow for the role of mrs blaylock damiens nurse initially moore didnt think that farrow would accept the role but stiles convinced him she would eventually he just rang up farrow at her home and offered her the part     4 harvey stephens who portrayed damien in the omen appears in this remake as the tabloid reporter who asks robert thorn if the deceased nanny was on drugs     5 during filming seamus daveyfitzpatrick was never told that his character was supposed to be the son of the devil costar julia stiles has commented that it was because the filmmakers thought he was too young to understand it but he was really obedient when john asked him for the damien face     6 the day after they filmed the scene where robert cuts his sons hair to reveal the birthmark the entire scene was completely destroyed
Feb 8 2011,positive,damien is the only scary part of this
Feb 5 2011,positive,very scary stuff didnt sacre me a long time ago but it scares me now but its really good
Jan 28 2011,negative,kids are so frickin creepy
Jan 27 2011,positive,my rating seems unusually high but i always thought this remake was decent mia farrow steals the show  best smart casting choice ever   had its breathtaking hd moments on blu
Jan 21 2011,positive,i think personally more gory then horrific and kind of confusingthe child is creepy and unsetteling and the dreams the woman has but like i said its more of a gory mystery then the oraginal
Jan 20 2011,neutral,scary and different when it came out
Jan 19 2011,positive,seemed to go into more detail then the original or i just understood it better  still pales in comparison to the original but a good effort  ya better recognize
Jan 17 2011,negative,looks like 666 is unlucky for some this film is no match for the original on any level
Jan 15 2011,neutral,i love the idea with the omenbut this movie dragsi lost interest fairly quickliev didnt do the best job playing the lead role
Jan 14 2011,positive,its better than it should be but tries to match the original too much which it could never do annoyingly loud musical stings rather than tension ensue in this one
Jan 10 2011,positive,i am fanatically obsessed with horror movies and this one did not disappoint ive never seen the original but i thought this one was sufficiently creepy without being overthetop bloody to me real horror is the kind that makes your skin crawl not the kind that makes you want to throw up if you feel the same be sure not to miss this film
Jan 9 2011,negative,worse than the original one priod
Jan 3 2011,positive,a good remake some really cool scenes definitely deserves a watch for any fan of religious horror or cinematic thrillseekers very interestingbut i think most of it has to do with the story the original film introduced
Jan 2 2011,positive,it was a good movie it was better than what i thought i want it on dvd but its not better than the original it starred mia farrow david thewlis pete postlethwaite liev schreiber julia stiles and seamus daveyfitzpatrick
Dec 23 2010,neutral,nice touch with the score the visuals but characters we never grow to care about doom this remake the cop out ending also leave the film as incomplete while the race against the clock aspect ruin what there is
Dec 11 2010,neutral,1hr and 49 minutes of my life that i will never get back
Dec 9 2010,negative,the most pointless remake this side of gus van sants psycho
Dec 4 2010,negative,an appalling remake to say the least the writers attempted to make an amazing story because it coincided with a fortunate date but it failed to deliver the film felt rushed and the casting didnt feel right michael gambon would in my opinion have been a more convincing robert thorn the story was treated as if the child was the cause of everything that happened when the original gave the impression that it was circumstance  the two stars are for david thewlis role as jennings who was convincing despite the fact that the original jenninings david warner actually looks quite similar
Dec 3 2010,positive,hate remakes but this movie still very good very close to the original story at time scary but its to modern for me like the old movie but people who enjoy horror flicks will like this one
Nov 28 2010,negative,i found it pretty dull although the cinematography is good albeit a bit too dark at times stick to the original
Nov 27 2010,neutral,being partial to the original which still holds up very well i was reluctant to see this remake but it is very good and the special effects are improved but it is basically a remake of a film that did not need to be remade it was interesting to see mia farrow as the not so innocent nanny finally getting her turn as one of the bad guys and probably enjoying it
Nov 16 2010,neutral,completely pointless remake if its not broke dont fucking fix it you hollwood whores
Nov 14 2010,negative,the original version were better
Nov 13 2010,negative,worst movie of all time
Nov 13 2010,negative,im surprised at how a great cast can be summoned together to make such a turkey expensive waste of time its admirable how leiv schrieber was able to summon enough emotion to do the grief scenes because the whole thing is so bad
Nov 5 2010,neutral,4810        the omen is a remake that couldnt have worked whether the story was particularly good or not the filmmakers essentially remade so many scenes to the point where every scare is predictable and even the new ones arent to be treasured regardless the omen is a better film than it should be that should not entail that its a good film but its one of the more decent horror remakes out there theres definitely something artistic about it on a visual level but underneath its another shallow horror remake from hollywood i guess it has enough style to appeal to the general audience of todays horror flicks but thats not the point i dont want style i want a good movie and this is not what i mean while i do respect the original film and this film is clearly affectionate of it as a whole i cant be scared by a film that ive already seen ive seen better spins on the devilchild subgenre of horror and this isnt even one of the good ones and you know why because it isnt original the omen was original this film which doesnt even deserve the name that it bares is not in any way original and thats why is looses its entertainment factor pretty fast i found it to be watchable but if youre going to incorporate style into the mix then do it right give me style if you intend to give me any and give it to be in large amounts i look down on the omen because it is in every way inferior to the original its not scary its not creepy its not thrilling and its not particularly artsy allaround what could have been a creepy remake is made into another disappointment that does anything but surprise me then again i expected the remake of the omen to suck and you know what it didnt suck not a whole lot at least hell it cant even be called a bad film but it cant be called a good one either and thats precisely where it is at fault on the bright side it looks pretty and the acting isnt entirely revolting on the side of the cons its not very entertaining for a demonchild movie but then again its also a remakedemonchild movie maybe thats why i couldnt warm up to it            if youve seen the omen then ill save you the time and tell you to skip to the next paragraph of my review because to be honest nothing has changed same old story except this time its not really all that effective for those who are new to the series then here we go the omen is the legendary story of damien the son of the devil after his wifes child dies during labor robert thorn swaps out the unborn babe for a new one the new childs mother is nowhere to be seen and theres something wrong about the kid as he grows up youll notice that hes unnaturally somber always pouting and has rings under his little eyes he also doesnt get sick and the nearest thing he has to a complaint is when he goes completely crazy whenever he so much as sees a church he also seems to strike fear into whoever or whatever looks at him which we all know is unusual as well at first the parents take all this so lightly then things get really weird as damien almost intentionally puts the mother in the hospital and a priest is mysteriously impaled by something off of the church roof which is thought to be compelled by the power of the antichrist its not so much the story of this remake which is slightly less effective now that its all style and no substance is bad but its that its not as engaging as it was in the 1970s the story might as well be the same but its not as well told as it was in the original since its not as honorably good as the original the omen does not deserve its title as it lacks the frightening qualities of the original this happens a lot with remakes and im somewhat glad that the omen was granted a mediocre sequel but id rather that it wasnt made at all that would have been nice                liev schreiber cant replace gregory peck as robert thorn peck was absolutely magnificent while schreiber simply isnt the onscreen onofakind father that he thinks he is with that being said schreiber isnt bad its just that he lacks the brilliance that peck was essentially entitled to julia stiles isnt anything special wellin this movie nobody is but that shouldnt entail that she never has her little moments which she does and you know what its not good enough for me portraying damien is seamus daveyfitzpatrick who possibly does the best out of all the actors i say this because his pouty face is the most convincing thing sincethe original damien from the original omen and that is a good sign david thewlis was genuinely entertaining to watchyou know up until he got his head chopped clean off that is mia farrow a past survivor of the antichrist is the new portrayer of the psychotic maid from hell awesome right id think so         this is an artistic film without artistry i say this because the film itself is not art but on a visual level it can be called just that the production design is wonderful and the cinematography even more so however i dislike how the film goes farther away from actual scares than it does thrills the movie tries to scare us once in a while and of course it fails and the reason behind that is because if its not remaking a scene from the original the scares never fail to be something that weve all seen before you can show demonic imagery from the side of a mirror in an instant but please dont expect us to be the slightest bit scared what also bothers me is the lack of a truly frightening score i liked the music in the original omen because it really affected the experience while the new original score isnt bad at all its not as key to the scares as it was back then maybe its because hollywood feels as if we arent scared by scary things anymore and its rather visually revolting crap that makes us cringe thats not how it works although i can kind of forgive the omen for not insulting the intelligence of its audience but it doesnt exactly reward us for our intellect either now does it when all is said and done this remake is limited to a lack of ambition or originality                these kinds of remakes dont work anymore because theyre not bad but theyre not good either i would have liked the omen to pick a side much worse or much better than the original considering todays horror standards i doubt that it would have been a good sequel anyways but considering all the style involved it should have at least been entertaining instead it essentially copies the hell out of the omen instead or remaking it or even honoring it and despite a few entertaining scenes and some seriously symbolic colors im seeing red the omen is mostly uninteresting and id recommend most people to give it a skip if youve seen the omen then youve seen enough theres no need to see this film if youve already had one runin with the demon child one time is enough although to experience the original film over and over again is no sin its just that none of the sequels or remakes that would follow could compare to such an experience and this film tries to remake it for the facebook generation and fails for the most part if it werent for consistently good visuals and decent acting i would have written this film off completely i dont write it off completely because its backed up by some style although not enough and whathaveyou but style alone does not a good movie make i know that from alltoomany cinematic experiences gone wrong and this is essentially another one of them
Nov 4 2010,positive,okay but the original was the best
Nov 1 2010,positive,only the cast is new
Oct 31 2010,negative,its a crap from where that child was collected mia farrow is the only advantage in the film
Oct 30 2010,positive,when a mummy and a daddy love each other very much and they unfortunately have a baby who does not survive the birth the daddy shouldnt agree to take a newly orphaned baby without telling mummy first    thats the first few minutes of the omen it opens in rome and pretty much runs as described above the father is gregory peck as robert a prominent politician who has a great i am acting voice and the mother is lee remick as kathy faced with the choice of telling kathy that the baby did not survive or taking the opportunity handed when another mother dies during her own sons birth robert takes the latter way out    at the time the local priest says god has given you a son yeah right let me know how that works out for ya    cut to about 3 years later robert is promoted to be the us ambassador to the united kingdom resulting in an immediate move for the family and the young damien    when damien turns 5 they throw a big party at their home this is where it gets messy the family nanny sees a dog lurking nearby a pitch black dog a rottweiller for whatever reason the nanny seems impelled to take dramatic action she goes to the first floor and wraps a noose around her neck and throws herself off the edge but not before screaming something to the effect of this is all for you damien in the resultant chaos damien spies the dog still lurking and gives him a friendly wave    at the party  and at most major events that occur to the family over the next cinematic hour  a photographer is snapping away all the while    a few days later in rolls father brennan to the embassy who asks to speak to robert who initially agrees after he goes off on a bit of a tirade rabbitting on all sorts of ominous doomsday stuff he is turfed    enter the supernanny mrs baylock she arrives unintroduced and unrequested at the home and while she appears quite nice and professional you can tell immediately something aint quite right with her especially when she goes into damiens room and it appears that she doesnt have any white parts in her eyes evidence keeps building up against the poor little tacker obviously the nanny suicide being exhibit a  for now    over the ensuing few days     a trip to church sends damien into a cuckoobananas frenzy forcing them to abandon the sermon and     a day out at the local drivethrough safari park shows kathy that even animals have fear and hatred for damien especially the baboons who go wait for it apesh    initially kathy blames herself for damien and actually asks for psychological help for herself where she claims that damien is not her child and that he is evil youd think that at this point the right thing to do would be for robert to fess up but in his mind the lie got him this far what more could go wrong    father brennan shows again at a local rugby match telling robert to meet him the following day for 5 minutes only as his wife is in danger when robert meets him brennan spouts a lot of nonsensical sounding gibberish and tells him he must visit some guy to tell him how to kill the child upon parting ways a storm flares up from nowhere and follows father brennan who seeks solace at a church though things dont go so well for him when there    the straw that breaks the camels back is when damien is fanging around the first floor on his tricycle and seemingly makes a beeline for kathy as she stands on a table watering houseplants this scene is quite famous and has been parodied a few times there are many quick cuts between damien mrs baylock and an oblivious kathy and when she falls off the balcony the camera follows her to the floor    i dont feel that im giving too much away to this point when the poster has a picture of the boy with glowing red eyes damien is satans spawn     there i said it    anyway once the photographer gets involved and contacts robert things heat up robert decides to investigate for his familys sake and this takes him on a long quest first to a hospital in rome then a monastery then an abandoned cemetery and finally a city near jerusalem he must have racked up some frequent flyer miles    the climax is slightly tacky after such a prolonged deliberate build up and almost felt like a let down but the final scene was effective and set up the sequel which was apparently inevitable even though this film was made in 1978 and sequelitis wasnt yet rampant in hollywood    even after a movie which dealt with the son of satan and his attempt to take over the world by using a small boy i was never actually scared or even nervous watching the movie i might remind you that the exorcist came out before this film and it was very edgy and way more scary than this but the omen was well acted and for some reason i like movies that pose theological questions or theories    final rating  7  10 perhaps hasnt aged that well and gore hounds look elsewhere but a well made film and worth a look to escape the usual high school cannibal cheerleaders 11  in 3d    if you liked this or even if you didnt try oneguyramblingcom
Oct 29 2010,negative,liev schreiber has taken a bit ox botox his face is barely moving when he talks or does anything
Oct 23 2010,negative,very poor remakewhy did they bother
Oct 17 2010,positive,good movie great adaption enjoyed it
Oct 14 2010,positive,i love this movie dunno why people say its a shit remake but mmhmm how good was the original then
Oct 12 2010,negative,not a patch on the original
Oct 11 2010,neutral,first one was better
Oct 7 2010,negative,nothing short then a dissapointing remake the only good part is when the woman jumps off the building killing herself that was good but the rest it just plain boring and pointless
Oct 7 2010,negative,almost a scene for scene remake of the original that doesnt add anything and at times the actors appear to be barely awake  the film starts with the delivery of a still born infant and so the father decides to take another infant and not tell his wife  once the child hits the age of five strange things begin to happen the maid hangs herself at a birthday party and the father is hounded by a priest that seems to know whats going on  nobody takes ant action until its too late and evil looks like its about to win  if youre going to make a remake that is not as good as the original at least change it up a little bit
Oct 7 2010,positive,its a horror of all time
Oct 2 2010,positive,the omen is a decent remake of the 1976 classic it puts a 21st century spin on it while staying true to its origins while being a solid remake it is not nearly as powerful as the original john moores direction is well done and both julia stiles and liev schreiber have strong performances compared to many of the awful horror movies made in the last ten years the omen is much more enjoyable david seltzers well done modern script keeps viewers interested while overall the film is not that scary this remake is able to take more risks than the original that was released in 1976 the 2006 version is able to add more violence and use new technology for newer scares     robert thorn liev schreiber an american diplomant stationed in italy is told that his firstborn son died soon after birth so to keep his wife katherine julia stiles from being overwelmed with anguish he takes the advice of catholic priest father spiletto giovanni lombardo radice to adopt a child thats mother died during child birth robert is promoted to deputy ambassador and his family moves to london disturbing events begin to happen around their son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick one of the first being their nanny hanging herslef at damien birthday party she was driven to do so by a black dog robert is approached by father brennan pete postlethwaite who gives him a creepy warning that he knows secrets about damiens birth robert and katherine hire a nanny mrs baylock mia farrow who is really sent to protect damien katherine begins to sense that something is wrong with damien and has various dreams showing him as some evil being robert meets with father brennan again and father brennan tells him he must go to italy and meet a man called bugenhagen and he says that he must kill damien before he kills katherine who is preganant with their child robert who has been ignoring all of the warnings finally realizes they could be true when father brennan is found dead and damien tries to kill katherine he meets a photagrapher keith jennings david thewlis who has found himself involved in the same mystery as robert them both must find out the truth about damien    the omen lacks the scares of the original but makes up for it with a clever updated storyline liev schreibers powerful performance as robert thorn the father of damien is engrossing the religous symbolism and twists will keep you interested all throughout the film which is very much needed since the lack of scares julia stiles as katherine is very well done performance and one of the consistent parts of the film john moore doesnt bring anything special to the table but he does succeed in not making a awful film some very good performances and a 21st century scriptstoryline make the omen solid and very watchable    moodometer 60
Sep 29 2010,negative,booooring the only scene that scared me a grandma jumping on liev schreiber the only reason that this movie brought me to watch this movie was its marketing technique 6606 pretty cool movie pretty bad
Sep 24 2010,positive,not bad a little predictablebut on the whole not a bad effort liev schreibers performance is solid as always and just like in the originalthe tension rises slowly and steadily the films death scenes are the most imaginative ive seen in a very long time
Sep 18 2010,negative,why i watched because i had to see why they would want to remake one of the best horror films ever made the acting in this movie was not very good the story scenes and music were not as creepy the nanny was not creepy and why watch this when you can watch gregory peck deliver one of his best performances the original has everything a horror film needs to be to get you biting your nails and jumping in your seat while not going overboard on gore or getting cheesy skip this remake and watch the original
Sep 14 2010,positive,this is actually a pretty good remake with the obvious parts updated  with one or two scares this is almost as thrilling as the original unfortunately the acting is not as good  the direction is bad but overall one of the best reamakes ive seen
Sep 14 2010,positive,if the original had been better this would have been a good remake not enough death  there could have been so much more to the story
Sep 8 2010,negative,pointless and rubbish remake  preferred the original
Sep 6 2010,positive,great movie  and i wasnt even scared   it keep me intrigrued and compelled to keep watching from start to finish  i am starting to like scary movies  i surprize myself sometimes
Sep 6 2010,positive,not bad but im really not sure why it was remade  it is almost identical to the original but not as good
Sep 5 2010,negative,at the end of the day its just another pointless remake with a kid whose as creepy as winnie the pooh
Sep 2 2010,positive,the kid is creepy nice watch hard 2 xplain bt remains one of my favs
Sep 1 2010,negative,what made the 1976 omen so frightening was the notion of innate evil existing in a small apparently harmless child  seamus daveyfitzpatricks pseudoominous scowling damien is hardly as portentous as the original innocently smiling harvey stephens  liev schreiber and julia stiles lack the chemistry and pathos of gregory peck and lee remick and mia farrow who gave birth to her own demonic spawn in rosemarys baby is laughably hammy as the nanny ms baylock  pete postlethwaite michael gambon and david thewlis subbing for horror veteran david warner all provide notable supporting performances but they cannot save this overdone and totally unnecessary remake
Aug 31 2010,positive,well shot and full of suspense the omen is a generous remake with obvious affection for the original
Aug 29 2010,negative,dont waste your time with this movie all the best gorescary parts were cut but viewable as a special feature the only good thing that i can say about this film is that the art direction is okay
Aug 28 2010,neutral,boring and just another remake
Aug 28 2010,negative,lame remake of richard donners classic horror pity a good cast wasted in a very bland horror
Aug 26 2010,negative,what is the fuss about this film i seen them all there rubbish
Aug 24 2010,negative,another pointless remake watch the original instead
Aug 22 2010,neutral,i have mixed feelings about this one liev schriebers performance was great but it just doesnt match the original
Aug 21 2010,negative,its all for you damien  apparently since the unlucky number is 666 the media tried to influence us that on 6606 june 2006 was the day where evil could possibly come up and invade so in celebration this remake was made and it was the invasion   a large group of religious leaders mostly catholics prophesize the end of days through a chain of events similar to those in the book of revelations hurricanes floods terrorism ect all thats left is a comet and a baby finally those happen and the baby ends up adopted by a diplomatic couple which experienced a miscarriage everything seems normal until this baby turns six strange and terrible things happen and people die in strange ways little do many people know this is the devil   story it was a remake of corse so idk what to say the original was a classic it felt like they were taking it and putting a modern twist to it and tried to make it a little more pretty   acting was good but dont expect awardwinning the better work comes from the nanny and the mother the devil child seems more crazy then creepy at times unlike the one from the 70s looking back at the camera at the end just this kid who needs sent to miltary school actually a demon kid id just send him off to military school either way but thats what the sequal was for back in the day
Aug 19 2010,negative,so what exactly ruins this remake two things for one the actor that plays damien is too fucking weird what made damien so scary in the original is that for the most part he acted like a normal kid thats what made his actions all the more horrific the kid in this doesnt smile doesnt act like a kid period he makes the kid from the ring look like a kid from a chuckie cheese commercial and secondly its completely 100 the same film as the original shot for shot remakes are pretty lame anyway but a remake that tries absolutely nothing new is pointless  410  mediocre
Aug 14 2010,positive,didnt enjoy this film really not as good as i thought
Aug 10 2010,negative,awful remake i walked out on it in the theatre
Aug 8 2010,positive,very good horror movie and gregory peck was so good in it
Aug 5 2010,negative,this remake of the omen or the omen 666 as it is sometimes called since it was released on 662006 is not a bad film at all but it is an entirely unnecessary film solid production and direction give the film its own distinctive style and its initial moments try to update and expand the story by including events such as september 11th as signs of the advent of the antichrist while these opening moments are promising and the film looks great it ends up merely following the story almost verbatim for the remainder of its twohour running time the film even includes basically the same dialogue if this film wasnt a remake it would be awesome but because it is it is nothing but derivative trash that is not even brave enough to forge its own path
Aug 5 2010,negative,near enough shot for shot remake rather than a new reimagining slightly modernised  schreiber is ok but it aint the original  plus the decapitation scene loses a lot in the modernisation
Aug 5 2010,negative,not the best cast of characters for this remake
Aug 2 2010,negative,i liked the original better
Jul 31 2010,neutral,i watched this as an au harry potter film the boy they really didnt want to attend hogwarts lupin and dumbledore were there and so were sirius black in his animal form and an even further disfigured voldemort
Jul 24 2010,positive,stylish remake that adds a little and takes a lot from the original  very stylish camerawork and good effects are the plus side  deja  vu  and predictable ending are the minus side    i saw the original beforehand and still liked the little surprises
Jul 22 2010,positive,love it so much and it was full of mystery great direction and fascinating the end was unexpected and rather sad i enjoy watching it and as if attracts me till the end
Jul 21 2010,negative,john moore and company do offer some new insights into this remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all time  however it is overproduced over stylized and misses out on the intimacy and high drama that made the original the classic that it is great performances by entire cast  but it wasnt enough to keep me  from yearning  for the original and asking what was the point
Jul 20 2010,negative,eh  why remake something thats already so good  this remake does nothing that the original didntand the 1976 version was much scarier
Jul 19 2010,positive,his day will come    a remake of the 1976 horror classic the omen 1976 an american official realizes that his young son may literally be the devil incarnate    unlike most remakes this movie is surprisingly faithful to the original it modernizes it by using elements like 911 and the tsunami to foreshadow damians arrival other than the film being set in present time the movie was basically a scene for scene match of the original with a few twists in decent taste that makes it standout from the original as to make it not a direct xerox copy of it so if youve seen the original youll know what is about to happen for most of the time and sometimes the director throws in something new to make you jump    the downfall of this movie comes with the actors julia stiles and leav schreiber are the most nonbelievable couple on screen when their characters are apart their acting becomes a little more believable mia farrow of rosemarys baby fame plays the servant of hell in the form of a nanny the original ms baylock was disturbing to watch because she was scary herself mia farrow tried too hard to be scary and ended up looking like an idiot most of the time shes on screen now onto damian seamus daveyfitzpatrick tried his hardest to fill harvey stevens shoes but fell up short by a mile stevens was a creepy looking kid that every time he was on screen made your skin cold fitzpatrick makes you go awww hes so cute only during a nightmare of mrs thorns does this new damian make you cringe    this movie is enjoyable for both fans of the original and those who know nothing of the original the story is something that the average horror fan can get sucked into and those who have seen it will still be shocked by some of the minor additions to the film    overall i give it a c faithful recreation of a classic acting is fairly bad but the rest delivers
Jul 17 2010,negative,generations wiped out by a birdflu pandemic torrential flooding caused by global warming genocide perpetrated by warring armies rosie odonnell returning to daytime television while these seem to be telltale signs of an impending apocalypse they also prove to be the subtextual brushstrokes behind john moores somewhat vexed update of richard donners horror classic the omen     in this rrated update after a series of unfortunate events rivaling anything final destination ever put forth a young couple stiles schreiber begin to suspect that their young son newcomer seamus daveyfitzpatrick may be the devil incarnate beginning a search for his true roots and the salvation of mankind     having worked some of the bugs out of his reimagining prowess on the poorlyreceived the flight of the phoenix moore smartly borrows from the original without bowing to a coloringbynumbers scheme what was yellow he let mellow moore incorporates very little sfx relying instead on a good oldfashioned firstrate makeup and visual effects crew plus the casting proves a able schreiber and stiles perfectly hitting their marks and the supporting cast mia farrow david thewlis stealing their thunder what was brown he flushed down the couple proves to be younger than in the original and beset with inner turmoil his and hers crosses atheism and depression qualities easily identifiable with modern pillpopping moviegoers perhaps one double flush would have helped at times the omen descends into camp especially the dueling priests played by pete postlethwaite and michael gambon who apparently find the scenery quite delicious         bottom line oh god bad devil
Jul 6 2010,negative,usually when i go into a remake i try to forget my opinions of the original which i loved that was hard to do for this one though since this seemed to be almost exactly like it  if i wanted to watch the original i would have stayed home and watched it
Jun 25 2010,negative,julia stiles why are you in movies
Jun 22 2010,negative,eh  watch the classic original instead
Jun 22 2010,negative,the kid is not as creepy as the original so much for a good remake
Jun 21 2010,positive,this is quite a good remake of the original the little boy who plays damian is really quite creepy and plays the part so well it has scares chills and thrills just like the original i really liked it and thought it was a good remake as i did expect it to not be as good as the original but it surprised me alot mia farrow was just as creepy as damians nanny
Jun 17 2010,neutral,i liked the original better
Jun 17 2010,negative,never beat the original
Jun 12 2010,negative,why remake an already very well made movie all you can do is get worseand you did
Jun 10 2010,negative,robert thorn is a senior american diplomat whose wife katherine endures a difficult delivery where their newborn child has died thorn knows the news will devastate katherine who had suffered two previous miscarriages the hospital priest presents thorn with another child born that night whose mother died in childbirth the priest compels thorn to take the infant boy as his own katherine will never know the truth and their son which they name damien will be raised as their flesh and blood as the child turns five unsettling events begin to occur enter mrs baylock damiens new nanny who seems to have a preordained devotion to the child then tragedy strikes closer to home but only later does thorn comprehend the truth damien is no ordinary child he is the longprophesized antichrist now thorn must make the ultimate sacrifice to prevent the unspeakable terror that awaits the world     on the sixth of june 2006 it was said all hell would break loose and people on earth would be punished im afraid to say my friends that we was punished as the omen was released on the big screen the story was just incredibly boring and not entertaining in the slightest the characters were written very poorly and there wasnt really much point in having the characters in the movie as they were mostly either annoying stupid or just pointless the acting is very poor in the movie and could have been so much better the casting was just terrible and so wrong for the movie the writing was bad and the script was even worse all in all it has to be a serious contender for top 5 worst remakes    totally pointless and seriously idiotic the omen aims for nothing but cheap scares and it even fails miserably at doing that the characters were about as interesting as staring at a wall for eight hours the casting was pretty bad and the acting was unconvincing and poor it could have been much better in the right hands this could have been a decent remake but theyve totally screwed this up if it wasnt the writing it was the cast i thought that it was nonsensical garbage and pointless theres one positive i can think of and that was that i watched it on television for free so it didnt cost me a penny im quite happy about that because i would have been upset if i bought this on dvd if you like the new horror remakes or you like watching bad horror movies that make you laugh then this is for you however if you liked the original or you like original fresh horror movies avoid at all costs    110   this movie was made to punish us for an hour and a half im convinced of it its boring its been done before and a pointless remake watch it on television
Jun 3 2010,negative,how can you make an almost carbon copy that is worse than the original which i didnt like either
May 29 2010,positive,this is one awesome remake    story  same as the original roberts baby dies during birth and he adops a baby and him and his wife call it damien and robert finds out that its the devils son and they get a nanny who is damiens guardian just like the devil dog    i wont give you the full story because its the same as the original and i dont fell like posting the same thing twice    awesome remake through it is too close to the original so 90
May 28 2010,positive,for a remake it wasnt that bad
May 27 2010,negative,a remake that again fails on so many levels and again how does stiles still get acting jobs
May 26 2010,positive,why make a remake if the original one is already good but this wasnt that bad but if theyre making a remake it should have been better right ah well
May 23 2010,positive,as far as remakes go it wasnt bad  good cast and current graphics but the same old story
May 23 2010,neutral,quite a useless remake but i did like liev schreiber  he aint no gregory peck but the man can act
May 21 2010,positive,lets get a few facts straight on this oneis liev schreiber as good as gregory peck nois julia stiles as good as lee remick nois the omen remake as good as the originalagain noi sat down to this one thinking how bad it was going to bebut for once a remake thats actuall no to far behind the originalnot got the presence of the 1st but still got loads of scary moments and mia farrow is great as damiens evil protectorwell worth watching
May 17 2010,positive,my grandad showed me this film thanks
May 17 2010,positive,this remake horror film was alike the version between end of days and final destination 3 looked more terrifying and i havent seen the original one yet thats true  director john moore has thrown in a little more gore and a few subliminal shocks  and there are a range of succulent hammy turns from the likes of pete postlethwaite and mia farrow nodding to her starring role in the same eraâs rosemaryâs baby but for the most part has followed the original screenplay with uncanny slavishness    horror remake of richard donners 1976 the omen
May 16 2010,negative,didnt even come close to being as good as the original
May 13 2010,negative,awful awful awful the kid is too cute the story is all over the showthere are some promising sequences which could lead to something or some sort of exciting climax which disappoints again and again what was pete postlethwaite thinking
May 13 2010,negative,its nothing but an hollowboreinglameretarded yet mildly stylish attempt at remaking a classic and belive me it doesent get the job done
May 12 2010,positive,interesting and i didnt expected ending like that 
May 11 2010,positive,this is the second time ive seen it and i definitley enjoyed it more this time despite it still being a rather slow film at times i hear it stays very close to the original which i havent seen which is a good thing and i quite like the characters and storyline the death scenes really standout and they dont take ages to start either apart from a few slow scenes its a rather good thriller worth checking out especially if you were a fan of the original or feel like giving the remake a go
May 3 2010,neutral,this remake of the omen or the omen 666 as it is sometimes called since it was released on 662006 is not a bad film at all but it is an entirely unnecessary film  solid production and direction give the film its own distinctive style and its initial moments try to update and expand the story by including events such as september 11th as signs of the advent of the antichrist  while these opening moments are promising and the film looks great it ends up merely following the story almost verbatim for the remainder of its twohour running time  the film even includes basically the same dialogue  if this film wasnt a remake it would be awesome but because it is it is nothing but derivative trash that is not even brave enough to forge its own path
May 2 2010,positive,kinda scarygood storyline
May 2 2010,neutral,the little boy is disturbing
Apr 29 2010,negative,didnt need a remake as this very average flick proved
Apr 28 2010,positive,not to bad of a remake could have been a little better
Apr 19 2010,negative,this movie was released on 662006 thats all there is to know about it otherwise its a near identical remake with weak casting decisions and inferior directing
Apr 17 2010,neutral,nearly a three but it seems too long and the ending doesnt leave much effect it just makes you feel disappointed
Apr 14 2010,positive,not bad but still think the original is much better
Apr 14 2010,negative,interesting idea to bring it into the present day however as true as this is to the original you cant get away from wooden acting
Apr 13 2010,neutral,the only thing you need to know about this film is the reason why it was made and it was obviously made just to coincide with its release date 6606 theres no other reason    still not satisfied okay lets continue    this remake is absolutely pointless it barely changes anything about it so theres no point sure there are some little changes here and there and mia farrow is always a welcome addition but this remake was unnecessary    one thing they really screwed up was damien the original damien was good because he was just a regular kid he acted like a regular kid as long as you kept him away from churches the thought of killing just a regular little kid would be terrifying to a parent but in the remake damien is just weird hes a creepy little kid and you know that thats what they were going for too the director completely missed the point    also liev schreiber wasnt bad but hes no gregory peck    while the story is of course good mia farrow is good and it has a few scares here and there i can do without this remake
Apr 10 2010,negative,what a remake oh why did i even bother to watch this on the first place
Apr 8 2010,negative,i fell asleep  that in itself should tell you that it was shit
Mar 30 2010,positive,great movie if this is going to happen for real well sorry  remake just terrible
Mar 25 2010,negative,the original was better but this is more accessable
Mar 24 2010,negative,regurgitated non scary tosh
Mar 22 2010,negative,if youre basically just doing a sceneforscene remake of the original why bother  this a shameless attempt to cash in on a date not to do something unique with the material
Mar 21 2010,negative,this a is a sad imitation of the original why bother with this when the 1976 version is so good you can watch gregory pecklee remick and the excellent billie whitelaw the production quality was really bad if your going to pretend that the story is set in london make sure you dont show foreign shop fronts and bill boards if only this version had just gone straight to dvd 25
Mar 18 2010,neutral,david thewlis is one of the few things that makes this movie watchable
Mar 17 2010,neutral,the original is better
Mar 16 2010,positive,that kid is so terrifying  oh god what a movie  it freaked me out
Mar 10 2010,positive,one of the more pointless remakes that is a virtual shot for shot copy of the old one with worse acting liev schrieber makes a decent fist of it by the end but dont bother with this just watch the gregory peck one instead and you wont have to suffer julia stiles hammy acting  mia farrow is wearing well though
Feb 28 2010,positive,hehe the little kid looked like he could be a young version of my ex
Feb 24 2010,negative,we dont want your chuffing remakes hollywood get some new ideas you bumholes
Feb 23 2010,negative,ill give it a shitty rating because mr schreiber is one of my favorite actors
Feb 20 2010,negative,the original is better
Feb 19 2010,negative,dull and bland with one memorable moment involving a decapitation  i do like liev though  its just nowhere close to creepy
Feb 15 2010,negative,why watch the remake when the original was only fropm the 70s hardly old
Feb 12 2010,positive,first and only viewing  summer 2006 in theaters
Feb 11 2010,negative,this film is the biggest piece of shit i have ever seeni was so disappointed mainly because i was so excited when i heard they  were doing a remakei mean the original was so excellent i thought there was no way they could come up with a shit versionyou know kinda like sex even when its bad its good but guess whatwhere do i start  casting was totally wrongdamien looks like dennis the menace and not scary at allharvey stephens was much better in the originalthe guy who played robert thorn did not have the gravitas of gregory peck and the lady who played his wife seemed too youngthey should have cut out the dream sequences as they were crap and not scary at allthe biggest sin was leaving out the original haunting sound trackthe music created half the creepy atmosphere of the originalonly the special effects were better in this version off course being 30 years after the first moviethis movie was rubbishgo and see the original if you want genuine scares
Feb 9 2010,negative,just not very good at all
Feb 4 2010,negative,i had mixed feelings as i always do when i hear they are remaking a movie i love  part of you is excited that maybe better technology might somehow produce a better product  and part of you is skeptical just knowing deepdown they are going to ruin a movie you love  well this one had more the feel of the latter and my feeling was correct  this movie finalized a notion that i didnt like julia stiles now i hate julia stiles  but we cannot completely fault her in the making of this steamy pile of excrement oh no we must fault all of those who were involved  i mean this movie was just horrible unwatchable  if i would have went to the theater i would have been pissed
Feb 2 2010,positive,scared the crap outta me lol
Feb 1 2010,negative,this takes a cast that sort of resembles the original uses all the original script bullet points of drama and becomes almost a shot for shot redo but has none of the original tension the direction is weak by comparison and you just want to slap damien instead of being scared of him pointless
Feb 1 2010,negative,this a is a sad imitation of the original why bother with this when the 1976 version is so good when you can watch gregory pecklee remick and the excellent billie whitelaw the production quality was really bad if your going to pretend that the story is set in london make sure you dont show foreign shop fronts and bill boards should have gone straight to dvd
Jan 31 2010,positive,an accurately copied remake so accurate that the new version brings nothing extra to the table other than to loose some of the forboding you felt throughout the original to be brutal i was a bit bored
Jan 29 2010,positive,the cinematography was nice as was the storyish
Jan 26 2010,negative,sooo dissapointing not as good as the classic  the kid was kind of creepy looked to be more hevily medicated than anything  his long range stares and sinister grins i should have went into this with out the thoughts of the original version in my mind it may have had a different effect  
Jan 26 2010,negative,i have to say this is the best very disappointing remake of all time story plot and scenes is very similar with original film director john moore cant explored the evil terror with modern era atmosphere nothing different with 1976s film so i think this is just copy and paste with different casts not creative 
Jan 25 2010,positive,scary as you can get with all the ingredients to make a very good religious horror come to life on screen
Jan 18 2010,positive,i like the new one more then the first one and that does not happen very often lol
Jan 14 2010,positive,this was a decent remake i definitely enjoyed it but the original is the way to go
Jan 11 2010,neutral,ok film about the son of the devil
Jan 9 2010,negative,the omen 5 schrieber farrow and stiles squirm in this hollow replica of the original that carries all the plot but overstyled in modern horror movie madeness leaves little atmosphere 3010    the omen remake is one of the most boring films i have ever seen sticking so religiously to the original would have been a good idea in my eyes after the halloween and friday the 13th remakes turned out to nothing more than another sequel the omens unsubtlety is one of its biggest flaws the ridiculous dreamsequences or the fact that this time damien looks like hes been drugged up painted white and had his head wired down to be honest the schmaltzy entanglement of stiles and schriebers relationshit with damien is boring intolerable and ridiculous with a child looking that evil and disturbed the actions of the characters just seem more unrealistic than those of peck and co in the original while i would congratulate a team who obviously wanted to bring a new fresh omen to todays generation ii cant help the feeling that it was only made to coincide with the release date 060606 hmmm    rated 15 contains emo children from the start and strong schmaltz  final score30100
Jan 8 2010,negative,this is one of those movies they should have just left alone the original is great but this is truly horrible there are huge lengths of time when no one talks in the movie maybe 1520 mins at a time and nothing truly interesting ever really happens on screen i dont know what they were thinking with this but it is one of the worst movies ever which is really disappointing considering how good the original was
Jan 4 2010,negative,god i hate remakes of classic horror films
Jan 3 2010,negative,the little boy was adorable
Jan 2 2010,positive,loved the omen loved the special effects even if some of the scary parts made me lol the kid makes me feel freaked out and the way the parents handle it kind of creeps me out too demonic children in todays world never p
Jan 1 2010,positive,i kinda like this one good acting and pretty entertaining
Jan 1 2010,neutral,the original was better
Jan 1 2010,neutral,not as good as the original
Dec 30 2009,positive,plot was kinda of drawn out the end wasnt that good other than the eerie hint that there might be a sequel and the fact that it hinted at a bigger picture in the end with allusions to prophecies from revelation in the bible
Dec 29 2009,negative,this was absolute rubbish total waste of time vv
Dec 27 2009,negative,if this is the best a director can do with the antichrist he might as well commit suicide
Dec 27 2009,negative,this is a decent 21st century remake but does not have nearly the power that the first had  all the elements are there but not the spirit  it reminds mt of american psycho in that the script is all but duplicated but at the same time modernized
Dec 23 2009,positive,i looove it more than the old one i know it almost the same but the actors and special effects are better ahhh its great
Dec 23 2009,negative,i think this movie is similar to omen iv in that it is completely pointless and a lame excuse to continue a tired franchise a disappointment i was actually looking forward to watching
Dec 22 2009,negative,expected too much with this one cuz of the success of the original this wasnt much scary or anything
Dec 17 2009,negative,inferior remake why did they bother
Dec 16 2009,negative,no no no no no  leave classics alone stop remaking films and have an original idea you wankers
Dec 10 2009,positive,its all for youdameon creepy
Dec 9 2009,neutral,no where near as good as the first one go check out the omen with gregory peck and lee remick
Dec 7 2009,negative,not a bad remake but its pointless this one literally personifies the word remake because its the exact same as the original its easy to see that they saw an opportunity to cash in with the unique date of 060606 and they took it its uninspiring and lacks the spirit of the original bleh
Dec 2 2009,neutral,o  someone is not gonna sleep tonight  p  seamus daveyfitzpatrick did a great job here  thumbs up little kiddo
Dec 2 2009,negative,i was so excited when the preview for this sequel came outthe movie wasnt nearly as good as the originalthe gorilla scene was the highlight of the entire moviei was disappointed
Nov 25 2009,negative,this film is a proof that almost every british actor has been on harry potter this remake doesnt bring anything fresh to the plot and is just an technologically updated version however i liked the use of red and white and the overall gray and cold feeling and the original kid was so much creepier
Nov 24 2009,neutral,shows no respect or the acting skill of the origional but more people were scared of this movie because it came out 6606
Nov 21 2009,positive,entertainer strangely when i watched i got scared
Nov 20 2009,neutral,considering this was an attempt to remake the original omen they did a poor job although the effects were obviously better the entire plot was identical and yet it still didnt do justice to the original so the remake was completely unnecessary
Nov 18 2009,positive,i thought this was actually a really well done remake it looked beautiful and is just an improvement on the original liev schreiber and mia farrow were just amazing and everyone else was good too i think that at the core the idea is really disturbing in the fact that the villain is a seemingly harmless child how can you kill your son how can you be sure of anything when it is someone you have loved their entire life a great question that i think is basically answered in you can if its the antichrist
Nov 18 2009,neutral,again original was better
Nov 15 2009,positive,it was alright it was the most pointless remake ever though it was almost sceneforscene identical to the original just not as good
Nov 13 2009,positive,it was really cool though i expected it to be more scarierand i thought something really scary will happen at the end
Nov 8 2009,neutral,not as good as the orig
Nov 7 2009,neutral,creeped the hell out of me
Nov 7 2009,negative,awful remake why mess with perfection
Nov 1 2009,negative,boring not scary an insult to the original 13100
Nov 1 2009,positive,what an easy role for the kid somewhat deserted characters but nice facts from the priest and the fotographer expected more of this not bad
Oct 29 2009,neutral,sadly i havent seen the original movie but i am guessing its better than this remake
Oct 28 2009,positive,an enjoyable oldie but would it cut it today  i dont know
Oct 28 2009,negative,shot for shot remake pointless i could quote it during the movie my first viewing
Oct 26 2009,positive,this film surprised me my wife rented it from pay per view and we saw it together and it was a good time creepy images and suspense highlights this movie    i also liked the fact of how the film slows down and makes us understand the characters more then the viloence although the original is more scarier and creepier and this one was a little toned down    its a well acted and well made thriller     mp grade b
Oct 22 2009,negative,there are some creepy images but not the kind of amount necessary to make this remake as scary as you expect
Oct 19 2009,negative,original was okay this one not so much
Oct 15 2009,positive,the remake is more or less a shotforshot remake adds some scary effects and whatnot but overall just not as interesting as the original
Oct 15 2009,negative,the anti christ was voted out of office last year
Oct 3 2009,positive,bad remake it is ok but just not as good
Oct 2 2009,negative,just dont watch this version watch 1976 far better
Sep 30 2009,negative,belowaverage remake
Sep 29 2009,positive,not scary mostly boring and what the hell kinda ending i was hoping for some good satanic things this kid was just some little bastard who nobody loves not satans spawn but still i usually give movies 3 stars for at least keeping my attention
Sep 26 2009,positive,demon kids are the worst arent they
Sep 24 2009,neutral,from what i remember there were a few cool shots and intense scenes the original is better

Sep 9 2009,negative,i have yet to see the original but with the lack of scares that this movie has im not sure if i want to
Sep 7 2009,positive,it the dame as the old one  frame by frame but i like it if the same thing only fresher why hate it
Sep 4 2009,positive,a good remake but not great in fact neither this or the original are particularly creepy haunting or mystifing the kid is pretty evil but i can imagine worse
Aug 30 2009,positive,still creepybut good
Aug 30 2009,negative,not sure why this was made some effective scares
Aug 29 2009,positive,just imagine if scary
Aug 25 2009,negative,a very pointless remake but i did like liev schriber and julia stiles
Aug 23 2009,negative,why did they bother it was exactley like the originil
Aug 22 2009,positive,pretty creepy this coming out on 6606 eh i saw this version before i saw the original and much much prefer it to that one excellent remake and the boy is much more convincing than the one in the 76 film great effects with a fascinating story love how you can see whos going to die soon and how theyre going to die sad thing is i could see something like this happening in real life but i hope not
Aug 22 2009,positive,although the movie left some questions to be answered i thought that it was a solid remake the acting was pretty good and the storyline did not lack although at times it was a bit confusing and that kid really did look like a creep
Aug 21 2009,positive,awesome remake  a must see if u like the original
Aug 19 2009,negative,horrible film and terrible ending havent been so bored in a horror movie in awhile
Aug 19 2009,positive,not as good as the original
Aug 18 2009,positive,plot was kinda of drawn out the end wasnt that good other than the eerie hint that there might be a sequel and the fact that it hinted at a bigger picture in the end with allusions to prophecies from revelation in the bible
Aug 18 2009,negative,its not the origional and its not a remake that stands out from the crowd
Aug 15 2009,positive,this is my type of movieit is good i liked it
Aug 14 2009,negative,creepy movie in a not so cool way
Aug 14 2009,negative,i didnt like it at all it scared the crap outta me in a bad way they had to clean up the mess
Aug 13 2009,negative,seen this remake and it was real decent
Aug 11 2009,positive,i saw it on premiere night
Aug 11 2009,positive,the old version was better had more of a creepy atmosphere this one was alright
Aug 10 2009,negative,not as good as the original
Aug 7 2009,positive,probably my first horror
Aug 5 2009,neutral,a lackluster remake that does not deserve the same name as the original as much as i love and admire liev schreiber he turned the character into a different more modern and more sensitive individual than pecks interpretation this is not necessarily a good thing
Aug 3 2009,negative,a complete and utter waste of time  whats the point  the original was damn near perfect and this is pretty much a shotforshot reproduction of it  still not as much of a slap in the face as the psycho remake
Aug 2 2009,positive,i thought they did a great job with this  it feels fresh and the story still works only issue is with the miscasting of julia stiles who is a fine actress  just not for this role
Jul 31 2009,negative,why why why this movie existed purely so it could be released on 60606 wank
Jul 29 2009,neutral,i like the old versions
Jul 26 2009,negative,very frightening points it made me jump a lot but not that great
Jul 26 2009,positive,awesome film though still undecided whether the original was better or not
Jul 24 2009,neutral,not a terrible remake  it is pretty much shot for shot though
Jul 22 2009,negative,the new one was not good but the grown man sitting next to me who couldnt watch it and jumped out of his skin every ten seconds was definitely worth it
Jul 17 2009,positive,this film really made me stunned to get down of the 666 it was weird and i even had the feeling of someday as sooner the world gonna be get over and especially the small kid seamus daveyfitzpatrick he made me really hate him because he is handsome but his eyes and face are really threatening that he is the real omen in this worldthis film will surely threaten u but they voyaged a long time of saying the simple thing and yet the film is endless one as he continued his presence in this world still a normal and threatening film
Jul 16 2009,positive,thoughtprovoking  one would wonderwhos there governing us now
Jul 14 2009,positive,decent effort as far as horror remakes go liev is very good as is evil damien 666
Jul 13 2009,negative,there is no reason why this movie should exist this is completely pointless the original is quite legendary but they should have left it with that god damn this was a stupid idea im really not sure if there was anything good in this one fuck me
Jul 12 2009,negative,not bad never saw any of the other movies ending was too predictable also i found it hard to believe that julia stiles and liev schreiber could be married with a child isnt she like 15 years younger then him
Jul 11 2009,positive,this was pretty close to the original omen though i like the first one the best  after the first few omens it story got kind of old so it was nice to see a good remake
Jul 6 2009,positive,cant compare to the original
Jul 4 2009,positive,still scary as ever even by todays standreds
Jul 4 2009,neutral,the original was way better
Jul 1 2009,positive,one of the better remakes as of lately
Jun 30 2009,negative,im the kind who gets freaked out easily this wasnt scary at all
Jun 29 2009,positive,good but the original is the best tho it is pretty cool how the main character roberts friend dies i kno im a sick person p
Jun 23 2009,positive,cool but not as good as the original the dream scenes are pretty cool though
Jun 22 2009,positive,slick and flashy remake its alright but it doesnt take any chances
Jun 22 2009,positive,this was a great remake in fact it was practically the same so why remake it i just watched the original and realized that this was actually better because the acting was really bad and gregory peck was pretending to be jimmy stewart also schreiber and stiles seemed at the right age to be having their first child unless it is typical for rich people to hold off having children when the father is 60 and the mother is 40 all the same neither movie was really that great damien omen 2 was much better
Jun 21 2009,negative,not bad on its own this would be a good movie but as heir to the tremendous omen legacy it is simply not good enough you would do better watching the original three before this one sexy julia stiles is always a favorite and farrow schrieber and the creepy kid do well
Jun 21 2009,positive,a frosty remake with very serious acting but id say mia farrow is impressive here
Jun 20 2009,negative,im not a fan of julia stiles and i think she totally missed the vulnerability displayed by the wife in the original and i think she seemed more angrybitchy than what was necessary liev did a good job but i think he failed to emit the love for his wife portrayed by the husband in the original i guess thats why its a remake but  some things should remain the same
Jun 16 2009,negative,i really could not stand this remake if you want my opinion on horror remakes see my review of when a stranger calls which is a remake
Jun 14 2009,negative,nothing like remaking a scary movie and removing all the suspense from it relying on lame jumpscares that fall flat as theres no suspense leading to it
Jun 14 2009,positive,thanks god i didnt see the original movie if i did i will not consider it as a good one
Jun 14 2009,negative,nowhere as good as the original
Jun 13 2009,negative,dont remake something if you have nothing to add
Jun 10 2009,neutral,my once partner in crime has described this as a worthless pointless remake and to be honest he has a point an almost shot for shot remake that brings absolutely nothing to the table this move is ultimately unsatisfying and almost completely without merit its distracting enough although i fear my feelings for the movie may be tempered by my reverence for the original and so my opinion isnt exactly unbiased
Jun 10 2009,negative,suprising for a remake
Jun 10 2009,positive,this movie scared the life out of me when i was youngerbut im tough nowlol
Jun 6 2009,neutral,not too bad but the original was more like the book and they did change a few things
Jun 6 2009,positive,original was better and scarier
Jun 4 2009,positive,pretty good remakestill not as good as the origional
Jun 2 2009,negative,the omen is a very dull remake that has no one as great in it in terms of acting power i would go as far to even say its almost guilty of pulling a psycho 1998 in the fact that almost nothing in the film is unique to it and this makes you just want to see the original which i highly recommend over this
Jun 1 2009,negative,i will say kudos on the release date    that kid was hilarious too
May 31 2009,negative, i was more scary that the kid he doesnt do anything just look at u likes he was a bad boy  it suxs
May 30 2009,positive,never saw the original but this is good
May 28 2009,negative,eh original was killer just because of the cast this one is basically word for word the original
May 26 2009,positive,an excellent movie of good olden days
May 24 2009,neutral,i like the actors especially julia stiles im just wondering is this supposed to be a horror movie cause then it fails
May 24 2009,neutral,i had never seen any of the omen movies so i can say i really enjoyed this horror movie pretty much everything is based on suspense so theyre no gore or trashy part which i enjoyed if we forget about julia stiles who obviously is in need of acting lessons the whole cast was pretty good
May 23 2009,positive,interesting a lot of liev schreiber  and the music was quite good
May 23 2009,positive,love liev schreiber  pretty hot but this isnt a very good film pretty boring
May 23 2009,positive,i thought this remake was pretty damn good all things considering i loved the original so maybe theres no bad way to tell a great story such as this as quality always shines through mia farrow steals the show but updating it to reflect our times was a perfect touch rather than trying to reset it in the 1970s
May 22 2009,negative,too many plot holes great cast though the kid was creepy as hellz
May 21 2009,positive,add a review optional
May 20 2009,neutral,not really very scary
May 19 2009,positive,utterly scary beyond belief those pictures
May 17 2009,positive,the old one was much better but at least they didnt go all screwy with it
May 17 2009,negative,i dint quite except this movie to be specially good but i could never imagine that they actually succeeded in making this to one of the worst made movies ive seen from the 2000s the funny thing is that i got the inpression that this movie had some potential when i saw the first minutes when the odd men declare that something bad is going to happen cause the prophesy says so ah some independency from the moviemakers i tought but alas i was so wrong the acting is so poor its embarrasing and the directing is about in the same class mia farrow why did you do this to yourself youre much too good to except a role in this flop   it hurts to even mention the wonderful original in this review but its the same plot the american abassador exchanges his dead newborn son to a son of mother that had died while giving birth the kid turnes out to be satans child the problem is that they are trying to copy too much of the original which simply doesnt work in a remake you have to try to put in some new scenes like scorsese did with cape fear the kid rather look authistic in this movie then evil cause he always has the same face expression and do not responds when his parents talk with him but you cant blame the kid actor for that but the director the parents are fainfully bad and unconvincing actors they didnt even succeeded with a creepy athmosphere the only thing i like was some popup scary pictures which on the other hand is very easy to make one scared     img
May 16 2009,positive,the originals better 
May 13 2009,negative,doesnt even come close to the origional
May 11 2009,neutral,so initially when i first saw this movie i absolutely hated it but after revisiting it i just think its overly mediocre its pretty much a shot for remake its just less all around usually a redo takes the original and goes overboard with it but director john moore max payne takes a muted approach making most things have less impact most of the performances are good sexy liev schreiber scream and the always dependable julia stiles save the last dance are solid and mia farrow rosemarys baby is fun as the nanny the only one whose lackluster is damien himself hes just pouty and annoying most of the death pieces are just okay except the awesome priest kill the movie is completely unnecessary but its marginally entertaining just forgettable    budget 25m  domestic box office 55m  worldwide box office 120m    255
May 10 2009,neutral,although it tried to be faithful to the story of the original which not necessarily a good thing the remake sorely missed the gothic score of the original the original had very creepy moments even in repeat viewing could not be achieved in the remake the casting was much weaker the 2 leads i thought was miscasted liev schreiber was no gregory peck not that the original was a topnotch movie but the remake made that seemed so that said those who never saw the original will enjoy it as a mediocre thrill
May 9 2009,negative,no no no stop remaking the classic horror movies stop it write some new ones are we that out of ideas
May 5 2009,negative,no reason to remake it
May 5 2009,positive,this one gives me the creep and freak of satanism i just wish theres no such thing like this generally the film spawn sequels but this is good for those who wants scares
May 4 2009,negative,with the exception of styles the cast does a much better job than the film surrounding them deserves
May 4 2009,negative,you just dont remake the omen
May 3 2009,positive,i really liked it this is my sort of thing
May 1 2009,positive,this still scares da shit out of me i could not finish this film
Apr 27 2009,positive,remake of the 70s classic almost scene for scene the actors do a good job in there roles but were essentially treading the exact same ground as before with little new see it if you havent seen the original in a while or if your a die hard theological thriller fan otherwise not much reason to seek this out
Apr 26 2009,positive,its a pretty freaky movie good acting and scary parts
Apr 26 2009,positive,i think the original was better
Apr 24 2009,negative,could have been waay betterliev was goodjulia stiles did nothing in her role
Apr 21 2009,negative,when you already have a good movie why remake it hasnt anyone ever heard of if it aint broke dont fix it
Apr 19 2009,negative,nothing like the original
Apr 19 2009,negative,an absolute pointless and redundant remake
Apr 18 2009,positive,good movie and a bit creepy
Apr 18 2009,positive,the original is the best
Apr 18 2009,negative,i admit that the young actor playing damien is absolutely perfect he is creepy as hell but that is the only good thing about this film everything else is inferior to the original they modernised the story too much and filmed it in a way that made it very confusing i had no idea what was going on the first time i watched it then i watched the original and it all made sense i just feel like this film had so much potential but failed
Apr 17 2009,positive,creepy one of the classic horror movies of alltime
Apr 17 2009,positive,very creepy whatever you do do not name your son damien i recently had a student named damien and he was an unholy terrorat 5
Apr 15 2009,positive,a mere replica of the original nothing new replica
Apr 14 2009,neutral,not as good as the original
Apr 14 2009,positive,i dosn t watch 1 movie but this movie is good the last surprise is terrible
Apr 12 2009,positive,a pretty good remake and i saw it on 666
Apr 12 2009,positive,classic the cathedral scenes were filmed near where i live you know
Apr 11 2009,positive,another scary devil movie
Apr 10 2009,neutral,a classic horro ok remake 610
Apr 10 2009,positive,this movie was incredibly entertaining and not in the cheesy way i thought it would be  the casting was absolutely perfect the cinematography was beautiful and creepy and one of the best aspects by far was the musical score  the composer blew my mind it was recorded at abbey road with first rate muscians and singers  the music really communicated the seriousness behind the idea and prevented the film from becoming just another silly horror movie
Apr 6 2009,negative,if one movie truly needed an update it is the omen but unfortunately this one isnt it  nothing scary or even interesting about this one makes the gergory peck a true classic
Apr 6 2009,positive,scary dont like this 1
Apr 5 2009,positive,i quite enjoyed the rise of the apocalypse linked to modern politics  otherwise i was a bit disappointed with the simplicity of the storyline but enjoyed the movie
Apr 5 2009,positive,love the creepy song that always plays when damien is about to do somethingand the camera gets all close to his eyes lol
Apr 5 2009,negative,stop remaking classics
Apr 5 2009,positive,quite dull  im intrigued to see the original now  the little boy was scary  i turned off when liev and david went exploring in italy  i wasnt paying enough attention to why they went there in the first place ha

Apr 4 2009,positive,ugh this movie scared me fer  life
Apr 2 2009,negative,it sucks    big time 
Apr 1 2009,positive,another great classic
Apr 1 2009,positive,amazing film so creepy this kind of stuff scares the hell out of me and i love it  really good movie 
Mar 30 2009,negative,for the cast i really expected a lot more  plot was thin characters were silly and even the spook factor wasnt enough to make up for it yawn
Mar 28 2009,neutral,why is satan so bad he kills considerably less people in the scriptures than god does christianity doesnt make sense at its fundamentals and movies like this remain conservative in this way
Mar 27 2009,neutral,i dont like the remake as much
Mar 26 2009,positive,neither this one not the original are anything great but i enjoyed this one a little more
Mar 26 2009,positive,its very good most of it is scary and its an intrensting mystery
Mar 25 2009,positive,i like the old one better but it was still goodd
Mar 24 2009,negative,its all for you damien so ridiculous why remake this i was more scared when the choirs would be singing in the background the only good thing about this movie was liev schreibers hottness  pete postlethwaites acting as the priest he seriously needs to be in more movies this guy can act
Mar 24 2009,positive,creepy makes you wounder about lots of things that happened lately
Mar 24 2009,positive,i wont watch this film ever again unless im forced to lol it was soooo jumpy i thought all the characters were how i imagined when i read the book all over it was a fab film still scary though
Mar 24 2009,positive,watcheble gets bit boring in the middle but i like the end i bet there is 2nd part coming someday
Mar 24 2009,negative,saw this on 6606 lame ass movie that doesnt even come close to the original
Mar 23 2009,negative,once again the original was better
Mar 23 2009,positive,not bad for a remake
Mar 20 2009,positive,suspenseful yes interesting yes the acting was good but it felt very recycled i know its a remake but nothing new was brought to the table
Mar 19 2009,positive,this movie is a lol
Mar 19 2009,positive,ive never seen the original but this wasnt terrible and that is a pretty nice compliment to a horror flick
Mar 17 2009,neutral,not what i was expecting for

Mar 6 2009,negative,the original is soo much better
Mar 5 2009,negative,a faint copy of a brilliant original all they did was add bad acting and stupid modern symbolics like wtc 911 being a sign of armageddon watch the original skip this
Mar 2 2009,negative,an unecessary remake
Mar 1 2009,negative,i expected too muchso poor
Mar 1 2009,positive,i was told that this movie was the scariest movie that u could watch well they were wrong this movie was defenatly creepy and intense but not really a jump in your seat movie plus movies are always generally intense when u have a topic such as armageddon 666 or the end of the world
Mar 1 2009,negative,a few stylistic touches cant save this plodding film
Feb 28 2009,negative,painful and pointless shot for remake every scene in the film was just the same as the original nothing different
Feb 28 2009,positive,not that scary i havent seen the original so cant compare the movie was overdone and maybe just maybe the director did that to make us scared but well it didnt work
Feb 27 2009,positive,another of my 45 perfect movies proved in its time that the horror genre was more than that
Feb 25 2009,negative,why remake the classics
Feb 25 2009,negative,its not that this movie is bad though it is its just thoroughly amateurhour from start to finish its like it was written designed produced and directed by people two weeks into film school
Feb 24 2009,positive,love this movie anything demonic pretty much rocks
Feb 21 2009,positive,didnt see this remake  original one scared me tho
Feb 20 2009,negative,i will give it an extra star for one of the best kills i have ever seen on film ie the death of david thewlis character  essentially this is just anothe final destination movie though
Feb 19 2009,neutral,a fairly reverential treatment of the original  nothing much new here
Feb 18 2009,positive,the scene in the hospital gave me nightmares
Feb 16 2009,positive,extremely scary in a not so scary kind of way way deep sht here
Feb 16 2009,positive,no money to c it  mo
Feb 16 2009,positive,surprisingly better than dick donners
Feb 15 2009,positive,if you love real scary old demon movies watch you will like the omen
Feb 15 2009,positive,the best horror movie ever in the history of hollywood
Feb 14 2009,positive,a actual scary movie
Feb 13 2009,positive,freeeaky but the original is better
Feb 13 2009,positive,another omen movie not as good as the older versions but still pretty good with some outstanding scenes scene where priest gets the rod plunged through him is pretty intense and julia stiles is nothing short of beautiful this is a weeknight nothing else to do or watch movie 3 12 stars thats all i can give it
Feb 11 2009,positive,great cast but i hate the fact that it is a remake
Feb 9 2009,neutral,alight remake of the orignal got a bit bore halfway through it but than the photo bloke loses is head than the evil nanny gets it 380 over the car cool wonder what the next 1 will be like giving the end
Feb 5 2009,positive,great movie but not that scary
Feb 4 2009,negative,originally i was going to give this unnecessary remake 1 star but then i saw the omen iv  honestly this film isnt really that bad  the deaths are really cool especially the decapitation however the film is nearly shot for shot and just doesnt work  theres a good cast but it doesnt work  i think this primarily comes from the fact that the kid isnt demonic yet adorable like in the original  heres hes just just a friggin asshole with a sour look on his face the whole time  the score of the original is also wayyy better  the original is a 45 or even 5 star film  this one is just pale by sheer comparison and performance
Feb 4 2009,neutral,when the newborn child of an american diplomat dies the child they adopt turns out to be more than they expect    i am quite a big fan of the original omen and had really classed this under the movies that should never be remade banner but the result isnt as big a mess as i thought it would be  the acting is just as restrained as the original the direction is just as restrained as the original and the story is just as restrained as the original  in fact this remake of the omen is the original  the movie pretty much runs sceneforscene apart for a few updates for current world events as the original  the majority of the dialogue is pretty much wordforword  the climax is also exactly the same as the original  in fact the major death scenes are the only things to be reimagined  i would have scored this movie higher if i hadnt seen the original version of the omen but i just cant help comparing and contrasting
Feb 4 2009,positive,the omen series are in the list of my horror movie collection
Feb 2 2009,negative,just watch the original instead
Feb 1 2009,negative,for the most part impeccably shot though there were a few really cheesy shots mia farrow getting hit by a car the camera work was the only upside to the film however the script was boring the performances were rather uninspired liev schreiber bore the heck out of me and even when suspense was attained it ended before it had a chance to grab be also the creepy satan kid looked pretty dopey and benign
Jan 31 2009,positive,pointless remake of the 1976 film which isnt as good and particularly lacks the distinction of jerry goldmiths original classic score  however taken as a film in itself and as remakes go this is very professionally made and entertaining with liev schrieber julia stiles mia farrow david thewlis pete postlethwaite and michael gambon all very capably filling the roles created by gregory peck lee remick billie whitelaw david warner patrick troughton and leo mckern
Jan 31 2009,negative,old one is way better
Jan 31 2009,negative,absolute drivvel didnt like the original and this is just a mirrored updated version it waqs so bad i feel aslep and got told off for snoring so did some cleaning in the kitchen so it mustve been really bad
Jan 29 2009,positive,i can only laugh when i remember seeing this late at night with a bunch of hormonal teens
Jan 27 2009,neutral,not too bad of acting but the plot was meh
Jan 26 2009,negative,devil boy comes to earth kills all evil shall pass i am so tired i am going to bed p
Jan 25 2009,negative,demonic children are really a pain in the assand ultimately creepy to boot too bad the remake doesnt live up to the original
Jan 25 2009,neutral,average too similar to the original
Jan 24 2009,negative,ok movie not really worth updating  i really donât remember much about the original âomenâ but from what iâve heard the remakeâs pretty damn similar  it has that 70âs horror feel to it slow moving with a few graphic deaths mixed in with fairly lame stuff thatâs supposed to be scary  like when the monkeys at the zoo flip out when encountering damien thereâs no payoff even with a big gorilla about to break the glass on his cage  the score is actually pretty good i noticed half way through that it was the music that was actually creeping me out more than the actual movie
Jan 22 2009,positive,i was well impressed just as good as the old one
Jan 22 2009,neutral,still didnt see the originalthats coming soon  has onemaybe two really scary scenes and thats itthe kid did his job wellid be scared shitless of that kidschreiber did his job excellent as did stilesconsidering the latest horrors coming out of hollywood this one wasnt that bad but ill still have to see how it stands up to the original
Jan 21 2009,neutral,ok fell asleep so need to watch again
Jan 21 2009,negative,dull poorly acted run ofthe mill crap  the leads had little to work on and the gory scenes could of been better given todays technology and little damian was no where near as scary as before avoid
Jan 20 2009,negative,not the best movie ive seen but not the worse either the deaths were inventive and well shot but the rest of the film was subpar they should have taken their inventive deaths and written a store around them instead of doing a remake the movie might have been better
Jan 20 2009,negative,wasnt anywhere near how good i thought it would be yes its a modern remake so its expected to be terrible i havent seen the original so cant compare them but judging this one alone it wasnt very good   the acting and script work was very dry and not very convincing and it took ages for the film to pick up the pace a little in fact it didnt really get good until near the end just after the photographer got decapitated up until hes about to kill his son but apart from that its pointless drivel that tries to make you jump with things that arent even scary and fails completely to scare anyway  its alright and worth watching if you get the chance but i wouldnt recommend it personally to anyone  410
Jan 18 2009,positive,this movie makes me so pissed
Jan 18 2009,negative,watch the original
Jan 18 2009,positive,this is the most frightening movie i have ever seen okay im a wuss
Jan 18 2009,neutral,poor remake shocked
Jan 17 2009,positive,i actually kind of liked it
Jan 17 2009,negative,what was the point of this remake  stick with the original
Jan 16 2009,negative,not one of the better remakes
Jan 16 2009,negative,lametastic liev schrieber is like a damp washcloth and julia stles just makes that weird shitzupug face for the whole filmonly this time its scared pug facealso the kid isnt creepysounds stupid but hes just not
Jan 15 2009,neutral,a surprising amount of classy filmmaking in a movie obviously made just to reach a release date that said it still kinda sucks
Jan 14 2009,negative,bad movie nuff said
Jan 14 2009,positive,this was ok not as scary as the original
Jan 14 2009,negative,some films should never be insulted with a remake
Jan 13 2009,negative,a complete remake of the original but without gregory pecks topnotch performance
Jan 11 2009,negative,the original is better
Jan 11 2009,positive,not having seen the first one i cant compare them but this certainly had more tension and creepiness thatn i expected from a julia stiles remake
Jan 10 2009,positive,not a bad remake  just not the best  enjoyable though
Jan 9 2009,negative,why the fuck did they make this it is shot for shot the exact same movie retarded
Jan 9 2009,positive,a pretty good remake
Jan 7 2009,negative,the original was better
Jan 7 2009,positive,actually a decent remake overall
Jan 4 2009,positive,baboons at their scariest
Jan 2 2009,neutral,original is way better in my book
Jan 2 2009,neutral,not as good as the original
Dec 30 2008,negative,reasonable remake bit slow moving think that the original went at a better pace
Dec 29 2008,negative,this was bad not in the evil sense of bad but in the raping of both one of my favorite books and one of my favorite movies so  yeah i guess maybe evil bad but not devil evil bad fuck you john moore oh and the decapitation scene looked better in the 70s one
Dec 29 2008,negative,rotten  e 0mg sooo stupid yeah scary and bloody and what not but the plot the actual point of the movie terrible aweful ewwy ending and just blech if u like creepy demonic pointless movies woot for u but if not dont waste ur time
Dec 28 2008,positive,this is an awesome remake of the original i hope they remake pts 24 too
Dec 28 2008,positive,a pretty decent redux the hallucinatory flashes are jarring but not in a bad way
Dec 27 2008,negative,original is way scarier
Dec 26 2008,positive,a better film than the exorcist  although it is of a similar nature
Dec 25 2008,negative,wow ooooo what an ingenious marketing device to release this film on the number of the beast a generically bad movie the 1976 original film is way better this doesnt hold a candle to that film
Dec 24 2008,positive,its not easy witnessing the decapitation of your favorite actor but still it is a good movie
Dec 24 2008,positive,most dont but i much prefer this remake to both of the originals the child actor for the character damien is much better than the old one and this movie does a better job of captivating your interest and keeping it throughout
Dec 24 2008,positive,i am usually very antiremake i just refuse to watch them on principle but this one is really well done visually striking exciting i just wish i didnt recognize the actors believability is crucial in horror films and knowing the actors from other things ruins it for me
Dec 23 2008,negative,actually scared me at times  liked its sorta subtle hints about politicians  poor mrs thorn   i dunno about the kids smile it seemed to come out of left field whatever that means i know like almost nothing about sports
Dec 22 2008,positive,the demon child is really terrifying pretty good movie
Dec 21 2008,positive,well acted and great acting but its too depressing and boring to be the real deal
Dec 21 2008,positive,this is so close to the original it was hardly worth doing still good though
Dec 20 2008,negative,not anywhere near as good as the original  the child actor in the original was a better actor and looked more sinister  the child in the remake just had a comical scowl on his face the whole time which i guess was supposed to look scary but just made me laugh  julia stiles wasnt very good either  the whole thing was just a waste of time and youd be better off just watching the original as there is nothing different or better about this remake
Dec 19 2008,positive,basically a scene by scene remake of the original still fairly good though
Dec 17 2008,negative,why did they bother to remake this was there a point
Dec 17 2008,negative,every time i try watching it i fall asleep
Dec 17 2008,negative,didnt think it was at all good apart from the death scenes that guys head comes so cleanly off
Dec 17 2008,positive,okthats is just ok not the best acting in the world and damien just isnt creepy enough
Dec 17 2008,positive,when the vatican observatory priest sees the appearance of a comet the church is sure that it confirms the eve of the armageddon meanwhile the usa presidents godson robert thorn is informed in the maternity in rome by father spiletto that his wife katherine has just lost her baby and she had troubles with her uterus and would not have another pregnancy spiletto suggests robert that another just born child that lost his mother could be the substituted for his son and robert accepts the child and gives the name of damien robert is promoted to ambassador in london after a tragic accident when damiens nanny commits suicide in his birthday party a substitute mrs baylock comes to work and live with the family along the years katherine realizes that damien is evil while robert is contacted by father brennan who tells him that damien is the son of devil when the priest dies in a bizarre accident the photographer keith jennings shows evidences to robert that the boy is the antichrist they travel to the town of megiddo to learn how the boy can be stopped   this movie plays with the intellect it is frightening for what is not seen from the grey overcast that blurs the skies of london and the dead stillness of the great pereford mansion that houses the illfated thorn family to the deepest recesses of civilization in the hollow underground of an ancient excavation site the film effectively captures the viewers interest and draws them into a world that is on the verge of the ultimate disaster  the birth of the antichrist the story is slightly slower than the 1976 original but in the words of a famous director the expectation is scarier than the event when you have actors of the calibre of gregory peck and david warner it certainly helps peck is utterly convincing as the ambassador who doesnt want to believe the shocking facts staring him in the face and warner who often found himself in second rate bgrade rubbish obviously relished his role as the inquisitive reporter who helps convince peck that things are not as normal as they seem    the biggest disappointment was that the kid seamus daveyfitzpatrick hardly speaks at all and instead of that scaring us more it has the unintended effect of being irritated by his supreme lack of dialogue its also very fasithful to the original this of course makes it predictable if youve seen it as acting went there was some degree of weakness with mia farrow failing to live up to her role of nanny meaningfully julia stiles isnt a particularly strong actress which is a bit of a letdown the director blatantly spent more time hyping up the film than actually focusing on casting   a few scenes were visually delicious with a number of truly harrowing sequences but others failed to make the grade when it came to making the audience physically jump so it was an entertaining 2 hours nothing terribly new and not as creepy or gothic as the first one in a way i was hoping it might go in a different direction but perhaps its the producers ultimate compliment to the original  keep it very similar just updating it for a new generation of horror fans
Dec 16 2008,neutral,this movie was okayit could have been a lot betterthe kid did an excellent job being creepy as possiblebut i didnt like julia stiles in this movieit just was goofythe movie could have just used better castingand i know this is a remake but this movie was exactly the same moviedid they use the same script not as good as the original
Dec 16 2008,positive,not as good as the original but still a decent remake
Dec 16 2008,negative,stop remaking classics  plz
Dec 15 2008,negative,wowreal boring movie
Dec 15 2008,negative,these kind of remakes are simply pointless what a waste of time  money
Dec 15 2008,negative,what was the point of this remake lots of modish slomo the wooden liev schreiber michael gambon impersonating father jack hackett theres also the presumably ironic casting of squeaky mia farrow to contend with thewlis brings an interesting manic quality but stripped even of the infamous malveread more loent chantingthis is an utterly redundant movie
Dec 15 2008,negative,might as well be shot for shot watch the original instead
Dec 15 2008,neutral,slavish remake with poor acting by the two main leads  i couldnt wait for julia stiles to be wiped out but mia farrow was fun as the nanny and david thewlis was pretty good as the photographer too knowing where the story was going probably didnt help but then again the original film is still watchable no way would i watch this again
Dec 14 2008,positive,good remake of the original
Dec 14 2008,positive,the old version is soo much better
Dec 12 2008,positive,ummmm at least you got see julia stiles do a different character
Dec 12 2008,negative,loved the original more
Dec 12 2008,neutral,i wasnt too fond of the kid but i guess thats the idea
Dec 9 2008,positive,the omen franchise thriller violence
Dec 8 2008,positive,this kid was definitely creepy so he did his job i like to think i would have ended the story differently had i been the guy holding the knife
Dec 7 2008,positive,i guess its not meant to be a scary scary movie but nonetheless it has decent cinematography and acting
Dec 6 2008,neutral,no scarier than the originala bit boring
Dec 3 2008,negative,message to liev schreiber you are not gregory peck so stop enunciating like him
Dec 2 2008,positive,had 23 shockers other than that regular horror movie
Dec 2 2008,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie
Nov 30 2008,negative,doesnt add anything to the original movie boring avoid this and see the original instead
Nov 28 2008,positive,finally got to see this at a theater last time was on tv when i was about 12 older horror movies know how to build anticipation and are more restrained most current ones are just about shock value slow revelation that hes the son of satan is just really creepy
Nov 28 2008,positive,not scary but kind of creepy
Nov 27 2008,negative,what the f why why why make a remake of a classic when will people learn
Nov 27 2008,positive,way better than the crap remake it scared the livin jaysas outta me
Nov 24 2008,positive,it scared me more then the original
Nov 23 2008,positive,every shot is framed as if to say look out this kid is freakin evil but the stylistic flair of color acts as a saving grace in this film
Nov 23 2008,positive,not a bad remake not as creepy as the original but then the 1970s produced many creepy horrors for its time why though these days they arent as creepy i dont know my take on modern creepy films are that they are too uptodate playing it safe for the box office and not enough weirdness to pull it off carrie for example and its modern update eugh and the stepford wives the wicker man shedevil etc please leave these classics alone but i digress modern omen was not bad there are no plans to do the sequels many may rejoice i would have watched them though if they did
Nov 22 2008,positive,i thought the old omen was more creepierbut this remake was okay
Nov 22 2008,positive,this film was really good as well as the original and it had an amazing ending to it
Nov 21 2008,positive,the acting was good and the little boy 
Nov 21 2008,positive,i only liked it because good acting and has a good story line plus i love the actress julia stiles apart from that yer it was ok
Nov 20 2008,positive,it was alright i suppose i probably wouldnt watch it again ive never seen the original
Nov 20 2008,negative,the director is a huge kuberick fanand it shows in one scenei thought i was watching 2001 space odyssey skip this and watch the original
Nov 20 2008,positive,not bad and it stuck very close to the original entertaining but im still not creeped out by omen i watched this one in the dark and i just thought it a rolicking ride wasnt scared grossed out on occasion but the first one made me laugh i didnt really think either were particularly erie
Nov 19 2008,neutral,nowhere near as good as the original
Nov 19 2008,negative,these shitty remakes need to stop seriously and what were they thinking with the whole julia stiles thing it doesnt work get over it
Nov 19 2008,positive,im not a huge fan of all the horror remakes  this one stays pretty faithful to the classic scenes from the original while playing with new ideas in the margins  i still prefer the original
Nov 19 2008,neutral,pointless remake ahoy
Nov 19 2008,positive,a very good remake of the 1976 film however there are low key points    im pretty sure we all know the plot of the adopted child saemus daveyfitzpatrick of the thorn family julia stiles and liev schreiber being the son of satan and the forces of good aiming to stop him    the acting is great especially with mia farrow she does a great job as mrs baylock the effects are great with soem good death scenes that are similar but different to the original    however the film is an almost shotbyshot remake of the original as said before the deaths are almost different but thats all thats different    if you fancy seeing a modern version go ahead and see this film it is certainly one that s recommended however if you dont want to see the same film stick with the original
Nov 19 2008,neutral,no more than an update of the story which loses a lot of the atmosphere and intensity of the 70s film version  theres a lot of miscast actors in it too although mia farrow for nanny is an inspired choice
Nov 18 2008,negative,when will the remakes stop
Nov 18 2008,neutral,notentirelyscary remake of a notentirelyscaryinthefirstplace film however postlethwaite is excellent as usual as is michael gambon totally taking the piss the film is entertaining if pointless david thewlis isnt bad either but damiens mum is rubbish
Nov 18 2008,positive,liev schreiber is great so is julia styles havent seen the original so cant say which is best
Nov 18 2008,negative,totally unnecessary remake
Nov 18 2008,positive,that this is more or less a straight remake of the 1970s film in some ways makes it seem a bit pointless but it is actually very well done and this modern version doesnt have the dated look the old one now has and the film has to be set in the now to be fully effective everyone remembers that scene from the original with david warner and the plate of glass but this ones is even better
Nov 17 2008,negative,this movie was creep probably cuz i saw it on opening day 666
Nov 17 2008,negative,got bored towards the end and couldnt be bothered finishing the film the original i remember enjoying
Nov 17 2008,positive,nowadaysif hollywood arent remaking east asian filmstheyre remaking their ownor britishold classics and although there has been a few decent remakes this isnt really one of themprobably not the worst of the remake bunchthis has a few creepy moments and the kid that plays damien is still pretty creepy to but it all seems a bit pointless considering the original is so great then again a few of my favourites have already been remade and a few more are being done right now so no point in complaining anymore i supposean ok horror film overallbut as expectednot a patch on the original
Nov 17 2008,positive,if taken as a standalone film it isnt that bad the story is still brilliant  the only problem is that it pales in comparision to the original
Nov 16 2008,negative,waste of time nothing new to say what was the point  you cant beat gregory peck
Nov 16 2008,positive,considering it is a carbon copy of the original
Nov 16 2008,negative,i think the original was much more intense  the child in the remake didnt really look menacing  when he frowned he just looked like he was a normal kid throwing a tantrum lol mia farrow was probably the only scary bit in it  the red bit was already done before in sixth sense all in all they wasted money doing a remake as the originals were good enough
Nov 16 2008,positive,this and the amittyville horror are good remakes but i prefer the originals now why is it that hollywood cant seem to produce something orignal these days do we really need a 6th saw movie whatver happend to originality
Nov 15 2008,positive,the movie my name is from gets a remake
Nov 15 2008,negative,why all the remakes hollywood should remember the sayingif it aint broke dont try to fix it absolutely no need for this pointless rehash
Nov 14 2008,negative,i actually saw this one before i saw the original i gotta say the new kid rivals the old in creepiness i think they did an excellent job sticking to the original story and im quite partial to liev schreiber honestly though neither one excited me too much
Nov 12 2008,positive,few bits that made me jump a little but film was good  good cast and did a good job of remaking the original
Nov 12 2008,positive,creepy good vs evil moviedont remember the original omen movies but i hope they remake the sequels also
Nov 12 2008,negative,i laughed throughout
Nov 12 2008,positive,could have been better
Nov 11 2008,negative,beautiful art direction the end
Nov 11 2008,neutral,i thought the movie started out good but lost steam toward the middle and became rather unbelievable
Nov 11 2008,negative,the first time i saw this i liked it but just saw it again recently and thought it was kinda dumb
Nov 10 2008,positive,rarely is a remake as good as its original however in this case it was the acting was solid and the scares were as effective as they were all those years ago they chose the perfect damien in seamus daveyfitzpatrick mia farrow played the perfect mrs baylock too
Nov 10 2008,negative,one of the worst remakes ive ever seen although liev screiber is actually pretty good in the gregory peck role  looking sort of matronly julia stiles is disturbingly attractive but grossly miscast
Nov 10 2008,negative,it had a chance to be a par to subpar movie but its ending killed it  it tried to tie everything together in the last 5 minutes  i think this movie had so much more potential 
Nov 10 2008,neutral,this version of the omen is a decent film with no pizzazz a great cast gets put into a overlyminimalist remake of the classic horror flick by the same name this is the only movie where i have seen someone decapitated by what looks likes the frame for a sign post or part of a stairwell i must say this part of the movie seems very unlucky to me
Nov 9 2008,negative,the only reason im giving this a full star is because it made me go wtf a couple times overall 2 12 hours of my life i will never get back
Nov 9 2008,negative,the dogs got me nothing else shit
Nov 8 2008,negative,released 060606 its frights were efficient but i cant see how it can overshadow the original most of the people who saw both versions swear that this update is unnecessary i guess the producers were just banking on the release date to create more buzz
Nov 7 2008,negative,very very far from biblical  not to mention its not even slightly interestingsucky story
Nov 7 2008,negative,youd think schreiber thewlis and posthelwaite would be a sign of an excellent movie to come but sadly this unnecessary remake is a pathetic affront to the original  with the same writer the script has only changed in miniscule ways and rather than any reinterpretation or reimagining the cast makes poor attempts to copy the performances of their predecessors  sorry liev you are not gregory peck  you wouldve been fine being you but moore wouldnt let you would he what deviation from the original there is often takes the form of watering down previously chilling scenes most notably the zoo incident  maybe this film shouldve had the originals curse satan is a better filmmaker  add to all this an overuse of blue filters and an uninspired score that only seems worse when compared to the brilliance of the original and you have very dull experience that feels worse than reading cliffs notes  i blame this on john moore  after all it occurs to me that this is exactly what he did to flight of the phoenix  maybe he should go work with david twohy some more and see if some of the talent finally rubs off  see the original omen folks  ignore this entirely
Nov 7 2008,negative,this movie was not what i expected it to be the ending was stupid and the whole thing just made no sense
Nov 5 2008,negative,it was good as a scary movie overall but it was almost exactly like the originalso why make another one when youve already got a good movie
Nov 5 2008,positive,even though this was good i still perfer the original
Nov 4 2008,negative,its not scary than i thoughtdisappointing
Nov 4 2008,positive,i love the omen its so scary i love this little horror movie
Nov 3 2008,negative,not scary  julia stiles is sometimes pretty sometimes ugly
Nov 3 2008,negative,horrible horrible horrible horrible avoid at all costs and watch the original which is miles more original than this piece of crap
Nov 2 2008,positive,wow this movie was scary because of the way it was done
Nov 2 2008,neutral,i couldnt take it seriously enough to actually get scared but it did impart a more positive impression of julia stiles than the one i had previously
Nov 2 2008,positive,a true thriller without resorting to throwing a lot blood and guts all over the place this movie will keep you on the edge of you seat guessing what will happen next though the film starts out a bit slow most of the information shown in the beginning of the film is relevant and enhances the plot the acting is top notch by everyone except the main male character in my opinion this film is genuinely creepy and will actually make you think
Nov 2 2008,negative,it was an average horror film that really didnt scare you as it should  one scene got me in the jump factor but other than that this movie was a waste of time
Nov 2 2008,positive,not as scary as it could have been
Nov 2 2008,positive,this movie has one of the kreepiest soundtracks ive ever heard seriouslysatanic opera kreeeeeeepyyyyyyyy this movie is a classic too and it actually scares me
Nov 1 2008,positive,devil childreni know a few
Oct 31 2008,negative,i watched this for the second time cause it was on tv  i love to look at liev schreiber  julia stiles is annoying  mia farrow was a great evil nanny  spolier they killed prof lupin which pissed me off
Oct 29 2008,positive,not bad loved the cast
Oct 28 2008,negative,this movie was so slow  almost to the point of boredom and then the music would get louder and something horrific would happen but that didnt help the movie at all i havent seen the original so i cant compare it but ive heard good things this movie did not hold up to its namesake and predecessor
Oct 27 2008,positive,cant beat this film or the idea
Oct 25 2008,positive,this movie was not as good as the original but it was alright
Oct 25 2008,positive,scared the crap out of me
Oct 25 2008,positive,still the best horror movie series
Oct 24 2008,positive,wonderful as far as horror remakes go
Oct 24 2008,negative,have seen my fair share of piss poor remakes and this piece of shit ranks right up there stiles is woefully miscast she is dire here and i hate to say that aout julia who is usually much better than this schreiber is no peck infact cotton weary has done nothing of interest since the scream trilogy but hes married to naomi watts lucky sob haha the movie sucks the kid sucks he is crap he doesnt even look menacing the original kid really could have been the son of the devil lol this wimp not so much i also hated the photographer if i was there i would want to hot this annoying assclown he hassa camera in everyones face all the time even when he has no purpose to be taking their picture one last thing before i wrap this badboy up when the priest meets his maker outside the church evil forces lock the church door so that he cant get in when schreiber bungles damien into the church to save mankind you would think that god and the forces of good would lock the door to prevent the forces of evil from entering and killing the good guy saving the evil little bastard and dooming us all but no i got the message loud and clear the devil and evil doers get shit done god issa pussy with no power and the good people always fail in the end seriously why would anyone even admit to being catholic after seeing this they portray the devil as being very much real and yet offer nothing to counter him and instead portray god assa myth stupid fucking movie
Oct 23 2008,positive,the old version is better
Oct 21 2008,positive,not as spooky as the original one but still pretty good to watch
Oct 20 2008,negative,i like the cast but i didnt like this movie
Oct 20 2008,positive,okay this movie was really creepy cause i remember seeing it on 666 and that alone was nerve racking john moore really had a visual eye with this movie and i felt it was one of the few horror remakes in the past five years that really did justice
Oct 17 2008,positive,creepy movie love creep movies
Oct 17 2008,positive,creepy very creepy i liked it alot and that little boy was a great actor and i was kind of disapointed with julia stiles but they all have their bad days really good and thought provoking though
Oct 17 2008,negative,very average remake of the 70s version which i remember from my youth added nothing to the story and pretty much is the same film
Oct 17 2008,positive,i had never seen the original version of this movie but this one blew me away i was very impressed with all the acting as well as the mood the movie set this movie is pretty creepy but not in the same sense as the kind of movies where there is a killer on the loose or a haunting in a house
Oct 14 2008,positive,not as good as the original but was worth seeing the new kid wasnt nearly as creepy and i think the director overkilled the red symbolism throughout the movie
Oct 14 2008,positive,fairly welldone remake  the air bubble scene was new and the new kid playing damien was right for the role
Oct 13 2008,negative,more of a cheesy horror flick than anything else  definitely does not give off the same feel or personality as the original
Oct 13 2008,positive,yet another case of a pointless remake it is not that this is a bad film more that it offers nothing new and it still inferior to the original so why bother
Oct 13 2008,neutral,has its moments but not much its a remake of a film that wasnt all that great in the first place  about all you need to know really
Oct 12 2008,neutral,not as powerful as the exorcism of emily rose but creepy lacked direction
Oct 12 2008,negative,what was so good about the original was that the little damien was naturally creepy  here he is made to look creepy  the only real usp of this was the release date
Oct 12 2008,positive,nice one got some really scary moments
Oct 11 2008,positive,not quite as good as the original but a giant step up from some of the remakes that we have been seeing lately
Oct 10 2008,positive,i thought this was better than the original
Oct 10 2008,positive,why why present a remake so faithful it almost shot for shot and word for word even terrible dialogue such as shes pregnant   im afraid not remains coming from a doctor in todays day and age that is pretty disgraceful why not just stick your tongue out and go na na nee na na the updates include an internet link replacing a newspaper and the tricycle now becoming a scooter where before damian was creepy and evil hidden behind young innocence here the film tries so hard to slap you across the face with him being the son of the devil he is pale really pale has cold dead eyes and a haircut from the 70s version on the plus side the acting is brilliant and at times improves on the original schreiber especially is a realistic father and ambassador who plays his emotions close to his chest stiles thewlis farrow are all great so its a shame they are not given some new and interesting material to tackle the film also looks good brimming with a grim and bleak atmosphere and aesthetic that supports the story with all its might it will be a pointless watch for those that have seen the original but should be above other horror for new comers
Oct 10 2008,positive,not as good as the origina lof course but yeah i guess u can watch it once and then sigh
Oct 8 2008,neutral,the original was far superior
Oct 7 2008,positive,this is a good remake of the original omen movie theres a lot more gore and violence but its tasteful if you hate old movies but still want to see the omen this is the way to watch it
Oct 6 2008,negative,gregory peck was just so awful in the original that we needed a remake shut up
Oct 4 2008,negative,even though it mirrored the original it was not as good  something seemed to be missing
Oct 4 2008,positive,the omen 2006 fox dvd video
Oct 1 2008,negative,absolute waste of time why did they even bother what could have possessed pete postlethpriest the original is dated and ive never been a huge fan of that but this effort is even worse the child actor playing damien is atrocious the scene with damien having a fit in the car on the way to church and screaming  scratching at his mums face pulling her hair etc is laughable its not even the childs voice looks and sounds like its been edited onto it afterwards so corny avoid tis poo
Sep 30 2008,negative,for the love of god if the film is still good to todays standerds do not make a fucking remake and seriously dont get a kid where you want to kick his face in rather than be afraid of him every little detail that made the orignal so good they fuck up in this remake
Sep 29 2008,neutral,this film had its moments not many but some i have to say that the kids minion getting run over just caused me to burst out laughing does that tell you anything about this movie     the build up was decent but it just didnt feel smooth    the acting is pretty decent nothing too over the top for a horror flick    technically speaking some of the footage didnt match for example toward the end where the car window should have been shattered it wasnt things like that just kinda irritated and jarred me     from a story perspective it felt way too jumpy it just didnt flow well it felt too convoluted and sort of like the screenwriter didnt quite know what he was doing i think if the film would have been cut say by fifteen to twenty minutes it would have worked maybe it felt just a tad too long to me    the deleted scenes in this case i think were good calls as they really didnt add anything in this case less was more    so while it was better than say cloverfield its not really a scary movie to me weird perhaps but not scary
Sep 29 2008,positive,love the new and the old
Sep 29 2008,neutral,a it completely spoiled the divine name off the 1976s legitimate the omen
Sep 27 2008,positive,an good remake of a not excellent movie
Sep 27 2008,positive,i wish it wouldnt have been exactly like the original though the keyword is remake
Sep 27 2008,negative,i watched the original and this back to backso i could compare the two  when i saw the cast i thought maybe this could be a good remake of a classicbut i was wrong  although much of it was identicaleven word for word at timesto the 76 masterpieceit just appeared as a whole heap of scenescopied badly and lumped together  the acting was surprisingly crappy and the damien character was nowhere near as creepy as the first devil childin factin comparisonit just couldnt hold a candle  maybe its unfair to judge this flick by comparison to its predecessorbut its a remakeit always will be compared  it gets 112stars simply because of the classic story and the fact that it didat least try to stay faithful to itbut that is all it had going for it
Sep 26 2008,positive,i actually really enjoyed this movie  its pretty much exactly like the original except for the manliness of gregory peck rip so i definitely prefer the original  still very good and interesting
Sep 25 2008,negative,remake is decent but i feel it was just wrong i mean gregory peck was in the original its an insult to him to do this
Sep 25 2008,negative,the original is much much better
Sep 24 2008,positive,lots and lots of people drill this film but i didnt find it so bad maybe thats because i have not seen the original in a long time the acting was ordinary but the film had a real intensity to it which i liked the use of colour was very effective too and the film managed to deliver a few scares
Sep 22 2008,neutral,i really didnt enjoy watching it i thought i would im not a big fan of horror movies but instead it gave me a bad feeling left in my stomach not because of the gore but the whole situation the devil in a childs body
Sep 22 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Sep 22 2008,neutral,was the same as the original
Sep 21 2008,negative,awful its nothing close to being scary

Sep 13 2008,neutral,exact copy of the old one
Sep 13 2008,positive,the old one was way better
Sep 12 2008,negative,not as good as original  omen mmoives which came out in the 1970s starring gregory peck and directed by richard donner this has to be the worst horror movie of the year 2006 and one of the worst remakes ever made and one of the worst i have seen
Sep 11 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Sep 11 2008,negative,liev schreiber can choke on a pastrami sandwich

Sep 7 2008,neutral,major parts of the movie are boring the main idea of the film is not developed
Sep 5 2008,negative,see the original skip this
Sep 5 2008,negative,no comparison to the original
Sep 2 2008,neutral,dont worry if your like me and have a phobia of demons this is by no means a satanicly evil film as a matter of fact it doesnt have very many scares apart from pop goes the weasel pocorn dropping moments eyem going to list one major complaint eye have over the movie the father of the evil child is played by that guy who starred along with denzle washington in the manchurian candidate is a very unlikeable protagonist he basicly ruined the film for me apart from that the film is fairly enjoyable and it deosnt try to be more than it really is just a good ole entertainer
Sep 1 2008,negative,horrible movie sometimes you think its gonna get scary but it never does

Aug 27 2008,positive,this is the only horror remake i actually thought was good and for once didnt piss over the original the surprise ws julia stiles actually acting as always liew schreiber did a good job in stepping into the shoes of gregory peck in fact the casting wss very good in this film
Aug 26 2008,negative,awful though i guess they had the good sense for once to remake a movie that sucked in the first placeonly they made it even worse
Aug 25 2008,negative,why did a casting director think that julia styles could be a better mother to the spawn of satan than lee remick
Aug 25 2008,positive,an almost exact remake of the 70s classic but somehow is just isnt as good
Aug 24 2008,positive,i used to like it when i was younger
Aug 23 2008,negative,the original is much better i thought i would see something different but some parts are identical  dissapointed
Aug 23 2008,positive,even scarier than the original it creeped me out a little too much
Aug 22 2008,positive,this movie would of been a whole lot better without julia stiles i did love mia farrows character though
Aug 21 2008,negative,this was a waste of 650 i even went to see it on 060606
Aug 21 2008,negative,god if you want to see a good horror movie watch the original wich is a classic for a reason dont botter with this one the acting is terribly dull and the whole scare tactick is based on cheap tricks that olny work when your at the movies with a giant screen in front of youplease give the audience a little credit
Aug 21 2008,negative,why pointless remake avoid this like the plagueand watch the original
Aug 20 2008,negative,as i general rule i am not really a fan of remakes especially those of the horror genre i consider myself an avid horror movie fan i would rate this movie right up there with the remakes of the amityville horror and the texas chainsaw massacre they all seemed to pale in comparison to their 1970s counterparts  this film tried very hard to be a doppelganger to richard donnors 1976 classic they changed almost nothing from the original script and the acting was appalling even mia farrows role as mrs baylock didnt give this film any saving grace for me if i am going to watch her in a horror film it will be rosemarys baby  this film proved one constant to hold true  you should not mess with a classic
Aug 20 2008,negative,just see the original
Aug 20 2008,positive,the old version better

Aug 16 2008,positive,i watched this late at night with the lights off and headphones on and i still managed to release a little wee at certain points dont get me wrong this version isnt as creepy as the original however it is jumpy and i didnt mind it as much as i thought i would  john moores use of colours stands out in every scene as a dont look now red vibe is constant throughout not brilliant by a long shot but not too bad
Aug 16 2008,negative,give me the gregory peck version didnt like this one nearly as much
Aug 15 2008,negative,lets make an exact duplicat of an older movie  give me some dame special effects or something
Aug 15 2008,negative,the only difference between this one and the first one is that the first one was a masterpiece and this one is a useless piece of crap
Aug 15 2008,positive,not bad the story and execution is well done to me it was quite enjoyable to see damiens destiny unfold the acting is not bad a few of the elements are just stupid however even though the demonic forces are the movies explanation some of the deaths are just plain ridiculous there are not many scary parts but the movie over all is chilling itll satisfy anyone looking for a thrill and its worth a rent
Aug 15 2008,negative,again why remake a classic
Aug 14 2008,negative,pointless as it is identical to originali kind of expected this would be about omens teenage years than i would def wanna see the third one too and so on  
Aug 13 2008,negative,the original was better
Aug 12 2008,negative,crappy noscares remake ill give it an extra star because the kid is super creepy
Aug 12 2008,positive,amc were having an omen trilogy night for halloween so i decided to watch this remake of the classic horror original and you know what it really wasnt that bad it helped that they stuck faithfully to david seltzers original screenplay and although liev schreiber is no gregory peck the supporting cast david thewlis pete postlethwaite were pretty good and all the technical aspects were up to snuff i enjoyed it ok the remake was probably unneccesary in the first place but if its existance inspired a few people to go back and check out the originals it was worth it
Aug 12 2008,negative,this movie came at the very end of the really crappy scare movie phase but it was still crappy
Aug 11 2008,positive,good filmthe sequals stink
Aug 11 2008,positive,another classic thriller

Aug 8 2008,positive,better than the original
Aug 8 2008,positive,as someone who is fairly and legitimately scared of the catholic occult this movie proved just thought provoking and scary enough to prove enjoyable for me however i dont think this is everyone especially its target audiences cup of tea great performances for schreiber and stiles
Aug 7 2008,positive,a decent idea for a remake even though the original was disturbing enough in a way that we dont see anymore today
Aug 6 2008,negative,the first time i saw a horror flick and didnt get a heart attackwhich is good for me 
Aug 6 2008,positive,i have never seen the original but a friend tells me this is pretty much word for word the same i quite liked this though mainly for its casting of thewlis and schreiber
Aug 6 2008,negative,if im in the mood to make out with my date during a movie about the anti christ then somebody did not do their job right
Aug 6 2008,negative,q what if they remade the omen but shot it like the worlds worst aerosmith video and featured performances so wooden they look like a bad high school play  a it would suck
Aug 5 2008,positive,good remake that injects some fresh scares into the wellrespected original
Aug 5 2008,negative,and what exactly was wrong with the original series  nothing
Aug 5 2008,positive,fab film hope theres a squel like the old omen films

Jul 25 2008,positive,decent reinterpretation of the original
Jul 25 2008,negative,not an impressing film the plotline was confusing and the deaths were unrealistic and gory however the good points of this film were watching the deaths backwards in slow motion not reconmended

Jul 6 2008,neutral,eh not sure what to say really i vaguely remember the original one so i cannot really compare this with it    when did julia stiles face get so fat wasnt she just a teenager a short time ago and now shes playing mother to the son of the devil weird    what i found silly was that here is a diplomat who sudden forgets about his job for a week so he can go and figure out who his kid is id think that his phone would be ringing off the hook asking where the hell he was    oh and mia did a fine job
Jul 6 2008,negative,an utterly pointless remake which is so unimaginative that it is almost a scene for scene copy of the original but dull and seemingly made as though it is expected that the viewer will have seen the original which comes across as terribly lazy pete postlethwaite david thewlis and michael gambon are okay in the key roles played by patrick troughton david warner and leo mckern and mia farrow is the horrible mrs baylock
Jul 6 2008,positive,its cool but the original is really much better and terrifying
Jul 5 2008,positive,i saw this on 6606
Jul 5 2008,negative,this film shows the problems with trying to remake a film julia stiles is the only part of this film that is any good not scary  the original has way impact on creeping you out and making you jump
Jul 4 2008,positive,one of my favorite horror movies 2
Jul 4 2008,positive,i liked the first version better because it wasnt sooo modern
Jul 4 2008,negative,just another reason why all hollywood remakes should be stopped at once the original is and will always be a classic of the genre the acting was solid the story was tight and the music remains the most frightening horror score on film why bother renewing something that was already great to begin with everything that was so cool in 1976 royally sucks in 2006 with a remake that just made me want to watch the classic original all over again the murders are the same only with added cgi to make them more realistic and the dialogue is pretty much how you remember it however nothing works mia farrow as the devilish nanny is wasted pete postelwaite and david thewlis are all at sea in underwritten roles one longs for the original cast and that music without it its like jaws without the shark or psycho minus a shower scene while i watched it i was constantly reminded of the original but only in the case of wanting to watch that iinstead of this drivel  this is surely not what the filmmakers intended lacking any kind of tension or even scares the filmmakers instead resort to jump shocks and loud screams on the soundtrack  a typical cliche of modern day horror films  but even these i could see a mile off also in the original you never really knew for sure whether damien was in fact the son of the devil the screenplay never made it entirely clear that the brat was a rotten egg until right till the very end with innocent people dying in mysterious circumstances one never got the impression that satan was causing it all the deaths were always grounded in reality and nothing supernatural or even hellish was hinted at in short damien couldve been innocent and everybody else was overreacting not so the remake ominous read that as unintentionally hilarious nightmare sequences loud wailings on the soundtrack church doors closing from the inside are just some of the hints that the devil is very much at play here also whereas in the original damien said nothing and appeared innocent and even angelic this little brat looks evil right from the minute we first see him this robs the film of what tension remains after one gets over the fact that because its a remake we already know the outcome in short what is the bloody point at least give us something new and stop spelling stuff out for us stop treating us like idiots and let us do some thinking for once but the worst insult against its audience is this annoying bloody downright obvious preponderance on the colour red yes the film is about the devils son and yes red is universally attributed to ol saint nick but did the filmmakers really have to ram it down our throats yes we get it  red means bad things will happen enough already almost every scene has an ominous portent of red a red umbrella a red balloon some passerby dressed in a red raincoat the godfather did the same thing with fruit to telegraph danger for the characters but the godfather is a modern classic whereas the omen 2006 is a misbegotten attempt at capturing the old proverbial lightning a second time only this time theres no bottle in sight with wooden acting lousy timing leaden pacing no real differences to the original and an almost lethargic atmosphere i for one was firmly on the devils side this time out hollywood executives should really start taking a look at themselves  or at least scour the bookshops for original material because if this is the best they can do god help us my advice steer clear and rewatch the classic from 1976 true its over thirty years old and is very much a film of its time but it still rocks and its still creepy as hell this one just sucks
Jul 4 2008,negative,asian tend to use little girls in their horror film because girls are naturally more mysterious then men making girls scarier and i agree with them shutter the grudge 2 to name a couple these movies still keep me up at night this movie was just as disappointing as hearing that my favorite news anchor from tampa florida died well i think he committed suicide or am i mistaken needless to say the old nanny was creepier than satans own son whats wrong with this picture the student has surpassed the master

Jul 3 2008,negative,fantastic brilliant very well done whoever was responsible for the cinematography and production design deserves credit apart from that the film was awful  damien is no way scary the priest who who is on the isolated church in italy looks more like lord voldermort then a guy who was burned and the scary moments were not scary    the original shows what good film making is for this film nearly uses the exact script word for word

Jun 30 2008,neutral,very well made and superbly editedbut lacking in any kind of surpriseand ultimatley pointless with neither the originals desperate tone nor its scare factorall actors involved struggled valiantly to make this workand while the recent world events give this remake a timely feelit is just too bland and focused on gore to have any real impact whatsoevershame

Jun 23 2008,neutral,i liked the dog in the original better
Jun 22 2008,positive,js rocked in this
Jun 22 2008,positive,a skillfully made shotforshot remake of the 1976 horror classic starring gregory peck its faithful to the original but i think its a little better it has the same scary moments but the way the people are killed off are very well done i knew when all the shocks were coming but i still jumped as they appeared on screen it is welldirected wellacted and contains some good quality kills worth a look even if you have already seen the original

Jun 18 2008,neutral,eh it was alright
Jun 18 2008,negative,this movie was a crazy mess
Jun 18 2008,negative,despite every death in the film being excellent i suppose i was just glad to see them all go this remake was heinous my main beef with it was the acting julia styles and liev schreiber along with having no chemistry whatsoever managed to give hideous performances watching the boyantichrist was also excruciating it was as if the only casting criteria they had for the role was annoying with black hair the one saving grace apart from the said death scenes was the almost dolllike mia farrow  she was perfect as the nanny
Jun 17 2008,positive,honestly the best rendition of an old story it gave me nightmares
Jun 17 2008,positive,not a bad movie in and of itself but its not different enough from the original to count as anything more than a polish job

Jun 17 2008,negative,as always not as good as the original
Jun 16 2008,positive,it was more funny than scary haha
Jun 16 2008,positive,surprisingly effective remake of the classic 70s horror film that while its not as good as the original is still better than alot of horror films we see todayimpressively directed by irish director john moorethe film is very faithful to the original but still makes some minor deviationsmost notably in the portrayal of the charcter mrs baylockplayed eerily sunny by mia farrowliev schreiber is very good in the role gregory peck played in the original and although she might initially seem too young for her role julia stiles is good too while david thewlispete postlethwaite and young seamus davey fitzpatrickas damien are all flawless as wellthe film is also very well shot and genuinely gripping and if its a goodquality horror film youre after then this one is well worth checking out
Jun 15 2008,negative,blah  a terrible movie that makes me not want to watch its source material
Jun 15 2008,positive,it was going good and then it just ended so crappy that it just killed it for me i think so much could have been done but since its based of a previous movies ill write it off as a limitation

Jun 13 2008,neutral,it was not nearly as scary as the origional however i saw the origional when i was like 6 so im probably scarred for life julia stiles makes we want to kill myself anytime i see her so her being in the cast really didnt help
Jun 12 2008,negative,cant even watch the whole movie does not compare to the original so much scarier
Jun 12 2008,positive,decent remake i like parts of this one more than the original
Jun 12 2008,negative,completely unnecessary remake
Jun 12 2008,negative,not a terrible movie but a pointless remake almost identical to the original except its not near as good which is why i give this movie 2 stars if you are a fan of the original it might be worth a viewing other than that please please please watch the original instead
Jun 11 2008,negative,horrible seriously just rent the original it is exactly the same except with poor acting poor suspense poor pacing and some added 911 news footage
Jun 11 2008,positive,not that scary not that good
Jun 11 2008,positive,a good remake of the old however this one relies alot on scare tactics and gore as opposed to mental terror
Jun 11 2008,negative,as much as i love liev schreiber hes not gregory peck and the less said about julia stiless wretched performance the better  its an almost framebyframe remake with none of the finesse or suspense or horror of the original  the only good thing is mia farrow
Jun 10 2008,positive,actually a damned good remake of the original
Jun 10 2008,negative,the original is better
Jun 10 2008,negative,hollywood stop trying to remake movies that dont need to be messed with

Jun 8 2008,positive,pretty decent remake of the original  julia stiles was a bit flat in her role and the photographers part was a bit odd for sure but overall i think it was worth watching if your tastes lean towards the demonic flavor

Jun 7 2008,positive,a movie that constantly keeps setting you up to scare you but just doesnt the original was so much better
Jun 7 2008,neutral,this movie came too late in the horror game as an effective remake not to be down down on this because the acting and directing was fine its just there were not scares or real tension or suspense thats not a good thing when its a horror film
Jun 7 2008,neutral,didnt really scare me soo much the ring was better
Jun 6 2008,neutral,big moose  scary moose

Jun 5 2008,negative,a terrible terrible movie i am a baby with horror movies and they all scare me but this one really freaked me out and i had to turn it off i hate any movies where things happen to with or through children
Jun 5 2008,negative,the only reason this movie has one whole star is to show that its better than the ring 2  but this movie is junk  the first five minutes do a good job of setting the mood but then its all down hill  all the suspense is telegraphedyou can see what is going to happen minutes before it ever does  i may have given this film a whole two stars if it wasnt a remake of another film but theres something particulary foul about sleepwalking your way through a remake  just dont waste your time
Jun 5 2008,negative,stupid and predictable as every horror film seems to be
Jun 4 2008,positive,really good remakei still like the orginal though
Jun 4 2008,positive,my parents should have named me damien
Jun 4 2008,negative,the son of the devil will rise from the world of politics    considering the paranoid religious gibberish pertaining to the release of richard donners 1976 horror flick the omen its scarcely surprising that a remake was commissioned to tie in with the rare date of 6606 in the current cinematic age remakes of horror movies are a fickle beast endlessly being rolled out for money only rarely have i witnessed a horror remake that produced decent results i have yet to see a brilliant remake such as zack snyders reinvention of dawn of the dead other remakes such as the texas chainsaw massacre have become some of the worst segments of modern cinema put very simply hollywood has become too lazy to create original ideas so theyre recycling and reusing ideas for an easy profit the creative team for the omen were so lazy that the person who penned the screenplay for the original david seltzer was hired to polish his own script for the remake     this remake is absolutely futile in essence this remake adds nothing but occasionally impressive gory cgi effects tasteless references to modern disasters as a way of displaying the fulfilment of some religious mumbo jumbo that supposedly describes the signs of an impending armageddon and a more refined visual style aside from that its essentially a wordforword almost shotforshot remake of richard donners 1976 original with no additional scares the filmmakers could have expanded the original filmthey could have executed an entirely different treatment of the book of revelationsinstead this is a purely futile duplicate of the original sure some may think that if this is identical to the original than the scares must be the sameright wrong the death scenes are more predictable marco beltramis score cannot set the creepy atmosphere of jerry goldsmiths music and the cast are mainly woeful     the plot is of course identical to that of richard donners 1976 original except the opening is a little different the opening of this film depicts activity at the vatican as the sighting of a comet confirms the world is on the eve of armageddon cut to political figure robert thorn schreiber whos racing to the hospital to be with his wife katherine stiles who has gone into labour complications during childbirth leave the child stillborn and katherine unconscious with permanent damage to her womb resulting in an inability to bear another child father spiletto radice a priest working at the hospital offers robert a replacement for his loss a young child born on the same night whose mother passed away during labour believing it is best for his wifes sake robert agrees to take the child raising it as his own with katherines oblivious to the situation roughly 5 years later young damien daveyfitzpatrick is developing smoothly but a series of peculiar deaths result in suspicions that the child is in fact the antichrist  the son of the devil robert thorn then works with photographer keith jennings thewlis to discover more about the heritage of damien     the characters are portrayed poorly by a disappointing cast liev schreiber cannot replace someone of gregory pecks stature its impossible to comprehend the praise that schreiber received hes a dreadful actor emotionless expressions monotone voice no intensity in line deliveries julia stiles should never have become an actress every time stiles hauls her oversized cranium into shot the movie grinds to a screeching halt as the theme of the film flips from proficient thriller to daytime soapopera territory mia farrow supplies the film with the only terrifying moments a faint praise as damiens demonic nanny farrow flexed her only decent acting muscle in roman polanskis rosemarys babyroughly 40 years ago her time arrived and passed long ago seamus daveyfitzpatrick is not sinister or frighteninghes an innocent little boy who cannot act in the original the young boys facial expressions sent chills down your spine daveyfitzpatrick sends tickles down your spine david thewlis was nominated for a razzie award for worst actor im shocked at this because thewlis is one of the only good actors in an otherwise dreadful cast julia stiles and liev schreiber should have received the nominations pete postlethwaite is frequently sincere in the role as a priest trying to warn schreibers robert thorn of the danger unfortunately even he cannot cover up the flaws in the rest of the cast     overall the omen is yet another addition to the disparagingly extensive list of horror remakes that should never have been authorised perhaps as a standalone film itd be a decent horror outing for the genre buffs for those whove never seen richard donners 1976 original maybe some satisfaction will be uncovered john moore is a competent director who brings an intriguing visual style to the production however this remake is pointless and there was never an apposite warrant for a remake apart from the obvious marketing purposes at the end of the day you end up wondering what the point was cinematic déjà vu is the most probable reaction

May 26 2008,positive,let me start off by saying that the omen  the original version  is my alltime top horrorsuspense movie with that said id like to say that the remake is all in all not that bad in fact this movie is practicly a shotfor shot remake which in general is not for me however this film manages to update the original omen film in a way that sometimes makes more sense than the original case in point when mrs baylock goes to catherines hospital room in the original omen catherine is thrown out of the hospital window and mrs baylock just strolls calmly down the hall i mean nobody tries to stop her cmon in the remake catherine is killed much more quietly and in a way that would allow mrs baylock to just stroll out of the hospital unnoticed regardless i found myself in the theater on 6606 watching a movie id never seen before and quoting dialog quoting dialog wow this remake really is close to the original while the original version of the omen gets my 5star rating i could only bring myself to give this version of the omen a 4star rating i dont know why maybe it was julia stiles to say im not a fan would be putting it mildly

May 17 2008,negative,i fail to see a slightest point in this remake of the omen it offers nothing new compared to the original omen no novelty or any other value whatsoever i think this falls into the same doomed to fail category as the remake of psycho this flick just follows the original script closely and thats all there is to it perhaps thats the best thing about this flick though having tried to change the plot would have just ended in even a worse remake maybe there are some 2006 gadgets that has been using in making this film but if there are they do not stand out in any way and even if they did i could not care less i remember seeing grecory pecks omen at the age of 12 in a movie theatre despite the fact that it was forbidden from minors under the age of 18 i didnt sleep an eyeful the next night and i still get the shivers from watching it watching this movie i barely could stay awake

May 13 2008,positive,im obsessed with the antichrist
May 13 2008,negative,julia stiles is a terrible actress i dont know why they picked herbut still this movie sucked ass
May 13 2008,negative,5 star to the original
May 13 2008,positive,still the original better
May 12 2008,negative,this is why hollywood horror sucks today its either pointless remakesprequelssequels lame japanese remakes or torture porn
May 12 2008,negative,so stupid it had a few funny parts full of trinkets and magic spells talk about losing sight of how god works maybe if i wear garlic around my neck then i can ward off vampires
May 12 2008,positive,give me goose bumps interesting fact there were multiple deaths that occured during the making of this movie towards cast members and at ne point the kid randomly aacke the dictor injuring him for no real reason
May 12 2008,positive,the movie itself it passable but it looked fantastic my score is probably artificially inflated due to my liking how it was shot some creative death scenes too good for a laugh
May 11 2008,negative,wowanother shitty horror movie remake  does anyone else think that hollywood has nothing original to make anymore
May 11 2008,neutral,why remake the omen the original is a masterpiece as it is two reasons spring to mind the first being the widely spreading lack of originality since hollywood has lately concentrated on doing remakes of old classics hitcher the texas chainsaw massacre a trend that doesnt seem to be dying since remakes of friday the 13th the birds and a nightmare on elm street are in the works the second reason could be as superficial as the filmmakers realizing that the release date could be set on 060606 granted it isnt the disaster new psycho was but this new version doesnt offer much aside the few effective shocks mia farrows presence for example is complitely wasted
May 11 2008,negative,not as good as the first
May 10 2008,positive,i will never forget the scene where the dude gets decapitated by the plate glass
May 9 2008,positive,i was pretty scared after watching this movie
May 9 2008,negative,on its own merit it was typical of modern hollywood remakes  too much was sacrificed in favour of questionable effects and cheap startle cues  it was a good thing we had the theatre to ourselves otherwise people would have gotten annoyed at how frequently and loudly we heckled and berated this film  if i were to compare it to the original it wouldnt even rate
May 9 2008,positive,it was actually a good remake
May 9 2008,negative,go see the original with gregory peck
May 8 2008,positive,wonderful color choices red on white
May 8 2008,positive,prefere the original
May 8 2008,negative,doesnt compare to the original at all
May 7 2008,negative,nothing compared to the original
May 7 2008,negative,its the same script as the originaljust an extra scene or two and a few changed lines but its the same thing why this is cinematic laziness at its worst its like the psycho remake in many ways there is nothing here that the original didnt do better except for the impaling scene that was actually pretty good and if your going to stick this close to the original and not use jerry goldsmiths score then thats an automatic fail
May 6 2008,neutral,this movie is almost line for line to the original just a couple of extra tweaks  are they worth seeing the remake not really in the original and in this one story content out ways the action of the film its a freakier idea than it is a sight true story i bought this movie for three bucks
May 6 2008,positive,i havent seen the original yet but this was entertaining
May 6 2008,positive,i dont usually like scary movies but someone told me i had to watch it and it wasnt as bad as i thought i liked it which suprized me 
May 6 2008,negative,just see the original neither one is a good film but the originals much more entertaining julia stiles is horribly miscast
May 5 2008,positive,better than the original much scarier
May 5 2008,positive,it was quite impressive hard to beat the first really but i enjoyed it the kid wasnt really weird tho jst seemed stupid and aloof schreiber was pretty gud too
May 5 2008,neutral,it wasnt as terrifying as the legendary original but engaging nevertheless i thought the casting was a dampener and even though marco beltramis background score created a dark atmosphere it was nowhere close to jerry goldsmiths demonic score
May 5 2008,positive,not bad but the original is better the kid in this was stupid
May 4 2008,negative,the old one was waaaay better
May 3 2008,negative,see the original  mia farrow really wrecks this whole thing
May 3 2008,negative,boring ass devil kid
May 3 2008,negative,of course it had its shock moments but apart from that the film is really nothing special it just proves that some kids can be evil 
May 3 2008,positive,ooh creepy actually i thought this movie was cool and in the end i knew that he wasnt gonna be able to kill the boy hes such a damn loser he had plenty of opportunity but as soon as the boy cried no daddy please it was all over from there
May 3 2008,negative,justthe copy of damien omen 1976
May 2 2008,neutral,kid acts like someone took candy away from him not evil enough to be convincing
May 2 2008,positive,its a very very faithful remake we have here pretty much the same script and structuresome nice long takes and a nice welcome lack of intrusive music the original i feel suffered from intrusive musicsome of the death scenes though have been altered and arent nearly as good at the original onesbut some of the scenes are better than the original scenes
May 2 2008,positive,i love the classic version of this movie i also love this movie because it is essentially the same film while some of the shock scares are more than a little corny the set pieces in london and the monastery for example are beautiful and liev schreiber does an amazing job as mr thorn it is just a remake but it is a very slick one and im glad they chose not to deviate from the original film
May 2 2008,negative,absolute pap only successful because people believe in utter bollocks
May 1 2008,negative,the original was much better

Apr 28 2008,negative,terrible remake and on my birthday i guess it was the day of the devil
Apr 28 2008,positive,odd remake  liev schrieber was good but the kid just wasnt creepy enough to match the original
Apr 28 2008,positive,i dont think ive seen the original but then im not too interested in them still i watched this film and it wasnt too bad some good performances and some excellent stunts like the nanny jumping off the roof i still probably wont bother with the original though
Apr 27 2008,negative,creepy and not in a good way
Apr 27 2008,neutral,i kind of feel like this movie is pointless  though some good acting and plot points carried the movie a little bit the supposedcreepy ending was anticlimactic and the story for me never followed through
Apr 27 2008,positive,loved it  what an evil little kid reminded me of me   a classic horror flick a mustsee
Apr 27 2008,positive,the omen never gets old i miss the music though thats the best part
Apr 26 2008,negative,not as good as the original trilogy remakes always tend to flop
Apr 25 2008,negative,craptastic remake of what was a creepy and inventive movie  it was nice that they brought back mia farrow though
Apr 25 2008,positive,scene for scene remake minus the original score that made the 1st movie so damn good
Apr 25 2008,positive,just like the original  if youve seen the original its exactly the same
Apr 24 2008,positive,that little boy freaks me out
Apr 23 2008,positive,personally this movie surprised me  when i first saw the trailer i thought damn they are just gonna have another cheesy horror with a bunch of crappy special effects to try to make it scary  instead they actual spent time to make  a decent plot along with a cast that fit their roles which made for an all around decent movie
Apr 23 2008,positive,k i really dont like movies like this but i watched itnot all that i actually think the original was better
Apr 23 2008,positive,compared to most of these horror remakes this one is pretty good although im not a huge fan of the first one a talented cast and a capable director hold ot together not a big fan of schreiber in the lead but he wasnt bad better than most of its peers
Apr 23 2008,positive,great film but absolutely the same film as the original with a less scarier kid
Apr 23 2008,negative,i am extrememly disappointed with this the 2006 remake is total rubbish classics should never be remade
Apr 23 2008,positive,stylish and spooky but ultimately let down by some unforgivable acting a poor script and numerous unintentionally funny moments still its entertaining enough and the original was overrated anyway
Apr 23 2008,positive,the origional is better
Apr 23 2008,positive,i really loved this movie it was the right amount of horror with just a sprinkle of family ties
Apr 22 2008,positive,not a bad remake but the old addage if its not broke dont fix it definately applies here
Apr 22 2008,positive,almost frameforframe version of the original except less good
Apr 22 2008,positive,i havent seen the older ones but this one was good
Apr 21 2008,negative,the original was better an utterly pointless remake
Apr 21 2008,negative,typical terrible horror moviehad a good gimmick going for it though u know the 666 thinghahayeahuhno
Apr 21 2008,positive,once again you can never go wrong with a classic 
Apr 21 2008,negative,this cant be serious
Apr 20 2008,neutral,not half bad for a remake still what ive seen of the original the omen from 1976 was scarier
Apr 19 2008,positive,i am fairly certain this movie was remade solely to put it out on june 6 2006  you know 6606 i would say that this movie was remade really well harvey stephens  damien in the original movie got a cameo in this movie and i thought that was awesome i really loved mia farrow playing mrs baylock
Apr 18 2008,positive,not a bad movie overall
Apr 18 2008,negative,remake has a few atmospheric moments but not that scary
Apr 18 2008,negative,size4colorredo my god or should i saw o my devil no i think ill stick with good ol godcolorsize

Apr 17 2008,positive,loved the originals
Apr 17 2008,positive,one of the best horror ever

Apr 17 2008,negative,absolute proof some movies shouldnt be remade an exercise in futility
Apr 16 2008,positive,soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo scary imagine if the hypothesis were true i couldnt survive the fear without having a stroke
Apr 16 2008,neutral,i love liev schreiber in this movie  hes the only thing that makes this movie worth seeing  its pretty well known that if you have a kid named damienlife sucks we get that and another remake wasnt necessary
Apr 16 2008,neutral,i havent seen the original but this movie had some problems they seemed to drive the whole 666 thing and the church a little far i just wasnt buying it
Apr 15 2008,positive,a halfway decent remake for a change
Apr 15 2008,positive,the remakes are never that great this wasnt as bad as i thought it would be

Apr 15 2008,negative,exact remakeyea instead of watching this one watch the original
Apr 15 2008,positive,not scary at all the ending is stoopid but see it bc you have toos
Apr 15 2008,neutral,this movie is a surprisingly faithful copy of the original unfortunately i think we live in a different age now and the themes seem really dated in an age of the left behind series and religious fundamentalism in our country and abroad it would have been more interesting if they had used some more contemporary tropes this was definitely not a bad bad movie but it is such a copy of the original that i would stick with the original
Apr 14 2008,neutral,ho hum  thewis is no peck
Apr 14 2008,neutral,not as good as the original
Apr 14 2008,negative,this version was abysmal  the original is the way to go
Apr 13 2008,positive,it was good if u saw it on 666 after that it lost all power
Apr 12 2008,negative,ahh scary little child
Apr 12 2008,negative,i dont understand why they felt the need to remake this movie
Apr 12 2008,neutral,i have serious disdain for horror movies but this is one of a different kind i generally enjoyed it because of its strong plot which apparently is faithful to the original
Apr 12 2008,negative,i laughed through the whole movie then its bad
Apr 12 2008,negative,pathetic remake no one comes close to pecks performance and there is not enough modern filmmaking added to make it worth it
Apr 11 2008,negative,a crappy remake that fell way short in emulating the original een though it was basically shot for shot it lacked the cohesion and ambience of the original aweful
Apr 10 2008,negative,a slap in the face to the original
Apr 10 2008,positive,a decent attempt at a remake with some darkly disturbing religious symbology good acting and smooth direction
Apr 9 2008,negative,only for people who didnt see the originali did
Apr 9 2008,positive,they could have tried to make the remake a little bit more different other than sticking to the exact story
Apr 9 2008,negative,creepy in many parts and sometimes scary julia stiles does a great job
Apr 8 2008,neutral,a decent remake but nothing special
Apr 8 2008,neutral,virtually a shot for shot remake of a classicstill a good film thoughthe kid was a creepy looking sod and liev schreiber played his part welli wonder if they will tell the full story and thus remake the 2 sequels as well
Apr 7 2008,positive,the original is always better
Apr 7 2008,negative,freaky crap he older version though
Apr 7 2008,positive,this was a good creepy movie
Apr 7 2008,positive,a good try on remaking it and its worth a watch but if youve never seen either id start with the original which is much better plus i just dont think julia stiles was very suited to the role of damiens mother that ruined it a bit for me
Apr 6 2008,neutral,though the film had some creepy moments and moments that were just fun and exciting but the awful story and acting got to me i have never seen the original before so i am basing this review on my initial viewing of this remake  without comparing it to the original like most of the reviewers are doing here the film started out well and it gradually got more interesting and complex some moments were a little freaky and scary but it wasnt enough to sustain the film from start to finish i also the film got a little too scifi toward the end the ending was especially disappointing i was actually hoping a all out bloodfeast but instead it just ended  randomly and confusing the films cast was alright nothing to rave out the young boy who portrayed the devil did a good job but i felt a little awkwardness with his ability to portray a devil plus who was that nanny anyway did the film ever explained who she was was she also a devilindisguised or just knowledgeable that the beast has been born knew who he was and where to find him her death in the film was a little mediocre but then again the films ending wasnt as strong as the rest of the film overall the film had some creepy moments but i was wanting more from the cast and the story even though this was a remake i think the studio and the director should take liberty by adding some fresh elements to the film as well also there were some scenes in the film that had very good visuals  mostly the bathroom scenes
Apr 6 2008,negative,not a fan of remakes
Apr 6 2008,positive,it is said that the original is much better than this one i saw the original loooong a go and i barely remember it but this one is really awesome one of the best horror films ive seenthe child is creepy and his look is freaking scary i  loved the movie
Apr 6 2008,positive,why remake this film
Apr 6 2008,positive,absolutely identical to the original even most of the script is the same
Apr 6 2008,negative,terrible remake of a classic avoid and see the original its so much better
Apr 6 2008,negative,i was truly disappointed 
Apr 5 2008,positive,not too bad of a remake
Apr 4 2008,positive,ooh creepy actually i thought this movie was cool and in the end i knew that he wasnt gonna be able to kill the boy hes such a damn loser he had plenty of opportunity but as soon as the boy cried no daddy please it was all over from there
Apr 4 2008,positive,very interesting and exciting wen u watched it for the 1st time and if u havent watcehd the orgianl onebut if compored to the orginal one this version is better because of the modern technology and better perfomance by liev schreiberbut the sad thing about this movie is julia stiles that i cud not really standbasically this movie is one of her best related to her other stupid moviesher performance was sooo cold even though this role requires strong acting but she failed to thatit would be a better mother if it was rachel weisz who was actually nominated 1st 4 this movie
Apr 2 2008,positive,i thought this was actually a really well done remake it looked beautiful and is just an improvement on the original liev schreiber and mia farrow were just amazing and everyone else was good too i think that at the core the idea is really disturbing in the fact that the villain is a seemingly harmless child how can you kill your son how can you be sure of anything when it is someone you have loved their entire life a great question that i think is basically answered in you can if its the antichrist
Apr 2 2008,positive,the true scary kid movie redone with julia stiles actually looking decent
Apr 2 2008,neutral,almost identical to the original i do hope they remake the sequels but with some new twists
Apr 2 2008,negative,kasper its the remake p you cant seriously think it deserves 3 12 stars lol
Apr 2 2008,neutral,an acceptable remake
Apr 2 2008,negative,when will they stop making remakes
Apr 1 2008,positive,freaky man released 6606 and everything
Apr 1 2008,positive,it wasnt a terrible remake but i definitely prefer the original
Apr 1 2008,negative,compared to the original this is just soso whats the point strickly to make cash
Apr 1 2008,negative,pointless exercise as the film is identical in tone to the original with nothing new to say the film plods to a conclusion which is nothing but relief the cast is not too bad and the film well shot   also if you are making a devil film dont make the kid look scary with bad makeupmake him look wonderful as the son of lucifermuch scarier when he turns out bad 
Apr 1 2008,neutral,not a bad remakebut not good either
Mar 31 2008,negative,shit slowmoving boring and it felt really forced and fake
Mar 31 2008,positive,if it has a kid  whos really a demon named dameon then yes ive seen it
Mar 31 2008,positive,i hated the shotforshot remake of psycho this isnt quite as bad although liev schreibers gregory peck impression i could have done without even though it is a rather good one
Mar 30 2008,positive,admittedly i havent seen the original yet so this rating will doubtlessly change however as an omen noob i really enjoyed what was going on here of course being forced to stare at the alwayscute julia stiles never hurts any and i really enjoyed david thewliss character
Mar 30 2008,positive,scarestheshitoutofme
Mar 30 2008,negative,julia stiles doesnt make a believable mother that is the first of many reasons why this movie doesnt get my vote

Mar 29 2008,positive,will scare you to pieces
Mar 28 2008,positive,pretty good was expecting better tho
Mar 28 2008,positive,wot a sonwho wouldnt want 1 just like him lol
Mar 28 2008,negative,lol  the shamelessness of americans milking their own tragedies to further the cause of a very bad horror movie remake as if 911 and the space shuttle columbia disaster heralded the coming of the antichrist and voting george w to president  twice  didnt first off  didnt any adults want to be in this movie liev shreiber is hot but he aint no atticus finch julia stiles looks like shes still in high school  lee remmick must be turning in herwhatever happened to lee remmick anyway and who hired mia farrow whos disturbed but not disturbing and the kid is about as frightening as paul rubens who might terrify the christian right but no one else we dont even get the satanic choral music which was like the best part of the original  the most terrifying aspect of this version is how some elements which in the original might have been explained away as coincidence or postpartum depression were dumbed down so that even the most uneducated of coughamerican teenagers could understand
Mar 28 2008,negative,absolutely god awful i kept waiting for liev schreiber to sell me a watch 
Mar 28 2008,positive,a bit slow but a few good deaths in there although not as good as the origional
Mar 27 2008,positive,it was only good on mute with shane telling us the real story

Mar 25 2008,positive,surprisingly effective  i even jumped a couple of times
Mar 25 2008,positive,it was actually ok it was freaky
Mar 24 2008,neutral,like psycho the remake pointless but pretty
Mar 24 2008,positive,it was a decent movie with some interesting facts brought up to explain a possible near future end of the world
Mar 24 2008,negative,this is a movie where the trailer is very creepyand the film is not creepy at all i never saw the original but this one definitely wasnt worth the hour and 45 minutes
Mar 23 2008,negative,good god i hated it
Mar 23 2008,positive,still shit myself even knowing what was going to happen the por guy sat infront of me had a kick in the head
Mar 23 2008,positive,never going to be as good as the original but its not as bad as i thought it would be very well directed and the acting is well above average one of the better remakes around
Mar 22 2008,positive,meh i saw it on 666 but that didnt really help it all that much
Mar 22 2008,negative,i hated that kid i feel like if the antichrist is here on earth hes not going to be the pale quite kid in the corner hell be the blonde hair blue eyed overachiever to blend in a bit more
Mar 22 2008,negative,yes the president has the devil child what a bad ending
Mar 22 2008,negative,terrible remake  one of the worst of all time
Mar 21 2008,negative,predictable only thing that made me jump a little were the dogs in cemetery pa blasted the speakers so loud i was eating should have seen the dogs coming but was distracted by my bowl of egg and rice
Mar 21 2008,negative,completely devoid of any suspense whatsoever an utterly pointless remake
Mar 21 2008,positive,the original scared everyone
Mar 20 2008,negative,a really well made film and it gets an extra star for having david thewlis and mia farrow in it not a patch on the original which boasted a great cast chilling set pieces and truly frightening music     mia farrow as a kindly mrs baylock was bizzare twist not unnerving enough    the lttle boy was just a sulky little boy son of satan  naughty schoolboy possibly    why remake a classic  pointless and up there with thre recent colour remake of psycho with anne heche    passionless
Mar 20 2008,positive,most amazing reamke of 2006black dogs a crazy scaryand that boy creeps me out
Mar 20 2008,positive,fontariali know why it was decided to remake the omen richard donners breakout horror film that starred gregory peck and lee remick and for the most part it did what it set out to do but there are many questions that it left me askingand then some    the omens story starts off with the stillbirth of an ambassadors liev schreiber son he is told this by a priest who suggests that he replace the dead son for a living little boy who was just delivered to a woman who died in childbirth after a little coaxing the ambassador agrees and his wife julia styles names the boy damien but the real madness begins at damiens 9th birthday party when his nanny kill herself in front of all the guests and a new nanny takes her place mia farrow soon after little damien now played by seamus daveyfitzpatrick throws major fits when even coming up to a church drives animals into fits of fury and ultimately to attempted murder his mother catches on pretty quickly that her son isnt exactly right and by this point its time to find out who damien really is and what can be done to stop what he will become     its already been advertised that damien might just be the antichrist and while in the first film it explores evil under the appearance of innocence it didnt really contemplate how much choice plays into this the remake is more interested in fulfilling the prophacy side of the omen it skips those questions altogether but this alone doesnt make the film bad just a simple thriller what does push it beyond recomendation is the fact that the film wants to the religious aspects incredibly serious but wants to thrill just one problem for those who have an understanding of revelations already know how the omen is going to end theres no suspence and the film is already dark as it is     i have always like liev schreiber and julia styles and i still like thim in this film but the film doesnt allow them so much to play with since theyre being oneuped by suspected antichrist the proverbial bomb under the table without that these characters would be much more interesting and challenging but the films ultimiate intrest lie elsewhere even mia farrow with a very creepy character doesnt have a whole lot to run with and little seamus daveyfitzpatrick doesnt say or do too much to warrent any mention this film fails the actors    but it does show off john moores direction which have never been in question perhaps i should be more upset with moore putting his own signiture over his actors but i dont think it would have made for a better film either way the screenplay written by the original screenwriter david seltzer is just way too interested in the premise than the characters and ultimately fails both    all in all this is an effective film in theory a welldesigned remake that dances like travolta but isnt travolta now put that in the collection plate on sundayfont
Mar 20 2008,positive,of all the bloody unnecessary remakes of cult classics this is by far the best    its visual style and score adds something instead of taking everything away as those remakes usually do

Mar 11 2008,negative,it freaked me out not a big fan
Mar 11 2008,negative,not quite as creepy as the original but still decent enough
Mar 11 2008,neutral,not as good as the original  and that ruined it for me
Mar 11 2008,negative,stuuuuuuuuuupid oh and it came out on 6606 oooooooh get a life
Mar 10 2008,negative,subpar remake  the only improvement over the original was the casting of mia farrow as the nanny
Mar 10 2008,positive,never name your kid damien and dont buy a rotty i liked the movie though and for those of you that know me there was only one bit that made me hit the roof not bad really for a horror

Mar 10 2008,positive,hmmmmmmm scary  i really din like the child
Mar 9 2008,positive,so much modern style thrown in that i got distracted and some of the story was lost
Mar 9 2008,neutral,fairly watchable decent cast but the kid is horrible he frequently turns to the camera with such a deliberately devious smile that it becomes ridiculous not bad not great but i never really liked the original anyway its a decent distraction just dont expect much depth or ingenuity in its approach
Mar 9 2008,positive,s alright i guess emphasis on i guess
Mar 9 2008,neutral,crap not scary or thrilling at all
Mar 8 2008,neutral,all i can really say is if you truely insist on naming your brat ass kid damien dont be all surprised when the child ends up all infested with satan i suppose i enjoyed it about as much as i could enjoy a film saturated with christian mythology as i tend to loathe christianity my facination still continues of the bad math encountered around the number of the beast being 666 i mean i may have it wrong but the way i remember reading it was the number of the beast was 600 thrice fold and six now in my math 600 thricefold would be 1800 and 6 being plus six adds up to 1806 so wouldnt the number of the beast be 1806 i dunno
Mar 8 2008,positive,the original one was way better
Mar 8 2008,negative,a bloody joke pointless shot for shot remake of a classic and completely inane  why would david thewliss photographer develop stuff in a dark room in 2006 and how could liev schreibers thorn carry 7 daggers on a plane post 911
Mar 7 2008,neutral,the original is wayyyy better
Mar 7 2008,negative,ehh i heard the original was better
Mar 7 2008,positive,although i prefer the original version it was still entertaining to see how they have redone it  enjoyed the creepy kid who played damien
Mar 7 2008,positive,i enjoyed it comparing this to the original is pointless some genuinley scary moments mia farrow was just brilliant
Mar 7 2008,neutral,scared the crap outta me
Mar 6 2008,positive,im not a scary movie person but this keep me thinking
Mar 6 2008,positive,i love this film not as good as original but still good
Mar 5 2008,negative,terrible  a friend and i watched the original and then followed by going to a midnight screening for this at work on 6606  the original is very creepy and has   some amazing dark cinematography  the only highlight from this one is when liev schreiber punches a dog right in the face
Mar 5 2008,negative,for some reason i really didnt like this movie
Mar 5 2008,positive,schreiber did a great job in this as did stilesbut not as good as the original

Mar 3 2008,positive,freaky little kid i would not want to be the kids actual father he looks possessed little demon

Mar 2 2008,negative,hollywood is scraping the bottom of the barrel if they have to remake this crappy movie the original was ok but why couldnt they leave it at that
Mar 2 2008,negative,gregory peck must be spinning in his grave
Mar 2 2008,negative,again what with the remakes more proof to leave the classics alone
Mar 2 2008,negative,horrible remake horrible
Mar 2 2008,neutral,not at all as awesome as i thought it would be
Mar 2 2008,neutral,not the worst remake
Mar 2 2008,negative,funny in its ineptitude
Mar 1 2008,positive,the film actually turned out to be pretty good acting was soso the camerawork was okay but what sold it was the lighting and music excellent music
Mar 1 2008,positive,not at good as the original
Mar 1 2008,positive,a carbon copy of the original only with a different cast not bad but why bother making the same movie
Mar 1 2008,negative,i dont know if it had anything to do with not being scottish but i do know it was certainly crap
Mar 1 2008,positive,deaths are inventive and horrible the possessed dogs are the scariest things ever and the music is good
Mar 1 2008,negative,not something i would normally watch but hide behind the pillow when most scary scenes were on but other than that i thought the movie was pretty good for a horror flick
Feb 29 2008,negative,for a remake of a beloved class this wasnt that bad
Feb 29 2008,positive,the film exceeded my expectations and was grittier and more brilliant than the original one i liked it
Feb 29 2008,positive,this is just wrong  little kids are supposed to be cute not creepy
Feb 29 2008,negative,the remake of course sucked ass
Feb 29 2008,positive,it pissed me off when the wife got killed
Feb 29 2008,positive,much better than the classic film it stuck well to the original story but indulged in the more modern penchant for more backstory more in depth characters and of course effects i liked it
Feb 28 2008,neutral,it wasnt worth making in my opinion  i enjoyed some of it but i really think the original was much better
Feb 28 2008,negative,i thought it was going to be awesome instead i was quite disappointed
Feb 28 2008,positive,i was insulted at times that it was dumbed down from the orginal  like they posioned the mother in this one as to in the orginal i believe sheg ot shoved out of a window   it held itself up well and was really one to keep our eye on  the kid was way beyond creepy and his church flipout in the car where he like mauls his mother was way better than the orginal where the kid just started crying  so it gets a good grade form me
Feb 28 2008,positive,lol wmp crashed in the last 10 mins or sth xd  and i loved how they turned every o in the names of actors into a 6 xd  the movie overall isnt so bad ive a feeling though that the original was better i gotta check it one day
Feb 28 2008,positive,not too bad not too bad sweet death scenes they would have been sweeter if they added in the deleted scene cuz it seems they took out the gory part of the scene i found the story was a bit hard to follow how they were introducing new characters every like 5 mins i wish those demons that women sees the one in the previews wit the animal skull and red hood made an impacted in the story but your only see it for half a second
Feb 27 2008,negative,as pointless as remakes get right up there with van sants psycho
Feb 27 2008,neutral,watch the original much better
Feb 26 2008,negative,i actually fell asleep
Feb 25 2008,positive,went and saw it on 6606 it was alright not the best way to spend the day of the devil
Feb 25 2008,neutral,could have been better
Feb 25 2008,negative,this film was just bad with terrible scares a plot that doesnt even come close to the terror or the tension of the first and man was i suppose to laugh during some of the scenes cause i did i felt i was watching final destination 4 or since 4 is on its way outthen 5 i mean it was like damien hired death from the final destination films to do all his killing only to not have them duke it out freddy vs jason style at the end additionally remakes are doomed to be bad much like sequels they are inevitably going to be a lesser film this movie is a great example of why remakes should not be made bad movie bad remake and bad hollywoodgo lay down
Feb 25 2008,positive,its exactly like the first one but with new actors and vivid colours and the slipped in a character from the game resident evil 4 so yeah good flick but coulda made it there own
Feb 24 2008,positive,okay this freaked me out for alike 2 weeks
Feb 24 2008,negative,the original was betterand i thought that one sucked lol
Feb 23 2008,positive,not nearly as scary as i thought it would be gees still a cool story and i liked that lupin was in it makes me never want to have a nanny
Feb 23 2008,positive,thatll make ya not want to have any kidstheyre fuckin crazy
Feb 23 2008,negative,i tend to love films that show the dark sides of religion but i couldnt really take this seriously the kid was a good actor though
Feb 23 2008,negative,i thought it would be really good but was really disappointed when i saw it
Feb 23 2008,negative,terrible  julia stiles is not at all a good actress either  that kid had really cool eyes though  did not like this at all
Feb 22 2008,positive,goooood show frightening
Feb 22 2008,positive,i saw this opening night in silver spring md  it was packed  people were sitting on the floor up the stairs  the movie itself was averagethe original is better but the movie going experience was unlike any other  totally cool
Feb 22 2008,positive,kinda freaky the ending sucks
Feb 22 2008,positive,liev schreiber and julia stiles are the unwitting parents of the spawn of satan in this updated remake of the 70s classic  while people tend to look down on any remakes of beloved movies  some such as this are due for an update  here the majority of the key scenes remain intact and are redone very well  great casting is key for a very good remake   mia farrow also stars as the not so well intentioned nanny  very good remake
Feb 22 2008,positive,gives u scare  the end is near 
Feb 21 2008,negative,like i said the first one was better
Feb 21 2008,negative,hey ruin the original in this move liev schrieber and david thewlis were good but the director ruined what this movie is about

Feb 20 2008,neutral,the first one was soo much better on so many levels this version was just a dumbeddown one only thing that stands out is the modern setting
Feb 20 2008,positive,a very realistic and frightening narration  damien scares you and the music is haunting a great film
Feb 19 2008,negative,the deaths were so uncreative i had high expectations of this movie and they got chopped down faster and more unstylishly than that guy on the stone steps who got his head cut off rosemarys baby was a creepier movie meaning no comparative disrespect to rosemarys baby which is an excellent film
Feb 19 2008,positive,this movie aint scary but i like watching it
Feb 19 2008,neutral,ou dear i dont know was it good or bad but it was definitely scary

Feb 18 2008,negative,i hated this if you are going to do a remake at least add your own style this was the exact same but not as good
Feb 18 2008,positive,the story line is ok but the effects and the use of red in every scene is brilliant
Feb 18 2008,negative,a near wordforword clone of the original  why bother remaking something if youre not going to add something new
Feb 18 2008,neutral,very similar to the original i wasnt scared by either one the choice of casting julia stiles as the mother was a surprise
Feb 17 2008,negative,not as good as the older version
Feb 17 2008,positive,this was so cool my son is named after this one
Feb 17 2008,neutral,i liked it i never saw the original so i cant compare it but i would watch this again
Feb 17 2008,negative,man i want to punch that kid so badly
Feb 17 2008,negative,hated it the original being only slightly better anyway
Feb 17 2008,neutral,wtf ending always sucks in the omen
Feb 17 2008,positive,liked the original much better
Feb 16 2008,positive,this is really freaky but i love it
Feb 16 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 16 2008,negative,wasnt as good as i was expecting
Feb 16 2008,positive,not as good as original
Feb 16 2008,positive,what pray tell is the point of this movie exactly its nearly identical to the original dont know whether to give it one star or five because its the same film  basicallyits like reading the same comic but having been drawn by a different artistand its nowhere near as good like reading an old alex ross drawn graphic novel but drawn by someone shit
Feb 16 2008,negative,the little boy steals this movie but his performance cant make this any more than a below average movie
Feb 15 2008,negative,the original is one of my all time favourites and i was horrified when i watched this remake i expected it to be a different take on the story but was simply a reshoot scene for scene with different characters tisk tisk
Feb 15 2008,positive,this was good for a laugh
Feb 15 2008,negative,an utterly pointless remake of a true horror classic  it brought no new twists or angles to the original except maybe a few pathetic attempts at getting the odd cheap jump out of the audience  what a complete waste of money and my time watching it  however david thewlis is excellent as ever  he earns the two stars
Feb 15 2008,positive,not as good as the original but still a very good movie
Feb 15 2008,positive,wasnt terrible pretty decent for a horror remake especially a horror classic much better than the majority of horror remakes that come out but the original definitely owns
Feb 14 2008,negative,dreadful liev schrieber and julia stiles attempting to raise a blue eyed wannabe emo version of damien who has a strange ability to control mia farrow it seems to be a mishmash of clumsy 70s horrorthriller tributes boys from brazil rosemarys baby in a pathetic modernist attempt to prove that progress can always make a film better it has some inspired moments admittedly the scene with the scarred monk stiles murder at the hands of farrow but most of it is just going over old ground in much the same fashion as gus van sant attempted to do with psycho what hollywood still fails to understand is that some remakes work whilst others dont because the ones that do adapt and change according to context they take time to understand the themes of the original film and then try to bend them around their own ideas which is why texas chainsaw works so well and why remakes like this and the wicker man are so poor if this film was anything other than a straight remake it would have garnered more admiration but as it is the 2006 version of the omen is nothing more than uninspired and an insult to the 1976 original
Feb 14 2008,neutral,ehhhi saw it but i didnt really like it much i havent seen the original though
Feb 14 2008,positive,i just love scary mooooovies
Feb 13 2008,positive,just like the first one that made it predictable to me but a well done remake
Feb 13 2008,negative,pointless remake seemingly only remade for the date 666
Feb 12 2008,neutral,julia stiles cannot act the kid was a little unsettling at first but his scowl and heavy breathing got old fast some decent suspense saved it from being a terrible remake
Feb 12 2008,negative,sucks the original was better
Feb 12 2008,negative,they took everything that was good and creepy about the first one and left it out  dont waste your time  rent the original instead  its a great film
Feb 12 2008,positive,haha this is so hilarious if you watch it with the right people
Feb 11 2008,positive,kill the bitch ass nanny
Feb 11 2008,positive,i think i liked the original better but it was good

Feb 11 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 11 2008,positive,scares the crap out of me
Feb 10 2008,negative,bleh wasnt worth seeing
Feb 10 2008,neutral,framebyframe remake of the original  nothing new
Feb 10 2008,neutral,decent remake until it became a final destination ripoff
Feb 9 2008,negative,the original was better
Feb 9 2008,negative,first one was better
Feb 9 2008,positive,creepy liev schreiber again gives an impressive performance yet again and where did they find that creepy kid from anyway hes screwed for life if someone recongizes him
Feb 9 2008,negative,this movie is exactly like the old one there is no reason to watch it
Feb 8 2008,positive,i loved this movie and i want to see the original i hear its even scarier and creepier
Feb 8 2008,negative,is this a scene for scene remake seems pointless
Feb 8 2008,positive,i think this was a lot better than the original althoguh the original had the better cast
Feb 8 2008,negative,10 minutes was all i could stand watch the original dont waste your time on this
Feb 8 2008,negative,a remake that just wasnt required
Feb 7 2008,neutral,save for a few scenes here and there its almost an exact replica of the original moreso than a remake i couldnt even finish the movie because of it especially considering i have practically memorized the original
Feb 7 2008,positive,actually a pretty good movie very scary because who knows if this could happen
Feb 7 2008,positive,scary when it came out  some bits still make me jump
Feb 7 2008,negative,why mess up an original  julie styles is not believeable as a mother and all the scenes and camera angles are the same as the original why remake it
Feb 7 2008,negative,in viewing this movie you have to suspend rational thought about fairy tale ideas such as satan the book of revelations etc    the fact that 6606 was coming up was apparently enough of a reason to remake a movie that was less than 20 years old at the time i barely remember the original but i dont remember the kid being evil from the start we were led to believe that the kid was unaware of what he was doing until the scene where he winks at the end in the remake however the kids knows hes evil the entire time thus ruining the winking scene     the last 20 minutes or so of the movie may be even more unbelievable than a red guy with horns and a pitchfork    the prophecy of the photographer being the next to die becomes true when hes impaled in italy from something falling off the roof or something this is the only death where the omen kid isnt present hes thousands of miles away whatever thats fine but then the omen kids father runs up to the photographer and grabs a bunch of swords from his decapitated bodys hands in front of a tonnn of onlookers and boards a plane back the states he boards the plane in a post 911 world with a bunch of ancient swords they even make it a point to mention that the movie is post 911 by showing video of the towers collapsing in the opening scene    maybe mayyybe i could believe that because the man is an ambassador that he had special privileges and could bring a bunch of weapons on a commercial airline ok so then the dude goes into his kids room notices the 666 behind his head grabs the kid and carries him of to the car because the only way to kill the demon or satan or whatever is to kill the kid with the swords in a church the father is distraught and starts driving like a complete idiot like 80 mph and crashing into a bunch of crap the cops who happen to be right there start chasing him     why did the father have to drive like killing the kid was so urgent wouldnt he be careful not to break about 100 traffic laws on his way to the church its not like there was a timeline like he had to kill the kid by midnight or something he couldve killed him in a month or two if he felt like it    so he drags the kid onto the altar pulls out his swords and then gets shot by the cops who are in full riot gear why would they be in full riot gear when they were basically pulling someone over for speeding an ambassador mind you    the ride to the church couldnt have been more than five minutes tops we are to believe that this cop just happened to be hanging out with his little radar gun in full riot gear    so the cops kill the dude and then the guy gets a military style funeral with the gun salute and everything the president was even in attendance     would a man who was killed while trying to ritualistically murder his 5 year old son on the floor of a church have a military style funeral with full honors     hopefully when they remake this movie in 6666 they will address these issues
Feb 7 2008,positive,one of my favourites
Feb 7 2008,negative,i gotta say nay on this one guys as ive stated before im a huge horror fan and i loved the original omen trilogy  thats right a trilogy omen iv doesnt exist i dont give a fuck if youve seen it or not it never happened  this retelling of the omen is simply that its the original retold nowadays and shot almost scene for scene when i say scene for scene i dont mean how they done the remake of psycho which was literally scene for scene and even shot for shot what was the fucking point i just found myself going along with the film and sayin to myself oh heres where the priest gets impaled or oh here he goes on his scooter to knock his ma over the balcony switching a tricycle for a scooter you sly bastards  see it really is different the acting isnt too bad the actors turn out decent enough performances its just that when you know whats coming up and how the story goes its hard to get truly involved or give a damn about the characters why did i watch it then i hear you ask curiosity like most fans of the original i wanted to see what theyve done with this all new version lastly damien himself has to get a mention played by seamus daveyfitzpatrick hmmm i wonder where his family hail from damien just came across as a little disturbed to me in the original harvey stephens was pretty believable as the son of satan the little shit and gave off that unsettling feeling that there was something not quite right about this kid  i havent heard whether this is to be the first remake of a trilogy but heres hoping it aint
Feb 7 2008,neutral,that little boy is scary but the film is very predictable
Feb 7 2008,neutral,horrible acting but entertaining lol

Feb 6 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 6 2008,negative,its a rubbish remake of a fantastic film it does not improve on the story in any way it does have some good turns by thewlis farrow  postlethwaite but they are fighting a loosing battle when up against a talentless director a kid that isnt scary and the pain to watch that is julia stiles stop remaking and make something new
Feb 6 2008,positive,the original is better still ok
Feb 5 2008,positive,wow it wasnt all that creepy in the usually horror ways but just the thought of the little kid being the devil is freaky the dogs scared me too but seamus daveyfitzpatrick was adorable little emo kid the ending was freaky too p

Feb 4 2008,positive,not so bad scariest
Feb 3 2008,neutral,remake technically improves upon the original but fails to deliver the same thrills and chills mia farrows eerie performance is notable though
Feb 3 2008,positive,the original is definitely better
Feb 3 2008,positive,this movie gave me the worse nightmare ever on the same night i watched the movie  it literally made me scream at like 4 in the morningoh yeas this is the movie about evil yes this is the movie about satan yes this is the movie about devil yes this is the movie about anti god yes this is the movie about 666this is omen this is horror
Feb 3 2008,negative,avoid it stupid extremely predictable and depicts ideas that the satan is more powerful than god if i could give negative ratings i would
Feb 2 2008,positive,it was trying too hard and just didnt measure up to the creepyness of the original
Feb 2 2008,neutral,dang good for its time oh wait this is the other one it was ok
Feb 2 2008,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 2 2008,positive,not a good as the first but good enough  love julia stiles 
Feb 2 2008,negative,another goddamn unnecessary remake
Feb 2 2008,negative,why is it that directors think a new version of a classic might be better  history tells us the opposite please hollywood  start creating new ideas
Feb 2 2008,positive,released thirty years after the original  i think i may have seen this infact on 060606 hard to beat the original  as other people have said did we really need a remake
Feb 1 2008,positive,creepy keeps u watching wheather u want to or not
Feb 1 2008,negative,the only reason it gets any stars from me is for the performances of thewlis farrow and always the incredible liev schreiber otherwiseshite

Jan 29 2008,positive,seen this one in the theater and i actually threw up during the scene where the priest gets impaled  i actually puked just as it happend four times      i saw it on midnight of 6606  badly sunburn too  my then room mate wouldnt let me live it down being a horror writer who writes graphic stories of my own   all it in all it is a good movie but one you have to watch the 1976 version to get the details where they got graphic   the death of the mother is a little different in this verison  it was a little colder how they got rid of her      i am not about to give everything away here but youll see some rather controversial footage from 911 and hurricane katrina and believe me the director of this one has some brass balls  it is also based on a novel the screenwriter did

Jan 15 2008,positive,no one expected this to be a patch on the original but at least one zoo sequence thanks to cgi was superior again topnotch acting postlewaite thewlis and mia farrow as the evil nanny the remake is sadly let down by the main actor and actress a pair of lame ducks but having a black alsatian was a lovely touch
Jan 15 2008,positive,not so great a remake
Jan 15 2008,negative,perhaps the remake of the 70s classic was intended to set the original on an even higher plane the story is filmed so close to the original that it leaves you wondering why they bothered the effects are no better the acting is unemotional at best and a majority of the scary snippets in the trailer are actually dreams the cast is unconvincing not sure why they bothered with this one
Jan 15 2008,negative,competentbut fairly pointless remake
Jan 15 2008,positive,satan is one of the better actors of our decade  his son the antichrist could take a few lessons from him  not as good as the original

Jan 12 2008,neutral,the original beats this version by a mile
Jan 12 2008,neutral,the omen remake isnt nearly as good as the original unfortunately the best part about it was that it was released on 6606 and its something cool that ill be able to share with grandkids and such it had a couple of new scares but it was basically the original over again

Jan 8 2008,negative,nothing in the story really interest me at all
Jan 8 2008,neutral,of all the reimaginations this one didnt go too far in making me sick  i just really dislike julia stilesand how in modern day american flicks they try to incorporate the terrible terrorist tale

Jan 2 2008,negative,why remake one of the best horror films of all time
Jan 2 2008,positive,the original sucked this was marginally better stiles saved the movie  the kid isnt evil enough and it is true predictable  such potential with a story idea like this

Dec 31 2007,positive,this movie made me change my mind about having kids lol very creepy but very good
Dec 31 2007,positive,its pretty good its not as good as the first one i gotta say but its really good for the first part of it when the man is annoucing the disasters in which may have been caused by the trumpets being blown the director really did his homework to getting people to fall for the movie i didnt find it scary at all but my friend and my brother said it gave them nightmares haha it is a great movie to show when you have friends over but it just isnt as good as the orginal classic

Dec 30 2007,positive,i watched dis movie so many times dat i even remembered everythin dey say
Dec 30 2007,positive,not bad for a retread though its completely gratuitous given that the original is still one of the creepiest films ever made still it has some great visual elements though we felt compelled to cackle mstk3style at damien because that kids facial expressions were priceless
Dec 29 2007,negative,much more funny that scary saw it on 6606 the aesthetic was cool orignal is the way to go remakes are failing
Dec 29 2007,negative,i was laughing and apparently not the only one the first was far better
Dec 29 2007,positive,a surprisingly good remake
Dec 29 2007,positive,im usually not one for scary movies but this movie is very well done it not only leaves you with a strong sense of reality which is what is lacking in most movies of this genre and is consequently the reason why i pass on most of them but it also leaves you feeling very fulfilled that you just saw a damn good flick an excellent remake and very deserving of its ironic release date 6606
Dec 28 2007,positive,not as good as the original but liev schreiber had a good performance
Dec 28 2007,negative,another needless remake which banks on the superstition of 6606 took the original aspects away from the original and watered it down with camerawork and dialgoue tailored to the japanohorror remake craving masses
Dec 28 2007,positive,liked the original 1s better but a good film
Dec 28 2007,negative,just a retreading of the original and not much else  some cool visuals but the story needed a few new elements
Dec 28 2007,positive,this movie was actually kinda good it isnt even halfly as good as the original movie but youll watch this trought quite easily its really not as spooky as the original and this one fails at many parts when it tries to create the atmosphere but it has good actors and theyre really trying their best to be the characters
Dec 27 2007,neutral,i bow to the original
Dec 27 2007,negative,i dont know if this was intended to be a comedy but i was laughing
Dec 27 2007,negative,needless remake of a classic
Dec 27 2007,positive,rather a funny movie than a horror one in my opinion but definitely a decent movie
Dec 27 2007,positive,the best part wen the thing falls on the guy creepy and corny at the same time
Dec 27 2007,negative,yay julia stiles getting beat up by a little kid yay how about no
Dec 27 2007,negative,i was not scared totally predictable

Dec 26 2007,negative,prefer the original anyday
Dec 26 2007,positive,the best bits of this movie are the lead ups to what we already know is going to happen im not going to spoil the ending but it does come across as quite a letdown the nanny hanging herself still sends a chill down my spine
Dec 26 2007,positive,actually a good remake of the original
Dec 26 2007,negative,remakehorror films are shit
Dec 26 2007,positive,it is a good one       love renee
Dec 26 2007,positive,the omen 2006 as all know its a remake from the horror classic by the same title in 1976    the story revolves satans child who was adopted by human parents and turns into a massacre parody as he grows older and become a danger threat to both of them and to mankind    i never watch the original very hard to find but as my research goes most of the scene and plot was the exact from the original so im safe    i loved this movie concept just brilliant cinematography and music score was outstanding direction was good just ridiculous    spoilers   the opening scene when liev heard that his baby died in the birth process he immediately was convince to ignore his dead baby and take over the evil baby  cmon i dont know if the 1976 one was like this or not but its stupid  i know that he is shed with pain and sadness but does he loss his intelligence too     second major outrages foolish scene should be julias fall down scene  i was laughing very hard when i saw this she was watering a little pot flower which was hang in the ceiling near the hallway balcony  of course its so easy to arouse accident  with or without evil damien push you over sigh    liev schreiber was miscast total miscast    julia stiles in other hand was average nothing special i love her really but playing a diplomats wife isnt she too young for that    mia farrow she played the evil nurse was alright she looks creepy in some scene    overall a nice eerie movie with the essence of devil   was hoping for an excellent devil movie well could be better    610 the same rating with the eye very strange
Dec 26 2007,negative,no no no dont remake classics
Dec 25 2007,neutral,mia farrow is terrifying
Dec 25 2007,positive,better than the original worth the release date hype more clean cut scarier crazier better acted great use of color do it

Dec 24 2007,positive,children playing the spawns of satan are always creepy
Dec 24 2007,negative,did anybody think that liev schrieber would measure up to gregory peck  why dont we remake the godfather with seth green barry pepper james franco and kirsten dunst
Dec 24 2007,positive,scary but not scary enough 
Dec 24 2007,neutral,not a huge fan the story never caught my interest the boy was too cute to ever make me see him as the devil or whatever he was not that scary either
Dec 24 2007,negative,a remake that was almost the same as the origional just not as good

Dec 23 2007,positive,i enjoyed this film alot its creepy and frightening
Dec 23 2007,positive,despite some small flaws this movie completely took me by storm compelling story fueled by a constant deep fear as compared to the lame slasher cheese types that hollywood wont stop pumping out loved the plot and filming style
Dec 22 2007,positive,i loved it prefer the old one but this aint bad at all
Dec 22 2007,positive,that little boy kicked julias ass in the car in front of church  watch this on christmas

Dec 22 2007,positive,i thought this was a pretty solid remake  the original is excellent and this one doesnt stray too far from it
Dec 21 2007,negative,this version was not scary  the kid just needed a good smack

Dec 21 2007,positive,original had more edge to it it was a faithful remake but thats it
Dec 21 2007,positive,movie is kind of scary and bloody
Dec 21 2007,positive,better than the original classic creepy and devilishmy kind of show
Dec 20 2007,negative,the original is a classic and one of my favorite horror movies this remake was unnecessary
Dec 20 2007,negative,why mess with i mean remake a good thing
Dec 20 2007,positive,not as good as the original but thats hard to be fair
Dec 20 2007,negative,unnecessary remake but fairly well made
Dec 20 2007,neutral,it was alright considering i got the movie for free with my ps3  a few scary parts but nothing special
Dec 20 2007,positive,one of the better remakes these days  its not a scary movie some parts are creepy but thats about it  keep a look out for mia farrow she takes the crown as creepiest nanny ever
Dec 20 2007,negative,simply the worst remake ever
Dec 20 2007,positive,i screamed like a bansheeits that good  saqw this at 12mncouldnt sleep after that  great horror
Dec 20 2007,negative,pretty forgettable im going to have to watch the original to compare
Dec 19 2007,negative,original is way better
Dec 19 2007,negative,essentially a shot for shot remake of a movie that was mediocre at best
Dec 19 2007,negative,see the original instead
Dec 19 2007,neutral,watched this at about midnight didnt finish til about 2 or 3 in the morning which then there was a lunar eclipse created by mars making the moon red i went to bed fine not that scary at all
Dec 19 2007,negative,not anywhere near as good as the original
Dec 19 2007,negative,a perfect example of why some movies just dont need to be remade
Dec 19 2007,negative,stiles couldnt act her way out of a ketchup commercial ive never seen the original but i was wondering why they bothered a remake when i laughed through most of it a complete lack of suspense horror or action but great for laughs
Dec 19 2007,negative,to its creditit could have been worse  it was atmospheric but sadly didnt have a tenth of the coolness of the original  no gregory peck severly hurts the score
Dec 18 2007,negative,definitely better than the original it just wasnt very excitinga few good action shots and some decent drama here and there but they just arent great horrors
Dec 18 2007,positive,scared the f out of me
Dec 18 2007,positive,damien looks like my godchildand that in itself scares me
Dec 18 2007,negative,the kids pretty creepy and liev schreiber is fantastic otherwise theres really no bother with this remake the horrorsuspense moments are far too cliche the script is useless and bringing in mia farrow to be ironic or something was a silly idea she does a good job but her character really lacks the plot isnt even explained properly and the ending is crap saved by schreiber until he recites the lords prayer why do they always do that
Dec 17 2007,negative,really pointless why make a remake that is the exact same as the frist one
Dec 17 2007,positive,little creepy kid movies are the shit and this one being the original oh mama awesomeness
Dec 17 2007,negative,i saw this movie already  the original  its exactly the same why even bother remaking something and not change a thing about it i will stick with richard donners version
Dec 17 2007,positive,although it is the same as original but a great story i like it
Dec 17 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still good
Dec 17 2007,positive,woohooooo much thrills at the end
Dec 16 2007,positive,a great and closely done remake
Dec 16 2007,negative,this was a remake that really wasnt necessary  the stoy is pretty much identical and they didnt really update any special effects very well or anything else for that matter  it was too exact of a copy i guess is the problem  basically a rich couple have a child but once he hits a certain age a bunch of weird stuff starts happening and it turns out that he is a demon child  like i said a direct remake i never like julia styles either so it just made the movie worse to me i dont see any reason to recommend it
Dec 16 2007,positive,my friend screamed at one point in this and she refused to watch it any further
Dec 15 2007,negative,the original is definitely better
Dec 15 2007,negative,once again ahhhhhhgdiasghd too scary

Dec 15 2007,neutral,lots of potential but a terrible remake they stayed pretty true to the original but somehow made it worse
Dec 15 2007,positive,actually a really good remake of a classic scary as hell movie the kid is just as creepy as the old one
Dec 15 2007,positive,one of my favorite movies
Dec 15 2007,neutral,a stylish remake that falls down on little content and diversion from the original spooky in parts but overall one that you will forget quickly the actors dont meet their ends quick enough is its biggest downfall
Dec 14 2007,positive,i like the name damien
Dec 14 2007,negative,remakes in most cases bad
Dec 14 2007,positive,good movie just as good as the origional
Dec 14 2007,positive,one of the scariest scary movies
Dec 14 2007,negative,at least stiles died in it

Dec 13 2007,positive,ive never seen the first one but this was pretty scary
Dec 13 2007,negative,10x worse than it should have been
Dec 13 2007,neutral,creepy if watched in a garage at midnight with chimes in the background
Dec 13 2007,positive,creepy  sure  scary  maybe  pointless  absolutely  but still better than gus van sants psycho
Dec 13 2007,positive,i cant remember what the hell this movie is about
Dec 13 2007,negative,not scary at allpretty bland movie the only intense part is the needle partwhich isnt even true to life and i hate it when they do that in movies not worth time or money to rent it dont watch this watch the original
Dec 12 2007,negative,it wasnt a horrible movie i didnt stop midway because it was so unbearable to watch there werent any scares and it was hardly a thriller in all it was bland
Dec 12 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Dec 12 2007,negative,not as good as the original
Dec 12 2007,positive,liev schreiber performs as a block of emotionless wood who adopts the son of the devil  mia farrow is excellent as the nanny  there are some great shots within this mediocre remake  it will not scare but it will leave you with an uneasy feeling
Dec 12 2007,negative,dumb remake dumb dumb dumb i should know considering the vast quantities of horror movies i take in
Dec 12 2007,neutral,creepy yes good erwellnot exactly
Dec 12 2007,negative,boring definitely not julia stiles best work
Dec 11 2007,positive,my friends kid looks just like the kid from this movie its creepy
Dec 11 2007,positive,a tie between the remake and the original
Dec 11 2007,negative,it is a shame that it is an exact remake of the original so for the one who saw the original it is like watching the same film again no surprises at all
Dec 11 2007,negative,if this is the same the omen that im thinking of i got to the end and was like are you kidding  can i have that hour and a half back
Dec 11 2007,negative,just watch the original its 100 times better
Dec 10 2007,negative,and this movie was in the horror section boring well its got an okay plot but where are the scares and stuff  pass
Dec 10 2007,negative,sucked compared to the original which is one of my alltime favorite horror flicks liev schreiber cant compare to gregory peck
Dec 10 2007,negative,ok so clever points for releasing it 662006 otherwise not so much
Dec 10 2007,negative,mia farrow is chilling as mrs baylock
Dec 10 2007,negative,i thought it was a very poor remake  stick to the original
Dec 10 2007,positive,one of the best remakes ive ever seen
Dec 10 2007,negative,features that leaf guy doing his best gregory peck imitation  pretty much exactly the same as the original
Dec 10 2007,negative,i really didnt like the remake it was your typical horror movie
Dec 9 2007,positive,the only downfall is its exactly like the original
Dec 9 2007,negative,i cant believe i bought the remakeit plainly sucksill be nice and give it one starthough
Dec 9 2007,positive,decent remake that is held afloat by just how disturbing seamus daveyfitzpatrick is as damien the actors give mediocre performances except pete postlethwaite did an amazing job as father brennan it has a good story and some good production values i especially like the contrast of red and white in certain scenes also they do create a rather creepy mood throughout the entire movie and it has one decent scare which made it worth watching even if the original is better
Dec 9 2007,positive,whether it was as good as the original ive no idea except that for a horrorthriller fan like me that kid scares the creep out of me
Dec 9 2007,negative,leave classics the hell alone
Dec 9 2007,positive,this is the closest a movie has gotten to depicting exactly how i believe the antichrist will rise so well done that it could be a biodocumentary if it werent a remake of a classic
Dec 8 2007,negative,the only good thing about this was katherines new death which actually freakedme out but other than that it was lame
Dec 8 2007,negative,the nanny getting hit made the whole theatre laughgreg and i cheered
Dec 8 2007,positive,great film fantastic remake
Dec 7 2007,neutral,i dont know how good the original was but im sure this is definitely not a profound movie devil seemed so weak as it presented
Dec 7 2007,negative,im embarrassed to admit i rented this  absolutely terrible
Dec 7 2007,positive,original is far superior
Dec 7 2007,negative,due to overwhelming deja vu i couldnt even manage to finish the movie oh wait it wasnt deja vui was actually watching the exact same movie i had previously watched with the same title and different cast i mean honestly what was the point of remaking the movie if the only difference is the cast if youre going to make it make it your own
Dec 7 2007,positive,for a remake it wasnt that bad
Dec 7 2007,positive,thats scary really  that childs really looks like an evil and look at his eyes filled with malevolent look  that child sure know how to act   very good
Dec 6 2007,negative,eh ive never really beenoh wait this is the new one let me take away a star and a half
Dec 6 2007,negative,hey lets totally rely on a gimmic of a release date to make our shit remake successfull and totally renig all things that made the original so amazing
Dec 6 2007,positive,pretty good but not as scary as i prefer
Dec 6 2007,negative,this was not scary at all waste of my 12 bucks
Dec 6 2007,positive,terrible remake  brings nothing new or amazing to the series a kid who looks exactly like the original damian making everything even more identicle and the original still rains supreme
Dec 6 2007,positive,somehow not as creepy as the book
Dec 5 2007,neutral,pretty good remake but nowhere near the original
Dec 5 2007,positive,a good moviebut nothing like the original movie

Dec 4 2007,negative,such a bad bad bad movie
Dec 4 2007,positive,eh could have been worse for a remake i guess
Dec 4 2007,negative,what a piece of shit this was
Dec 4 2007,negative,i think the original halloween and the original omen are the two best horrors of all time  this remake was awful and should have never been made
Dec 3 2007,negative,dragged on forever wasnt really that scary i havent seen the 76 version so i cant compare
Dec 3 2007,positive,this movie made me jump in my seat a lot what makes this movie special to me is the atmosphere i watched it in a packed cinema with a group of black people that wouldnt stfuhowever they did make me lulz when they said and i quote awww that was my nigga
Dec 3 2007,positive,exactly the same as the original
Dec 3 2007,positive,im now afraid of 5 year old boys a really good phycological thriller that makes you think about more than just the bible would recommend to anyone that likes truly good scary movies
Dec 3 2007,positive,it was a good psychological thriller but it wasnt really scary enough for me
Dec 3 2007,positive,take by take exactly the same as the original  i dont see why everyone was so hard on it i loved the original but since that means this was unneded ill grade it lower than the 76 version
Dec 3 2007,negative,a remake tell me why ho yeah the moneyright
Dec 3 2007,positive,coverd my eyes alot lol
Dec 3 2007,negative,a fun remake the first time seeing it but yeah it butchered the original def not as creepy
Dec 3 2007,neutral,another pointless remake
Dec 3 2007,neutral,i shielded my eyes looked away from the screen and jumped several times during the omen but was that because i was scared for a long time horror movies have contained moments when a character suddenly sees something or someone and a loud blast from the soundtrack startles the audience the trick as an audience member is to determine whether a you are afraid of what is about to happen storywise or b what is about to happen soundwise i would choose option b for the omen and yet there is fun to be had in this film not quite enough to justify a 10 ticket at the cinema but for a rainy friday night dvd viewing you could do worse    liev schreiber and julia stiles star as an american diplomat and his wife raising their only child damien schreiber harbours a secret involving the boy that he has kept hidden from stiles their child died during pregnancy and a mysterious doctor persuaded schreiber to substitute it with another child born to an unmarried woman damien unbeknownst to schreiber is the son of the devil it takes several years apparently as this period is offscreen for damien to act on his devilish instincts but once the nanny hangs herself from the upper floor balcony after shouting âthis is for you damienâ a shocking series of events mostly deaths ensues     stilesâ character has no occupation in the film except to visit her husband at work and spray the plants around the house and yet she feels the need to hire new help this is discussed by the couple in the film however it still seemed a little strange to me anyway mrs baylock is the replacement played by mia farrow in a rather brilliant piece of casting farrow was the lead in rosemaryâs baby a classic supernatural thriller in which her husband made a deal with the devil provide me with a âbreakâ in the acting world in exchange for my wife giving birth to satan the irony and amusement in her performance in the omen is that this time she is goading the child    farrowâs presence made me reflect on rosemaryâs baby a far superior film it contained as far as i can recall no false âjumpâ moments or phony suspense the story played out at a constant crescendo with characters we felt sympathy for so that the climax was truly horrific it resonates strongly there is tragedy at the conclusion of the omen too but there is no way for the audience to be absorbed or moved by it this is essentially a mainstream modern horror film concerned with loud music not building fear in our hearts i am writing this review some four weeks after viewing the film and there is no emotional resonance     still this is slightly better than your average horror flick and there is no doubt that you get all of the screams blood and deaths one could possibly want in a film about a devil child i particularly enjoyed farrowâs performance even whilst she was underused and david thewlis as a photographer who notices an alarming pattern on his prints i was also grimly amused by three elaborate death sequences in the film that would not have seemed out of place in final destination 3 commendable too is the sparing use of gore which turned me off a movie like saw 2     an interesting feature of the omen is how quickly and cheaply it was made which shines through in several performances overall schreiber does an effective job but towards the end his emotional scenes ring false and the direction tends to clunk stiles seems a little young to be credible opposite him and her character is difficult to comprehend the filmâs marketing hinged on its release date of 6606 is it possible that production was sped up to accommodate this certainly some of the more dramatic scenes with schreiber and stiles need more time and development to affect the audience     the omen may try harder to be a good movie than final destination 3 however it just isnât as much plain fun neither films approach being scary and this is a major problem for modern horror pictures you can admire the skill of the artistry up to a point but i believe it will take more than some loud blasts in the ears to ensure that directors switch from b to a they need mrs baylock to goad them
Dec 3 2007,positive,liked the originally better but they tried to stay true to the story  it was ok
Dec 2 2007,positive,not as creepy as the original
Dec 2 2007,positive,clearly not as amazing as the original but still had its crazy scary moments
Dec 2 2007,negative,rent the originalthis is crap
Dec 2 2007,negative,if youre going to remake a movie shot by shotwhy remake it at all
Dec 2 2007,negative,laughable literally
Dec 2 2007,positive,real horror     the end has crash my heart
Dec 2 2007,negative,i did not like this film one bit my friend and i thought it would be scary it wasnt at all but just plain out crap sorry to those who probably liked it wonder who but this film is utter crap
Dec 1 2007,negative,why did this need to be remade
Dec 1 2007,negative,the kid is creepy but the acting is much much weaker than in the original even the kid although creepy is just creepy nothing more very unlikable cast you want the devil to take them not as good as the original not close
Dec 1 2007,negative,why remake something that was already good
Dec 1 2007,negative,if i could give it less than a 0 i would this movie was supposed to be a horror i laughed through most of it that is the half that i actually watched i mean come on i am sitting there going mmm popcorn would really good right now i think i will go get some anything to get away from this boring non eventful movie if this reflectss the old one ain any wya shape or form i want nothing to do wit it i hate demonic movies anyway and only watched ccause it was the only thing on cable that day it was either this or rosie odonnels weight loss video in chinese i should have clicked on subtitles and watched that instead it would have been far more entertaining and i hear its a bigger hit hahaha
Dec 1 2007,negative,you know when the scary parts are coming just watch for anything red in the movie 
Dec 1 2007,negative,creapy this came out on 6606
Dec 1 2007,negative,mia farrowget the hell out of this movie
Dec 1 2007,negative,the original is much better
Nov 30 2007,positive,ive still never seen the original but the remake i thought was actually pretty good it is a bit slow but a good movie
Nov 30 2007,positive,decent remake i would even go as far to say that there are certain things in this that are better than the original ex the death of kate mia farrows performance was awesome but julia stiless was laughable
Nov 30 2007,negative,as bad as most remakes are it was just plain stupid i was never a fa of the original one but this was just terrible i have never seen worse acting in my life the movie was so boring and im suprised i did not get up and walk out of the theater
Nov 30 2007,negative,literally a shotbyshot remake not necessary
Nov 29 2007,negative,an ok movie im just not a big fan of these types of movies
Nov 29 2007,positive,that kid is freaking psycho
Nov 29 2007,negative,as bad as remakes get  besides halloween and black xmas  id give this 0 stars but it only goes down to 12
Nov 29 2007,negative,the most horrific thing with this unworthy remake is the casting
Nov 29 2007,negative,why did they have to remake the original into this piece of crap
Nov 29 2007,neutral,nothing much i can say about this movie i was watching a complete rehash of the original film including most camera angles dialogue and various other small things that id rather not waste my time getting into   that said and done im very openminded so im not writing this movie totally off nothing in this movie was better than the original imo but i did enjoy the dream sequences which worked well and the visuals was quite well done i must add the boy wasnt as scary looking the two leads werent as convincing i didnt think they worked together at all actually but mia farrow came round and did a very nice turn as the nanny   the music worked well with certain sequences but it didnt give you that horror effect the original did still it was a nice score the supporting cast were average at best still for todays audiences who havent seen the original you might just like this quite a bit as an entertaining horror film but if your looking for a well acted shocking horrorstick to the original
Nov 28 2007,negative,had nothing on the original not scary at all except one time with mia farrow jumping on a car out of nowhere
Nov 28 2007,negative,garbage this terrible deserves no actual review from me
Nov 28 2007,negative,the death scenes were complex and fun to watch but overall neither version of the omen is really impressive
Nov 28 2007,positive,good mia farrow is great the kid is crazy kokos mala kljucava
Nov 28 2007,negative,while pretty faithful to the original i felt this version settled too much in the shock value of quick shots than the slow creeping horror of it all and leiv schreiber couldnt possibly hope to replace the monolithic gregory peck and although julia stiles isnt a bad actress this wasnt a great performance i blame the director
Nov 28 2007,negative,couldnt wear a cross for 10 years after watching the original scary stuff man
Nov 28 2007,negative,not as bad as i expected it to be  but when youre expecting pure dogshit i guess the bar aint set too high
Nov 27 2007,positive,i just dont like the story
Nov 27 2007,positive,i think it did justice to the original
Nov 27 2007,positive,slightly unfairly maligned remake  like psycho just cant see the need though
Nov 27 2007,negative,yikes this one scared me
Nov 27 2007,positive,creepy kid love it
Nov 26 2007,negative,see the original  the little kid in that one is waaaay creepier
Nov 26 2007,positive,a really really good horror film
Nov 26 2007,positive,what a great 80s legend
Nov 26 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still a good movie
Nov 26 2007,negative,this is such a dumb story but this version is better than the first one and scary too  the characters showed more realistic emotion and had more believable reactions than they did in the first one but then again the first one came out of the slew of emotionless movies of the 70s so thats not surprising
Nov 26 2007,negative,they should have picked anybody but julia stiles to play damiens mother her acting was horrendously fake the kid was weird but not creepy enough if youre interested in these films see the original
Nov 26 2007,positive,i think this was a decent remake  it was nice to see mia farrow
Nov 26 2007,negative,when you thought you bought the omen 1976 and start watching and realize its this remake you can only be disappointed well the story is same there are same lines and theres damien but theres nothing new and some remade staff is worse than in original highly unnecessary remake
Nov 26 2007,negative,not as good as the original
Nov 25 2007,negative,one of the funniest most predictable scary movies of all time and not just because i saw the original
Nov 25 2007,negative,why did they remake this movie but they never made a fifth one theres some baby antichrist out there totally unaccounted for
Nov 25 2007,negative,stick with the original
Nov 25 2007,negative,uuuuuugh bloody sacralidge the kid was well too cute and his father well too wooden  i never realised how dam good gregory peck was in the original till i saw this how could they possibly waste so much money making something so lame out of a classic
Nov 25 2007,negative,biggest turd in turdville julia stiles needs to crawl into a hole
Nov 25 2007,negative,forget this one watch the earlier one
Nov 24 2007,negative,meeehh not that good it is proof that julia stiles has no soul seriously just look into her eyes at any given time during the movie mia farrow was flawless
Nov 24 2007,positive,will creep you the fuck out
Nov 24 2007,positive,the omen it was a lot like the original
Nov 24 2007,negative,very disturbing movie of its time at least the original was this is a poor adaptation on a classic horror film
Nov 24 2007,positive,one hell of a remake not as good as the original but thoroughly executed
Nov 24 2007,positive,scary child  say no more
Nov 24 2007,positive,classic horror movie
Nov 24 2007,positive,not a bad remake but it doesnt have the same atmosphere as the original
Nov 24 2007,positive,decent for a remake i guess but it was exactly like the old one which was kinda lame
Nov 24 2007,positive,haha i was talking to callum when i was watching this hes right its pretty scary lol
Nov 23 2007,positive,damienwhat a kid
Nov 23 2007,neutral,succeeded in creeping me right out
Nov 23 2007,positive,it was alright but the kid they chose was too cute to be scary
Nov 23 2007,positive,scary the kid did great good acting scary shots
Nov 23 2007,positive,the omen 2006 i have to say that this movie is pretty good and i have seen the original and its not fucking scary trust me its not its fucking dated and the only thing that was a saving grace was jerry goldsmiths score which ill talk about later and richard donner is not a great fucking director just checkout timeline john moore didnt do much either in the way of directoral work but i liked behind enemy lines and flight of the phenoixbut the reason why i liked this movie so much was probably because liev schreiber and julia stiles are fucking great the movies core is its score by marco beltrami which leans out its head when it wants to scare the living shit out of you but its essentialy a jump scare movie where it says boo and its not as much as i intended but it scared the shit out of meapparently my mom is like the unsinkable molly brown cause she did not move one fucking bit she didnt even fucking flinch but anyways it plays out more like a fun scary adventure which is probably why i liked it so much because it felt more global than the original which is another problem i have with the dated fucking movie the original felt like it was alwas in one fucking place anyways this movie is a giantic improvment over the original but what both the movies have in common is an effective score im kinda split down the middle with the score to the original on one hand it is very effective when in context but when outside of the crappy film its kind of a laughable score at times when the chorus just screams at the top of their lungs ave ave ave hastos christos and it gets a bit annoying but its quiter moments where the chorus is at a listenable volume is where the score shines but its not an easy listen but its still a great effective score that won jerry goldsmith his first oscar but i dont think its fair to compare jerry goldsmith to marco beltramiwho was a student of jerry goldsmiths marco beltrami and jerry goldsmith have two radically different styles and marco does pay homage to jerry goldsmith but he does do his own thing too and thats when his score really shines marco creates these rithmic melodies which will get stuck in your head and since the movie relies on sound alot the score is also played extremly loud although both scores are radically different in sound and its effect towards each movie they are both great scores its a shame that there will not be a trilogy 4 stars
Nov 23 2007,negative,the 1978 original was much better
Nov 22 2007,positive,i saw this bc i like david thewlis the visuals were cool but the movie itself was just okay
Nov 22 2007,positive,creepyass movie and im not even that religious that little boy just does a good job at being freaking eerie

Nov 21 2007,positive,updated script younger leads and few new boos are just about all thats new in this decent remake of the near classic
Nov 21 2007,negative,too much hype for a movie that just doesnt deliver

Nov 21 2007,negative,i hope that this would be the first and the last remake of the original movie
Nov 21 2007,negative,this remake was utter crap watch the original for jerry goldsmiths score and the inventive death scenes
Nov 20 2007,positive,first i must say how it frustrates me when atheists hate these movies by principle i neither believe in god or satan but thats not a good reason to skip these in many ways epic battles between good and evil i find myths of old times and bibles prophecies even though they wouldnt hit close to reality quite interesting    oh the movie it wasnt too bad but somethings missing child creeps me out and so does the female actress not the nanny atmosphere was overally quite fine
Nov 20 2007,positive,not as scary as id expected it to be
Nov 20 2007,negative,i honestly got maybe 45 minutes into this movie and turned it off  the acting was horrendous and not liking the original i found this even more cheezy  not a big fan
Nov 20 2007,positive,the original is way better
Nov 20 2007,positive,a very good remake even though i didnt like some changes they made the kid was scarier than the original demian i thought liev schreibers performance was a little flat julia stiles has always been a mediocre actress but she does what she can the journalist was great but mrs baylock is soso     i liked a lot the vatican scenes but the ones of the cemetary could have been improved the deaths of some characters are really incredible i liked the associations of modern events with biblical prophecies despite its innacuracies    fun
Nov 20 2007,positive,one of the best of its kind cant be remade
Nov 20 2007,neutral,not as good as the original

Nov 19 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its nice to watch a horror flick that doesnt rely on geysers of bloodshed to create tension
Nov 19 2007,positive,in my eyes it acheives its purpose it sets out what it was supposed to do remake the original  that being said though what was the point for the new generation just make them watch the original and stop thinking of the dollar signs
Nov 19 2007,negative,i thought it was boring  but its a remake so i didnt expect that much
Nov 18 2007,negative,i thought this was pretty weak in comparison to the original which is a staple of classic horror to me
Nov 18 2007,negative,nothing new  very heavyhanded with the symbolism  not very scary
Nov 18 2007,negative,its a remake seriously do good remakes exist the special effects slightly improved on the original but they cut some stuff because apparently were a society of overly sensitive douchebags now
Nov 18 2007,negative,saw it at a driveinand laughed hysterically
Nov 18 2007,positive,again just not the original and julia stiles sucks

Nov 18 2007,positive,evil little bastard

Nov 18 2007,negative,another unncessary remake
Nov 18 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still worth a look
Nov 18 2007,negative,the acting suck big time and it wasnt scary wasted an hour of my time
Nov 18 2007,positive,again demented children scare me more then anything
Nov 18 2007,positive,so it came out on 6606 and all but even with its damned release date this movie hardly lived up to my anticipation of an apocalypse  few scary moments but overall not worth the 8
Nov 17 2007,negative,what happens when an extremely talented cast has nothing to do theres a decent jump scare or two but overall its pretty lame
Nov 17 2007,neutral,i liked the original movie better
Nov 17 2007,positive,i saw this on 6606 and was delighted with all the 666 refrences visually hidden in the film
Nov 17 2007,positive,this movie changed my life i love you peter mcevoy
Nov 17 2007,positive,reall thrilling scared of going to the toilet now
Nov 17 2007,negative,creepy a little tense but most of all somewhat boring did not really get into this remake
Nov 17 2007,negative,i fell asleep the first time and the second time was bored i guess some one just had to do a remake to take advantage of the date 6606
Nov 17 2007,neutral,not the same without gregory peck
Nov 16 2007,positive,wonderful just as good as the book
Nov 16 2007,positive,it wasnt bad but being so true to the original made this remake pretty unnecessary even more so than other remakes
Nov 16 2007,neutral,not even close to the classic
Nov 16 2007,positive,decent its nowhere as good as the original one  and i dont think the original one is that greatbut it keeps you entertained 
Nov 16 2007,negative,watched the movie was scary a bit but it gas such an anticlimax it aint funny
Nov 16 2007,positive,i personally love suspense and horror films and this was the perfect mix
Nov 16 2007,positive,the antichrist is there very good
Nov 16 2007,positive,pretty good it was basically word for word the original movie just made to look a little more modern decent horror flick
Nov 16 2007,negative,awful remake of formerly good movie  half a star for the sheer gall to cast julia stiles and expect any believability
Nov 16 2007,negative,youre better off watching the original
Nov 16 2007,negative,horrible remake shit as a rule ive nominated all horror films ith half a star they all suck
Nov 16 2007,negative,im sorry liev i tried but it sucked
Nov 16 2007,positive,i liked the original better  this is almost a frame for frame remake though
Nov 16 2007,negative,poor remake loved the original

Nov 15 2007,negative,i hate you peter mcevoy
Nov 15 2007,negative,horrible as a remake horrible on its own it must have been a joke on set with joke actors and joke plot lines no honestly how did this get made 12 stars for pretty colors

Nov 15 2007,positive,this movie is amazing and the music is crepy
Nov 15 2007,negative,the original was betterthey should have left it alone

Nov 15 2007,positive,i hope he dies at the end of the series
Nov 14 2007,positive,one of the best remakes of all time this movie is on my top 5 scariest movies list
Nov 14 2007,negative,wow i think a blowup doll could be a more believable father than liev schreiber was in this stupid movie
Nov 14 2007,positive,pretty awesome and of course had to see it on 6606
Nov 14 2007,positive,i know im probably going to go to hell for saying this but i laughed through the entire movie i thought it was great and damian was really cute
Nov 14 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Nov 14 2007,negative,this version really suckedif you want to watch the omen see the originali poo poo this one
Nov 14 2007,negative,i was neither impressed or disappointed with this remake i found that it was pretty mediocre
Nov 14 2007,negative,rent the older version
Nov 14 2007,negative,i worked in this one but still
Nov 14 2007,negative,the first omen was the best
Nov 14 2007,negative,slick remake but the script is so ridiculously convoluted that theres no opportunity for suspense to build in the movie the nadir is probably when david thewlis sits down with liev schreiber to lay out his grand biblical exegesis the sea in the poem is politics  it storms and churns just as politics does you see theyve chosen you liev plays the us ambassador to the uk  politics get it well at least mia farrow puts in a creepy cameo here and spoiler alert i did find the devils child ending up in the presidents care amusing
Nov 14 2007,negative,not as good as the original but then again they never are
Nov 13 2007,positive,freiken awesomebut originals are always better
Nov 13 2007,negative,its not scary tho
Nov 13 2007,positive,i saw it twice  the first time my nerves were shot and i sat clutching ashlea and sarah the second was my and rs first date a
Nov 13 2007,positive,didnt like the endingbut not bad
Nov 13 2007,positive,mia farrow gets run over take that woody allens past
Nov 13 2007,positive,this remake was okay not great but not bad either
Nov 13 2007,positive,great castbut nothing like the richard donner directed classic  lets not forget gregory peck
Nov 13 2007,negative,not nearly as good as the original
Nov 13 2007,negative,not as awesome as it could have been let down
Nov 12 2007,negative,no where near as good as the original
Nov 12 2007,negative,mia farrow as the nanny is a big joke too similar to the original
Nov 12 2007,negative,what a terrible unnecessary remake
Nov 12 2007,negative,the kid was perfectbut they ruined it the original was a lot better
Nov 12 2007,negative,this movie is not completeddont take my words for itwhen it reaches the last scene you might say damn i should have listened to jamie
Nov 12 2007,positive,not as good as the original and i had hoped maybe they would have changed the ending a bit
Nov 12 2007,positive,this is a really freaky movie it makes you wonder
Nov 12 2007,positive,faithful remakes defeat the purpose but this is still good the graveyard scene is just as chilling as the original but the fake ass gorillas cant hold a candle to the baboon scene from the old one
Nov 12 2007,positive,not as good as the original an average remake
Nov 12 2007,negative,the worst horror movie ever seen my friends and i went to watch this movie midnite show and expected a really scary movie but we almost fell asleep inside the theater i would recommend the tale of two sisters for those who like horror movies
Nov 12 2007,negative,horrible for all the wrong reasons
Nov 11 2007,positive,good movie actually scary
Nov 11 2007,negative,when there a movie thats supposed to be about the son of satan id at least hope that we could go through more of his life than just his early childhood the potential was definitely there but the execution was a complete flop
Nov 11 2007,positive,very similar to the original good movie
Nov 11 2007,negative,the only talented person in this entire movie was mia farrow  the only thing the director added from the original was the worst possible connotation of style and a possibly unintentional though definitely hilarious homoerotic vibe
Nov 11 2007,positive,children are so freaking scary the classic is the best but this one was pretty good
Nov 11 2007,positive,not too bad as remakes go but would have been better if they had made a  few changes to add a bit of suspense for those who had seen the original version
Nov 11 2007,positive,its not a bad movie but why bother with a remake liev schreiber looks a bit too young to be the us ambassador and julia stiles looks about 12
Nov 11 2007,positive,a movie that was more psychologically scary as hell than actually scary as hell some parts made you jump the creepy dream sequences made the entire movie well cast the devil child was brilliant everything was well crafted and tied together nicely i was not satisfied with the ending although as i understand it the original had three sequels and i can see why
Nov 11 2007,negative,an awful remake its not going to change the classic however this movie only brought a few scary scenes and thats all i dont recommand it
Nov 11 2007,neutral,it wasnt too bad but wasnt scared at all
Nov 11 2007,negative,the original was better
Nov 10 2007,neutral,not as good as the original
Nov 10 2007,negative,i can not believe i sat through that horrible movie i rarely rate below a star but wow that was bad
Nov 10 2007,positive,i havent seen it im sure it is still good anyway
Nov 10 2007,positive,how scary is this film damiendamien look at me this is for you damien
Nov 10 2007,negative,not as good as the original
Nov 10 2007,positive,the original is a lot better
Nov 10 2007,negative,the original was exponentially better
Nov 10 2007,positive,creepy and well done although almost a direct reshoot of the original while leaving out a lot of what made the movie creepy  damien
Nov 10 2007,positive,even though i have seen this when i was 7 i dont remember it much but i remember i actually liked it
Nov 10 2007,positive,this was a decent though unnecessary remake  clever marketing on the release date ie 6606
Nov 10 2007,negative,its ok watch the original
Nov 9 2007,neutral,oh my god its kind of boring not horrible at all
Nov 9 2007,negative,pointless original superb
Nov 9 2007,negative,the older ones better kthx
Nov 9 2007,neutral,it was  alrite  kind of disappointing
Nov 9 2007,positive,i love my horror movies and for methe omen trilogy tops the billnot so reliant on special effectslook up mabus hmmmm
Nov 9 2007,neutral,not as good as what i was hoping
Nov 9 2007,negative,what was the purpose of this movie poor attempt at remaking it  the original damien was much more creepy the music in the 1976 version was more suspenseful the only good thing is the guy who plays robert was a handsome spunk
Nov 9 2007,positive,it wasnt scary  it was as decent movie but i expected a movie about the devil to have something about it that makes you jump
Nov 9 2007,positive,it was okay  would have been better if the dicks in the theatre would have shut up
Nov 9 2007,neutral,when you do a remake youre supposed to bring something totally new to it add to the legacy so to speak  this film tries but falls just a little short of its goal  visually its slick and well done i especially liked the scene involving the death of the photographer  other than that there is very little differance between this movie and the original  the dialogue though not identical is similar enough to be  the pacing is the same as well  other than mia farrow as the evil nanny the characters in this version werent as engaging either  the child however nailed his role perfectly
Nov 8 2007,positive,really scary acutally
Nov 8 2007,negative,it could have been a lot better that kid scared the hell out of me though
Nov 8 2007,positive,there was suspense but not enough the scariest part i thought was the mother left home alone with a demonic child of course that happens everyday across the country
Nov 8 2007,neutral,not as good as expected
Nov 8 2007,positive,i actually prefer this one to the original
Nov 8 2007,positive,almost as good as the original
Nov 8 2007,positive,is pretty frighteningthe gore is good
Nov 8 2007,neutral,no need to remake the classic
Nov 8 2007,negative,yet another pointless remake
Nov 8 2007,negative,ha ha this is a hilarious movie
Nov 8 2007,positive,i was really pretty good i liked it loved the imagry and the dark theme
Nov 8 2007,negative,its pretty good but it has nothing against the original
Nov 8 2007,negative,not nearly as good as the original liev schreiber for gregory peck what were they thinking  the only good part is mia farrow
Nov 8 2007,neutral,scared me a lot haha
Nov 8 2007,positive,probably the number one creepiest film i have ever seen
Nov 8 2007,negative,a successful shotforshot remake of the original so this too is not scary not good in any way terrible
Nov 8 2007,positive,i had heard this was a lot worse than it actually was  of course the original was better when is that ever not the case but this was okay for a remake  my main problems with it were that it kind of looked like a music video at times and julie stiles who im a fan off just looks way too young to have a son damiens age  the acting is fine and its a good story
Nov 7 2007,positive,decent remake of a clasic
Nov 7 2007,positive,the release date was cool 60606 lol but the movie was lame 
Nov 7 2007,positive,a classic of the genre this film was the first great mainstream good versus demonic evil film
Nov 7 2007,negative,its better the original this wasnt even scaryy
Nov 7 2007,positive,too creepy for words
Nov 7 2007,positive,pretty close to the original but you cant beat gregory peck
Nov 7 2007,neutral,the original version is better
Nov 7 2007,positive,not as good as the original but acceptable
Nov 7 2007,negative,oh dear lord  wheres the original when you need it
Nov 7 2007,negative,the only thing that saved it was a most unprecedented decapitation scene
Nov 7 2007,positive,i was expecting it to be truly terrible and it wasnt  it had some very scary moments in it but it could never live up to the original  its not a movie of this time
Nov 7 2007,negative,was ok not the best but decent
Nov 7 2007,negative,the original is loads better
Nov 6 2007,negative,good remake and solid acting introduce satans spawn the vengence the previews promised never happen though
Nov 6 2007,neutral,seriously its exactly the same as the original  and the original wasnt that good
Nov 6 2007,negative,not too good at all great cast but just not too good erm heres a tip for you  dont watch this film
Nov 6 2007,negative,fucking pointless remake  its exactly the same even the dialogue  jesus what do these people think
Nov 5 2007,positive,meh i saw it in theaters and i only bought it cos it was 10 bucks
Nov 5 2007,negative,pointless remake of a great horror original
Nov 5 2007,negative,not as good as the original
Nov 5 2007,negative,honestly there was no point to this remake it lacked everything that the original has come to be known for    horrible and dull acting unemotional directing     seriously go find the original and give this one a pass
Nov 5 2007,negative,i prefer the original much more scary
Nov 5 2007,positive,classic specially the ost
Nov 4 2007,neutral,it didnt have any originality
Nov 4 2007,positive,not very interesting
Nov 4 2007,positive,a wicked classic redone even better
Nov 4 2007,positive,while this movie is far from being a truly bastardized remake of a classic it certainly isnt blockbuster material or even nightmare material for that matter  liev shreiber and david thewlis were great  i just think that if youre going to remake a great movie really put a nice new spin on it and do things a little differently  if i wanted to watch this story be told again id choose the original every time
Nov 4 2007,negative,i wanted this to be goodit wasnt horrible
Nov 4 2007,negative,original wayyyyyy better
Nov 4 2007,positive,original always the best
Nov 4 2007,negative,i thought it was a strange headtrip confusing headache movie
Nov 3 2007,negative,rightfontarialsize2due to the omens subject matter the studio decided to release it on june 6th 2006 666 on the day of its release there was a major dust storm in my town of phoenix arizona the next day a server thunderstorm hit i was forced to fight my way threw the hammering raindrops to reach the theater something tells me that god doesnt want people to see this movie     the omen is a remake the classic horror that was releases nearly thirty years ago after a loss of a child robert thorn takes in an anonymous invent his wife katherine is unaware of her miscarriage so robert claims the child is their own flesh and blood and names him damien little do they know damien is actually the son of the satin it seems like whenever you name a child damien hes bound to become evil    i really enjoyed the first hour of the omen the films started out with some good old fashion scares and many possibilities then the film entered the second half when everything seemed to drag on the film seemed to spend far too much time trying to explain the situation to the main characters however it wasnt that hard for the audience to figure out that this child is evil and needs to be killedsizefont    fontarialsize2my real problem with the omen though was the little boy playing damien the kid tried so hard to act evil with a soft creepy voice and dull personality that he wasnt scary at all i was reminded of a much better psychological thriller entitled the bad seed in the bad seed there was a little girl named rhoda played by patty mccormack a very talented child star in the day the aspect that made little rhoda scary was that she never really tried to act evil she acted as if she were just another wellbehaved girl although she was really a killer     there are things to admire in the omen the film features some nice final destinationlike deaths mia farrow has a fun performance as a crazy nanny with a sludge hammer however the film never quite pays off in the films climax robert discovers a birthmark on damien in the shape of three sixes however didnt he ever consider that they could be three ninessizefont  right
Nov 3 2007,neutral,wasnt as scary as i hoped  i should probably go see the original
Nov 3 2007,neutral,retarded once again  this storywhich may i add is good has been taken over by a corny film  like ahg just so annoying when good stories arent showed well through good movies    i have no idea how people i know were so scaredand screaming through this movie dumb
Nov 3 2007,neutral,i actually found this movcie to be quite boring
Nov 3 2007,neutral,not that bad i kinda like the idea of a horror movie based on the bible and contemporary politics at the same time i didnt see the original though
Nov 3 2007,positive,i havent seen it but it looks good
Nov 3 2007,positive,i love this movie so scary
Nov 3 2007,neutral,if you are reading this my advice is to see the original instead
Nov 3 2007,negative,okay this movie was themoststupidestmovieever    the most stupidest movie ever it was good to see julia stiles in this movie but the movie plot     i will at least give one star rating because the beginning well okay the story was interesting the mother was a jackal the baby wasnt julias she thought it was her real child but its actually the devils child the ending was just stupid this movie is bit complete waste of time for me
Nov 3 2007,negative,its poo but  im in it  as a gorilla

Nov 2 2007,negative,amazing movie dont watch it alone
Nov 2 2007,negative,not as good as the orignal  
Nov 2 2007,negative,you know while the limited release horror market which is only one step away from straight to video is remaking the classics can someone hook me up with a remake of slumber party massacre
Nov 2 2007,negative,i watched this on halloween and it really sucked i like julia stiles she normally chooses good films to make but this one was boring very very boring
Nov 1 2007,positive,the first ones better
Nov 1 2007,negative,why do they continue to remake mediocre movies
Nov 1 2007,negative,it was really boring
Nov 1 2007,negative,one of the crappiest of crappy remakes its not so much bad as it is nearly offensive
Nov 1 2007,positive,the original was better but julia stiles is actually realyl goodwho knew
Nov 1 2007,positive,one of the few truly great horrors
Nov 1 2007,positive,abit jumpy but still good

Nov 1 2007,negative,why bother making a remake of an all ready perfect film
Nov 1 2007,negative,painfully bad seriously it hurts
Nov 1 2007,neutral,not as good as the original
Nov 1 2007,positive,as a remake it got it down visually and it was still haunting but i kept getting the feeling as if the child actor who played damien had been misroled it seemed like he was too cute to play damien although i have to admit he did do a pretty decent job i remember the scene where he was just getting a peanutbutte and jelly sandwich and i was freaking out the only thing that makes this remake low in standard is that it is what it is a remake but however a very decent one worth watching if youve seen the original its pretty much the same only they updated the effects and visuals which in this film will make you jump
Nov 1 2007,negative,this movie was not creepy enough and the plot lacked a point it could have been better
Nov 1 2007,negative,lets put in the color red a lot and hey look its that monster suit from the village
Nov 1 2007,neutral,original is way better
Nov 1 2007,negative,terrible wannabe to the original
Nov 1 2007,negative,please stop flashing crap on screen randomly with loud noises in order to be scary alot of the plot was kind of dumb too i havent seen the original and dont care there was potential as far as devil children go but the execution was stupid
Oct 31 2007,positive,this movie is messed up the birthday party scene is crazy
Oct 31 2007,positive,scary  entertaining
Oct 31 2007,positive,its a decent movie but i really wanna watch the old one

Oct 30 2007,negative,yet another pointless remake
Oct 30 2007,negative,kinda like a high school theatre performance of the original better than the psycho remake thoughwhich doesnt say much
Oct 30 2007,negative,should have kept to the original
Oct 30 2007,positive,not needed remakenot bad though
Oct 30 2007,positive,for the sake that it wasnt all that bad a remake but mainly for the decapitation by sign and humourous moments unintentional throughout
Oct 30 2007,positive,awsome movie to watch after the exorcist
Oct 30 2007,negative,this remake takes all the misteryof the original and makes it obvious its good i wont say it isnt rarely scary but it helps make an analysis of how societys average intelligence has been freefalling for decades like i said its not as awful as those countless horror movies but it substitutes thrills for jumpscares all too often
Oct 30 2007,positive,ekk i remember when this came out
Oct 30 2007,positive,the thing about making remakes is the tricky part of deciding how far to stray from the original if one makes a lot of changes the crowds may complain see italian job but if you stick too close to the original the audience is left with a feeling of âwhat was the pointâ there are very few cases in the past of a remake surpassing or even equalling the original such as john carpenters the thing or the recent texas chainsaw massacre remake managed sadly this film is not one of them refusing to stray too far from richard donnerâs 1976 classic this film merely updates the original to a modern environment slightly increasing the gore factor    the story follows that of a us ambassador whoâs son dies soon after being born and rather than upset his wife agrees to adopt a new born baby whoâs mother died during childbirth telling his wife its their son as the story progresses and the tension mounts we discover that this child is the son of the devil and so the senator embarks on a quest along with a photojournalist who fears his life is in danger to find a way to stop him    unfortunately one of the most powerful parts of the original film jerry goldsmithâs oscar winning score has been replaced by a new far inferior score from composer marco beltrami without goldsmithâs epic choral masterpiece much of the atmosphere is lost    all in all the film adds nothing on the original and loses much of its atmosphere damian feels less evil and even a cast including some of the cream of british acting talent including pete postlethwaite michael gambon and david thewlis cannot save this from being a slightly disappointing affair youâre better off renting the original

Oct 30 2007,positive,this really is very scary  i was able to shout with my friends when we watched it
Oct 30 2007,negative,definitely pale when compared with the original best thing it in was the nanny from hell
Oct 30 2007,positive,this did the original justicemia farrowyeah
Oct 30 2007,negative,stop with the damned remakes
Oct 29 2007,positive,from allmovie fueled by advances in special effects the birth of the midnight movie and a cultural fascination with mysticism the horror genre achieved a status in the 1970s not seen since its glory days of the 1930s of all the occult horror films that surfaced in the wake of 1968s rosemarys baby richard donners phenomenally successful the omen 1976 was the slickest and least subversive derivative but effective the film was gregory pecks boxoffice comeback and it offered a convincing turn from lee remick as well the omen never achieved the cult status of other specimens of the genre but it paved the way for such 1980s bigbudget mystical horror films as the howling 1981 and poltergeist 1982 the films success also ensured more bigscreen projects for donner including the lethal weapon series
Oct 29 2007,negative,remakes often suck especially when they are a carbon copy of the original
Oct 29 2007,negative,hated this movie was freakily stupid
Oct 29 2007,neutral,gregory pecks version was better
Oct 29 2007,negative,needless remake of a classic  this effort lacks the originals creeping dread and even the reworking of the original score seems lacklustre thewlis does stand out as the photographer and his is the best death scene  so an extra star for that
Oct 29 2007,positive,a freaky movie  that kid looks possessed
Oct 29 2007,positive,this was a decent remake of the originalbut nothing beats the absolute creepiness of the original
Oct 29 2007,positive,a remake of the original horror classic of 1976 is a tough job unfortunately this film offers nothing more than the original film has already given us and thats a shamelike why was there 666 on father brennan thigh i am pleased that they did stay true to the origional but a remake without anything new is somewhat pointlessmia farrow strangely enough as mrs baylock does a great job but even that cant save this movie from being a rental
Oct 29 2007,negative,there were a few good parts but the movie was so anticlimactic that it was not worth watching overall
Oct 29 2007,negative,why did they bother making this  david thewlis was good as the photographer but the rest of the cast were poor compared to the 1976 original at the very least this needed a decent score but even that was lacking the recent remakes that i have enjoyed have been those that took the title and concept and used those to come up with an original film the hills have eyes and texas chainsaw massacre this was almost a shot for shot remake and the question remains why
Oct 29 2007,negative,in no way or in any way as good as the original
Oct 28 2007,negative,i liked this movie the first time when it was called  the omen
Oct 28 2007,positive,a great horror movie is hard to find but this was worth the watch
Oct 28 2007,positive,yes i worship this movie okay not literally but this is definitely one of the best remakes i have ever seen julia stiles and liev schreiber are totally believable as a couple did not buy for one second that gregory peck and lee remick would have a child in their 60s  just see this film you will be scared to death about the book of revelations and the antichrist i actually find it all fascinating but the film is just that great
Oct 28 2007,negative,i like the original version better
Oct 28 2007,positive,i watched it on 6606 i prefer the original one
Oct 28 2007,negative,is okgood special effectsbut thats about itthe original is better
Oct 28 2007,negative,usually when a movie is revisited one hopes that perhaps a different director would be able to contribute something to the original this isnt the case here the movie is slightly tuned for the current times but there isnt much here that adds to the original plot or enhances it in anyway why recreate a classic if there isnt anything left to say heck i didnt even find this scary and that was a huge letdown if you havent seen the original please do so before visiting this new revised version its cursed
Oct 28 2007,negative,some parts jumped out at me other times it was just slow but it made me want to compare it to the original i was just glad i didnt have to go home to children after watching this
Oct 28 2007,negative,some parts jumped out at me other times it was just slow but it made me want to compare it to the original i was just glad i didnt have to go home to children after watching this
Oct 28 2007,positive,a very good movie very frightening with a good solid plot
Oct 28 2007,positive,this is the only time i will ever say they made a horror remake that didnt suck  awsome
Oct 28 2007,positive,its good but theres nothing in it to set it apart from he original
Oct 28 2007,neutral,good for a scary movie with a few startling moments but not good when your find yourself laughing through some of the scenes where people die also it was cut a little funny almost like it was fit for tv
Oct 27 2007,positive,it was pretty goodymanaged to make me jump a few times 
Oct 27 2007,positive,scary never saw the first one but this is goooooood

Oct 25 2007,neutral,scary  liked book better
Oct 25 2007,positive,fantsatic performance by liev schrieber and seamus dvey fitzpatrick was creepy too a farely well made remake but it was slow and a little too long which kind of brought it down for me
Oct 25 2007,negative,i guess because i knew what was going to happen i did not really like this movie
Oct 25 2007,positive,if you saw the first one youve seen this
Oct 25 2007,negative,definitely should have been left to the originalthe first kid was better
Oct 25 2007,positive,just as good as the original

Oct 25 2007,positive,the only highlight until his head is no more is david thewlis

Oct 24 2007,negative,not that great of a remake
Oct 24 2007,positive,much less good than the original  where is the dread  the creepiness is not here
Oct 24 2007,negative,ending sucked it was disappointing
Oct 24 2007,negative,nothing special didnt see the original
Oct 24 2007,positive,pretty sure dominik should have been named damion
Oct 24 2007,negative,i was dissapoited with this remake there was no new material or modern updates i wish film makers have an imaginationbut if they did they would be making new films i suppose
Oct 24 2007,negative,boo and not the scary kind of boo but the kind youd give to elementary school presentations of society didnt dictate that you applaud
Oct 24 2007,positive,creepy conceptwell spun tale
Oct 24 2007,positive,prferred the original
Oct 24 2007,negative,bad remake the original will send chills down your spine this made me fall asleep and dream about the original
Oct 24 2007,negative,another fucking useless terrible remake they need to stop remaking perfect classics
Oct 23 2007,positive,great and loving homage to the original with great score by marco beltrami
Oct 23 2007,negative,so close to the original in tone and style right down to liev schreibers gregory peck voice that one wonders why remake it at all
Oct 23 2007,positive,the original is much more creepy but mia farrow was good
Oct 23 2007,negative,bad bad remake its so bad you wanna slap everyone that stared in it including the impressive mia farrow
Oct 23 2007,positive,original was way better
Oct 23 2007,positive,scares the crap outta me
Oct 23 2007,neutral,forgettable watch the original 4 movies of the series not this awful remake
Oct 23 2007,positive,this movie was pretty good and it scared my friends to death he he deathomen lol
Oct 23 2007,positive,okay original is okay to i dont know i saw it on 666 i think  maybe that was the only reason i was excited to see it
Oct 23 2007,neutral,this remake was okay
Oct 23 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Oct 23 2007,negative,hands down horrible as well
Oct 23 2007,positive,if i could sleep with liev schreiber then i too would put up with having the son of satan  he is gorgeous  this is a very good remake and i was impressed which is unheard of
Oct 23 2007,positive,fear not little one i am here to protect thee
Oct 23 2007,negative,made the other omen movies look horrible
Oct 23 2007,positive,want to see the original now
Oct 23 2007,positive,original was better but still good
Oct 23 2007,negative,not a patch on the first but its got some pretty gorgeous cinematography going on
Oct 22 2007,negative,for what its worth the original is fantastic
Oct 22 2007,negative,pointless see the original
Oct 22 2007,neutral,it was alrite nothing special
Oct 22 2007,positive,i would hate to meet this child actor irl seriously hes scary looking
Oct 22 2007,positive,dude this thing was fucking scary
Oct 22 2007,neutral,id heard so many bad things about this remake and while i didnt think it was outrageously bad i found it far from good  it was basically the same as the original except with different actors and now they have cell phones and computers  i find it entirely pointless when people feel a need to remake movies that arent even that old and dont do anything new with them  best thing about this remake  the kid was freakin creepy as hell  watch it just for that
Oct 21 2007,negative,tis one is crap i wanna watch the original
Oct 21 2007,neutral,the original is so much better
Oct 21 2007,positive,not as scary as it looked
Oct 21 2007,negative,absolute rubbish see the original
Oct 21 2007,positive,i really liked this movie  the only part i found scary is when she was looking in the mirror and that thing appeared that scared the hell out of me 
Oct 21 2007,positive,though far from being a bad film it is proficiently directed and acted the omen remake seems a little pointless it is almost too faithful a remake scenes occasionally seem like identikit versions of the classic original and end up doing nothing but remind the audience just how perfect the original was a film that is destined to merely sit in the shadows of its predecessor  if you liked the original youll most likely feel the same way and if youve yet to watch the original then go and watch that instead another prime example of a pointless exercise  why does hollywood insist on remaking classic films that were already good enough lets have more original ideas please
Oct 21 2007,negative,omg stop remaking perfectly good horrors
Oct 21 2007,neutral,the original just pisses all over this bland and pointless remake   but it does have its moments mia farrow is great as mrs baylock  a much more subtle and insinuating performance compared to billie whitelaws outrageous histrionics and although lee remmicks dramatic demise was truly terrifying in the original forever so ingrained in my subconscious that i can never pull a shirt off over my head without seeing billie whitelaws menacing visage the murder by lethal injection is truly horrific because of its quiet terror  rather like a tarantula creeping beneath the sheets  apart from that its pretty much a pale copy of the original camp classic
Oct 21 2007,negative,rubbish in tha house
Oct 21 2007,positive,actually an okay remake  made me realize that omen backwards is nemo  interpret it as you will
Oct 21 2007,negative,the remake sucks huge two stars was generous
Oct 20 2007,neutral,why bother this was pretty much exactly the same as the original
Oct 20 2007,positive,eh it wasnt too bad even though there were some horrible shots especially toward the end
Oct 20 2007,neutral,remake is not so good the only part i liked was where they dug up the mom and it was a dog other than that the original is better
Oct 20 2007,positive,reminds me of my old neighbor k
Oct 20 2007,negative,the only good thing about this movie is that julia stiles dies
Oct 20 2007,neutral,julia stiles looks like a cat scary kid
Oct 20 2007,positive,actually not that bad
Oct 20 2007,positive,not as good as original but still a great movie
Oct 20 2007,positive,it was entertaining to say the least
Oct 20 2007,negative,weak compared to the original
Oct 20 2007,negative,has a really nice look to it sticks largly to the original but then why bother to make it
Oct 19 2007,neutral,i really wanted to like this film and i thought they had something too bad it was the same movie gregory peck did in 76 the use of the color red was a nice addition but the only good one
Oct 19 2007,negative,chilling and creepy in the beginning yet instantly forgettable
Oct 19 2007,negative,straight out did not like it  not a good movie
Oct 19 2007,positive,really creepy but i liked it
Oct 19 2007,positive,not the best but far from the worst
Oct 19 2007,negative,wots wrong with the original clerly nothing as they copied every scene from it
Oct 18 2007,positive,very good not as good as the first omen ever made still good julia stiles is awesome
Oct 18 2007,positive,the same as the original only no gregory peck or exdoctor whos as priests
Oct 18 2007,negative,it wasnt as good as it seemed it would be
Oct 18 2007,negative,watch the original one this one sucked asshole
Oct 18 2007,negative,it isnt a bad film but it nearly pales in comparison to the original i remember feeling disturbed after watching the original many years back     liev schreiber is a fine actor but hes no gregory peck the musical score in the remake doesnt sound as boneâchilling as the original the dreams that the lead characters had carry creepy images without any sound effects still the remake isnt evil enough unlike the original
Oct 18 2007,positive,even though this is a remake it is still much better than the original  while the original features a kid with no eyebrows who looks like he has an earache every time he sets hell loose this remake has a kid who is adorable before he pulls your heart from your chest  the acting pulls you into the mystery surrounding this kid and the performances of liev schreiber julia stiles and pete postlethwaite bring the intensity up like four levels  the movie is creepy but i missed the glass pane decapitation
Oct 18 2007,positive,most of this movie i was looking through my fingers scary as hell but it did come out on my birthday
Oct 18 2007,positive,this  remake   hasnt  got what the  first  one had  but still one to  see
Oct 17 2007,negative,one of the only films to ever give me nightmares
Oct 17 2007,positive,go see the original with gregory peck and mauling dogs
Oct 17 2007,positive,a very worthy remake of an awesome movie though of course not as good as the original the decapitation part was the sweetest thing ever its all for you damien
Oct 17 2007,positive,scary as all get out
Oct 17 2007,neutral,original is always better
Oct 17 2007,positive,a remake thats very true to the original they dont exactly do anything worse than the original film though it probably could have set a better mood with a scarier score there is one thing they do better here and thats the dogs the originals dogs just didnt feel right but these guys got it right
Oct 17 2007,neutral,meh not scary at all
Oct 17 2007,negative,two stars is being really kind too
Oct 17 2007,negative,a very very bad remake
Oct 17 2007,positive,not that scary but yeah im gonna tell what happens all i will say is that the boy is evil he kills everyoneee
Oct 17 2007,positive,the new omen was very good i really liked it because it wasnt really startle scare scary it was psycholocily scary something i have never exeperience before
Oct 17 2007,positive,surprisingly good remake
Oct 17 2007,negative,i found myself laughing a lot actually     the child who played damien was far too cute to be the son of satan i thought  and julia stiles julia stiles is a worthless actress if she isnt in a shakespeare teenswindling remake     however the scenes where the nanny jumps the photographer is picking up the swords the priest is running onto holy grounds were all filmed really well overall it was filmed well i guess    liev schreiber was the best part of this movie and he wasnt that great bottom line    boring
Oct 17 2007,negative,pretty crappy update of a monvie that wasnt all that good to begin with
Oct 17 2007,negative,id find a grandmother doing a tap dance scarier than this
Oct 17 2007,positive,watch out for that kid oh and come on 2006 06 06 when researchers are saying that it is supposed to be 616 instead d
Oct 17 2007,positive,mint film i enjoyed watching it
Oct 16 2007,negative,they dont get much wrong they dont change much but still just rent the original when they got it right
Oct 16 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still enough to send a chill up your spine
Oct 16 2007,positive,look out for that pane of glass david warner ouch
Oct 16 2007,positive,well  for julia stiles 
Oct 16 2007,negative,give me the original
Oct 16 2007,positive,this scared me in a way  i dont know why but it did
Oct 16 2007,neutral,i saw this strannge
Oct 16 2007,positive,it was ok not as good as i thought it would be
Oct 16 2007,negative,the first one was great this one was butchered by julia stiles
Oct 16 2007,positive,definitely not as good as the original the boy in this one wasnt as scary and this movie seemed to drag a bit
Oct 16 2007,positive,one of the better remakes ive seen ill give it 2 thumbs up
Oct 16 2007,positive,this like the original was okay
Oct 16 2007,positive,decent remake of a sweet classic including a lot of people i enjoy doesnt do enough to revitalize the original  when they say remake they mean an exact replica julia stiles could die and i wouldnt notice though liev schreiber bitches
Oct 16 2007,positive,i like the original better
Oct 15 2007,negative,bad bad remake now go and sit in the corner
Oct 15 2007,positive,this movie is a decent remake the best improvement is that the mom played by julia stiles has a more important role in the original she played a wide eyed mom and that was about it julia stiles gave more depth to the character
Oct 15 2007,neutral,watch the original okay julia stiles is good and all and i love david thewlis but they do not match gregory peck they just dont the original is so amazing
Oct 15 2007,positive,there were some insane death scenes but i seemed to miss the storry im going to have to rewach it
Oct 15 2007,positive,ive met seamus daveyfitzpatrick and he is terrifying
Oct 15 2007,neutral,i liked the original was very creepd out by it this new one i bought it on dvd and watched it once me no likey so much
Oct 15 2007,negative,not a patch on the original
Oct 15 2007,negative,scary but ultimately stupid film that abuses the book of revelation missing its most fundamental point
Oct 15 2007,positive,i like liev schreiber   pretty much indentical to original but enjoybale none the less bast part was seeing it in teh cinema with my mate and she got a fright and jumped a mile in her seat and started screaming while i laughedsuperlolz
Oct 15 2007,negative,original was waayyy better 
Oct 15 2007,neutral,pointless remake of the 1976 original in which almost every scene is exactly the same damien 20 isnt as creepy and liev schrieber just doesnt have the same screen prescence as gregory peck despite this as a standalone film it does the job but i really dont see the point in remaking or rebooting a filmfranchise without bringing something fresh and new to the screen
Oct 15 2007,negative,at least there was a guy getting impaled and chopped into 3 pieces
Oct 14 2007,positive,wordforword remake of the originalthe only reason to see this is because liev schreiber is the fucking man  it gets 4 because it stays so close to the original
Oct 14 2007,negative,the original was a classic 70s movie that was well directed and acted this is the opposite
Oct 14 2007,positive,not very scary but good
Oct 14 2007,neutral,not like the original but ok
Oct 14 2007,negative,pass but it starts off with promise
Oct 14 2007,negative,this movie had promise but dissappointed

Oct 14 2007,negative,poo watch the original and be truly scared
Oct 14 2007,negative,all of the omen movies are the same
Oct 14 2007,negative,gag me i think it could have been a good movie because the kid was absolutely horrifying and it had a good plot but they didnt do anything with it so it sucked ass
Oct 13 2007,negative,didnt reloaded the creepiness of the originalyawn
Oct 13 2007,negative,i couldnt even summon the effort it would have taken to hate this movie  thats how much i didnt care  yet another completely unnecessary remakemaybe this is actually a sign of the apocalypse
Oct 13 2007,neutral,ive never seen the orginal movie but this one made me uneasynot to spoil but watch out for the bday scenevery creepy

Oct 11 2007,positive,not as scary as i would ahve hoped
Oct 11 2007,negative,i havent seen the original movie version of the omen but if it was anything like this one i dont think that i want to this film was dull with absolutely no scares the characters were lame the script was anything but interesting and the ending was upsetting i hated this movie
Oct 11 2007,positive,solid remake with a great score but an implausible showdown
Oct 11 2007,positive,so glad when he runs that bitch of a nanny over good film havent seen the original tho and people do say its much better
Oct 11 2007,negative,it seemed to be lacking something possibly because it is a remake ill have to go watch the original i think

Oct 10 2007,positive,the original was much better
Oct 10 2007,negative,junkim actually a fan of liev  check out his directorial masterpiece everything is illuminated
Oct 10 2007,positive,watch this for the decapitation scene
Oct 10 2007,negative,boy i thought this was lame given its cast i thought maybe there might be something there but the kid looks more annoyed than anything schreiber seems to be sleepwalking and oddly emotionless given what hes going through and stiles looks too young for the part  it looks like she gave birth to this kid at 15 not particularly scary or even dramatic it gets half a star for a pretty cool beheading other than that the original is imho far superior
Oct 10 2007,positive,good remake pretty much word for word
Oct 10 2007,negative,te original was scarier
Oct 10 2007,negative,only made use of the release date might as well stick to the original
Oct 10 2007,positive,this movie made me mad but it was good thu wierd
Oct 10 2007,negative,the original was creepier darker and just plain better
Oct 9 2007,positive,this was ok but the original was better
Oct 9 2007,positive,i thought this remake wasnt that bad but an obvious cash in due to the cinema release date  i think they should have digitally restored the original for theatres instead  i thought the dream sequences were ok but looked totally out of place  i like julia stiles as an actress but was wrongly cast as kate due to her age  marco beltrami did a reasonable job with the score but not a patch on jerry goldsmiths oscar winning soundtrack  the original was by far the best of the 5 films
Oct 9 2007,positive,i love these kinds of movies
Oct 9 2007,positive,was an interesting story line but the ending was pretty cheesy and well i like julia stiles
Oct 9 2007,positive,great movie for those into prophcys and catholosism book version was better though
Oct 9 2007,positive,omg i  scary movies  and this one is off the hook  lol
Oct 9 2007,positive,nothing on the original extremely disapointing  but to be fair not the worst attempt ive seen
Oct 9 2007,negative,these movies are super fucked up i dont know why i watch this
Oct 9 2007,negative,haha this was soooo stupid  and then again so impractical  there wasnt a moment in the movie where i felt scared probably because the creators of the film failed to involve the audience or use a writing stratedy called character development
Oct 9 2007,positive,if you love the original you will be happy with this remake it is loyal and builds on missed opportunities such as the dream sequences i did not care much for julia stiles however
Oct 9 2007,positive,that kid was freaky looking and evil
Oct 9 2007,neutral,prefer the original
Oct 9 2007,neutral,a competent remake  the kid is suitably creepy
Oct 9 2007,negative,not as good as the original
Oct 9 2007,positive,was quite good lots of dogs in it and i got attacked by one walking home freaky kid
Oct 8 2007,positive,weird creepiness but this movie
Oct 8 2007,positive,actually not a bad remake i was impressed still doesnt compare to the original but not bad at all

Oct 8 2007,positive,i like when the evil animals came out
Oct 8 2007,negative,lame lame lame lame lame stick with the 76
Oct 8 2007,positive,old version was scarier
Oct 8 2007,positive,well there are some really bad acting scenes within this movie but overall its a good movie  it seemed like final destination at points thoughim intrigued to see the original now to compare and contrast
Oct 8 2007,negative,the original is way better
Oct 8 2007,negative,pretty poor remake  the kid was scarey but it lacked any real scares or tension
Oct 8 2007,positive,i actually thought this was one of the most superb remakes ive ever seen now considering two nights befgore i watched the remake of the fog and almost smashed my screen in protest at how utterly dire it was you start to realise that i am in fact a harsh critic but this film stayed true to the original and it delivered very well pacing was excellent and the scares remained more psychological  as they should we didnt need some gory reinvension of this movie    the parts that were violent weredone to the right level for modern audiences because frankly if seeing a man get brutally decapitated in front of your eyes is not shocking enough you have some serious mental issues to address      all in all a great film great cast and made far creepier by the more sophisticated modern direction
Oct 7 2007,positive,i think i went the same day they released it 666 i thought something creepy was gonna happen got my hopes up for nothing
Oct 7 2007,negative,i was deeply disappointed in this remake the built up hype may have played a part in the letdown however that was not the only factor i must say mia farrow cast as the nanny was a nice pick as she is a familiar face to the horror genre sadly i must say though julia stiles was not the correct choice as the mother she was in my opinion inexperienced for this kind of hypedup film her acting in this movie was of a novice another aspect that let me down was the zoo scene as in the original the mother and son drive through a safarilike zoo and their car is attacked by monkeys i was on the edge of my seat in this remake to see what the director had up his sleeve to make this scene even more terrifying to my dismay all the gorilla did was make a crack in the glass cage and the scene was abruptly cut to the next this is where i threw in the towel this movie was nothing more than a cheap thrill i will say to end on a positive note that the cinematography was phenomonal  i was very impressed by the vivid red objects in each scene and how the lighting captured the essence of it
Oct 7 2007,negative,the old one is the best i was so disappointed with this one
Oct 7 2007,positive,666 is a incorrect number is sopust to be 999 but i just dont care the movie is good but not that scarybut its so close to the truth
Oct 7 2007,negative,its so awful but i went for liev he needs to make better movies for my sake if not for his career

Oct 6 2007,positive,genuinely spooked me at parts
Oct 6 2007,positive,a decent horror i havent seen the original thought ive heard its better i had high expectations due to word of mouth and it wasnt anything special so i was let down
Oct 6 2007,negative,once again 12 hour in and had to turn it off from fear
Oct 6 2007,positive,well made but too akin to the original i was expecting more surprises
Oct 6 2007,positive,very creepy i cant say i recall watching the original in full but i did think this was pretty good for a remake the kid was certainly well cast that smug grin at the end made me shudder david thewlis character had the best death scene ive seen for ages blimey o0
Oct 6 2007,negative,i hate movies based on religion and i hate suspensehorror movies do i need to say anything else
Oct 6 2007,negative,original is far better
Oct 6 2007,positive,pretty good shitty ending   lesson dont fuck a jackal
Oct 5 2007,positive,a good remake of a great movie
Oct 5 2007,positive,lol devil not scary but good to the original
Oct 5 2007,positive,666 is a incorrect number is sopust to be 999 but i just dont care the movie is good but not that scary

Oct 4 2007,negative,how could they do this to one of my faves
Oct 4 2007,positive,not as good as the original although julia stiles liev schreiber and david thewlis are amazing actors

Oct 4 2007,positive,evil rears its ugly headdamn and nearly wins close shave some heart stopping moments
Oct 4 2007,negative,not as good as the originalthey could have changed some parts instead of replicating it
Oct 4 2007,negative,completely pointless and the laughable attempts at style do not add to the fear or suspense this is honestly pretty boring without any invention the kids forced to make grumpy face for the entire runtime while julia stiles pretends to have emotion poor mia farrow too who despite being well cast doesnt even get a showcase scene there is no mood or intellect here even though it strives to match the original
Oct 4 2007,positive,this remake was excellent
Oct 4 2007,positive,better than i yhought it was gonna be

Oct 2 2007,negative,best part was the sandwich knife
Oct 2 2007,negative,this was really disappointing i have not seen the origional but i dare say that is better than this bumbling mess there is no fear to be had here other than that of a wasted cinema or dvd fare
Oct 2 2007,positive,still gives me chills thinking about watching ppl hang and watching ppl get their head cut off ew creepy
Oct 2 2007,neutral,wasnt as scary as the original
Oct 2 2007,positive,there definitely was a creepy vibe the whole movie but the commitment to the plot points took most of the horroraction away

Sep 30 2007,neutral,a professional remake theres nothing really wrong with this movie the pace is good the effects are convincing and the acting works fine except for julia stiles who is clearly out of her element and fails to convey the required love for her son or the subsequent fear and selfdoubt its sad that it all comes together in such a mediocre way there isnt any fear factor and the sense of imminent danger just isnt there frankly everybody is ludicrously blind to the obvious creepiness of the nanny and damien theres nothing really wrong with this movie there are just better movies of the genre out there    and i found the whole plot ridiculously focused on america
Sep 29 2007,negative,creepy stuff but still dumb
Sep 29 2007,negative,god cant save you scary i hate scary movies

Sep 26 2007,positive,i loved this filmvery good supernatural thriller
Sep 26 2007,positive,this kid needs a good beating
Sep 26 2007,neutral,in fairness the omen would probably deserve a 3 12 or four star rating if it wasnt a remake of a nearperfect film not quite the shot for shot remake that psycho was subjected to but the script is almost verbatim the original     the integration of the red motif from dont look now didnt do it any additional favours
Sep 26 2007,negative,just wasnt that scary
Sep 26 2007,neutral,not having seen the original i cannot comment on which is the better of the two but i do think this remake was credible liev schreiber did a great job as robert thorn and added a lot of emotion to his character personally i dont believe seamus daveyfitzpatrick made a good damien as he didnt seem evil enough all in all some great sets and a few final destination style deaths made this quite enjoyable
Sep 26 2007,positive,decent enough and entertaining but not as scary as the original but good enough to make me seek the 1976 version out again
Sep 25 2007,negative,worse than the original  put julie stiles back in teen movies

Sep 23 2007,negative,lame this movie was a waste of time not scary not thought provoking just pathetic
Sep 23 2007,neutral,the original was better
Sep 23 2007,negative,this does have better production value than the average horror movie the cinematography looks good a lot of the editing isnt bad and lieve schreiber and pete postlethwaite are a definite step up from uh whoever was in that crappy texas chainsaw massacre remake there are 2 major problems however which prevented this movie from succeeding one is that the little kid was almost too cute for me to root against even if he is meant to be the spawn of satan for some reason every time he was about to beget another atrocity upon his unsuspecting parents the result felt less like a taut horror thriller and more like a tweety bird cartoon more importantly however this movie fails because it is long and boring very long very very boring at one point near the end 2 characters find something unsettling in a cemetary and the soundtrack shrieks in typical horror fashion this was the one part of the movie where i actually became startled unfortunately i hadnt been startled by the plot twist but by the fact that the sudden noise had jolted me right as i was about to fall asleep
Sep 23 2007,negative,boring not scary at all i thought it was a horror but it ended up being a drama that was too slow  too long
Sep 23 2007,positive,havent seen the original it has some good moments when you got quite scaredsurprised overall it was pretty good but i miss the little extra
Sep 23 2007,negative,creepy little devil child i thought children were bad enough thanks
Sep 22 2007,negative,this was really boring creepy acting little boys dont really scare me
Sep 22 2007,negative,why   why remake a classic  is hollywood running out of ideas  something that should have never been made  poor and very very unscary  if you want to see the omen watch the original as in the remake you dont care about any of the characters and the way they are dispatched has no shocks or scares   avoid and watch the original
Sep 22 2007,positive,i havent seen teh original but i thought this one was great
Sep 22 2007,negative,the original was better
Sep 22 2007,neutral,an interesting film but not as good as it could have been whoever thought julia stiles could play a mother should be fired

Sep 22 2007,positive,entertaining but not much else
Sep 21 2007,negative,i forgot how much i hate this movie until it asked me to rate it how much red can one person randomly throw in one movie the acting was horrible and it didnt even show people what they needed to know at the end  stupidstupidstupidstupidstupiddddd movie
Sep 21 2007,negative,wack i mean the original was great but like all remakes they just dont compare

Sep 21 2007,positive,one of the only movies that i can honestly say made me feel nervous driving home
Sep 21 2007,negative,hands down julia stiles wins the award for worst acting in a horror film ever eeever  how could you damage a movie like that julia i almost want to applaud you if you just werent so bad
Sep 21 2007,positive,haha i was freaked when i watched this scary crap
Sep 21 2007,positive,im a huge fan of the original omen trilogy and this pretty much tries to copy the original film scene for scene but adds a few unnecessary jolts for effect its not that the film is bad just that it really didnt need to be made because the original still holds up just fine
Sep 21 2007,negative,so bad i cried laughing i dont know whether to give it a half of a star or five
Sep 21 2007,positive,great horror movie one of the original movies made about satan having a son on earth

Sep 21 2007,negative,mia farrow was crazy scary in this one the rest of the cast and the movie itselfblah it doesnt even come close to the original i liked the 666 marketing blitz though
Sep 21 2007,negative,julia stiles is the only woman that i consider uglier than julia roberts that there gives this movie a low rating but the fact that its pretty much the exact same damn thing as the original how unoriginal
Sep 20 2007,negative,the major delemma with this movie is that while interesting it just didnt live up to its source material the original even with better graphics

Sep 15 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still very well made
Sep 15 2007,negative,they use the same script and in many cases the same shots  so you really end up with a 75 exact copy of the original with  flashier editing and slightly bloodier deaths  there are some good actors here and some interesting use of color but its  really a bland unecessary attempt to cash in on the 6606 release date  20th century fox youre so clever

Sep 11 2007,positive,pretty much what i expected  a movie about the antichrist but wasnt expecting the ending though still just an okay movie  great performances from thewlis schreiber and short perf by gambon  but still just okay
Sep 11 2007,negative,awful in every respect slavishly remakes the omen only adding some idiotic scenes with vatican officials and a slideshow and a watch flashing 706 before an accident subtle isnt it sporadically funny when it isnt content to be dumb
Sep 11 2007,positive,this is seriously creepy and disturbing

Sep 9 2007,positive,best julia stiles death ever love the old omen and the new ones i hope will stay this good
Sep 9 2007,negative,a remake that delivered nothing new and therefore was quite unnecessary  its not bad its just that the original did it first and better

Sep 8 2007,positive,scared me when i was younger
Sep 8 2007,positive,def better than the new one they did
Sep 8 2007,neutral,this movie was just alright by my standards

Sep 7 2007,neutral,woah freakythe original one was better
Sep 7 2007,negative,the only reason why this movie deserves a star is cuz they featured a rottie and everyone knows how devoted i am to that breed
Sep 7 2007,negative,oh man fear the power of promotion gimmick using the release date as its promotion gimmick to draw audience into the cinema the omen is nothing but a slow and boring movie with a dramatically dull script cheap scare tactics and a bunch of cast whose name you cant even pronounce
Sep 6 2007,negative,one of the best casted wastes of my time that i have ever sat through  the acting is solid as a good heavy chuck of concrete but honestly i found all of the supposed twists and turns coming as if there had been a big yellow street sign a block ahead of them warning me  only the central protagonist ever reacts logically to anything letting doubt and concience guide him right up until the shit ending where he is dead the boy lives and then the kid ominously pun intended breaks the 4th wall  oh and the stupid power point presentation given at the begining to spell out the end of days was stupid im fairly certain a priest gives one of those every thursday anyway cause really what else do they do at the vatican aside from investigate miracles and cover up sex crimes
Sep 6 2007,negative,gave up after about 20 minutes
Sep 6 2007,negative,the only reason the movie was made was so they could release it on 6606 and after you watch it you will wish theyd never made it watch the original and actually be scared as opposed to annoyed

Sep 5 2007,positive,i really liked this the kid is mad scary i thought t stood up against the original even though i would also choose to watch that instead
Sep 5 2007,neutral,soso remake i think julia stiles should stick to what she does best shakespeare
Sep 5 2007,positive,the first one was ok and this one is good but i just wish the kid was a little better at acting in stead of playing up that creepy makeup otherwise the storyline is great
Sep 5 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still a good movie
Sep 4 2007,positive,have not seen the original but this movie was pretty freaky
Sep 4 2007,negative,10 to see this tripe barely worth 666

Sep 4 2007,positive,i thought the movie was funny at points
Sep 4 2007,positive,this is a watchable movie   its entertaining enough if not slightly boring in places although a bit creepy its not a great horror  its worth a watch just to watch thewlis and schriber
Sep 4 2007,negative,sucks big time when compared to the original
Sep 4 2007,positive,the kid in the old one is creepier but the deaths are just as good  that priests death gets me every time
Sep 4 2007,positive,not a scary as the original then again i was like ten when i saw it
Sep 3 2007,positive,the modern aesthetic within the thriller genre could use a pipinghot injection of hitchcock  the original omen freaked me out this one barely made me use my imagination  and thus did not make my senses tingle  high marks for david thewlis though since he is always awesome
Sep 3 2007,positive,not nearly as good as the original but still a nice attempt  you cant beat gregory peck
Sep 3 2007,positive,only has a few deviations from the original other remakes should learn from this movie
Sep 3 2007,negative,why why why    and fucking casting julia stiles

Sep 2 2007,negative,dumb dumb dumb  julia stiles needs to fall down the stairs and die a few more times to garner another half star
Sep 2 2007,negative,most pointless film ever at least try and do something different or original shot for shot remakes are boring
Sep 2 2007,positive,it wasnt hyper scary but it scared me in the way that it communicated pure evil which won in the end

Sep 2 2007,positive,good film that brings the original uptodate
Sep 2 2007,neutral,you would think that when the villian is the son of the devil that the movie would be a little more scary
Sep 2 2007,positive,thought this was better than the original
Sep 2 2007,negative,original was better
Sep 2 2007,negative,not as good as the original but the original to me isnt exactly scary because its a pretty old movie and the acting is still amateur here its exactly the same as the original but the acting isnt as good as i expected it to be
Sep 2 2007,negative,a chilling serious intelligent horror story with strong sense of urgency oh wait that was the original
Sep 2 2007,negative,that child and this movie should both have been aborted

Sep 1 2007,positive,creepy looking kid
Sep 1 2007,negative,they killed another classic
Sep 1 2007,positive, a brilliant remake which nearly surpasses the original the film was really disturbing and scary seamus daveyfitzpatrick delievers a really top notch and scary performance as satans son mia farrow delievers also a terrific performance a faithful remake of the 1976 film and thats a relief it depends on characters and situations and doesnt go berserk with visuals director john moore has added some creepy visuals and assembled an unusually strong cast for a horror flick the omen remake is creepily efficient unlike one of the newfangled horrorfests it doesnt drown you in brackish atmosphere and surroundsound you with techno music     verdict full price  second highest rating in the system positive to mixed reaction this is a rating to a movie i view as very entertaining and well made and definitely worth paying the full price at a theater to see or own on dvd it is not perfect but it is definitely excellent

Aug 31 2007,negative,oh my god this was bad
Aug 31 2007,negative,how can a movie based entirely on a gimmick release date 6606 be any good  oh yeah because its a remake of a classic
Aug 31 2007,negative,it sucks  thats the one way to say it  they almost copied the old classic note for note and ruined most of it in the process  it just has no creep factor like the old one its lacking gregory peck even though liev schreiber is pure power and julia stiles has no personality in it which is a shame since shes so damn cute
Aug 31 2007,negative,i really hope the original didnt suck as much as this scary movies dont work well when they spend more time on the shallow plot and character development than on trying to scare you i like how it turned into an action movie at the end though
Aug 31 2007,neutral,why remake a classic
Aug 31 2007,positive,i would have smacked the evil out of that little bastard
Aug 31 2007,neutral,fairly standard horror fare but there were some interesting deaths towards the end
Aug 31 2007,negative,differs in some plot points and methods of killing characters from the original and tries to keep its creepiness level up but couldnt keep my interest
Aug 31 2007,negative,errrr no it was pants
Aug 31 2007,positive,another year another remake on what is deemed as a classic horror film while the film contains many of the originals good points it doesnt bring anything new to the table apart from looking polished and the special effects being more uptodate the acting is ok farrow is the best thing about this film giving the much needed menace to the film the biggest disappointment though is the child himself unfortunately daveyfitzpatrick cannot touch the performance of the original damian played by harvey stephens hes more like a child who has done something naughty like raiding the cookie jar rather than giving off the aura that he is the son of the devil a remake which has a few redeeming qualities but not enough to push the original out of sight
Aug 30 2007,negative,rent the original seriously pointless remake
Aug 30 2007,negative,it is like taking a big poop on the original  walked out of the theatre
Aug 30 2007,negative,not nearly as good as older omens

Aug 30 2007,neutral,a bad remke fuck julia stiles bad acting  but the theme is the same and you can not argue that it is a great story
Aug 30 2007,positive,img  this was way better than i thought it would be i cant wait for the next one
Aug 30 2007,positive,creepy movie fun to watch with friends
Aug 30 2007,positive,i didnt see the original so dont be to harsh while scary at parts it tends to drag plus the ending pissed me off

Aug 29 2007,positive,very scary i watched this movie once n for awhile i started seeing blackdogs n freaking out  not for the faint of heart 
Aug 29 2007,negative,omg this was the funnest movie it wasnt even scary at all i was laughing the entire time
Aug 29 2007,neutral,its is neither fantastic nor sucky it is just okay julia stiles was probably not the right choice for the role of damians mother since the only thing she can act as is a sassy teenager it was creepy though and the end will make you think
Aug 29 2007,negative,this movie was absolutely pathetic  i remember watching this in the theater and someone in the audience remarked that liev schreiber had the same damn expression  julia stiles has one of the most disturbing bone structures ive ever seen  her face looked like a square  as for damien he looks into the camera as if someone has taken away his lollipop  however mia farrows appearance made me shudder proving that face lifts can be scary
Aug 29 2007,positive,omg not fun watching it with just 2 guys and no girl  it scares u moreee
Aug 29 2007,negative,just a glorified remake
Aug 29 2007,positive,not as good as the original but okayish

Aug 28 2007,negative,i donno i was drunkbut i thought it was boring
Aug 28 2007,positive,watch it several times enjoy it always
Aug 28 2007,negative,original was better it even had better deaths it was fun to see prof lupin get decapitated though
Aug 28 2007,negative,no where near as good as the first movie but that could just be because it is a remake and the movie doesnt flow well with how i am now    i liked the original way better
Aug 28 2007,positive,disappointing yet still not bad
Aug 28 2007,neutral,huhas surprisingly notcompletelyawful remake whod have thought it however this remains so similar to the original film you have to wonder what the point really was
Aug 28 2007,positive,original version this movie was a little on the scary side  gregory peck is excellent in this  not for kids
Aug 28 2007,negative,this was the biggest piece of garbage that i have ever seen they just spewed the original out again literally shot for shot get some originality john moore
Aug 28 2007,positive,the part when the guys head gets cut off is awesome plus the goat skull party gave me goose bumps if you were in the theater that night you would have known it just like everyone else in the theater
Aug 28 2007,positive,its spetacular good fright
Aug 28 2007,negative,worthless in comparison to the original
Aug 27 2007,positive,not that much different than the original

Aug 27 2007,negative,the little kid in this movie scares me
Aug 27 2007,negative,watch the original  i now have watch the original copied to be pasted
Aug 27 2007,positive,i dont remember if i saw this or not
Aug 27 2007,negative,copies scene after scene from the original but adds nothing new to them  this is as pointless a remake as it gets  its only point seems to be connecting biblical prophecy to more recent events but it doesnt seem to do that well either  other than that it does nothing but repeat scenes from the original only much worse so whats the point
Aug 27 2007,positive,oh my gosh this was scary and it wasent the storyline it was the images waay better then the original
Aug 27 2007,neutral,i like schreiber and thewlis and they make the movie watchable but not by much its got some creepy moments and one of the best kills ive ever seen but otherwise just watch the original
Aug 27 2007,positive,this is really faithful to the original and i have to say i enjoyed it the little kid is proper creepy and mia farrow is the nanny from hell
Aug 27 2007,positive,excellent scarry and shocking i cannot compare to the original because i have not seen the original for a remake movie which a lot seem to be bad even without seeing the original this was good standing alone
Aug 27 2007,negative,the morning after watching this movie our car got stolen creepy huh
Aug 27 2007,positive,i only just watched it and it is pretty scary i hate damien he is so evil and the gross bit is where he gets his head cut off
Aug 27 2007,positive,alex good film    rach yay she dies d
Aug 27 2007,negative,if you have the chance watch the original instead from 1976 or so if you dont have the chance dont watch it whats the point of doing a remake of one of the horror classics to make it almost completely the same but without the scary elements and using a kid that is as expressive and as inspiring as a blank sheet of paper also they try to scare with the old dumb trick of silence and then a boom of sound with a supposedly scary image so its like your friends trying to scare you by hiding around a corner or so
Aug 26 2007,neutral,just like the original but it doesnt have the benefit of being an original
Aug 26 2007,positive,yeah it was actually pretty scary
Aug 26 2007,negative,rated poorly because it gave me nightmares for months last time ill ever go see a horror film even if it is a notasscary remake

Aug 26 2007,neutral,a mostly pointless remake that relies on cheap scares in lieu of being truly eerie
Aug 26 2007,positive,one of the better remakes
Aug 26 2007,negative,terrible go watch the original    julias stiles is useless as usual and liev schreiber again shows why he should stick to directing ie everything is illuminated    damien looked like he was trying to push a big dump out the whole movie
Aug 26 2007,neutral,silly and merciless the omen is one of many films that doesnt rank with the original
Aug 26 2007,positive,i think i saw the original  i dont remember  i liked this one  i usually dont like julia stiles movies but she was good in this one
Aug 26 2007,negative,not as scary as the original
Aug 26 2007,positive,much better than i expected
Aug 26 2007,positive,it isnt badthe boy was amazing though

Aug 26 2007,positive,decent sans the incredibly insulting final destinationesque death towards the end of the film
Aug 26 2007,negative,buying tickets for this movie is like making a deal with the devil
Aug 26 2007,negative,haha i saw this in the moives with 3 friends and one of them screamed so loud that everyone laughed
Aug 26 2007,positive,im not quite sure how to describe this movie idea its not enjoyable yet its different but didnt like it so much at the begin you would think youll c really something but at the end its not its scary in a way with the sound musique  such stuff however i just came with one thing im not quite if this the wirter want it but its when u r away from godterrible things could happen to your life
Aug 26 2007,positive,scary as all hellactually the only element that was truly scary was the nanny

Aug 25 2007,positive,i was a big fan of the original ones and i think the remake did a decent job the kid is not sucha  great actor but seeing mia farrow running with a hachet against the car tops everything else
Aug 25 2007,negative,once again hollywood get some new material  the original is fantastic leave it alone
Aug 25 2007,negative,horrible remake  liev schreiber is emotionless bordering on sociopathic

Aug 25 2007,negative,original was much better
Aug 25 2007,negative,the original was way better
Aug 25 2007,positive,original was better
Aug 25 2007,negative,if it aint broke dont fix it someone should have told them this before they made this terrible remake loved liev schreiber in the scream films but he was rubbish in this as for mrs baylock she wasnt half as creepy as the original and as for the kid who played damien bless him for trying but he wasnt creepy either
Aug 25 2007,negative,i honestly feel asleep in the theatre
Aug 25 2007,negative,at least they didnt change anything from the original its modern and okay

Aug 17 2007,negative,i seem to remember giggling a lot throughout this one
Aug 17 2007,positive,very good movie didnt end how i wanted it to though
Aug 17 2007,positive,a movie that didnt really need to be remade but im glad it was julia stiles is gorgeous and ill watch her in anything liev schreiber is one of the most underrated actors of our time and he puts on a performance worthy of pecks original
Aug 17 2007,positive,it was a good remake not as good as the original but a nice update worth seeing
Aug 17 2007,positive,as remakes go this wasnt bad great performances by the leads and more polished then the original     my only sticking point was the child himself  the original child was far scarier looking     liev schreiber was fab though and should be playing robert langdon in my opinion
Aug 17 2007,negative,shivers  not something i would watch over again
Aug 17 2007,positive,a lot of fun for most of the film with some startling imagary in the last act  horrific at times yet oddly enough darkly beautiful in its own way
Aug 17 2007,positive,not bad and scarier than the old version
Aug 17 2007,positive,was alrite there were some amusing deaths that made me laugh
Aug 17 2007,positive,hah you can see the mikes in the movie at the top of the screen that pretty much stops this movie from getting a higher rating just because it was so sloppily made everyone was so caught up in the hype of releasing it on 666 that they missed little details i thought it was okay bad performance from the kid written well directed badly etc
Aug 17 2007,neutral,okayish remake of the original but would have been happy with it not being made pretty much shot for shot copy with not a lot of new stuff liev schreiber and julia stiles also seem very very young to be the ambassador to the uk  wife certainly compared to gregory peck the little kid isnt as scary as the original either
Aug 17 2007,positive,my favorite part is when mia farrow gets hit by the car fun stuff here
Aug 17 2007,negative,we remade this why the original film is like the exorcist on half speed sorry
Aug 17 2007,negative,its not good until the very end
Aug 17 2007,neutral,not very scary  sigh  
Aug 17 2007,negative,had some scary parts but didnt deliver like the original
Aug 17 2007,negative,the fact that some people think that papal meetings go like that is both amusing and frightening
Aug 17 2007,positive,it was pretty good it wasnt as scary as people said it would be but it was alright not scary at all
Aug 17 2007,positive,original was the best and always will be so why this one
Aug 17 2007,negative,what the hell this is one of those remakes that should be burned bombed and buried absolutely terrible
Aug 17 2007,negative,hilarious it just didnt mean to be
Aug 17 2007,positive,too much hype before the release didnt deliver bad remake
Aug 16 2007,negative,a shocking attempt at this 1976 classic as much of a horror as it is a comedy the only thing that struck fear in my soul was how poorly directed this feature was the plot and characters are developed badly and the child damien is more annoying than he is the spawn of satan i would not reccomend this film to my worst enemy noone deserves to waste 1hr and 45mins of their precious time on this overated piece of trash
Aug 16 2007,positive,not horrible but not good  i enjoyed it i suppose but it definitely was not as good as the original
Aug 16 2007,neutral,original was better
Aug 16 2007,positive,he makes you not want to hae kids

Aug 16 2007,neutral,its ok and all its not scary and nothing special about it julia stiles is lovely though
Aug 16 2007,positive,rosmarys baby was better but this was interesting
Aug 16 2007,negative,its all for you damien
Aug 16 2007,negative,this movie should get a 0666 i guess half a star is close enough
Aug 16 2007,positive,will always think the best portrayal of the antichrist was on only fools and horses lol
Aug 16 2007,positive,an average remake of a classic film has some interesting new plot elements but is overall uninteresting and predictable the 1976 classic is one of the scariest films ever made this is just your standard horror film grade c
Aug 16 2007,positive,this movie its pretty solid way better than the original
Aug 16 2007,negative,i wonder which producer had to sell his own soul to satan to keep this franchise alive

Aug 15 2007,neutral,the omen was alright i liked the cinemtography the rest of the movie however was just ok it wasnt jump out of your seat scary the story line left some holes and the little boy damien was not evil enough he was just a sulky kid david thewlis who plays keith jennings did a job well done all in all it was worth seeing on the big screen i suppose not really worth paying for though
Aug 15 2007,negative,i think the only reason this movie was remade was because they could release it on 6606 watch the original with gregory fin peck in fact watch the entire original trilogy its loads better than this updated garbage and you dont have to look at julia stiles stupid face

Aug 13 2007,neutral,old versions are waaaaayyy better and i hate julia stiles with a passion in this movie especially horrible acting in this one
Aug 13 2007,negative,a pathetic excuse for a horror movie the religious underpinnings are ridiculous
Aug 13 2007,positive,loved it we have the older version but i still have yet to see that one and the older sequel too
Aug 13 2007,negative,there was something very incorrect about this movie and i think it had something to do with the fact that i cant watch julia stiles in anything unless shes making out with black dudes
Aug 13 2007,negative,u cant beat the originals
Aug 13 2007,negative,a well made movie sometimes scary but not really and a really cliffhanger ending that never concludes anything for which i was bummed

Aug 12 2007,positive,this was muthaeffen weirdi luved it tho
Aug 12 2007,negative,poor remake had potential to be quite good but liev schreiber couldnt come close to being anywhere near gregory peck
Aug 12 2007,positive,i saw it when it cameout on 6606 and didnt fall into the dimensional hole to hell so it was completely not worth it  just see the original this is fine there was just no point
Aug 12 2007,positive,this movie was ok  everything was completely predictable which took away from it
Aug 12 2007,positive,  not necessarily a film id have chosen to watch so surprised by how much i enjoyed it apart from the lame kid the actors were on form esp david thewlis who in return was awarded a super cool scene that im sure will stick with me downside of the film i have no doubts that the original is better
Aug 12 2007,positive,it was very reminiscent of the original but was updated and you have to love the release date
Aug 12 2007,negative,so poor and seldom tried to distinguish itself from the original apart from a couple of nice sequences illustrating nightmares and dark mental states
Aug 12 2007,negative,terrible it was funny but i think it was supposed to be a horror film
Aug 12 2007,neutral,not terrrible but not good
Aug 12 2007,negative,the kid in the movie said one line overall dumb
Aug 12 2007,positive,quite a good remake espcially mia farrow who was way scary and was evil how she killed julia stiles boo but ooo  still not a high rateing as this film freaks me out too much
Aug 12 2007,positive,strangely interesting and a bit depressing  i remember when mia farrow was the last of her kind escaping the red bull from pushing her into the ocean with all the other unicorns  sad
Aug 12 2007,positive,very creepy movie love this remake of the original
Aug 12 2007,neutral,i dont get those purists that say the remake was unnecessarythis movie was fun to watch  not that it was funny but of course one expects the gore and the suspense  i have seen the original and i really appreciated that this movie really stuck to the plot unlike other remakes that totally butcher its predecessors plot  the death scenes especially the priests were great    i also loved the cryptic use of the color red and really got creeped out at the person with the red hoodie running in the rain when the father is trying to find shelternot going to spoil it but see it again just at the moment where the father is searching for shelter from the storm and watch out for the color redcreepy
Aug 12 2007,negative,is this stuff supposed to be scary because i thought it was ridicolously bad
Aug 12 2007,positive,definately a very good film no question about it

Aug 11 2007,negative,original was much better
Aug 11 2007,positive,enjoyable but far from suspenseful more like an adventureaction movie
Aug 11 2007,positive,this could have been better
Aug 11 2007,positive,i really liked this movie the kid was super creepy and the end made me kinda mad and unsettled but not so much that it ruined the overall film
Aug 11 2007,neutral,this movie was good back when it was originally made but a complete remake was not needed and it just lacked
Aug 11 2007,positive,not bad but not good enough to warrant being made in the first place
Aug 11 2007,negative,this was a disgrace to film dialogue acting plot all shit everyone in the theater was laughing and mocking it the entire time
Aug 11 2007,negative,watchable but just a pure remake of the original

Aug 11 2007,positive,i take theoriginal overthis anyday
Aug 11 2007,positive,one of the greatest movies created it is so damn creepy which i love it certainly rivals with the book and the original
Aug 11 2007,negative,pointless remake as so little is changed  people seem to like creepy children in their movies so they tried way too hard to make damien creepy here  and the actress playing the mother effectively makes us despise her even though i dont think she was aiming for that  second most painful movie ive ever sat through in a theater  and in the opening credits every single o slowly turns into a 6 and every t slowly turns into an upside down cross  there are a lot so it gets really really annoying
Aug 11 2007,negative,why why why remake this film  the new one stinks
Aug 11 2007,positive,another great horror movie just dont adopt kids and name them damien you have been warned
Aug 11 2007,negative,enjoyed the earlier version wasnt done well
Aug 11 2007,positive,looks a bit dated these days but there is no denying the shock value is still fresh as the day it came out

Aug 10 2007,positive,i loved this movie it had all the same scares as the original it also had some different scenes that original didnt have like the way they killed the mother is so different this was really good
Aug 10 2007,negative,in hell the damned are condemned to watch this film for eternity fact

Aug 9 2007,negative,all the child star did was stare in glare i wish i could do that and make some cash
Aug 9 2007,positive,it scared me perturbed me excited me and i loved every minute of it

Aug 9 2007,negative,i love liev schreiber but this movie was gay
Aug 9 2007,positive,this movie is only good because it practically uses every line scene and camera shot that the old movie has

Aug 7 2007,negative,this sucked so bad  the changes in the story took away the whole reason for it and the bits that were the same were cold and boring  some very wooden performances
Aug 7 2007,positive,theres some cool scenes of people getting killed but nothing really extraordinary striking about the movie
Aug 7 2007,positive,wooow a good remake and a horror film that is true horror and not hack and slash i was taken aback by how awesome this movie was i highly recommend this movie

Aug 4 2007,positive,url  the omen  2006 110mins 15  director john moore  writer david seltzer  cast includes liev schreiber julia stiles mia farrow david thewlis seamus davey fitzpatrick michael gambon  uk release date 6th june 2006     horror remakes have a fairly terrible rep in todays society and deservingly so each year many ill thought out and poorly structured retreads hit theatres and make a few quick bucks before making a swift dvd debut this has proved an effective money making plan for studios who make the films on tiny budgets and without the intelligence and heart which is vital in the creation of a worthwhile horror venture ithe omen iis an oddity in that it marks a remake which is not only better than its original but also a genuinely superb scary film a movie which thanks to excellent casting and a more serious take on the material manages to exceed expectations to an almost unbelievable degree   url  robert thorn liev schreiber is informed on the night of his sons birth that his wife katherine julia stiles has just lost her baby and that complications during birth has bady wounded her uterus a priest spiletto suggests to robert that another child that lost his mother could be the substituted for his son and robert accepts the child and raises him as his own whilst katherine believes that the boy she is raising to be the infant she lost however this works well as the baby now named damian is brought into a happy home and the family exists peacefully and in harmony fast foward several years and robert has become the ambassador to great britain taking damian seamus davey fitzpatrick and katherine with him however on arrival odd things start to occur around the boy and numerous people bring dire warning as to the childs origins robert initiall shakes it off but as katherine becomes mentally unstable and deaths start to pile up he decides to investigate and put his adopted childs story straight  the film opens with a slightly altered beggining in which priests and bishops at the vatican predict the coming of the antichrist and are preparing for the armageddon this however is the only large change director john moore has made to the material staying close to david seltzers original script some will hold this against the picture but unlike faithful remakes like ipsycho imoores vision is an improvement on donners the new director creates a more menacing and serious horror film than the occasionally camp 70s effort the lean and efficent nature of the story feels more powerful and satisfying when taken in a less jokey context i find the original to be an enjoyable film but this is a cut above in terms of quality   the classic story fits well in todays world and remains no less compelling than the original alot of the films success comes from choices made by director john moore and his talented crew the first one of these ideas to cast actors instead of movie stars is a really brave and ultimately inspired one casting thesps liev schreiber and julia stiles in the lead roles along with award winners mia farrow and pete postletwaite really makes the movie a classier affair indeed a lot more talent is involved here than in most horror films never mind remakes its stiles in particular who shines putting in an extreamly focused and tense turn as the spawn of satans foster mother stiles pushes the envelope as far as it will go without descending into camp her portrait of katherine is brutally effective perfectly showing how such a nice person can be so degraded by mental instability certainly stilers is alot less wooden and far more grounded than lee remmicks interpretation in 1976 schreiber alos engages the audience and admittedly its he who is onscreen for the best part of the feature as robert an actor has to create a sense of strength and yet weakness to show that even the best and whole hearted of people are willing to make exceptions for the ones they love in the original gregory peck played the role in a much more hammy and directly entertaining nature but with screiber you get alot more humanity and emotional investment the man turns robert into someone worth rooting for and easy to relate with  url  as damian seamus davey fitzpatrick certainly has a scary look and delivers his lines in an eerie manner which in all honesty is all the role requires david thewlis is an effective piece of counter programming to screiber as his costar in solving the mystery thewis is a much more gruff and mercenary entity but easily as sympathetic finally as damians nanny mrs baylock a fantastically evil mia farrow delivers the films most memorable turn her sweet and sour turn is probably the films most entertaining and easily a more impressive than billie whitelaw in the original  the visuals are excellent moore has provided lush and eerie cinematography to spook his up market cast the wonderful use of reds and blacks adds a menace to the scenes that cant be bought the irishmen displays keen knowledge of how to stage a fright something holywood should exploit as soon as possible the wondefully stylish presentation also makes the film look alot more expensive than it actually was made for a paltry 25 million ithe omen ilooks closer to 40000000 when up on the silver screen  the most infamous death sequences all remain in their gory glory but moore also injects his script with a couple of extra little boo moments sure to catch even enthusiasts of their guard and indeed one in particular involving a mask and a bath is sure to hit a genuine scare the better treatment of the material means that moore is also able to draw a more disturbed reaction from his audience by planting the film firmly in our world he draws an extra layer of dread the original was missing  the movie was released on the 060606 offering it a wonderful marketing gimmick and indeed one that even cynics must think at least kind of cool its nearly a year ago now but still its a nice touch worth remembering  the movie had a brilliant opening day at the box office taking in some 14 million domestically sadly sales slowed up and by its exit from the theatrical run the omen had made a mediocre 115 million worldwide a dissapointment for distributers twentieth century fox at this point it looks unlikely a sequel will be made maybe a good thing as the originals sequel idamien omen 2i was fairly uninspired but theres no debating this is one of the best horror remakes around the point of the matter is that this is a superior version of what some already consiera classic and for that reason alone it deserves a life on dvd this new version of ithe omen iis a more relevant and classier affair that the initial 1976 version a remake which may actually better the original ithe omen iproves that sometimes rethinking something can end in the most glowing nature  url

Aug 2 2007,negative,very unimpressive remake of the original  liev and julia trying to fill gregory and lees shoes is painful to watch  mia and david thewlis fare better but cannot pull this one up enough

Aug 2 2007,negative,this is so shit it doesnt even deserve a star could they have made a shittier not scary movie ive concluded that any movie with liev schreiber sucks eg the manchurian candidate sucked but it even had denzel in it oh yeah same applies for julia stiles shes so annoying

Aug 1 2007,positive,as always julia stiles gives a cardboard performance but liev schreiber is very convincing as is mia farrow in her return to demonic horror  her first since the winning rosemarys baby the real downfall of the movie is young seamus daveyfitzpatrick as the wicked damien he is unconvincing and almost laughable in the role still the movie is atmospheric enough and manages to be downright creepy in some instances worth a look

Jul 31 2007,negative,pointless pointless pointless they follow the original closely enough but it is proof that a great story is not enough liev schreiber is an actor i like alot but he is no gregory peck and whoever directed this is certainly no richard donner the only reason this got made was because the studiop wanted to release it on the 60606 thats it no other reason they would jave been better served rereleasing the original in theatres like the exorcist a few years back

Jul 29 2007,neutral,decently scary liev schreiber is awesome in this movie and in the manchurian candidate
Jul 29 2007,positive,although this remake brought almost nothing new to the table this and the 1976 original have the same script and plotline modern technology has provided it with better cinematography and sound which are the two keys to a scary ass movie so despite the wellnoticed lack of gregory peck this embodies the perfect remake and will scare the shit out you christians beware

Jul 29 2007,neutral,it was not as scary as the first but there were definitely a few moments that were the boy was not as scary but the nanny was mia farrow did a great job of being the nanny i felt that the ending could have been scary and i wish this had not been basically the same as the first movie i would have liked a different plot or maybe a different ending
Jul 29 2007,negative,a pale imitation of the original despite one or two memorable scenes i am unsure whether to laugh or cry at seamus daveyfitzpaticks mannered and awkward potrayal of the antichrist
Jul 29 2007,negative,bad remake simply trying to cash in on the release date best part good supporting cast its just too bad theyre surrounded by a doomed project

Jul 28 2007,positive,its cool how they make everything sound so real
Jul 28 2007,positive,i havent seen the original which isnt like me but i love julia stiles and liev schreiber  this movie didnt disappoint
Jul 28 2007,negative,dragged and had no real sense of even creepiness was so interested in visual style that any sense of directing the actors was lost so we had wooden acting pedestrian plot and overuse of stylistic colour palettes bollocks the only thing that was scary was that this got made

Jul 27 2007,positive,the first ones better
Jul 27 2007,negative,i can almost do a stand up comedy routine about the end of this movie it all sucked but that in particuar made absolutely no sense the only reason i think people should see it is so my comedic bit makes sense
Jul 27 2007,positive,i saw it on the 6th of the 6th of the 6th at 6 in theatre 6 at 6pm
Jul 27 2007,positive,i actually laughed during some parts of this movie
Jul 27 2007,neutral,this film had tremendous potential but it just failed the atmosphere was great but the storyline was just too unbelievable and lets be honest a five year old boy is not exactly scary  even if he is the devils son
Jul 27 2007,negative,this movie was pretty awful  what is it with me and bad movies lately  i missed the first twenty minutes but i got the basic gist  this film really beats the viewer over the head with symbolism  how many crucifixes crosses and images of fire do we need  damiens the antichrist okay i get it    there were however a couple things i liked  the cinematography was really good  if i had watched it without the sound i might actually have thought that the omen was a good movie  also professor lupin was in it but he wasnt a werewolf he was a photographer who gets his head chopped off  kat stratford and cotton weary were the parents of the generic creepy kid  whats with all the horror movies lately featuring the same kid with a bowlcut      there was very little i found scary or even disturbing  fuck i kept watching the movie because i thought it was kind of ridiculous and amusing  many things were not explained  what was the deal with the second nanny mia farrow and the random dog  i didnt get it  was mia farrow possessed or like one of satan servants  whatever i give this film one and a half stars and its lucky it got that
Jul 27 2007,positive,i hate that visios little kidbut it made a very good thrilleri even jumped a little a few times
Jul 27 2007,negative,scard the living craaaaaap out of me but still had 2 watch the lot of them

Jul 26 2007,negative, why  original is a classic you just dont fuck with that

Jul 26 2007,positive,the original is amazingthis is almost shotforshot only the actors arent nearly as good its worth watching but the original is better
Jul 26 2007,positive,both of these movies are scary classics but i know that this may be disputed among a lot of people but i do believe that the part of damien is best played by seamus daveyfitzpatrick in the 06 version of this movie as opposed to the first version

Jul 25 2007,negative,hate the first one is so much better
Jul 25 2007,negative,a dissapointing remake a child sitting down with a creepy look on his face for the span of the film is not exactly the ideal representation of damien a little more depth would have been appreciated

Jul 24 2007,neutral,slow movie but good up until the last 10 mins
Jul 24 2007,positive,i just saw this one and realized after starting it i had already seen it  i remember liking it the first time but obviously not a lot as i didnt remember seeing it  but was enjoyable enough the 2nd time i guess
Jul 24 2007,negative,why do people like julia stiles  im sure shes a very nice person but she cant act her way out of a wet paper bag    and while im asking questionswhy did hollywood remake this film      i mean this watch watchable but sweet merciful crapif you have actors like michael gambon david thewlis and pete posthelwaite in your film dont waste them by giving them absolutely random and almost useless cameotype roles   call them cameotype because i have no idea if they were there because the filmmakers liked them personally or because they actually thought they served the story    whatever    its worthwhile to watch to see if only for mia farrows performance  and shes still gorgeous
Jul 24 2007,positive,i like this movie very  but it wasnt very horror movie
Jul 24 2007,neutral,ive not seen the original omen so ive got nothing to compare it to pretty decent film not great not terrible just an average film left wide open for an inevitable sequel
Jul 24 2007,neutral,cant really remember much of it so it cant have been too thrilling
Jul 24 2007,positive,i know the kid was supposed to be the scariest one in this film but honestly mia farrow freaked me out way more theres just something unearthly about her face i generally liked it as far as scary films go but it seemed like the editing didnt get into a good rythm and i think there were parts of the plot that should have been further developed
Jul 24 2007,neutral,the original was so much better
Jul 24 2007,negative,some really twisted stuff in here
Jul 23 2007,positive,not the original with gregory peck but still damn good
Jul 23 2007,negative,what compels people to remake good movies into bad ones
Jul 23 2007,positive,did not do the original justicenot as creepy
Jul 23 2007,negative,the original is so much better i hope that they dont remake the others
Jul 23 2007,neutral,david thewlis is cool and his death was the best part still a pretty unnecessary remake though read gregory peck rules
Jul 23 2007,positive,these movies scare the bajeeezus out of me
Jul 23 2007,positive,i like this moive n i want to watch it over over
Jul 23 2007,neutral,not half bad for a remake of such an iconic but the original is still better and still scarier
Jul 23 2007,negative,it was stupid then its stupid now
Jul 23 2007,negative,i hated it it wasnt scary and it made absolutely no sense
Jul 23 2007,positive,better looking with better performances than its 1976 title but lacking the feel of true horror that the original captured  that said david thewlis and liev schreiber are amazing
Jul 23 2007,negative,it has some pretty good actors but the movie itself is just another horror flick trust me youve seen it before
Jul 23 2007,positive,it made me scream  but i actually blame that on the girl next to me screaming still good film
Jul 23 2007,positive,this movie was made for me lol

Jul 23 2007,positive,i just love the part when julia stiles dies hah
Jul 23 2007,positive,meh this isnt great but it really isnt bad either the original like the vast majority of others is much better
Jul 23 2007,negative,the devil made them do it
Jul 23 2007,negative,it was kinda funny in the theater but theres no way around it this movie is terrible
Jul 23 2007,negative,definitely does not come close to the original in acting or scares
Jul 23 2007,negative,the only reason i enjoyed this movie was because i saw it on 6 6 06
Jul 23 2007,negative,what made the 1976 omen so frightening was the notion of innate evil existing in a small apparently harmless child  seamus daveyfitzpatricks pseudoominous scowling damien is hardly as portentous as the original innocently smiling harvey stephens  liev schreiber and julia stiles lack the chemistry and pathos of gregory peck and lee remick and mia farrow who gave birth to her own demonic spawn in rosemarys baby is laughably hammy as the nanny ms baylock  pete postlethwaite michael gambon and david thewlis subbing for horror veteran david warner all provide notable supporting performances but they cannot save this overdone and totally unnecessary remake
Jul 23 2007,positive,made me laugh people in the cinema were screaming nd shit but i just laughed especially at the eveil nanny axing the car lol 4 stars for comedic value but not a bit as good as the original
Jul 23 2007,negative,pointless remake all they did was recreate every scene from the original and make them as bland as possible the only good thing in it is mia farrow she at least tries something different with her character the kid is about as scary as the squirrel from ice age
Jul 23 2007,negative,horrible no story line and a lame ending
Jul 23 2007,positive,creepy kid  sounds like me
Jul 23 2007,negative,the original is so much better
Jul 22 2007,positive,good movie i just wish the kid would have died
Jul 22 2007,negative,after an hour or so i think i fell asleepi hate to be that guy but the og is light years better
Jul 22 2007,negative,why did they remake this
Jul 22 2007,negative,i liked the fact julia stiles was in this movie but it was real let down was hardly scary at all more blah then anything else most of the cast was well chosen for their roles but other then julia stiles the other acters never really gave any life or acting there of in their characters roles
Jul 22 2007,negative,we arent quite sure about the coyote motheror why they were watching the coyote when it gave birth to a human did they just guess did they follow all the coyotes around i dontget it
Jul 22 2007,positive,i had an interesting night after watching this
Jul 22 2007,positive,i liked the old one betternot a great role for julia stiles

Jul 22 2007,neutral,i thought the whole series was rather tripe but hey
Jul 22 2007,negative,just dumb a complete waste of money to make and a waste of my life
Jul 22 2007,neutral,a remake thats overly slavish to the original one wonders what was the point of remaking the omen  aside from now explicitly being set in a post911 world and a remix or two of some of  the famous final destination style deaths omen 2006s script is a beat for beat twin of 1976s   maybe you could argue that the acting is a little better all round despite the stunt casting  mia farrow as now the antichrists nanny  cute and the contemporary sheen makes the story more accessible to modern audiences  but ultimately who knows  this isnt a bad film but for those who have seen the original it is an unrewarding viewing experience  why the timidity and the reserve  an imaginative director and a bold studio could have really gone to town with this  still as it stands its hard to dismiss a perfectly solid bit of filmmaking that manages to send shivers down the spine like the original it conveys an oppressive sense of dread and foreboding so this may be for those oblivious to the films heritage nevertheless a wasted opportunity
Jul 22 2007,positive,okay interesting but kinda boring wouldnt watch it again
Jul 22 2007,positive,good remake as far as they go
Jul 22 2007,neutral,watchable but not a patch on the original

Jul 22 2007,negative,boring but at tyms gory
Jul 22 2007,positive,creepyheh heh my life
Jul 21 2007,negative,whats the point of a remake if its going to be shot for shot  if you cant bring something new to it then leave the original  which was fine  alone  and dont change the good stuff like the mothers death and make it worse  a total waste of time
Jul 21 2007,negative,im sorry but all these remakes are getting very old very quick  once again this one fails to match the original
Jul 21 2007,positive,wonderful movie but the ending left a lot to be desired its also not stated who damien is although it is implied strongly or why him and not someone else
Jul 21 2007,negative,not scary the little boy is not creepy
Jul 21 2007,positive,it was good but it seamed like the mom knew from the begining since isnt dameon only one letter away from demon

Jul 20 2007,positive,scary and stylish but still missing something
Jul 20 2007,positive,i can safely say ive never wanted to see a father ram a long blade into his kid until this movie  so needless to say i was horribly disappointed  it was ok  made me jump once or twice
Jul 20 2007,positive,very miscast the original is much better
Jul 20 2007,negative,doesnt compare to the original
Jul 20 2007,negative,im not just saying this this film was really not anywhere as good as the original i could not understand why bother to remake it if we want to see the omen we all have dvd players  just press play why remake it its a trend i suppose and there have been very many of them  old films and old tv shows a waste of time i was hoping for something new or different what a fool i was sorry but totally disappointing and flat

Jul 18 2007,positive,to me it was the same as the old one boring and stupid

Jul 17 2007,positive,i prefer the original however this wasnt half bad
Jul 17 2007,positive,i didnt think id enjoy it but i thought it was good
Jul 17 2007,negative,another money spinner from hollywoods lack of imagination department the marketing technique was undeniably astute that is about as positive as i can get though as the film itself never quite sheds the impression that the whole project was anything more than a marketing project a strange sense of deja vu shrouds every gory set piece each nearly identical to the original albeit each one is executed in slick fashion but somehow that isnt enough liev schreiber is no gregory peck and here we lose the heart of the film schreiber seems halfcut as he often does on screen and lacks any charisma as a leading man     perhaps remakes should be seen as an opportunity to reinterpret the original story not merely rehash time and time again the omen does attempt this to an extent however it constantly returns to the iconic moments of the original making its efforts seems all the more half arsed ultimately for the viewer it doesnt stand out as a worthwhile exercise
Jul 17 2007,negative,i didnt enjoy the remake at all it tried to follow a new plot than the original and failed
Jul 17 2007,positive,a fantastic trip of terror everything is this film is perfect and is without a doubt one of greatest horror films created

Jul 17 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Jul 17 2007,negative,should have left it at the 60s version but watching it on 060606 was memorable although this is quite an appaling remake
Jul 17 2007,positive,an eerie movie that almost deserves this rating solely because of the advertising campaign good in comparison to other movies of the genre

Jul 15 2007,negative,bah not creepy in the least very disappointing and corny
Jul 15 2007,neutral,this was a decent movie on its own merit but comparable to the original it doesnt hold up  watch this if you havent seen the one from the 70s
Jul 15 2007,positive,the kid is so creepy its unreal julia stiles does a great job but i hate her character she sits in the living room doing nothing and tells her kids to stop playing his video game when he doesnt listen oh nanny aggghh she shouldnt be banned from parenting luckily damien though so too
Jul 15 2007,positive,good movie but the special effects were really shitty in a few parts
Jul 15 2007,negative,this is the worst remake ever if you have seen the original you have seen this one it is the exact same
Jul 15 2007,negative,no chemistry between julia stiles and liev schreibe who are both usually pretty good on their own could have been better 3rd worst remake yet

Jul 14 2007,positive,an unoriginal yet still entertaining remake good acting especially by the sinister yet adorable mia farrow and an updated but still effective monkey scene my favorite part in both movies save this from becoming just another remake one major complaint though damien was just a little to cute this time around
Jul 14 2007,neutral,original is still better but thats what the dog told me
Jul 14 2007,neutral,david thewlis has to be watched but else just another unnecessary remake

Jul 14 2007,negative,good attempt just way behind quality of the previous movies
Jul 14 2007,neutral,seamus davey fitzpatrick is scary as damien but the rest of the film isnt necessarily the freakiest thing ive ever seen im guessig the original is brilliant this wasnt near as horrifying as i thought itd be what ive seen of the original is much more interesting the classic omen music is absent and severely missed it seems like the intense score was what made the original what it was unlike the first film nobody got sick or died during the makiing of this which is good but might be because of how lackluster this is   i dont like mia farrow
Jul 14 2007,neutral,i watched in the theater with a friend and he jumped scared and spilled all his popcorn over the seats behind us lol
Jul 14 2007,positive,one problem with this film the fierce rottweilersi dont think so there little stumpstails waggingoooppss

Jul 13 2007,negative,scary and stupid is all i really have to say about this movie
Jul 13 2007,positive,pretty weird creepy movie from what i remember
Jul 13 2007,positive,this movie functions more as a tribute to the original than a remake  the shotbyshot retelling with updated special effects has beent tastefully developed into 2006 but the slick special effects do not deliver the same weird unnatural chills that were present in the original
Jul 13 2007,positive,stylish and suspenseful the remake of the 1970s quasiclassic works best for those who havent seen the original it is one of the very few remakes which surpasses the source material in terms of production value
Jul 13 2007,positive,classiceven the revival was awesome
Jul 13 2007,positive,pretty good i liked the ending very much
Jul 13 2007,negative,one star for interesting visuals

Jul 12 2007,positive,i figured if i was gonna see it i should see it 6606
Jul 12 2007,negative,pales when compared to the original
Jul 12 2007,positive,leiv schreiber david thewlis pete postlewaite  too many favourites in one movie for me   my only problem with the movies is that 666 is actually a mistranslation its supposed to be 616 sigh oh well  and that its marketed as a horror movie when its not dont know what id classify it as tho
Jul 12 2007,negative,i didnt find it to be scary at all
Jul 12 2007,positive,ehem inantok ako pero ok lang i was super tired when we watched this so no one to blame 
Jul 12 2007,negative,liev schreiber is effective playing the role gregory peck played in the original but i dont have a lot of other good things to say about this remake  it wasnt necessary except so they could release it on 6606
Jul 12 2007,negative,exactly like the original  no new suprises which was a dissapointment for me
Jul 12 2007,neutral,it made me laughwhat else is new
Jul 12 2007,positive,just see the original  its just as good if not better
Jul 12 2007,positive,pretty good for a remake
Jul 12 2007,positive,better than the orig but then 60s movies arent my cup of tea anyway but good movie kinda creepy at times
Jul 12 2007,negative,horrible remake i almost fell asleep in the theatre execpt for the parts that makes you jump seriously this was long and annoyingthe old version is so much better
Jul 12 2007,positive,was pretty good but the orignial i like more
Jul 12 2007,neutral,it was ok but it could of been better
Jul 12 2007,negative,worst remake ever not even close to the original i had such high hopes with david thewlis on board you cant just turn off someones heart monitor in todays hospitals unbelievable crap
Jul 12 2007,positive,other than liev schreibers performance hes a much more gifted director than he is an actor this movie is actually a competent disturbing remake
Jul 12 2007,negative,i was laughing i swear i switched it off about halfway through loved the way that priest got speared though it was the only good scene in the movie
Jul 12 2007,negative,this remake be damned

Jul 11 2007,negative,i watched this and could have slept through it
Jul 11 2007,positive,its really just a better looking version of the original a litteral remake
Jul 11 2007,positive,excellent movieclassic horror at its finest
Jul 11 2007,positive,i screamed like 5 times when i saw it in theaters
Jul 11 2007,positive,should have seenit in theaters the kid is extra creepy better than the original and it doesnt need any big specail effects to mess with your mind
Jul 11 2007,positive,being an optamsitic amillenialist i think this is all crap but it makes for a good horror movie
Jul 11 2007,positive,as far as the remake factory goes most suck and i wont ever see them that said what made me wanna see this movie well liev schreiber was in it and more importantly david thewlis i love those two actors plus the movie just looked like it kept the vibe from the first movie creepy and gothic they didnt feel the need to amp it up ala texas chainsaw or hill have eyes they kept it simple but a downfall was that it was almost a shoot by numbers type thing there were too many similar things but all in all i enjoyed this movie
Jul 11 2007,negative,shitey remake of a good movie
Jul 11 2007,positive,i saw this in the theater and loved it  it didnt effect me much but i had a friend staying with me that couldnt sleep well for days and having my little brother looking just like damien doesnt help matters  the omen has a few shock scares in it but for the most part it is scary because it appears to be just plain creepy  it is interesting to see that the characters and the audience know that they are going to die and everyone keeps waiting for it to eventually happen  this movie is good and the original is a movie that i am hopefully going to see soon
Jul 11 2007,positive,had really cool parts in it and overall was ok
Jul 11 2007,negative,not scary at all there were probably two scenes in the entire movie that might make you jump  awful anticlimactic ending
Jul 11 2007,negative,you cant remake films like that and juila stiles i wish she would die i hate that fat headed bitch
Jul 11 2007,negative,corny its supose to be a scary movie but everytime the devil child was on screen ppl laughed
Jul 11 2007,positive,cant wait to see the next onewe all know its not over
Jul 11 2007,negative,why remake a seriously good film and put julia stiles in it because film studios have contracted directorial aids
Jul 11 2007,negative,if i could give this a negative rating i would it is the worst creation and saddest attempt to be a horror movie please dont waste your time or energy watching this if you have any sense of logic you will be questioning every move the characters make because their judgement is pathetic absolutely miserable watching this
Jul 11 2007,negative,sad to say i saw this movie  too dark for me wish i never saw it
Jul 11 2007,negative,original was marginally better
Jul 11 2007,negative,just watch the original
Jul 11 2007,negative,one of the worse remakes ive seen
Jul 10 2007,positive,pretty scary the ending was very moving however the child was not as scary as i thought he would be he looked too innocent and not as devilish as a son of satan could look like

Jul 10 2007,positive,slightly creepier then most horror movies these days

Jul 10 2007,neutral,unneccessary but cant say anything that bad about it  pretty much the same as the original but its all been done before
Jul 10 2007,positive,the only scary movie since 2004 julia got messed up by a little kid job well done
Jul 10 2007,negative,not bad not close to the original though they had to do something to mark the date i guess
Jul 10 2007,negative,it was scary at the time but now that i think about it it was kinda dumb
Jul 10 2007,negative,you have to be very childish to enjoy this movie as childish as the little demian who actually looks very tender pretending to be scary everything in the omen is ridiculous the deaths are laughable the story is stupid did actually someone felt terror with this feeble thing please a waste of time
Jul 10 2007,negative,alesha and i saw this one we hated it  p
Jul 10 2007,positive,which one the new one if so heck yes i wanna see it i saw some of it and i luved it
Jul 10 2007,negative,this movie wasnt as good as everyone made it out to be but there were still times that i was scared but i thought it had a weak ending

Jul 10 2007,positive,i enjoyed this but it didnt compare to the original
Jul 10 2007,neutral,i like this film becuase the storyline has complex meanings
Jul 10 2007,positive,i loved the original actually i found this to be a pretty good remake i found the score especially pleasing and not just the titular and evercreepy ave satani at times i found this one to be even more suspenseful than the original
Jul 10 2007,negative,lame as but niamh made it hilarious xx
Jul 10 2007,positive,i dont know what 2 rate cuz i fell asleep
Jul 10 2007,negative,how are you gonna try and replace gregory peck with liev schreiber  go watch the richard donner 1976 version
Jul 10 2007,positive,ok i havent seen the original yetbut i have the remake and i think its great
Jul 10 2007,positive,not a bad remake but the original is still scary and not particularly dated not sure the kid is as scary as the original so it doesnt really work for me great acting from liev and julia though didnt like mia as mrs baylock much more frightening in the original
Jul 10 2007,positive,seen the old version as well the new one was better
Jul 10 2007,positive,solid remake that almost surpasses the original

Jul 9 2007,negative,just like the old one
Jul 9 2007,positive,pretty creepy that kid totally is evil
Jul 9 2007,positive,scary but loved it
Jul 9 2007,negative,caught this on hbo  i expected it to be scary and it was a huge letdown  i hope the original was better than this      however i must give major props to mia farrow as the nanny protecting damien and to the casting of seamus daveyfitzpatrick as damien that kid was pretty creepy  i also liked the early scenes with the priests discussing revelation and the antichrist

Jul 9 2007,positive,everyone should watch this movie
Jul 9 2007,positive,nasty little demon seed couldnt remember much of the original so that might have been a good thing this version had some tense moments and a bit scary in parts and its funny to watch a movie where you are trying to remember where youve seen a particular actor before there was a photo journalist and i was stumped until i realized lupin from the harry potter movies lol

Jul 5 2007,positive,it was kinda creepydont wish a child like that on anyone
Jul 5 2007,negative,completely unnecessary  whats the point of remaking a movie if youre going to do it pretty much exactly like the original with the same scenes and dialogue  people can just rent the original or studios can rerelease the originals in theaters d and the millions of dollars that would be used for the remake can be donated to a charity

Jul 5 2007,positive,this movie was ok but it left me saying whats the point its a carbon copy of the original while not as exact as gus van zandts psycho its pretty darn close in terms of remakes i guess i was expecting it to be more like the remake of dawn of the dead where the they borrowed the original premise and tried new things with it all in all it doesnt compare to the original lets face it liev schrieber is no peck
Jul 5 2007,positive,its no original but it was good

Jul 4 2007,negative,stick to the original
Jul 4 2007,negative,this movie was awful
Jul 4 2007,negative,dumb very dumb original was better
Jul 4 2007,negative,possible one of the best horror movies ever made the original this is like trying to succeed at remaking the exorcist your never going to accomplish half of what the original film was so the real question is why let a travesty like this ever happen
Jul 4 2007,positive,one of the better horror movies ive seen
Jul 4 2007,positive,not too bad for a remake the ending wasnt tp to my expectations but worth my time
Jul 4 2007,neutral,meh the original was corny and so was this one

Jul 4 2007,negative,it was so weird and sucked
Jul 4 2007,positive,ah the omen im not sure whether i like this one or the remake better the remake is definitely less kitschy and lowgrade horror budgetting but that is sometimes what makes a great horror film go go rottweilers and antichrist children
Jul 4 2007,neutral,i was expecting a lot more
Jul 4 2007,positive,a good remake a few flaws in the we can make prague look like london but thats just me being picky still enjoyed the movie tho

Jul 4 2007,negative,doesnt do the original any justice
Jul 4 2007,positive,its ok but tiny bits of boredom
Jul 4 2007,neutral,i expected more from this movie then again a lot of people used to think my name was damien i am attracted to the dark side after all    pretty disappointing
Jul 4 2007,negative,the remake of the omen or what i like to call the mr deeds of the horror genre is a complete waste from start to finish just as adam sandler took an older much loved movie and completely butchered it in the remake the omen takes the classic horror film and disgraces it like no other remake before it its a remake in every sense of the word it was shot almost scene for scene exactly how it was in the original movie this in itself is a complete waste most remakes will take the general idea of the original and build upon it which makes for a new movie going experience but not the omen if i wanted to see the original movie shot for shot id watch the original movie outside of one slick decapitation there is absolutely no redeeming value in this trash should you ever have to choose between watching this film or scarfing down a bucket of shit choose the latter
Jul 4 2007,positive,nearly identical to original  bravo to liev  julia  great performances

Jul 3 2007,negative,second funniest scary movie
Jul 3 2007,neutral, this comment may contain spoilers     this movie was long i watched an hour at a time first half was pretty good the kid creeps me out big time i think they could have used a lot more gore and more killing the movie only have like 4 deaths i would have like to see the child be more satanic i think a creeper voice would have done it the movie wasnt what i expected i was hoping for more violence i think i might watch it again i feel a sequel is in order to show him go on and do a lot more creepier things the movie wasnt very scary i think one of the scariest or more creepy parts is when the nanny is on top of the roof and she says its all for you damien while hanging herself another part that i thought deserved mention was when his father takes damien to the car to go and kill him and damien just screams and in a way it just adds a great effect
Jul 3 2007,negative,dont rush out to see this one

Jul 3 2007,positive,freakkkkyyyy thats it
Jul 3 2007,negative,well i was not very happy when i found out that my favourite horror film was being remade but liev schreiber whom i love in the lead role made me feel a little better then i saw it and i felt a whole lot worse schreiber is in fact the best part of the movie julia stiles does a horrible job as the mother and should go back playing dancing teenagers in biracial relationships what shes remotely good at everyone else is just soso including mia farrow whos just plain creepy and not in the good way that the film requires and that the previous actress in the original did so well but in that uncomfortable way where you want her off the screen there were also a lot of cheap gimmicks added this time around to make it more scary and i just wanted to throw up dont see this its a complete act of blasphemy to the brilliant original see that instead it was made thirty years ago and it will scare you more than this could ever hope to do so
Jul 3 2007,negative,almost shot for shot the original but with special dream sequences of unscary things with loud banging sounds bad

Jul 3 2007,positive,a worthy remake that utilizes the classic films plot while introducing special effects that are a vast improvement over those of the original  unfortunately liev schriebers dry emotionless portrayal of the father brought the movie down for me id still recommend it to a contemporary audience with contemporary tastes  as for me ill stick to the original

Jul 3 2007,positive,when i was little i looked like damien the antichrist from the first version of this movie  the remake kid looks nothing like me so i cant recommend this movie    more seriously its pretty pitchperfect but why was it necessary  its so much a homage that it becomes irrelevant
Jul 3 2007,positive,i liked it i think the acting was spot on its also interesting i did not find it that scary tho this is a good movie overall because i think they got it right the actors n most especially the kid when u luk at him thats him the devils son he just has the look i thot the story was very good n i hope ther is the second part coming out soon judging by how it finishd

Jul 2 2007,positive,this wasnt that scary but it was still good
Jul 2 2007,positive,if you have seen the first movie of the originals then there is nothing new in this one except for a few odd flash backs with weird masks  i still havent figured that part out  but otherwise this movie and the original are twin brothers with a few odds and ends that barely distinguish them  it gets 3 stars because gregory peck is not in it
Jul 2 2007,positive,a solid scene for scene remake almost i like where the remake is headed
Jul 2 2007,negative,i really like the original better

Jun 29 2007,positive,this film is not quite up to par with the original but it comes pretty darn close id have to say that if any horror remake thus far has proven to match on any level the dread of the original this is the one liev schreiber brings the sort of understated performance needed for his role the only thins slightly out of place here is julia stiles while stiles has much more potential as an actor and does quite well here the age gap between her and schreiber is odd even more odd is her being the mother of a school aged child mia farrow returns to the screen with a building creep out factor the kid seamus daveyfitzpatrick is creepy as hell perhaps not as creep as the orignal damien but close a masterful remake of a horror classic
Jun 29 2007,neutral,good film but pointless remake

Jun 24 2007,positive,i didnt like it much i was expecting more and the leading actor liev schreiber was so stoic it was like he was trying to convey emotions but couldnt   but anyway i still give 35 stars because i liked the movie in itself it was just the  other things that i didnt like still prefer the original a lot more 
Jun 24 2007,positive,just saw it recentlymuch better than the original i think very good

Jun 24 2007,negative,rubbish real life actual rubbish
Jun 24 2007,negative,obviously pales in comparison to the original  that aside im convinced that watching schreiber and stiles try to act could be considered cruel and unusual punishment in some societies

Jun 24 2007,neutral,this movie was all hype it wasnt that scary
Jun 24 2007,positive,i like some of the polished up and dramatic deaths but the acting wasnt that great

Jun 23 2007,positive,better than the original
Jun 23 2007,positive,that little kid is an amazingly great actor creepiest stir
Jun 23 2007,positive,ahh this omen scares me not so much as like grudge scary but like demon and real stuff scary i think its a good scary movie and you should see it not as good as the original but it was still a lot better than the recent reboots of the horror genre classics see the texas chainsaw massacre or amittyville horror
Jun 23 2007,positive,scary liev schreibers performance is what made it so good
Jun 23 2007,positive,my first date with my current boyfriendon 6606
Jun 23 2007,negative,lot of money wasted making the same movie twice

Jun 23 2007,positive,alright the original was cheesy but so was this one
Jun 23 2007,positive,ahh this omen  scares me not so much as like grudge scary but like demon and real stuff scary i think its a good scary movie and you should see it
Jun 23 2007,negative,ignore this see the first one
Jun 23 2007,positive,this movie shows the prophecy from the book of revelation that provides a map to a terrifying future which points to the begginning of armagedon not very beliveablebut quite intersting and entertainning
Jun 23 2007,positive,not bad for a remake
Jun 23 2007,neutral,a fair enough remake of the old one sticking pretty close to its original the cast seemed a bit out of place but the ominous was present way too much red before impending disasters kind of gave it away just a fair film
Jun 23 2007,negative,an unnecessary remake
Jun 23 2007,positive,saw it long ago all i remember now about it is that i felt it overated at the time
Jun 23 2007,neutral,a decent remake with a few genuinely disturbing scenes  what i dont understand is how the death of julia stiles which shouldve been absolutely terrifying managed to fall so flat  disappointing really

Jun 23 2007,neutral,could have been better not bad though
Jun 23 2007,positive,mia farrow freaks me out in this one cinematography is good but still the originals will always stay the best
Jun 23 2007,negative,i thought this movie was a spoof of the first omen until i noticed leslie nielson wasnt in the film  why do filmmakers feel compelled to take perfectly well done movies made in the 50s  70s and redo them with all the bells and whistles and yet have a terrible screenplay and plot  the only reason i have two stars is because julia stiles character died that always makes me happy
Jun 23 2007,negative,you have to see the original much better than this one

Jun 23 2007,positive,not nearly as good as the original
Jun 23 2007,positive,size3if you have seen the original you have basically almost seen them all for those who havent they might find it more suspenseful than others there were two death scenes that were updated one was more bloody and gory than the original and the other one was rather dull and less shocking julia stiles seemed nervous with her entire performance in the film i was never a fan of liev schreiber so i thought his acting was just average what surprised me was that mia farrow played well as damiens nanny and evil protector id have to admit that there were two specific scenes that made me gasped first was the dream sequence of the mothers and second was the graveyard scene with a vicious dog to sum it all up this remake was not a complete duplicate of the original when it came to the disturbing images but it was when it came to the screenplay and direction size                img    size3bmemorablebsizesize3b quoteb the same quote as the originalsize

Jun 22 2007,negative,theres some decent kills in this flick otherwise its pretty boring

Jun 22 2007,negative,when i watched this film at the cinema i thought it was great with lots of horrific twists and deaths and really clever stories  however after watching the origional i started to see what people meant when they said that it was a waste of time  like most other horror remakes hardly anythings different  its all the same justnewer  why do they insist on continuing to fill our cinemas with this absolute bullshit  the main actor is very weak in this new film compared to the old one liev i think the new guys name was and although the little kid in the 2006 one was scaryhe was too obviously scary  if i took one look at that child i would of thrown him in the oven and locked it shut while turning up the heat to a hot 200 degrees

Jun 16 2007,positive,i really wouldve liked this film better had it not be completely mimicked of the original film this remake is shot for shot accurate with the original and i feel that its a bit stupid 30 years later and we couldnt snazz it up a bit with more camera creativity i love the acting and the aura of the film is just crazy but i feel that it is way too derivative or its 1970s counterpart yes i understand that the movie is a remake but even remakes have bigger improvements that are in compliance of the current present style and technology    i was pleased that current events were pieced within the film to make the story seem more interesting but thats more of an addition not a different view of how the director would see it the whole point of a remake is to see the movie in an entirely different perspective of how this director would have done the film not use his copying machine to piece it together shot for shot    overall pleases the eye gets emotions out and leaves you chilled out but in the end if youve seen the original dont waste you money to see it again with different actors

Jun 14 2007,negative,five years ago senior american diplomat robert thornes liev schreiber wife katherine julia stiles had a delivery that resulted in the death of their newborn child the thing is she doesnt know anything about it the hospital priest father spiletto giovanni lambardo radice convinced robert to take and raise another child born that same night whose mother died during delivery the childs name damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick years pass and damien is happy as well as healthy everything appears perfect that is until now beginning at his birthday party where his nanny commits suicide the occurrences continue with warnings from a strange priest father brennan pete poslethwaite claiming robert must defeat the son of the devil as the story progresses and more out of the normal events take place robert slowly begins to piece together the puzzle and realize the horrid truth damien is no ordinary child he is none other than the antichrist it is then he learns that in order to stop the dreadful catastrophe yet to occur he must kill his own son or so who he believed to be his own    sounds interesting doesnt it perhaps it might be if the exact story hadnt been told in theaters thirty years ago there lies one of the problems with this extremely unnecessary remake of the omen it is so similar in almost every way its disappointingly scary aside from a few death scenes and an added sixteen second dream sequence the only real difference here is the characters have cell phones digital cameras  the internet    the other problem the acting it was so close to grisly it just barely slides by as mediocre julia stiles certainly did not amaze by any means it isnt until shortly before we last see her that she almost manages to get a hold of her character and begin to come through possibly her next role as glenna in edmond being released next week in select theaters will suit her better and give her a chance to shine    i really wanted this remake to surpass its predetermined godawfulness but it didnt director john moore tried to go a good job here but was unable to succeed what he couldnt seem to grasp is when you remake a film youre supposed to bring and present the same feeling and likeness the initial movie contained while still making it your own and adding your own print to it not rehash the same one and wrap it in a new package he wanted to bring back a classic horror film and make it great all over again but it didnt just happen the fact its practically scene for scene the same as the original is mindlessly idiotic heed my words see the original 1976 omen not this lousy remake in it youll find far better acting and an overall more enjoyable viewing experience     originally written on jul 8 06
Jun 14 2007,positive,classic  awesome
Jun 14 2007,positive,didnt hold my attentionit ws still ok thoughi liked the camera work alot though

Jun 14 2007,positive,remake that invovles new actors but the rest is pretty much the exact same
Jun 14 2007,negative,i liked how they kept the storyline almost identical to the original but loved the updated special effects
Jun 14 2007,negative,the casting wasnt great julia styles simply sat around sobbing while damien was frozen in a stare weak film
Jun 14 2007,positive,not very scary but it did make me laugh overall not a very good movie
Jun 14 2007,positive,it was suppose to scare me but it made me laugh anyway i enjoyed it
Jun 14 2007,positive,this wasnt bad for a remake  some of the set piecesdeaths were filmed better than the original  but it wasnt as atmospheric as the original and the music wasnt as good as the original but still not bad as remakes go  was a bit ticked off by the swapping of the devil dog why start with a black alsatian at the party then switch to the rottwieller why not use one or other right through like the original film did  nice that they gave harvey stephens a cameo role too 
Jun 13 2007,positive,i loved the red against the white whenever julia stiles was on screen
Jun 13 2007,positive,the original was better but this is still a decent film
Jun 13 2007,negative,the original was so much better
Jun 13 2007,negative,as far as i knew the point to a remake was to improve on its forefather or make its own spin for the greater good of entertainment this is something i havent found in 95 of them and the omen is a perfect example of why im convinced that hollywood will never ever learn first off what made the original work was the fact that we learned about a married couple played wonderfully by gregory peck and lee remick got to know them and felt scared for them when the shite hit the fan here the two leads seemed like a couple that barely started dating they had nothing in terms of chemistry and i didnt feel an ounce of sympathy or fear am i supposed to believe theyve been married for years i didnt so i watched a movie that ive seen before except with glossier sets noe one to root for and drawn out scenes i will admit i jumped once or twice but they were for simple jump at you scares without any build up at all the role of damien was also sloppy the kid in the original was ambiguous wasnt shown much and stood out by being subtle all the kid did here was make funny faces and acted like a brat that couldve used a good spanking they also filled the movie with a couple of nowhere dream sequences which were obviously there to fill up clock time and give you jump scares john moore made the movie look like a painting and glossy but has no handle on suspense development or involvement maybe if he was helming an arthouse movie liev schreiber does good but doesnt hold a candle to peck julia stiles didnt work for this part like at all she looked way too young and her role was that wellwritten mia farrow did well but was hardly in the movie david thewlis is an awesome actor and here was no exception congrats dude for making me give a crap when i shouldnt have pete postlethwaite shows up in a shamfully humorous bit and seamus daveyfitzpatrick annoyed me anytime he popped up im supposed to be scared of this kid whatever anything i liked ill admit the beginning of the movie was pretty gnarly tying damiens birth into world disasters the sets were impressive and although i knew what was coming in terms of deaths there were a couple of different takes on them that were pretty cool but this movie did nothing for me in terms of making me care or getting me scared when compared to the original it just makes me holler in pity just watch the original and avoid this one the former sentence seems to be a catchphrase of mine as of recent i am officially sick to death of remakes
Jun 13 2007,neutral,bull shit  good deaths
Jun 13 2007,negative,not as good as i hoped
Jun 13 2007,negative,the original was better
Jun 13 2007,negative,not as good as the original poor liev
Jun 13 2007,negative,wow how do you screw this one up  and liev schreiber is probably my favorite actor right now  disappointed
Jun 13 2007,positive,this movie overall was ok the whole movie was about how this child was the spawn of the devil but the ending was horrible because there was all this build up for nothing do not want to give it away
Jun 13 2007,negative,it was alrightbut was made weak by the kid that played damien come on they could have at least picked a kid that was somewhat creepy the beheading was amazing and the only reason i give this two and a half stars
Jun 13 2007,positive,i saw this opening night it was okay not as good as i thought it would be
Jun 13 2007,negative,this movie confused me  i never understood why everyone thought the kid was so scary  he never killed anyonebad things just happened around him  it was kind of dumb  and yes i did see it on 6606 haha
Jun 13 2007,negative,this film is weird i was forced to watch seriously three omen films not a fan
Jun 13 2007,negative,just wasnt as creepy as the original
Jun 13 2007,positive,this was a pretty good movie
Jun 13 2007,positive,entertaining but pretty much average
Jun 13 2007,negative,bad acting bad horror bad ending
Jun 13 2007,positive,i liked the original better
Jun 13 2007,negative,awful awful movie and a giant wast of time you get to the end of the movie and just wonder why you just sat there for 2 hours
Jun 13 2007,positive,good movie on its own but offers nothing new or better over the original
Jun 13 2007,positive,this kept up with the original mia farrow and liev schrieber brought the film up to speed julia stiles was the weak link
Jun 13 2007,positive,this movie was pretty good
Jun 13 2007,positive,it was ok but not all that
Jun 13 2007,positive,i watched this on tvso creepy
Jun 13 2007,positive,this movie was so scary because it based everything on real life and before we watched it we saw signs everywhere we honestly thought it was the end of the world lol oh and during the movie there was one part where i swear everyone in the theater jumped the guy beside me said they are going to kill us all by giving us a heartattack lol thats the most rememorable part of that movie
Jun 13 2007,negative,some scenes were a little creepy but the movie as a whole was very disappointing
Jun 13 2007,positive,that kid was scary as fuck
Jun 13 2007,positive,anyone with the name of that little kidfreaks me out great moviekinda weird but good
Jun 13 2007,positive,really creepy good remake though
Jun 13 2007,negative,i feel like there was hardly any dialouge in this moviethere was really no suspense in thisat least from my viewpointit was mostly hype its a really jacked up storyline and towards the end it was looking like a regular scifi horror film effects special complete with a crazy lady with a sledge hammer screaming in the rainlittle kid screaminga crummy car chase and a repetitive poem recited over and over again    at one point i felt like i was watching star wars iii revenge of the sith and then at another instant the manchurian candidate it was fine movielike i said beforei think it lacks dialougetheres really no background storyits a bit fast paceda couple of nice camera shotssome tidbits to think abouta couple of crazy stuff in the movie but other than that i dont think it was worth the almost 10 i paid for it    mostly hypeabout 4 parts that might make you jumpmaybe if youre going to go see itthink twicemaybe see something elsemaybe cars or the breakup would be better at least i think so i kept on thinking the manchurian candidatedue to liev schreiber being in the moviei kept on saying look its raymond shawraymond shaw the omen so yeah really think about it
Jun 13 2007,negative,you will shriek in horror as you watch this awfully cheesy movie that was so desperate to get publicity that it used the premier on 060606  the boy who would be the future antichrist wears a 666 on his head as if that would make the date rather  fitting  i am equally surprised why they didnt create a movie about me to release on 070707 since i actually have a seven on my head    the 666 is overused and until you actually see the antichrist i suppose that movie makers will come up with more nonsensical movies about the antichrist  the boy sports such a sadistic look but really doesnt do anything else usually what happens to the other characters could be attributed to by chance  this has to be one of the worst movies i ever watched  the nanny is creepy and not in a good scary movie way  the hanging is quite awful because it looks more like a bungee jump gone wrong  i believe that julia stiless career must have plummeted and that next she will try modeling because any serious actor or actress in this movie has just become a joke  i was annoyed by the awful stunts performed by the mother like standing on the step ladder and then she crashes down  her dreams are equally as laughable they consist of looking at random images and then this massive vibrating noise to scare us  the noise made me shiver but quite honestly i was not impressed or afraid  the movie does not give the dreams the attention they should  in fact i could argue that harry potters dreams are more scary in their lucid details  i would recommend this movie if you are bored lost all of your movies let me guessdamien destroyed them could not go to your local blockbuster and had to write your own critique about a movie due tomorrow  they basically remade the first omen and added terrible dream sequences and several recent stories to prove revelation  really watch the first omen and breathe a sigh of relief at real art and not a hack tribute
Jun 13 2007,neutral,this movie definetly caught my attention from the get go  very jumpy and very catchy  i would definetly watch this again
Jun 13 2007,positive,that kid was messed up but the movie was a great horror ahhh i havent seen it since but i want to
Jun 13 2007,negative,wasnt scary at all
Jun 13 2007,negative,so lame and the poor child is going to go through so much crap growing up in school just for a lame movie
Jun 13 2007,negative,the dogs made me jump what a pile of crap
Jun 13 2007,positive,that kid will have serious issues when he grows up bc no one can act like the child antichrist  the way he did and come out clean
Jun 13 2007,positive,this wasnt as good as the orginal but i think it followed the story pretty well it was a pretty good updated version
Jun 13 2007,positive,as i didnt see the old one i think that this movie is good
Jun 13 2007,negative,its not scary at all you will insted laugh
Jun 13 2007,negative,horrible remake i already didnt like julia stiles now istill dont like her the original was infinitely better  why did they remake it oh yeahmoney
Jun 13 2007,positive,alright movie never saw the original so cant compare them
Jun 13 2007,negative,terrible absolutely awful
Jun 13 2007,positive,better than new production
Jun 13 2007,positive,remakes are they ever better
Jun 13 2007,negative,should never have been remade  just ugh
Jun 13 2007,positive,very disturbing full of surprises at some parts makes me want to pray hard  back to church
Jun 13 2007,negative,i have to give the omen a c i didnt really like it the start of the movie was bad with the showings of the war 911 tsunami were just dumb it didnt need to be there and it just seemed stupid the casting was okay however julia stiles playing the mother shouldnothavebeendone she looks way too young to be a mother to that boy especially when the guy who plays the husband looks like hes in his 40s the movie was slow at times and felt too long the dialogue wasnt that good and people were laughing at some of the scenes i got scared and jumped a few times but nothing earth shattering the ending was disappointing it just wasnt a good movie i wouldnt recommend it
Jun 13 2007,positive,compared to the slew of horror films being released out there now this ones pretty good the kid who plays the devil child is one of the best child actors out thereits hard to believe that a child so young can act so creepy parts of the movie actually made me jump something even the exorcist couldnt do the sheer stupidity of the ending will make you want to bang your head against a wall though
Jun 13 2007,positive,havent seen the new one but the old ones scared me a lot when i was i child
Jun 12 2007,neutral,it was okay  not nearly the kind of scaryish movie i was expecting but it had good jumpmoments
Jun 12 2007,positive,while being almost the exact movie as the original this one features phoned in performances and a abercrombie and fitch lookin kid
Jun 12 2007,positive,a desent enough remake as far as remakes go  the decapitation was awesome
Jun 12 2007,positive,i saw this in theaters on 6606  it was scary but the first was better

Jun 12 2007,positive,over rated not that scary
Jun 12 2007,positive,the ending was disappointing i dislike endings that end without thinking
Jun 12 2007,negative,this was a completely pointless remake  if youre going to bother remaking a film bring something new to the table other than improved special effects  oh wait  the original didnt need special effects to be  heh  effective  just watch the original and see the same film done much better and with a much better cast
Jun 12 2007,positive,scared the living shit out of me
Jun 12 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Jun 12 2007,positive,i had to clean the theater on 6606666not cool the movie was kinda wack but had some decent jumps
Jun 12 2007,neutral,i didnt like it too muchit wasnt bad it wasnt great  but  i expected it to be scarywhich it definitely wasnt  i laughed through parts of it like when that guy got his head chopped off   and i didnt like the ending
Jun 12 2007,positive,just average not amazing not horrible
Jun 12 2007,positive,very creepygave me nightmares must see
Jun 12 2007,negative,i think i fell alseep watching it  which makes it on par with the original

Jun 12 2007,positive,excellent remake  even scarier than the first
Jun 12 2007,positive,this movie was so messed up  glad my birthday isnt on 6606
Jun 12 2007,positive,the original was way better
Jun 12 2007,negative,what a pile of crap the only reason this film was ever released was to cash in on its release date 6606 watch the original and avoid this one at all costs
Jun 12 2007,positive,scary and funny to me
Jun 12 2007,positive,no way as good as the original but was still ok
Jun 12 2007,positive,damian was sooo cute in this movie
Jun 12 2007,positive,interesting plot not too scary though only the occasional popupoutofnowhere things
Jun 12 2007,negative,the only scary bits of this remake were the sections that that were added otherwise every scene is shot identically to the original these new scenes only shock becuase of the lazy use of dream sequences cgi and loud music and if youre going to keep everything else the same why the hell change such an iconic soundtrack lazy and flawed
Jun 12 2007,negative,not as good as the original  set in london but so obviously not filmed there  its one of those films that is only worth watching on the big screen as it relies so heavily on scary fx
Jun 12 2007,negative,loved the original but was disappointd in the remake the only thing this had going for it was the special effects in the gorygross scenes and the crazy lady with the axehilarious scene
Jun 12 2007,positive,very good  wow that kid is evil
Jun 12 2007,negative,yea i dont remember much about the movie so it couldnt have been that good  the original is hard to beat
Jun 12 2007,positive,it wasnt all that bad id like to see the original and compare
Jun 12 2007,positive,this new collection is nothing like the old versions
Jun 12 2007,neutral,one of the scary movies i dare to watch
Jun 12 2007,positive,it was i thought scarey but good
Jun 12 2007,negative,this remake sux assgo see the original

Jun 11 2007,negative,ive seen this movie but dont want to see it again
Jun 11 2007,negative,i think i wanted to laugh i do like stiles but this one made her very wooden so the priests were satanists or they didnt know that the child was the devils son and killed the actual child of the father
Jun 11 2007,positive,i had high hopes for this this was a movie that deserved to be reamade well and could have been easily unfortunatly it is nothing more than a complete copy of the first with maybe 4 new scares thown in
Jun 11 2007,positive,good movie but i would of killed him as soon as i knew he was a product of evil
Jun 11 2007,positive,i swear this is almost a shot for shot remake of the original
Jun 11 2007,positive,i laughed so hard at this movie
Jun 11 2007,positive,better than the first
Jun 11 2007,neutral,alright other than the awesome graphics did anyone check out the scene where the guy gets his head severed this movie made me so angry the kid come on we could have used a little bit more creepy emotion if youre going to be the son of satan i know youre supposed to be this naive solemn child but dang lets get some acting classes kthnx
Jun 11 2007,positive,this movie was really good it wasnt really scarey but more of a mystery sort of
Jun 11 2007,neutral,creepy but really slow  leaves a lot to be desired
Jun 11 2007,neutral,the only reason it was somewhat good was for a good laugh its really a funny not scary movie
Jun 11 2007,positive,good movie although the photos that showed how each person would die was a sort of final destination take off
Jun 11 2007,positive,was creepy and the subject interests me definately worth a rental
Jun 11 2007,negative,silly uninspired and overdependent on cheap jump moments the ending was a sickening setup for the sequel sure it has scary moments but you leave the theatre lacking the thrill that should come from watching a good antichrist themed horror flick
Jun 11 2007,positive,i like the omen this new and improved one made it easier to follow and understand there is a need to update the other ones too
Jun 11 2007,positive,that is a amazing movie very suspenseful and scary and kind of weird but o well p
Jun 11 2007,negative,i wasnt to thrilled with this moviei thought the acting could have been a bit more believeable and the story line has been ran into the ground
Jun 11 2007,neutral,it wasnt that good really possibly worth the 750 entry fee just
Jun 11 2007,negative,terrible the only part i liked was when damien went crazy in the car and clawed his moms face this was amusing due to the obvious poor acting skills
Jun 11 2007,negative,i was the exact same thing at the original  that was sooo lamme
Jun 11 2007,positive,that was a nice remake
Jun 11 2007,negative,not that great no where near as good as the original this was only made with money in mind
Jun 11 2007,negative,watch the original instead
Jun 11 2007,negative,i expected more out of this movie they could have done so much more with the technology that we have now days but they fell short of that there were a few good scares but the main source of fear was my own anticipation not what was in the movie
Jun 11 2007,positive,freaked me out that will probably end up as my child lol
Jun 11 2007,negative,cant touch the original
Jun 11 2007,positive,scared the crap out of me
Jun 11 2007,negative,why would mia farrow agree to do this horrible remake after her performance in rosemarys baby was so legendary
Jun 11 2007,positive,it was a good movie that i frankly avoided because im not much into the horror game  it was more of a thriller than i thought it would be never seen the original and although creepy in spots it wasnt what i would call scary because the gross bits always had a huge predictable precurser  i actually liked that because like i said i like thrillers not into slashers  i can see how that might turn off diehardhorror fans tho  it was nice to see julia stiles in a different sort of role for her shes believable once you get past her previous roles  overall it was quite enjoyable i wouldnt object to seeing it again
Jun 11 2007,positive,that child is creepy pretty scary
Jun 11 2007,neutral,great suspense and effects
Jun 11 2007,negative,i cant believe they remade a classic
Jun 11 2007,positive,ill agree with others that the movie is really not much different at all from the original but i cant deny that i love john moores visual style as seen in behind enemy lines and flight of the phoenix  i really dont think this movie is scary though and thats what it really needed to even try and top the original
Jun 11 2007,positive,i like julia stiles just not in this that kid was creepy as hell though
Jun 11 2007,positive,that kid is still creepy
Jun 11 2007,positive,this remake takes on the devils point of view in the revelations saga schreiber is an underrated actor in hollywood much to do with his primary focus being the stage i am a fan of biblical supernatural films and this fits the bill i enjoyed this film more than the davinci code which isnt saying a lot but with the attrocity that is the left behind series films this a defnite step up
Jun 11 2007,positive,kill the fucking brat now
Jun 11 2007,negative,hell scary doesnt make u think as hard
Jun 11 2007,positive,not really a worthy update quite pointless in my opinion
Jun 11 2007,negative,stupidwaste of money and it wasnt scary
Jun 11 2007,positive,this new version feels like final destination 
Jun 10 2007,negative,man this movie sucked
Jun 10 2007,negative,final destination 4with the antichrist
Jun 10 2007,positive,fantastic remake of the original but doesnt top it
Jun 10 2007,negative,really not a good movienot even that scary
Jun 10 2007,negative,didnt mind it but felt it was nothing special either
Jun 10 2007,positive,decent movie but that night was crazy
Jun 10 2007,neutral,pretty good a few good jumps
Jun 10 2007,neutral,not as good as the original
Jun 10 2007,positive,its as boring as the original but it looks cooler and it has julia stiles and it actually has some decent scares
Jun 10 2007,positive,i love this movie even though it freaked me out damien is really cute but his glares are really scary and it creeped me out even more cause every1 kept saying he looked like adam my little brother
Jun 10 2007,negative,the complete opposite of the amityville remake  brings absolutely nothing new to the table and greatly weakens the plot
Jun 10 2007,positive,dissapointed why do we keep redoing classic movies
Jun 10 2007,positive,not as good as the original but definitely far better than i would have expected
Jun 10 2007,negative,wtf seriously wtf
Jun 10 2007,positive,movies with evil and demons are always great
Jun 10 2007,neutral,the originals were better and the overabundance of the symbolic use of red reminded me too much of silence of the lambs
Jun 10 2007,positive,actually not too shabby like the original better though
Jun 10 2007,neutral,the originals were better and the overabundance of the symbolic use of the color red reminded me too much of silence of the lambs
Jun 10 2007,positive,the baby iz fuckin ugly that iz the only part that made me scarred
Jun 10 2007,positive,the origanal was better
Jun 10 2007,negative,the old one is better the story line is the same and everything but i just dont like remakes
Jun 10 2007,negative,kind of like not scary the original was better
Jun 10 2007,positive,awessome movie really bone chilling
Jun 10 2007,negative,original is so much better the only good things in this film is julia stiles and the kid
Jun 10 2007,positive,not as good as the original but it wasnt terrible either
Jun 10 2007,negative,great until the ending  like most movies
Jun 10 2007,positive,that kid is just creepy and thats all i can say
Jun 10 2007,negative,ok but the original was better i did like how true they stayed to the original
Jun 10 2007,negative,its exactly the same as the originalwhich wasnt that scary
Jun 10 2007,positive,i liked this updated version except for some of the cheap scare tactics that only young screaming teens love i also thought julia stiles was miscast here and mia farrows portrayal was too sickly sweetanybody whose that nice is always up to no good imo and very suspicious should have played it more indifferent
Jun 10 2007,positive,i love his lil smirk at the end its so cute and evil kinda mwahhahaish
Jun 10 2007,positive,funny not scary liek most people think
Jun 10 2007,negative,this flick was gorgeous but empty it should have been a lot scarier and not so careful to copy the original shotforshot
Jun 10 2007,positive,the thing that i loved about the movie was the symbolism the incorporation of red and white the whole its mother was a jackal line and the poem a few things could have been worked on and tweaked up so that they wouldnt appear so cheesy but it is a remake of an older movie so it has to retain some of the original in it or it will fail as a remake ive never seen the original so i have nothing to compare it to the thing that annoyed me was the mothers quick decision to abort the baby it seemed so unrealistic and strange actually julia stiles seemed to fail as an actress to me in this movie other than that pretty cool
Jun 10 2007,negative,it was not scary at all
Jun 10 2007,negative,this movie made me more sad than anything else i didnt find it suspenseful or scary
Jun 10 2007,positive,freakin awesome the kid is scary as hell
Jun 10 2007,positive,very scary  until you see the original and then realize its literally identical
Jun 10 2007,negative,this movie was awful  there is no other way to put it i felt bad for julia stiles because she is such a talented actress the original is much better dont even bother with this movie
Jun 10 2007,positive,i wanted to punch that little bastard in the face
Jun 10 2007,positive,it just seemed to lack something
Jun 10 2007,negative,was any of this film actually original not really sure what the actual point of this was except the child who played damien did it a lot better than the 70s one     in fact thats nearly the only good thing i have to say about this film the performances mostly were good and the little boy was almost creepy     but thats the thing this film is not scary at all the cgi for the deaths were pathetic they didnt look real at all the constant use of red also got very annoying and unnecessary towards the end i couldnt wait for the film to finish because it was just painful seriously just pick one of them and forget abut the other one because they are both exactly the same film except for the fact that this obviously doesnt look so old
Jun 10 2007,negative,hollywood needs to stop with the remakes argh it gets half a star because julia stiles was in it and i think she is hot
Jun 10 2007,positive,interesting but not that memorable
Jun 10 2007,positive,saw way past the 6606 but i thought it was pretty goodnever saw the others but i enjoyed it someone besides juila stiles mights helped it
Jun 10 2007,negative,waste of my time worst remake ever saw it on opening night and the people that came with me walked out
Jun 9 2007,negative,worst remake ever we saw it on 6606 and it was packedand everyone laughed out loud when the little kid was trying to look evil or sinister or whatever total crap
Jun 9 2007,positive,it wasnt scary my opinion
Jun 9 2007,neutral,i like the original more
Jun 9 2007,negative,the original left a much more lasting impression  still this remake of the 1976 classic had its moments making it worth a look see for all the horror fans of the world  gory in spots and not as scary as the original it still may give you a bit of a spin tingle when watching in the dark
Jun 9 2007,negative,pathetic attempt and this is coming from a big fan of the relihorror genre i guess the kid was really freaky so props for picking a good actor
Jun 9 2007,negative,wow this kid reminds me of my cousin but yeah he was seriously just not scary truly disappointing he was the least intimidating six year old demon child probably to ever grace the screen
Jun 9 2007,negative,absolutely pointless and laughable
Jun 9 2007,positive,wanna smack this little kid in this movie  but very good movie
Jun 9 2007,positive,a decent remake but i cannot help but feel it really wasnt needed when the original is so timeless
Jun 9 2007,neutral,ehdidnt thrill me
Jun 9 2007,positive,be scared be very scared the prince of darkness is upon us and he wants it all
Jun 9 2007,neutral,not as good as the original
Jun 9 2007,negative,the older one was alot better
Jun 9 2007,positive,well i enjoyed this movie first i just like horror movies second im just interested in this sort of thing you know the whole demonology and possession thing yea thats how i roll basically in this movie the antichrist is born and throughout this story you follow the quest of a man trying to put an end to his reign pretty good movie it is recommendednow go read some of my other reviewsthey are really good

Jun 9 2007,negative,mia farrow is awesome julia stiles was not believable
Jun 9 2007,negative,im making it a duty of mine to check out films a lot of people have seen i like any sort of movie famous or not but its always nice when i can connect with people when movies are discussed as such i figured the omen was a pretty famous tale and something most people had seen whats more i heard it was good so i waited for a while to see if id get the chance to see the 1976 version because it seemed like it was on tv every now and then the chance didnt arise though i did happen upon the 2006 remake on ondemand however i was surprised but figured i may as well watch it i prefer checking out originals before the remakes but i heard the remake was terrible i reasoned with myself that i would enjoy the remake more if i wasnt biased toward the original well ive still not seen the original and i have to say i rate the remake higher because of that its still not a very good movie though     let me begin by saying i am not at all opposed to horror movies that arent just mindless killing thoughtful horror movies have the chance to win me over just as much as wildly gory movies it depends on how good they are individually im completely unbiased when it comes to that some people would probably tell me im too young and too accustomed to the movies of today to understand the omen but that accusation holds no water the omen 2006 is just a bad movie it has apparently good source material and some nice effects but its still a bad movie overall     maybe thats because kate is unbearable and robert isnt exciting at all kate was just obnoxious throughout most of the film like when she asked damien to turn off his video game because it was driving her crazy do something about it yourself kate leave the room let damien have his fun her character really drove me up the wall and i have to say i was hoping there wouldnt be a miracle rescue when mrs baylock and damien came to murder her as soon as movies get me wishing a certain character would die you know theyre bad movies unless the effect is deliberate david of shaun of the dead anyone movies shouldnt really have you hoping their characters will die least of all the protagonists     robert thorn was not a compelling character at all i got the sense that he was being played by a decent actor but only very rarely did he show any emotion those times being when something major was happening like discovering his sons dead body attempting to kill damien or when he learned that kate was dead otherwise though he seemed unnaturally cool about everything that was occurring in the movie as has been said many times before armageddon has never been so boring     damiens creepiest moments were when he was simply staring at things and making things go berserk when he himself attempted to do things the creepy aura immediately vanished like the scooter running into kate the music was incredibly tense and dramatic like something momentous was about to happen well sure damien just knocked his mother off the edge but still it was a slight action youd think some epic battle was about to happen as the music grew louder and louder and more ominous     my favorite moment of the movie was probably the beginning the idea of adopting the motherless child was a pretty clever one but i suppose i shouldnt give credit to the 2006 version i wouldnt know but seeing as how everyone claims this remake is a blowbyblow of the original i assume this happened in the original as well which means its really the idea of the original not the remakewell whichever film came up with it its a smart exposition even i knew coming into this movie that the central concept was the child of satan so when robert thorn learned that his son was dead i was amazed i thought it was damien because i had no reason to believe otherwise smart     i never much liked dogs honestly for a while i was deathly afraid of them after my friends unfriendly collie came after me i know collies arent frightening but i was small and it was big and it was coming after me after a while i realized not all dogs are bloodthirsty monsters but i still was and still am a bit sketchy around them if i can help it ill avoid them but back on topic the dogs were the most frightening parts of this movie for me and unintentionally so evidently they were supposed to be menacing but they still scared me more than any part of the movie especially the first one sitting there as the hanging took place very creepy however thats pretty pathetic when black snarling dogs scare me more than the son of satan himself     even without seeing the omen 1976 i can tell a lot was lost in translation when the omen was remade i have to give it credit for the amusing 060606 release date but still it wasnt a very good movie it has a bit more substance to it than most horror films but its still only a betterlooking version of the probably superior original i will need to check out the original sometime soon if only to see this interesting story done properly for now ill settle on a 4 out of 10 for this omen decent but not decent enough

Jun 6 2007,positive,it was a good movie but not scary
Jun 6 2007,neutral,i would have never seen this if it hadnt been released on 6606 and in turn become a social event honestly however the folks in the row behind us were more entertaining if youre going to remake a movie change something  have we learned nothing from gus van sants psycho
Jun 6 2007,neutral,basically a shotforshot remake of the original 76 omen  which is by all rights an infinitely superior film i thought it was ok  couldve been a lot worse we all know how shotforshot remakes can go  gus im looking in your direction  if you ever try to remake a hithcock flick again i swear to god  youve been warned

Jun 6 2007,positive,ok not as good as the first one
Jun 6 2007,negative,julia stiles as a parent is very weird for me she does even worse as a mother then as a lover her trying to show emotion for her child is probably the scariest thing of the movie she should stop acting poor liev schreiber he has to act alongside her
Jun 6 2007,negative,just as boring as the original
Jun 6 2007,positive,scared the crap out of me
Jun 6 2007,negative,the original is better this one tries too hard
Jun 6 2007,negative,boo remakes  this is no exception  if you want to see this see the original instead and save yourself the pain of a crappy remake of a perfectly good original
Jun 6 2007,positive,a faithful remake but the changes were mostly needless and the cast although talented does not compare to that of the original
Jun 6 2007,negative,i fastforwarded through the whole movie and still didnt get anything out of it
Jun 6 2007,positive,very scary the first time i watched it young and impresionnable then now old and impressionable

Jun 6 2007,negative,hahha such a stupid movie  the only exciting thing about this was that it came out on 666 pfft it was all hype and no talent
Jun 6 2007,positive,80s horror is really the best i still find this movie suspenseful
Jun 6 2007,negative,this pales in comparison to the original with gregory peck
Jun 6 2007,positive,some of it was laughable why must there always be jump scenes but there were some very unsettling moments as well a nice little gothic story driven movie
Jun 6 2007,positive,i like the ending when the kid turns around and smiles hes so creepy
Jun 6 2007,positive,i really want to watch the old one but i liked it
Jun 6 2007,negative,very very bad remake of this movie  i laughed duringwell pretty much all of this  the best parts of this movie were as follows  1 the dog attacking the photographer and robert thorn  2 how the photographer died i actually replayed this scene about 15 times before i finished watching the movie  2 how the psycho nanny died i once again replayed this scene about 15 times before i finished watching the movie
Jun 6 2007,neutral,the origonal is wayyyyy better
Jun 6 2007,positive,my favorite classic horror film disturbing to the max the remake is more jumpy and scary this one just disturbs you out of your mind
Jun 6 2007,negative,a terrible remake of a film that i already didnt like it felt like it lasted about six hours
Jun 6 2007,positive,the little kid damien really is the cutest thing ever
Jun 6 2007,negative,crap pure and utter crap there is absolutely nothing good about this movie the cast is terrible the plot adds nothing to separate it from its original movie take my advice when coming between seeing a remake and the original always give the original the benefit of the doubt for coming up with the idea first
Jun 6 2007,positive,ohmygoodness  this movie is amazing  it has the chills and thrills that any movie should have  totally beats all of the other omen movies created other than the original
Jun 6 2007,negative,almost a scene by scene interpretation of the original that just does not work in its present form
Jun 6 2007,positive,not nearly as good as the first if for no other reason julia stiles  i still found it very enjoyable to watch however
Jun 6 2007,positive,definately creepy but the cliffhanger at the end was thoroughly disappointing

Jun 6 2007,positive,the first horror i ever watched still scares me to this day
Jun 6 2007,negative,really slow and boring
Jun 6 2007,negative,meh  watch the original
Jun 6 2007,positive,basically if you like scarycreepy movies then youll like this one

Jun 6 2007,positive,watch from the safety of a pillow

Jun 6 2007,negative,another horror remakea bit spooky in partsi wonder what the color red symbolizes
Jun 6 2007,negative,dont understand why they did this remake the original is much much much better and scarier
Jun 6 2007,positive,i though this movie was welldone very creepy
Jun 6 2007,neutral,full of cheap scares damien was very creepy and i would not want him as my child but there was a lot of over the top acting that was not needed and the whole film felt rushed and un original probably because of the hurry to get it ready for release on 6606 some interesting scenes but mostly just mindless creepiness
Jun 6 2007,negative,lets count how many times they can remake a movie
Jun 6 2007,neutral,mainly a cheesy remake but liev schreiber and david thewlis carry the movie and they carry it pretty well
Jun 6 2007,neutral,i saw the mic dropping down at least 5 times  dont they have people who check on these things

Jun 6 2007,neutral,not half as good as the original but a fair attempt
Jun 6 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still had potential  julia stiles wasnt right for the roleshe just doesnt know how to be a mother
Jun 6 2007,negative,this is an ok movie the newer one is better
Jun 6 2007,negative,the remake not so much

Jun 6 2007,neutral,orginal  good scary as shit  remake  not so good
Jun 6 2007,neutral,whoa freaked me out that little kid is nasty
Jun 6 2007,positive,really really good also people were cursed in the film and then in real life as well
Jun 6 2007,positive,i was so surprised how wicked this remake was its brilliantly directed and theres a strong cast liev schreiber pete postlethwaite and seamus daveyfitzpatrick were excellent and mia farrow brought some traditional horror to the story die hard fans of the original will probably hate it but i actually think its a great example of how remakes can be made without destroying the legacy of the original

Jun 5 2007,positive,its not a scary as i thought it would be but its still good
Jun 5 2007,positive,i fell asleep watching this movie not that it was boring i was just tired what i saw still wasnt that great but decent
Jun 5 2007,negative,the omen was really good the music was fantastic and the casting was good except that i thought damien was both better looking and creepier in the original they did a really good job at updating the film while keeping fairly close to the first version most of the death scenes were really really good but there was one where i felt ripped off and if you have seen the older version you will know exactly which one i mean there was definitely a good creep factor and since i like both julia stiles and liev schreiber this one is a winner in my book
Jun 5 2007,neutral,thought it would be better felt like it was missing something
Jun 5 2007,positive,pretty good remake  great jump moments
Jun 5 2007,neutral,it really wasnt even that scarry
Jun 5 2007,positive,creeepy but really good
Jun 5 2007,positive,great movie definitely will be watching it again and again the concept is beautiful and touches close to home to so many of us who rely on religion to save us it brings out deep fears you have hiding inside for the things you may or may not believe it
Jun 5 2007,negative,one star is for david thewlis and the other is for his amazing way to get his head knocked off in a lot of his movies

Jun 5 2007,positive,again coulda been better
Jun 5 2007,positive,more sad than scary liev and julia were great though
Jun 5 2007,positive,a lot of people seem to not like this movie but i was thoroughly impressed i thought it effortlessly combined the genres of thriller  drama there were really nice scares here and there and the overall mood of the movie was just right  really tense  dramatic great movie
Jun 5 2007,neutral,too bad what they call a jackal is actually a black german shepherd
Jun 5 2007,neutral,it was interestingly freakyi liked it
Jun 5 2007,negative,just a rehash of the old one with some special effects thrown in and a few unnecessary sequences particularly the beginning where they try to relate it to what is going on in the world pretty much every damn thing is the same the last shot pissed me off so bad liev schreiber was a good director in everything is illuminated he needs to go back to that it seemed like he was trying to do a gregory peck impression the entire time julia stiles was trying her best but was unbelievable as damiens mother the boy who played damien was entirely too creepy too the beauty of the original was how innocent he looked to the point that the audience always had in the back of their mind that maybe the father and mother really are going crazy        it had a good release date though
Jun 5 2007,negative,even though it is identical to the originalthe first was alot better
Jun 5 2007,positive,too disturbing for me

Jun 5 2007,positive,my favorite horror movie if this is the original not the remake
Jun 5 2007,positive,yay freaked my shit out

Jun 5 2007,negative,why and the films worst idea have the kid give evil looks 247 the creepiest thing about the original was that the kid looked normal so the difficulty in killing him or believing he actually was evil was that much stronger a simple poor decision crumbled the movie

Jun 5 2007,negative,the original was and will forever be better
Jun 5 2007,positive,pretty solid remake schreiber is one of my favorites but the new damian just isnt much compared to the original long story short the omen 06 is a decent flick but the omen 76 is a masterpiece if you are a fan of the franchise see it if you havent seen them start with the og

Jun 5 2007,positive,the concept and story was great just what i expect and like in a horror film since i never saw the original i assume the original was much better and creepier than this rather average remake regarding acting the little kid was decent although not as creepy as i hoped and i still cant take julia stiles seriously as an actress not to mention playing a mother in this film overall aside from the storyline i enjoyed the redonwhite visuals in the remake and cant wait to see the original

Jun 5 2007,positive,very good remake ps if your kid has the 3 6s kill him or her before its too late
Jun 5 2007,negative,horrible there are so many things wrong with this movie first the editting sucks because you can see microphones and other equipment dangling in and out of a lot of scenes plus it was a crappy remake i wasted two hours of my life and 8 dollars for a movie ticket
Jun 5 2007,positive,one of the better horror remakes to come out in the last few years manages to hit all the highpoints of the original while at the same time modernizing and upping the ante slightly

Jun 4 2007,neutral,not a scary movie at all i was really hyped up to see it however i felt somewhat dissapointed after it was definetly misiing something to make it scarier
Jun 4 2007,negative,its really impossible to watch a remake without placing it in context and comparing it to the original film which is really where this film falls short the original the omen is one of the most effective psychological visceral entries into the 60s70s satanic paranoia cycle the remake is sort of muddled and difficult to follow unless you are already familiar with the story the acting is poor especially compared to the old school badassery of gregory peck ambassador thorn in the original film    seamus daveyfitzpatrick is also no damien he is pathetic by comparison
Jun 4 2007,positive,i swear i almost had a heart attack when i saw this movie
Jun 4 2007,negative,really not a good remake the weird scare gags of julia stiles dreams are not necessary this is supposed to be a psychological horror film things like that dont work

Jun 4 2007,negative,a good beheading and not much more
Jun 4 2007,neutral,mediocre remake of on of the greatest horror films ever made  its ok because it doesnt stray from the original material much so its hard to criticize good material  unfortunately john moore brought nothing new to the mix so its ok but nothing special
Jun 4 2007,positive,i found this hilarious
Jun 4 2007,positive,amazing final destination like deaths but it has a plot
Jun 4 2007,positive,the omen is a very scarry movie when  i watched this movie my family made me watch it
Jun 4 2007,negative,wow never thought that a movie would be made just to capitalize on a specific date thats stupid
Jun 4 2007,negative,the original is soo much betterno one actually looked like they wanted to be in the movie
Jun 4 2007,positive,this is a tripped out movie that is real fun watching in the dark
Jun 4 2007,positive,ok movie i like the original version more though

Jun 4 2007,negative,i hate devil children
Jun 4 2007,positive,i liked this remake the original was good but the cinematography in this one far surpasses the old one this movie was just perfect in that sense   i also had low expectations for the movie because i liked the original but i came out surprised i really like this movie   dont hate on it because you think its cool to like the original better p
Jun 4 2007,negative,pretty lame in general but parts still managed to give me nightmares
Jun 4 2007,positive,likedthis version better than the other actually lol hes the devils son haha
Jun 4 2007,positive,a good attempt to remake the classic should have tried more to be its on film then be a shotforshot
Jun 4 2007,positive,wonderful retelling  powerful and reminiscent of the damien films thusfar
Jun 4 2007,negative,never saw the original now i dont want to this movie sucked ass despite me seeing it twice in movies

Jun 4 2007,positive,very dramatic but not that scary
Jun 4 2007,positive,the little boy in this movie scares the hell out of me awsome movie quite scary and disturbing
Jun 4 2007,neutral,not as good as the original but still a good film loved the decapitation of the photographer 
Jun 4 2007,negative,disconnected uninteresting and completely not scary the antichrist idea is interesting and should have been used in a much better way
Jun 3 2007,neutral,i dont understand why they felt like they needed to remake a classic like the omen but it isnt the total disaster i expected    the cast in particular farrow are spectacular even if schreiber and stiles have zero chemistry as a married couple    the famous gory murder set pieces of the first are nicely recreated with a bit of extra oomph and are really the highlight of the film    the script is almost the exact same as the first so it leaves the question as to why    i guess they decided to cash in on the fun june 6 2006 release date which ill admit is very clever    a rental for most
Jun 3 2007,positive,the original was better
Jun 3 2007,neutral,it was pretty good until the ending
Jun 3 2007,negative,this remake was a yawner  oh i was soooooooooooooooo scared because they released it on 6606  that was also one of the only reasons they remade this movie  leave the classics alone
Jun 3 2007,positive,jesus maybe im naive but this film made me jump on occasion definitely going to watch the original worth buying the trilogy
Jun 3 2007,negative,it was oki was disappointed tho
Jun 3 2007,negative,this movie was very pretty but terrible in every other way it was sort of like a 13 yr old wrote the script and chose his favorite high school actors to star in itand they were kind of embarrassed to be in it
Jun 3 2007,neutral,eh  another remake  maybe the director was fresh out of film school  forgive me for not doing my research
Jun 3 2007,positive,it reminded me of suspiria a bit with all the red placed in dangerous scenes
Jun 3 2007,positive,pretty darn creepy made me jump a lot
Jun 3 2007,positive,a visual masterpiece in its art direction as well as its score
Jun 3 2007,negative,i could not believe how boring this movie was i was excited for it to end truly terrible also julia stiles should probably die
Jun 3 2007,neutral,these movies freak me out  the first one was creepier
Jun 3 2007,positive,nothing compared to the original not bad though
Jun 3 2007,negative,hahahaha my favourite part was when the projector broke when i went to go see it
Jun 3 2007,positive,very good movie i love how everthing ties together but then falls apart at the end
Jun 3 2007,negative,out of all the horribly unnecessary crappy remakes of classic horror flicks this one is the shittiest i actually felt guilty after having watched it schreiber and stiles ruin the whole thing with their disconnected acting yuck yuck yuck
Jun 3 2007,negative,thought it would be better it wasnt all that badbut i still like the original version
Jun 3 2007,neutral,not as good as the firstbut hey it was good
Jun 3 2007,negative,not what it could have been still scary but lacked conviction
Jun 3 2007,positive,classic ofcourse i love it
Jun 3 2007,positive,it was so good that i will never watch it again
Jun 2 2007,negative,not good  take it from a horror movie officianado this movie dragged and lacked in every capacity
Jun 2 2007,positive,love it liev schreiber is amazing and hes a hottie best movie ever
Jun 2 2007,positive,the kid was the weak link in this movie
Jun 2 2007,neutral,lame  that little kid wouldnt have made it past an hour in the movie with most people
Jun 2 2007,positive,ick this was a very creepy show but while i havent seen the original i think they did a pretty good job on this definitely worth a look if you like to be a little freaked out
Jun 2 2007,positive,its okay but not scary at all
Jun 2 2007,positive,wht can i sayits awesome ill neva 4get this film 1 of my best

Jun 2 2007,positive,lmfaoo stupid antichrist kid
Jun 2 2007,negative,not as good as i expected it 
Jun 2 2007,negative,this movie should never have been remade  with the exception of mia farrow as ms baylock everything was just not working
Jun 2 2007,negative,what a fucking shitty movie its really not scary at all except for a couple dream sequences and thats because the director uses the played out trick of shit out of nowhere    aside from lack of horror is the atrocious acting sup julia stiles and lead male character i guess mia farrow did a serviceable job as the keeper of satans son coincidentally the child was not really scary at all he just seemed to either be staring off into space or screaming in the presence of religious symbols speaking of which hey guys theres a lot of religious symbolism just look there at that cross or this dog or whatever other heavyhanded bullshit the director wants
Jun 2 2007,positive,mediocre horror movie
Jun 2 2007,negative,the original was great this was a horrible remake it wasnt scary i found it boring and a complete waste of time

Jun 1 2007,positive,it kept me entertainedi didnt care for the ending though
Jun 1 2007,positive,good but i would so kill that child  the nannyhow could u treat ur mother like that bahaha
Jun 1 2007,positive,very lazy remake half of the script is from the original the only things they add are the nightmares which are actually quite scary
Jun 1 2007,neutral,this movie was a big dissapointment i expected more from them the kid just never talked were as in the first one he was all like i love you mommy and then he would like go crazythat was creepy in this one he just kinda stares at her wierd while he makes his pb and j also why in the hell would they change the way the mom dies the original killing of the mother is soooo scary and they just made it dull and boring with this one the one thing i did like about this tho was i liked the satanic dreams the mother had and i also liked the new way mrsbaylock diedother than that it didnt work out for me on a brighter note the visual look of the film i liked the deaths with the exception of the mothers death i liked but other than that this movie just didnt deliver the way it could have
Jun 1 2007,positive,a solid outting for the remake of the 1976 horror clasic the omen faithfully portrays the armageddon story with stylistic art direction suspenseful moods dashes of gore and wellpaced thrills its an entertaining and effective hollywood horror show and a classy revisiting with an unusually strong cast
Jun 1 2007,positive,i assume its not as good as the original but i still liked it
Jun 1 2007,positive,lol that little kid need the cheer up
Jun 1 2007,positive,a good horror but the book is much better
May 31 2007,negative,this movie was stupid they should have left it alone dumbass people
May 31 2007,negative,fucking horrible they should have just re released the original in the theater
May 31 2007,negative,arent horrors supposed to be scary so why am i laughing
May 31 2007,positive,the first half is really well made but then it crumbles and becomes a mess
May 31 2007,positive,this takes the on the edge of your seat factor to a whole new level this film will make you jump will make you scream well maybe not but it will make your stomach turn
May 31 2007,neutral,not nearly as good as the original  not even close
May 31 2007,negative,this was almost exactly like the originali didnt like it at all
May 31 2007,positive,made me so scared when i first watched this movie aged about 13 couldnt sleep for days
May 31 2007,positive,oohi personally cant cope with demonic type children good story though
May 31 2007,positive,the scooter death over the original tricycle death that sucked the rest of the movie was good though
May 31 2007,negative,everything about this film was stupid
May 31 2007,positive,you have to see this film the sort of film you and your girlfriend want to see i saw it and was impressed much better at the cinema
May 31 2007,negative,id rather watch the original wait a minute thats what they did a exact same replica of the old one they even had the same dialogue and all
May 31 2007,negative,sucked the acting was bad watch the old one its better
May 31 2007,positive,better than the first really enjoyed it 1 part scared shit of me but hey lol
May 30 2007,negative,completely and utterly worthless
May 30 2007,negative,centerimg        centerfontarialsize3img     fontarialsize3i dont know exactly what to say about last summers utterly pointless carboncopy remake of ithe omeni the original 1976 version is a classic and one of my ten favorite horror movies of alltime but this new update is so rountine and by the numbers so afraid of tarnishing the image of the original it takes few risks or gambles and delivers nothing for a payoff which is probably a sign that a remake was a pointless effort to begin with if it aint broke dont try to go fixin it for fans of the original this version delivers absolutely nothing new interesting or original and even the scares seem telegraphed from a distance actors liev schreiber and julia stiles cant hold a candle to gregory peck and lee remick in the original the only nice touch was casting mia farrow as the evil nanny good choice but i still prefer billie whitelaw over this more subtle performance director john moore is quickly building a career as a hack filmmaker with such uninspired projects as 2001s ibehind enemy linesi and 2004s remake of iflight of the phoenixi well make that a third strike to his record with this flopper of a thriller clearly im not recommending this version but i highly recommend checking out the original insteadsizefont     centerfontarialsize3img
May 30 2007,neutral,it would have been better if the writers used new materialbut it still is one of the better horror remakes out there
May 30 2007,positive,not nearly as good as the original but julia stiles does a pretty good death scene
May 30 2007,positive,i really like this movie they found the perfect child to play damien and he really made the movie creepy
May 30 2007,negative,not bad but schreiber is no peck thats for sure
May 30 2007,negative,watching this was like ticking off a checklist of scenes from the original which wasnt that great to begin with liev schreiber gives a dignified performance amidst all the dullness but any movie that relies on gimick casting mia farrow as the satanist nanny for scares doesnt deserve him
May 30 2007,neutral,scared the crap out of me
May 29 2007,negative,the entire concept of the antichrist comes from the bible  this view of him doesnt
May 29 2007,negative,remake and a very bad one at that  the antiwriter must have pined the verson
May 29 2007,positive,better than the original and david thewlis is hottttt in it so check it out
May 29 2007,positive,groundbreaking horror classic
May 29 2007,negative,i still dont understand why they remade the gregory peck original  i have three things to say having now endured this movie 1  mia farrow have you lost your mind   2  everyone involved in making a movie from the actors to the director to the crew to the writers to the producers to the caterers  all of them  should have a card with say five punches on it like a bus pass or a school lunch ticket  if you make a crappy movie your card is punched  for the first punch you are banned from having anything to do with making films for one year  your second punch for your second lousy movie means that youre banned from any aspect of the business for two years and so on up to your fifth punch  if you get the fifth and final punch on your movie biz ticket you are banned from the business for life   3  ive said it before and ill say it again  if you know the movie youre putting out for the public to pay to see is going to suck you are required by law to hire jason mewes and kevin smith to do a walk through  this will be something that the audience may come to anticipate and knowing that a movie is bad the audience might flock to your horrid project just for a chance to have a laugh when jay and silent bob walk through a scene  hey this could guarantee a higher gross as well  think positively for me the perfect place for jay and silent bob to walk through in this one would be when schreiber is hauling the kid up the church steps right near the end  jay and silent bob are exiting the church  mewes is of course smoking a cigarette as he comes out  and they hold the door open for schreiber to get the boy up to the altar in order with wholehearted approval of the audience  closeup on kevin smiths face nodding approval as well  to kill the terrible little actor we can all speculate wildly about what the two were doing in the church  in fact jay and silent bob see the police coming and continue to hold the door open for them as well  mewes of course is still smoking a cigarette  right before the good lawmen foolishly kill schreiber  close up on kevin smiths face shaking head in sorrowful disappointment  this would be a classic movie moment in the making  i am so stoked about this idea that im going to give the omen one big star because i figured out a way to make it an instantly better movie
May 29 2007,negative,up until the last five minutes this is a really scarygood movie  then it explodes into a ridiculous ending of crap and stupidity
May 29 2007,positive,want to see it again
May 29 2007,negative,the kid seemed more autistic than evil i think they just needed to enroll him in some special needs classes
May 29 2007,positive,didnt really like this one the original was way better
May 29 2007,positive,i like this movie i wudnt watch it again coz it scares me p
May 29 2007,negative,if you do a remake why make it the same az the 1st
May 29 2007,positive,haha its and ok movie  not scary as i thought it would be
May 29 2007,neutral,although there isnt much to be added from the 1976 classic there are still a few frights to be had
May 29 2007,neutral,omg the world will end
May 29 2007,negative,not scary just pathetic
May 29 2007,positive,my dad said the old one is better  even though i havent watched the old one and if i have i believe id agree with him
May 28 2007,negative,the original is better
May 28 2007,positive,i really thought this could have been better i dont know maybe im hard to please but i didnt find it scary
May 28 2007,positive,good movie could be better
May 28 2007,positive,it was totally cool but my mom says that the original was better
May 28 2007,negative,fontverdanasize2in a world where remakes reign supreme the omen was created on a whim of neat ideas the foresight to realize there would be a 6606 date in the future that would be perfect as a gimmick casting that links this effort with its predacessor and the presence of the devil to create a solid foundation for evil  sadly no one working on the movie realized what a pile of crap it turned into       aside from mia farrows intriguing role the acting was horrendous  julia stiles was painful to watch while liev schrieber moved through a ridiculous plot lifelessly as if he didnt want to be a part of it  if the story seemed to not make a whole heap of sense it is because it didnt at all  in the waning moments of the movie the most redeeming aspect was when the credits began to roll  seriously this movie was that badsizefont         img       fontverdanasize2 yes director john moore executed some eyepopping horror borrowing the popular exorcist technique of scenesplicing but for the most part this movie was dull  besides these the only other memorable part was the death of the former babysitter which was a spinetingling moment sadly wasted in the previews  some of the scenery was well shot but the story was so bad that the cinematography became rapidly insignificant       it is a shame that so many great productions made decades ago are brought back to life so carelessly  i am all for remakes if they are done well but when a wonderful idea is slaughtered in exchange for a favorable box office draw it is almost criminal  blockbusters should stay as blockbusters and cult classics as cult classics the two dont mix wellsizefont
May 27 2007,negative,horrible movie i want those hours of my life back not scary at all and trust me im a huge scardy cat dont waste your time
May 27 2007,positive,suprisingly good it had a lot to live up to with the original but it certainly came close liev schreiber julia stiles and mia farrow are all awesome in this
May 27 2007,neutral,the omen remake is passable at best    it sticks so close to the original film as to make its very existence questionable  whats the point of redoing greatness if youre not going to try to be as great or greater    there is no point  the fact is that this is a good movie  if id not seen the original this would have been a great movie    as it is i did and i find this movie ridiculous  most of the actors are good but the original damien packs a lot more oomph that the new one  he embodied the creepy satanspawn role    this movie comes off as a crackerjack copy
May 27 2007,negative,if youre going to remake a filmand make it exactly the same as the originaland i mean exactly the same why bother really what is the point on spending millions of dollars on making something that literally already exists     this film is literally the 1976 version   yes there are new special effects including more gore capable actors doing a great job filling their roles stylishly composed shots a contemporary setting but none of this changes anything i really cant understand why hollywood insists on remaking anything in this way especially classic films that shouldnt be touched i thought after the travesty that was psycho they would give up but i was wrong if you really want to see the story go out and rent the original if youve already seen the original and and to see what the new one is like go out and rent the original youll have the exact same experience as if you were watching this
May 27 2007,positive,if you understand the whole biblical thing youll like the movie
May 27 2007,negative,i liked the original one more
May 27 2007,negative,creepy kid creepy movie but stick to the original
May 27 2007,negative,complete trash  the film offers no new ideas from the original does not contain a single scare and has wooden performances from everybody i got bored halfway through
May 27 2007,positive,t much devl thing not of lord
May 27 2007,positive,it kind of reminded me of an m knight shamalin movie with how teh color red is such an important part the little boy doesnt speak which is creepy mia farrow is even creepy in thisi didnt like julia stiles though
May 27 2007,positive,creepy    i saw it 060606

May 15 2007,positive,this is another movie that i like the orginal better  im old school   tho granted the special effects and technology now allowed for some great effects that couldnt have been done in the 70s
May 14 2007,positive,a pretty good retelling  but the book was better
May 14 2007,positive,spiderman 3  two movies forced together lots of unbelievable scenes like the butler at the end meh    the sweet hereafter  dont see the hype kinda boring    smokin aces  dumb action flick    the omen  well directed acting fell flat might have liked it more if i didnt already know how it ends    chronicles of riddick  not as bad as i thought it would be completely butchered the mythos from the first movie though
May 14 2007,positive,great movie but nothing compared to the original
May 14 2007,positive,well i was seriously mistaken by this movie    i thought it was going to be so awesome and i was actually a little disappointed    i thought there was going to be way more mysterious killings by damion and less of the legal and background checking to try and find damions real father    but all in all it was a pretty good moviestill could have been more killing
May 14 2007,positive,devilshly delightful
May 14 2007,positive,one of the scariest movies ever madebest the little kid is an amazing actor most times we dont know if he is the devil or just an inoccent kid we are not sure of it till the very endworst mia farrow as damiens babysitter i think sissy spacek could do a better work
May 13 2007,negative,i hardly watchedi was closin ma eyes half of da filmbut can tell 4rm da sound effectsdat it was scaryyyywink wink
May 13 2007,negative,horrible movieit wasnt scary at all
May 13 2007,positive,it was surprisinly like the origanil it was very good
May 13 2007,neutral,i dont really know how to review this about 80 percent  of my friends that rated this almost all of you said the first one was better and remaking the 2006 verision is an insult    i could go without watching this movie it didnt really catch my eye of going out and seeing it it was predictable the whole morals of pride before logic i dont think i can say anymore without spoilers     the ending was a open book it didnt explain anything about the omen i wouldnt reccommend a sequel even though the orginal had like 5 wtf are they thinking are they just making one another serious disppointment of no logic
May 13 2007,positive,these are the old omens so dont take the rating the same for the new one
May 13 2007,negative,boring lame save your time and pass on this one
May 12 2007,positive,better then the original
May 12 2007,positive,was very good liked it although it is the same exact same remake of the older version
May 12 2007,positive,love it and creepy as all hell
May 11 2007,negative,hmmm well what can i say about this particular film i must admit i was never keen on the original so it should not surprise me that i found this film to be a bit boring some good images and some great acting but the story still seemed to be slowand realy not that scary in my opinion
May 11 2007,positive,the remake gave back what the original left us wanting the storyline remains tight screenplay almost identical just the actors and updated death scenes added that finishing touch to a film that has haunted so many
May 10 2007,positive,loved it  great remake  good decapitation too  gore gore gore
May 10 2007,positive,my first favorite of the omen series yay
May 9 2007,positive,good movie really freaky kid
May 9 2007,positive,remake of the originali prefer the original that is just me
May 9 2007,positive,the only film to scare me
May 7 2007,negative,dont waste your time and money on this pale imitation of the original  while i liked some of the new effects they were able to use i really disliked the cheapening of the entire script  the acting was pretty vile considering the starsliev schreiber and the boy who plays damien stand out as the main stinkers  the last twenty minutes are almost worth itbut again pretty disappointing  mia farrow is one of the few good things in this movie but its definitely no rosemarys baby
May 7 2007,negative,this was definitely not as good as the original i liked julia stiles but the boy who played damien was nowhere near creepy enough
May 7 2007,negative,dissapointing if youve seen the preview youve pretty much seen all the scary parts of the movie  liev schrieber does well as always
May 7 2007,positive,horror movie got to see it update i really like this one not gore but good
May 6 2007,negative,saw the original and it was so so  this remake is exactly what a remake shouldnt be  it is almost exactly like the original  different actors and a better production  it looks like after 30 years they could have made some changes to keep an audience in their seats  couldnt even finish it the movie was so boring  so it was better than the first but it lost a half a star because i already saw this movie once before 1976 version
May 6 2007,positive,ok this movie wasnt even scary
May 6 2007,positive,this movie is scary but cool
May 6 2007,neutral,liked the original better
May 6 2007,positive,it was spookier than i thought it would be
May 6 2007,positive,good special effects
May 5 2007,negative,this seriously is a vastly inferior effort which made little or no improvement to the first it seemed pretty pointless really i think the biggest problem was the young cast and the lack of jerry goldsmiths music in the original and that car explosion scene is more rambo than satan ugh
May 5 2007,positive,i thought that this was a decet enough remake i really loved it when julia stiles died she was such a bitch asn deseerved it i know that damien was supposed to be the son of the devil but he was so damn cute
May 5 2007,negative,this version was really bad
May 5 2007,positive,really scarey and the book was even better
May 5 2007,neutral,cliche not scary and boring

Apr 29 2007,positive,i went to see this on 6606 666 awesome movie
Apr 29 2007,positive,amazing special effects creepy kid crazy mia its all good
Apr 29 2007,neutral,although this 2006 version of the omen is nowhere near as good as the 1976 original i still beleive thaty many people and critics were way too harsh on this movie     liev schreberwho recently directed the charming everything is illuminated puts in a decent performance while julia stiles is mediocre in her role the character of mrs baylock seemed wasted in this movie she was so underused and mia farrow very often overacted in her performance and when she wasnt overacting she was underacting while seamus daveyfitzpatrick puts in a almost spinechilling performance as the 7year old damien      although this is far superior to many of the other remakes going around at the moment such as the wicker man at the end of the movie you are still asking yourself the same quesrtion after watching a movie like the wicker man and that question is why bother remaking it
Apr 28 2007,positive,more creepy that scary that is why i liked it
Apr 27 2007,neutral,dragged at times but overall pretty good

Apr 26 2007,neutral,its okay not that bad
Apr 25 2007,positive,for starters i did not like the lack of chemistry between julia stiles and liev seamus daveyfitzpatrick was a cutie and a bit eerie i admit i laughed at everything bad that happened to mia farrow because she had it coming i usually like her but in this she did such a good job that i hated her david thewlis added a good reaction to the whole priestmr thorn aspect did anyone else notice both michael gambon and david thewlis were in this taking a bit of a devil break from harry potter i guess i didnt find it at all scary just eerie the forthcomings of death were completely obvious minus lievs  police ruin everything the ending pissed me off a bit because of the obvious stench of sequel in the air

Apr 22 2007,negative,man this sucks usually i like julia stiles but in this one shes a pain to watch the whole movie is some of the deaths were funny and david thewlis is brilliant as always but thats all  if you wanna see the omen go with the original one its so much better  an undying classic thats what that is
Apr 22 2007,negative,a really poor remake of an origional classic after growing up with the origional this is very tame and at times boaring poor acting and not enough biblical truth spoil a great story here

Apr 13 2007,negative,pretty shit didnt seem to go anywhere in the end the damien kid wasnt even scary he was just a douche you wanted to kick in the face if your gonna remake an old horror movie heres an idea make it fucken scary dogs and julia stiles bad acting isnt that scary i dont mind liev schriber he is pretty cool
Apr 13 2007,negative,again can someone tell me the point in yet another old horror movie which couldnt greatly be improved on being remade and this time with liev schreiber in one of the leading roles seriously he sucked in scream and he sucked in this truthfully the first two omen films were decent movies and are entertaining to watch this scene by scene remake just felt entirely unnecessary
Apr 12 2007,negative,what a piece of sht
Apr 12 2007,positive,part horror part conspiracy  decent not great not bad  worth renting
Apr 12 2007,neutral,okay its on here twicecurious

Apr 11 2007,neutral,it was a little slow for my taste but after the original it was better
Apr 11 2007,neutral,its not a bad movie on its own terms but its not really a good one either the thing is though it cant work on its own terms because its nearly a carbon copy of the original minus some good bits a killer score and the originality
Apr 11 2007,positive,unnecessary remake  the kid in the original was better

Apr 10 2007,positive,a little freakynot
Apr 10 2007,neutral,dvd review    this an alright remake could have benn better but one of the good remakes for this generation    leiv schreiber is the best in the cast and does a great job julia stiles is crap no good she needs acting lessons the little kid was freaky david thewlis was great as well    its about the anticrist is born on earth and iborn into a family that turns there lives to crap and shows he is the anticrist    the good the story liev schreiber and david thewlis the freaky kid    the bad needed more story needed new bits some more twists some more blood the kid doing more fraky shit    overall it was an alright movie but could have been better and added some more stuffs but an alright for the job done 666
Apr 9 2007,negative,not much going on in this couple of scares
Apr 9 2007,positive,good oneand luv the fact that they relesed on 6606 really original
Apr 9 2007,negative,save your mony this movie was gay
Apr 9 2007,positive,i dont really believe in such existence
Apr 9 2007,negative,pointless remake which did nothing to add anything original and different except to jazz up the death scenes with a bit of blood the 1976 original was superior in every way and not once did this remake come close to challenging it wasnt really scary a few cheap frights were thrown in here and there and like i mentioned before a couple of the death scenes have been oversylized which admittedly do look impressive but it takes away any scare appeal marco beltrami did a very good job with the musical score but stil its not a match for jerry goldsmiths oscar winning original this one will probably be enjoyed more by people who have not seen the excellent original version
Apr 9 2007,positive,the best scary movie of all time i like the new one better though
Apr 8 2007,positive,not as scary as i expectedthe kid is pretty cute
Apr 8 2007,positive,as far as remakes that didnt need to be made this one isnt bad the story gets a little update without really changing any of the big memorable scenes the casting of mia farrow as the evil nanny was pure brilliance there are some genuinely creepy scenes  imagery worth a watch
Apr 8 2007,positive,i have to say that is so so not to bad could be better
Apr 8 2007,positive,that boy is evillllllllllll
Apr 7 2007,neutral,you cant top the original

Apr 7 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Apr 6 2007,positive,i luv diz movie cause is scary ass hell
Apr 6 2007,negative,just like the psycho remake years before they tried to keep everything the same and updating a few things to make it modern now instead of reading of the priests death in a newspaper it is seen online if your going to remake a movie try not to keep it pretty much the same otherwise just rerelease the original in theaters again or give it a super special edition on dvd

Apr 5 2007,negative,centerimg   lefti rented url omen 2006url off of my netflix account because my cousin said it was good netflix lists the movie as the omen 666 which is a bunch of bullshit because this is not the six hundred and sixty sixth sequel to the original omen film    left      leftafter i put the movie in and watched the movie enough to find out all the characters and all that jazz i made my predictions for how the movie was going to end       leftcenterspoilers highlight to readcolorblack  colorcenter  colordarkolivegreen my prediction was colorcolordarkolivegreenthe mom was gonna die the photographer was gonna die and the dad would be killed by the police before he could kill the devilboy making it so no one else could possibly save the planet from devilmcdevilson because everyone except the people killed thinks hes jus a cute wittle baby and i was pissed to see that i absoultely predicted the movie 100 oh and as an added little bonus the lil devil was given to the president because obviously thats what happens to any orphened children ever in the history of everything evercolor   centerspoilers end here   center   left   youll predict this movie in the first half hour i guarentee it      centerimg   julia styles doing back flips to keep me from falling asleep while watching this shitty film   center      this movie is also super boring 85 of the movie is the dad trying to see if his son really is the son of the devil       wait you know what really would have been a twist and made this a good movie if he wasnt the son of the devil i bet none of you would see that coming then the dad could kill his son and i would smile the end but no nothing i want ever happens in shitty movies like this      but back to talking about how boring this movie is theres almost no chillsscareswhatever in this movie everything that happens is forshadowed for like 5 minutes before it happens so when it finally happens youre not scared or surprised its like someone holding a box of ice cream bars for 5 minutes and then asking if you want one thats not an ice cream surprise plus there probably all melted by then and you say what the fuck dude      so i officially call sheninagans on this movie and demand that they give me money because i deserve money and am so good looking         centerimg   1 out of 5   this movie is so bad it might cause your dick to fall off   center   left   center
Apr 5 2007,positive,old version is the bomb

Apr 2 2007,positive,not bad for a remakethe same to that starred in remake of hamlet toonot bad
Apr 2 2007,negative,nothing compared to the original
Apr 2 2007,positive,bassically almost identicle to the origonal omen but with more action and a few more disturbing gory visions that flash through the mother and fathers lifes damian the devils child is rarely seen and says about three lines throughout the whole film it would of been nice to see a bit more of him overall good film but just needed a bit more effort to distinquish from the origional
Apr 2 2007,positive,its we good but reely scary

Mar 31 2007,positive,the story was so good but not so scary
Mar 31 2007,neutral,im only rating half because ive only seen half lol but so far its good
Mar 31 2007,negative,dreadful liev schrieber and julia stiles attempting to raise a blue eyed wannabe emo version of damien who has a strange ability to control mia farrow it seems to be a mishmash of clumsy 70s horrorthriller tributes boys from brazil rosemarys read morebaby in a pathetic modernist attempt to prove that progress can always make a film better it has some inspired moments admittedly the scene with the scarred monk stiles murder at the hands of farrow but most of it is just going over old ground in much the same fashion as gus van sant attempted to do with psycho what hollywood still fails to understand is that some remakes work whilst others dont because the ones that do adapt and change according to context they take time to understand the themes of the original film and then try to bend them around their own ideas which is why texas chainsaw works so well and why remakes like this and the wicker man are so poor if this film was anything other than a straight remake it would have garnered more admiration but as it is the 2006 version of the omen is nothing more than uninspired and an insult to the 1976 original
Mar 30 2007,negative,flaky modern version of the original why bother stick with the first one if thats your bag

Mar 22 2007,positive,hate julia stiles love mia farrow
Mar 22 2007,neutral,julia stiles was sorely miscast they should have used someone older who has less of a wooden facial expression and actually transposed emotion into their voice     mia farrow did a great job of making you hate her but over all i just didnt like the movie  i guess its because i was hoping to see damien get the sthiat stabbed out of him hey the devil can always try again  after watching it i just wasnt satisfied and never was i creeped out while watching it     i havent seen the original but if youre a horror buff this rendition just doesnt deliver

Mar 18 2007,positive,great start weak sequals and weaker remake
Mar 18 2007,positive,i really enjoyed this its the ideology thats scary here
Mar 18 2007,negative,my senses served me right here as this was undeniably a terrible movie and an unnecessary remake sure with modern day technology they made the film look realistic and much darker than the original as well as better production values but the original still stands to be superior despite the fact the original wasnt that great to start off with this remake isnt even as gory as one would have expected and the cast was a monumental disappointment an observatory discovers a comet which confirms the earth is on the eve of an armageddon the presidents godson robert schreiber is informed that his wife katherine stiles is having troubles with her pregnancy and they lost their child robert is offered a baby that lost its mother as a substitute which he accepts and they raise as their own child which they name damien daveyfitzpatrick succeeding the suicide of damiens nanny robert slowly uncovers evidence that suggests damien is the son of the devil  the antichrist  and must discover a way to stop the boy the film is a lot more subtle than the original with a few good scares here and there but its incredibly dumb and lacks substance you simply cannot replace gregory peck with someone like schreiber overall i cant say im surprised that the studio decided to rake in some extra cash by releasing a remake of the classic horror film on the 6606 but the remake sinks without a trace
Mar 18 2007,positive,it was more psychologically scary then visually
Mar 17 2007,positive,rad movie the remake was great

Mar 17 2007,positive,puts u right off kids

Mar 12 2007,negative,the origional was better
Mar 12 2007,positive,excellent horrorthriller flick would of liked to seen the original to compare but this one kept you on your toes the kid that plays damien is freaky also being able to release it on the 6606 was very clever

Mar 11 2007,positive,the son of satan is born a creepy little tyke that makes people do things such as hang themselves with just a look and a thought animals hate him women adore him    having not seen the original i cannot make a comparison but this movie was very good dark and creepy but not scary the kid was very good he had the look of the son down and was very believable    the scenes in this movie were very elaborate and beautiful the mansion where damien lives with his parents is exquisite it provides a perfect backdrop for some awesome death and neardeath scenes    this is a dvd to add to your collection and i hope the sequels are equally as entertaining

Mar 9 2007,positive,old ones are the best
Mar 8 2007,negative,ok my rating of the following film is purely based on suspence and thrillerness as the horror element was totally nonexsistant        the only partially scares were from mega freeking crazy mia farrow as damiens replacement nanny the 1st hung herself during dear damiens birthday party and in the form of rather greosome and creepy dreams        very poor direction dull cast especially julia stiles the plot was kept together enough by the better talents of liev schreiber and david thewlis but the casting of lil seamus as damien just didnt really cut it at all i spent all the film thinking how incredablly adorable he is and what stunningly blue eyes he has         as for the devil incarnate well he looks more like an autistic child acted like a spoilt brat who threw a incredable temper tantrum at church        i mean im more evil than that kid i wanted hell fire and mind violations you know like when he knocks his mum of the balcony clearly an accident whereas evilness would include raining sharpened metal forks or several pot plants down onto her lifeless body on the auditorium floor        well maybe i expect too much in so called horror films and remakes your welcome to discuss any ideas or conflicts you may have with this revieweven with me if you must    
Mar 8 2007,positive,not as good as the original
Mar 7 2007,negative,this very stale remake attempts to update the 1976 classic with more contemporary film making techniques aka cliches that dont really service the film in the way that im sure the filmmakers intended    its a very slick looking movie but that only really heightens your awareness of the fact that it is just that a movie and for me really took me out of the experience    i cant really say that i hated the movie but i had a really hard time paying attention to it  its certainly not the worst remake out there but i would consider it to be one of the blandest that ive seen
Mar 7 2007,negative,i expected this to be more    i didnt like it much
Mar 6 2007,negative,terrible i was more scared by the fact that it was more suitable for 2 year olds than damien im not christian anyway

Mar 1 2007,positive,the good  nothing much to talk about but they try to kept the same mystery of the original    the bad  a common man should feel more scared to go to graveyard at night  but it didnt seem to effect in any of the character in the movie they were very calm

Feb 28 2007,positive,not as good as the original but still ok
Feb 27 2007,positive,my dad said it was scary when he was a kid
Feb 27 2007,positive,considering it follows the original 1976 film around like a lost puppy its not bad  the deaths were actually toned down for the remake gasp but damien is still the embodiment of adorable evil  generally all right but see the original first so you may reflect on what the remake could have incorporated
Feb 27 2007,negative,pretty stupid i laughed a lot

Feb 21 2007,neutral,original was way better than this one
Feb 20 2007,positive,id watch the old version first 
Feb 20 2007,neutral,this remake is like listening to a cover version of a beatles song you like it but really want to hear the original again the original omen is such a terrific film convincing beautifully cast and with a great raw brit gothic feel to it the remake is a slightly glossier affair which is enjoyable enough but doesnt really take the story in any new directions although it hints that it will opening images of 911 and the asian tsunami promise a new take on the tale but with the exception of the very final scene this doesnt really happen the set pieces of the original were beautifully done  here theyre well done but dont seem to last long enough they dont feel special enough the cast is good but again it lacks the gravitas of the original this ambassador is no gregory peck overall this isnt a bad way to spend two hours in the cinema  its a hundred times better and more cinematic than new moon for instance  but could have been a lot more than it is
Feb 20 2007,negative,an adequate remake to the original with no new surprises styles an odd choice for kathy
Feb 20 2007,positive,this was so unexciting the only freaky bit was when the victims started dying esp when the guy got his head cut off and it was flung out and blood spurted outno wait u didnt need to know that
Feb 20 2007,positive,better than the original
Feb 20 2007,positive,not as good as the original

Feb 15 2007,negative,not the best remake in the world
Feb 15 2007,positive,the gimmicky date was a bit iffy but it was an okay movie
Feb 14 2007,negative,remake featuring the early childhood of the devils son and his familys growing suspicions of his nature  some good horror scenes and nice imagery but over all a prime example that when everything clicks in the original its impossible to duplicate the magic  good effort by some cast but the kids cant hold a candle to the first damien
Feb 14 2007,positive,scared tyhe crap outta me

Feb 13 2007,positive,it was not scary but it sure was spooky
Feb 13 2007,negative,hard proof why classic horror films do not have to be remade the original has better death scenes not to mention better acting
Feb 12 2007,positive,fantastic thriller one of the best in ages
Feb 12 2007,positive,perhaps just as good as the original  it has some really fantastic suspense sequences and the added plot details as well as the dream sequences are all quite classy  mia farrow is terrifying as is julia stiles but for a completely different reason
Feb 12 2007,positive,ahhhhhhhdamien has got 2 b da creepiest child evaaaa
Feb 11 2007,negative,centersize5size5the omensizeb        img just watched this movie because i was reallly bored and had nothing better to do a remake of the original and it is just like the original from start to end there is nothing new about this version usually they would change something around and give it a twist that the original didnt have but they didnt it was basically like watching the same movie two times in a row the only difference about the two movies was that this version did not have that great of a cast julia stiles was horrible in this movie she seems to have never acted with or been around children because she was just akward the entire time she was on screen she was the worst choice for the mother role this movie was just a waste of my timesize        left        size5bimg        bsizecenter
Feb 11 2007,positive,sort of sillythey had too many chances to get rid of that little devil

Feb 10 2007,positive,i luv every minute of this movie
Feb 10 2007,negative,img      size53 out of 10size
Feb 10 2007,neutral,somewhat decent most of the way through building some creepy parts the lady who hangs herself etc though it never builds a drive or purpose until the last actthe storyline doesnt really go anywhere and the ending annoyingly leaves nothing resolved characters also act in some dumb ways and there just isnt enough meat to the film overall in fact the center of evil in this entire film damien never really demonstrates why we need to be so afraid of him yeah bad things happen to random people but we never get a sense of anything at stake really only mia farrow stands out pretty much as rosemary would be 30 years after the events of rosemarys baby probably overall a frustrating film
Feb 10 2007,positive,damien is one freaky lil boy
Feb 10 2007,positive,it was creepy damn tht boy

Feb 3 2007,positive,the old version is better than the new one
Feb 3 2007,positive,fun to watch in the dark
Feb 2 2007,positive,this unnecessary remake of a classic horror movie is not as good or better than the original not even the cast was superior than the cast from the omen 76 it doesnt improve anything with the exception of  the decapitation scene that becomes very effectivesome few scares and a good score creates a good mood for suspense and makes up for things that didnt work out in this film because even the majority of scenes was like watching the original all over again      
Feb 2 2007,negative,this is a boring boring remake of a notsoexciting original classic
Feb 2 2007,positive,omg  im still scared by the 666

Jan 30 2007,negative,really very rubbish the original was far more brilliant
Jan 30 2007,negative,this was so dull having seen the original a couple years back i can say i wasnt that excited about this im not a fan of the omen films but i was interested in seeing the new modern adaption i was expecting a true horror dark and evil but no it was just about some kid who obviously wanted some ice cream throughout the whole film when he smiles at the end listen closely an youl be able to hear the jingle of the ice cream truck
Jan 29 2007,positive,this movie is really scary i did not finish this movie

Jan 23 2007,positive,it was kool seeing this movie
Jan 22 2007,neutral,i think that when a movie is remade that the original is naturally considered the best because the original was the first to achieve the idea
Jan 22 2007,positive,pretty kewl i saw this 1 with simon
Jan 21 2007,negative,see the original instead
Jan 21 2007,positive,i didnt get to c it all bc some ppl were talking during the moviebut owell from what ive seen it was pretty good and scary
Jan 21 2007,negative,hate it hate it hate it pointless
Jan 21 2007,negative,an update of a classic that didnt need updating sigh when will hollywood learn
Jan 21 2007,negative,the original is one of my favorite horror movies this simply cant hold a candle to it liev schreibers performance is bizarrely sterile and julia stiles though a good actress is miscast mia farrow is a total waste and the new damien is a complete failure on every level the translation of the movie from the old version to the new one is markedly literal but when changes are made theyre almost always for the worse    the one improvement is an extremely striking visual style the set design is absolutely gorgeous and some of the camera work is noteworthy still it feels wasted on this decidedly pointless remake
Jan 21 2007,positive,scared the crap out of me
Jan 20 2007,neutral,crazy ass movie demon cild for sure

Jan 18 2007,neutral,fontbook antiquasize4bthe omen 2006bsizefont     img              fontbook antiquafontverdanai borrowed this movie from the library yesterday and saw it last night now saying i was disappointed by it would be ridiculous as i never expected anything good to come of this movie so i can only say that it wasnt as bad as i had expected fontfont     i dont have the loverespectdevotion for the original that i had as a kid and a recent revist left me feeling ambivalent about it or rather it made me feel guilty for not loving it more its gregory peck for crying out loud i love him he was atticus finch how can i not like his performance in a classic horror  i guess ill have to live with that guilt i didnt like it much at all id probably say that i think the original is better than this slick remake but that doesnt mean either one is a great movie     i love liev schreiber but he doesnt seem to convinced here i guess its hard to be when there are so many plotholes and missed opportunities julia stiles is unconvincing in both her role as a mother and a wife who suddenly realizes her child is evil      there are a few extremely creepy moments and some jumpscares which were really effective but i cant honestly recommend this to anyone but a diehard horror fan      i wish they had worked harder on it but it seems like they were just focusing on getting it done and realeasingit on its gimmick date 666 that they didnt bother trying to make a great movie they just updated the same 70s movie we already know i wish theyd had better writing more dread maybe even another woman in stiles role but that couldnt have saved it either i dont think anything could have the kid was awful     he was terrible i know most child actors are crap but when trying to look scary this kid looked like hed pooped in his pants and was smelling it how scary is that not very most child actors are bad but this kid was truly absolutely horrible      bufontcentury gothicsize3things that bother me the mostsizefontub  bufontcentury gothicsize3sizefontub   1 the need for the ritualistic killing of the child fuck that hes the devil he is allknowing im killing that bastard the first chance i get they said he needed to be killed in a church with a dagger which would take his physical lifeill do that first and worry about the rest later     2 the graves which tell all um you are a bunch of satanists awaiting the birth of the one who will bring forth armageddon and you take a chance and bury two crucial things which lead to the evidence that you and the evil child exist why      3 ah screw it i could nitpick about everything but i dont have the time     the best i can say about this is that it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be     ill buy this mother when it hits the 5 rack you betcha

Dec 23 2006,neutral,fonttimes new romansize4color000000i have to say i never saw a reason why the original ithe omeni had to be remade  well i admit that 90 of the time i dont see why any older film that is considered well done or even a classic in its genre should be remade so really why would ithe omeni be any different  it just seems like the main reason they remade this film was so they could release it on 060606  whoopdeedo  the kid in this film never achieves the creep out level that the original child actor harvey stephens did in the original film  not even close  i almost always like the work done by both pete postlewaite and david thewlis  in this film though they are wastedcolorsizefont    fonttimes new romancolor000000size4            the sfx are really nothing big  some of the death scenes are elaborately set up but the effects used to execute them excuse the pun are nothing advanced or amazing in this day and age  the plot is a modern version of the original films plot but it really doesnt give us anything that says this is why we wanted to remake this film  they couldnt do this back in the day  even the music score is nothing more than some sound in the background  honestly i recommend seeing the original film and not bothering with this remakesizecolorfont

Dec 19 2006,negative,i am sitting here listening to that damn john mayer song waiting on the world to change and its all like moving me  i do agree that the fight aint fair and that the world is being ran by a bunch of leaders who are out of touch with the world  we cant do shit about it and that doesnt mean we dont care no we do were just waiting ohhh waiting on the world to change  you know      jesus day is getting here and like its just getting more and more unbearable for me  for the first time in a long time ive had to buy christmas presents for people without the approvals of liz  i miss her so fucking much i cant hardly stand it  i dont even want to go to my parents or johns parents because i feel like i have a bomb inside of me ready to just blow up and send me into some unbearable state of crying like a child      getting so emotional general examples of this are pretty odd      bend of dexterb  the season finale of idexteri came on sunday and i did my weekly chore of downloading the episode monday morning to watch before work  the last episode tied the whole thing together in a manner that i cant describe as less than perfect and just about everything that happened i predicted by the 8th episode  the ending was still almost unbearable because it feels like such a short 12 episodes  the show was so good and i became so close to the character of dexter that when it ended i simply cried  i cried because i wanted more  i cried because of the way it ended  i just cried at how perfect the show was to me      bthis damn john mayer songb  i never was much into john mayer i kind of liked that wonderland song but only in bed you know how that goes  well then he goes and writes something with a profound political statement such as the one in  waiting on the world to change  i like political statements and i love it when someone famous calls out against not just bush but the entire governmental structure of the world  it feels so hopeless though that the meaning of the song just causes me to cry      bthat new heroes show on nbc b well my friend suggested this to me mainly because i told him about my infatuation with dexter and he said that he was into iheroesi he told me what it was and that nbc plays all the episodes on their site  i still torrented the stuff because i hate watching streams and i watched the first 11 episodes in one day  i cried because episode 12 doesnt come out til january 22 and i will be on fucking dialup arg        time for a movie review of the likes youve never seen before      bthe omen   bif movies were ecosystems this would be a small pond in the middle of a nuclear testing facility on a planet engulfed in an atmosphere of the worst gases you can think of  yeah i wont even tell you why just know that this is possible the most retarded pile of poo ive watched in a good while  it competes with ithe village iand igarfieldi for suckiest films ever created

Dec 3 2006,negative,why did this need to be remade  the original was perfect  what we get here is virtually a shot for shot remake with more gore not only did the priest get impaled by the lightning rod but he gets skewered by broken glass as well and some more cheesy visual techniques added in the camera shake when liev schreiber sees david thewlis get decapitated was so damned silly  julia stiles is totally miscast here while schreiber sleepwalks through the whole flick  only david thewlis mia farrow and michael gambon seem to give a crap about their performances  even the kid sucks as damien  plus theres plenty of visual goof ups too like the boom mic being completely visible in certain shots as well the gun debacle in the finale thorn gets shot by a cop with a handgun then after a cutaway shot we see the cop lowering a massive smoking semiautomatic machine gun  its well made but its a pointless remake

Nov 20 2006,neutral,another volume of incredibly short reviews    the omen  a very stylized wellshot thriller without any thrills i really wanted to like this film but it was neither creepy nor scary good direction with a meddling story    poseidon  not as terrible as i was expecting but still not very good it might be titaniclite but at least it wasnt suffocatingly long    monster house  enjoyable for kids and adults alike this splendid little film exemplifies classic animated storytelling with highbrow spectacular new animation techniques unlike many animated films as of late the work from the actors does not distract from the story but enhances it with great performances by steve buscemi and maggie gyllenhaal i even didnt hate the presence of jon heder    the prestige  another clever film from christopher nolan with superb performances from all of its alist cast i was kind of wishing for a better twist at the very end but was still pleased by its outcome and the film as a whole    why we fight  a very interesting and extremely relevant look at the motives behind war paying special attention to president dwight d eisenhowers final address in office a bit talky but very well done

Nov 15 2006,negative,what a waste of fucking time this turned out to be true i didnt hold much hope for it hence skipping the theatrical release and heading straight for the dvd but i had a modicum of faith that the remake by john moore might tread some new dark material ha no deal sweetpea liev schreiber who in the past has wavered between good and great is just plain dull here whilst julia stiles is totally miscast a mother nah shes still in college by the looks of it in fact apart from david thewliss i think all the major players here were miscast the kid playing damien i cant even be bothered looking up the critters name has few if any lines and the directors attempt to replicate the original damiens creepiness just falls flat the last and very famous look by the kid at the camera smirk and all for example is just laughably contrived     ill be the first to admit im not a huge fan of gregory peck i admire the guy but his acting and the persona he created for the most part is just plain boring but watching the new version of the omen i was just yearning for the original i got up and started ironing my work clothes midway through for fucks sake

Nov 3 2006,positive,its not bad but its not like good either
Nov 3 2006,negative,having watched this remake now i stand by what i originally said it was nowhere near as scary as the original and some of the cast members looked like they were lacking in convictions  kid did look the part until he tried to look evil   if there is nothing else to watch then give it a go just dont expect too much
Nov 3 2006,negative,shit not a scratch compared to the original
Nov 3 2006,positive,yep this movie is almost as amusing as the exorcist
Nov 3 2006,positive,brilliant film great story
Nov 2 2006,negative,a waste of 7 dollars
Nov 2 2006,neutral,img    to me the omen always was a less than exorcist  the original imo was surpassed by the gory sequel damien  not that i did not like the original but when i heard a remake was in order i was somewhat excited  that was until i heard it was a shot by shot remake  hell why remake a film exactly the same  i mean come on infuse something different that will make it stand on its own  did they do that with this  in some ways yes  i did like the use of the color red throughout and the scary images  it is not as good as the original and made me want to revisit the unmatchable acting of the 70s version  this is not at all scary with only a few scenes to recommend  the extra on the dvd revelation 666 was morthwhile though

Oct 31 2006,negative,all anticipation for the 060606 release of the remake of cult apocolyptic classic the omen quickly flatlined as we were all forced to sit through hours of lacklustre scares and julia stiles who quite bluntly gives one of the worst performances ive ever seen  with insufficiently creepy little boys the only scares provided are heartstoppingly jumpy moments in which sinister looking masked demons appear though when coupled with the sillygirl aahs of antichrists mother julia stiles you find yourself wondering why you bothered paying

Oct 29 2006,negative,centerimg  center center    leftsize3the omenlike the name says shows the events talked about in revelation of when the antichrist will arrive and how he will arrive the only way to tell is by the mark of 666 imprinted somewhere on the body a couple notices their son being very strange and has sudden outbursts of anger this worries them and when a priest confronts the father this reality becomes much more apparent could their son in fact be the antichristsizeleft  leftsize3size left    centerimg  center center    leftsize3i am being fairly generous giving this movie a 3 because it is horrific and not meaning the horrific as in scary but as in bad this movie was simply terrible and although i have never seen the original i can see why people would hate this one being compared with it the acting is idiotic and the events that happen in the story are just funnyi laughed many different times during this at the ridiculous things that happened nothing about it was good one of the years worst for sure if you do decide to see this even after this review then be warned that you may be sitting their laughing at it a lot b310bsizeleft

Oct 25 2006,negative,img    bfontcentury gothicithe omen down i im glad i waited for the dvd on this one this version spoke no evil shown no evil and im wondering did the director hear that this story was suppose to be about evil the only thing that i thought was close to the original is that the damiens dad liev shreiber had a voice similar to gregory pecks but other then that this movie had the mark of sss all over it sucked sucked sucked fontb     img  bimonster house up  iloved this one and i was suprised when i saw the trailers in the theater my first thought was hated the graphics and looks to scary to take my kids well was i wrong i loved it and my kids loved it very kid safe it reminded me of the goonies for some reason just a classic halloween tale involving creepy old people the intro to puberty and the grey area of is it cool or not to go trick or treating this year also another great movie involving my man steve buscemi i think theres more ways to play 6 degrees of seperation with buscemi then with bacon b  img  bfontgeorgiaislither  up  ii waited and waited for this movie i was pissed that i missed its cinematic debut on the big screen so i reassured myself that it would be ok because it will take dvd form in seconds flati6 months lateriso i rushed yesterday morning rented it and shook in anticipation to watch it my only thought after seeing it was you guessed it what the hell was i thinking i mean it was good but my curiosity got the best of me the gross factor is what gave it high marks for me no scare factor in it what so ever the descent still carries the award for most scariest movie of the year so farfontb

Oct 24 2006,positive,this was a really good movie
Oct 24 2006,positive,this film was great but original way better
Oct 24 2006,negative,some good suspenseand decent plotbut the kid doesnt do much in the moviethe most acting he did was some kicking and screaming its not scary at all there could have been a lot more done with it some parts of the story were explained vaguely and the character development could have been a bit better specifically in the case of the evil nannyshes just there and we never learn much about her at alland what happens at the boys birthday party is never really linked to anything unless i missed something what was good though was that it wasnt like a lot of horror movies that are all gore for gores sake and have limited plot and dialogue also this movie had some nice symbolism in some of the scenesagain though so much more could have been done with it i also didnt really like it much because im not religious note i havent seen the original so i cant compare it with that

Oct 23 2006,neutral,the omen was a very average remake the only member of the cast who i actually thought did any good was david thewlis the rest of them just didnt seem to suit the roles or fit them  good to see mia farrow retuirning to the franchsie but lets hoep they dont follow this up with sequal remakes

Oct 23 2006,positive,omg this one was good and scary
Oct 23 2006,negative,crappy at best ive seen it twice and it just isnt compelling
Oct 23 2006,negative,directed by john moore  starring leiv schrieber julia stiles mia farrow david thewlis pete postlewaite seamus daveyfitzpatrick    horror films should get remade for two reasons one the original sucked big time amityville horror the fog and two the gore allowed today should prove more viscerally exciting the hills have eyes texas chainsaw massacre not unless it falls under these circumstances is there a need to remake a horrors past and unless its certain to be just as good admittedly i think the new dawn of the dead is very wellmade like psycho before it the omen is already a shelf classic the need to give the antichrist a second run was unnecessary not to mention that one film doesnt conclude it   best scene nanny takes a jump  quote the nanny damien look at me damien its all for you 
Oct 23 2006,negative,saw it not as scary this is a remake

Oct 20 2006,positive,this movie scared me so bad but i guess there is nothng wrong wiv that
Oct 20 2006,negative,you can tell the movie is nicein a sense of the editting but its just not that scary the music isnt paced right with the movie or something but it just throws it off i mean julia stiles and liev act well in the movieits just kind of cheesy there too little of a much needed level of subtlety to how things are presented theres no mystery and nothing for the audience to figure out hardly its a very linear and straight forward which makes it kind of boring the nice thing i can say about the movie is that the colors are for the most part done nicely thats the only scary or emotional part about itthe colors are either contrasted or blended really well to give some kind of effect but some of the deaths are just too dramatic to be taken seriously that priest dyin with the spear through the chest and then being photographed in the same position that was lame when is someone gonna make a scary movie as good as the ring these things are disappointing
Oct 20 2006,positive,this movie sound really good
Oct 20 2006,negative,the film is visually interesting and there are some character improvements but the film suffers from trying to copy the original film far too much and doesnt do the same things well enough

Oct 19 2006,positive,i think this is the new one i liked the first one too and i think i prefer it
Oct 19 2006,negative,ive always felt the original omen was one of the best horror films made the script is tight the pacing is perfect the tension and realization in the characters is gradual and believable and the suspense is taut this remake lacks all of that and its due to the direction the pacing is dragged out in certain scenes and the suspense of certain scenes is gone do yourself a favor and watch the original
Oct 19 2006,positive,its a kinda scary moviee but a good one
Oct 19 2006,negative,very disappointing in the fact that it isnt scary at all excessively gory and a bit farfetched in terms of the plot
Oct 19 2006,positive,i thougt it would be betterdisapointed
Oct 19 2006,positive,liev schreiber plays robert thorn an american ambassador who discovers that his 5 year old son is actually the son of satan in john moores remake to the 1976 horror classic ithe omeni with the endless stream of needless remakes 2006s iomeni seems to only have been made so it could be conveniently released on june 6th of this year which would read 060606 or 666    the film is basically the same film as before it has the same characters doing almost identical things as they did back in 1976 so if you have seen the original there really isnt a need to see this one i know it seems a little wrong that i would give this movie a slight fresh rating while i gave gus van sants remake to ipsychoi a harsh review i guess since i dont hold ithe omeni in much high esteem this remake doesnt bother me all that much     the acting in the film is fairly decent julia stiles performance is over the top but i did like her and i actually felt really sorry for her character schreiber is alright as the films hero but he is no gregory peck and it was interesting to see mia farrow play the exact opposite of her character in irosemarys babyi she is so evil in this movie but still manages to be my favorite person in the film     moores directing was top notch and the movie flows very well there are a few moments when the movie will hit a slump like in the original but those moments are usually followed by some exciting scenes of carnage this remake to ithe omeni isnt a perfect film but it isnt one that i hate it is worth seeing but not worth owning oddly enough the same can be said about the originalfont
Oct 19 2006,positive,this one was better than the original but it just wasnt scary at all
Oct 19 2006,positive,now this is my kind of movie

Oct 18 2006,positive,i am not fond of all the remakes of movies that have been going on in the past few years  i love this one  i love it even more then the first one  it is much scarier
Oct 18 2006,positive,with one of the best trailers in a long time i was rather interested in this film but avoided as the mediocre reviews came out then when stumbling upon it was positively surprised at how good it was updated from the old one in every way the omen 2006 like all modern horrors raises the stakes in production value and shock factor trickery which to my surprise actually works very well had the original not existed this would be a stand alone quality scary movie with all the right ingredients  a well cast scary kid very well cast scary nanny mia farrow and some stunning set pieces  david thewlis demise and julia stiles accident being the highlights what hampers its potential to be brilliant is the lack of a character of the kind of gravitas that gregory peck provided in the original his character played by thewlis in this version plays second fiddle to schreiber and feels a little weak which reduces the believability that an ambassador would travel to italy on a hunch also the plot suffers from completely dropping the political angle  schreiber is pursued on all fronts as an important american politician in the outset to suddenly behave like an anonymous tourist in his hunt for the chilling truth about his son but nonetheless it is entertaining stunningly shot and well worth a shot
Oct 18 2006,positive,i really wanna see it i will just rate it 5
Oct 18 2006,positive,awesome beheadings people dying not too scary but still that beheading is awesome

Oct 12 2006,positive,the omen is the modernized remake of the classic 1976 horror film about the birth and rise of the antichrist  this version stars julia stilesthe bourne supremacy and liev schreiberthe manchurian candidate 2004 and introduces seamus daveyfitzpatrick as damien  the movie is directed by john moore      robert thornschreiber is a man on the rise in the american government  when he is told there has been a complication with his wife katherinesstiles pregnancy he promptly rushes to the hospital only to be told that his child did not survive the pregnancy  a church official there to witness the birth informs robert that there was another child born to a mother that did not survive her pregnancy  robert reluctantly agrees to take the child as their own  the first few years go without incident but at one of his future birthday parties the attendees bare witness to the nanny hanging herself from the roof of the house calling out to damien its all for you  the action picks up from there as damien begins to leave a pile of bodies in his wake through no direct action  as robert and a reporter keith jenningsdavid thewlis harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban begin to investigate what exactly is going on their worst fears begin to come to life as they begin to believe that damien is the son of the devil      a couple things bugged me about this movie  the first thing was the terrible chemistry between stiles and schreiber  this has got to be one of the most stale and boring onscreen relationships ive ever seen  it seems like both of them are just itching to get through their scenes so the action can begin  the reporter jennings also sees events before they unfold via his camera thrusting the movie into a mold of the final destination series which i did not think was a good move  some of the death sequences also captured the final destination atmosphere  also just like the final destination series and most other horror movies in these times the movie fails to provoke any real scares  a couple small jump moments and a moment of pure suspense are all this movie has to offer      overall however the plot was very easy to follow  the movie does not exercise any expertise in religion which is good news for most  while most of the acting was stale throughout the movie the end is where it all came together thankfully  the ending is what really saved this movie for me  daveyfitzpatrick who played damien had close to nothing to say throughout the entire movie which was probably in the films best interests  his greatest moment came at the very end when he showed one of the most sinister smiles ive ever seen  the suspense really builds in a couple moments and often ends abruptly sometimes leaving the viewer stupefied at what they just witnessed      i have never seen the original which is perhaps why i thought this one was pretty good  was it great  no  it is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but it was watchable and entertaining which is more than i can say for most of the horror titles ive seen lately  i give it a thumb up
Oct 12 2006,positive,good one i love it
Oct 12 2006,negative,just becasue you throw a pale white kid who whispers a lot into a movie doesnt make it scary  this was such an insult to a real classic movie
Oct 11 2006,positive,i felt it was a reasonably good remake of the 1976 version better in some ways worse in some ways the cinematography is superb and i also feel that julia stiles is almost up there with lee remick liev schreiber however isnt as good as gregory peck but he still does a good job moody and tense atmosphere
Oct 11 2006,positive,that german shephard was scaryscarier lookin than mine
Oct 11 2006,negative,mmmm never paid much attention to it
Oct 11 2006,negative,i found it scary when i was 10 or 12 or so i really can  should find better things to do with my time
Oct 11 2006,neutral,the same as the original without the creepy music a nice looking and very well acted film but lacks the impact of the original
Oct 10 2006,positive,this remake horror film was alike the version between end of days and final destination 3 looked more terrifying and i havent seen the original one yet thats true  director john moore has thrown in a little more gore and a few subliminal shocks  and there are a range of succulently hammy turns from the likes of pete postlethwaite and mia farrow nodding to her starring role in the same eras rosemarys baby but for the most part has followed the original screenplay with uncanny slavishness  horror remake of richard donners 1976 the omen
Oct 10 2006,positive,this is not as good as the first the omen bit this movie did disturb me a bit was deff worth seeingsee it
Oct 10 2006,positive,what an amazing movie  i really love it  and i knew i would love it when i saw the ad for it a loong while ago 
Oct 10 2006,positive,omg this was not as scary as the commercial says it was
Oct 10 2006,positive,some part felt lyyke impossible hahas  ttuh exaqqeratinq lerrhs buddhen overall  5stars d
Oct 9 2006,positive,here it goes again another remake and another flop  this version wasnt bad and was really done well but in a society today where the church is so imbedded in our everyday lives it flopped miserably  i liked it alot and thought like most horror movies it need more gore  hopefully they will redo the rest of the series theatrically
Oct 9 2006,positive,could of been better
Oct 8 2006,positive,it has the coolest release date in history 6606 just as good as the original however a few tweaks wouldve been nice much appreaciation for mia farrow being casted a nice nod to rosemarys baby
Oct 8 2006,negative,i had high expectations for the recreation of omen but i must say nothing compares to the original
Oct 7 2006,positive,i dont know much about 666 and god or what not but i enjoyed the movie it was really good i hope there is a second one and that kid if frickin good for the job he is freaky the little satanistp see it
Oct 7 2006,positive,amazing  also being released on6606 sorta makes it seem better

Oct 3 2006,negative,not as good as original
Oct 3 2006,neutral,i dont get some remakes this is one of them i really hated the added strange imagery and the main casting choices julia stiles as a mother shes far too young to be convincing the original damien actor was scary because he looked so innocent the remakes actor seemed far too aware of what he was doing
Oct 3 2006,positive,mmm a went 2 c nd it wznt tht gd but am glad a went 2 c it cos a nva new 666 wz lyk a devil thing nd it wznt tht scary but reli jumpywell it wz 4 me okay
Oct 3 2006,positive,rented the remake and it was pretty good  dont think i would buy it

Sep 27 2006,positive,good remake of the original classic  if you are a horror movie watcher it is definitely worth checking out
Sep 27 2006,negative,its ok not scary at all but it is gory sometimes and the random dreams have not point they just make the film slightly longer grr
Sep 27 2006,positive,i was really looking forwards to this movie as i loved the original but was totally dissapointed  it didnt have the suspence ofthe original or the scarey movie score which was a big plus in the original
Sep 27 2006,positive,i thought this movie was done really well i still havent seen the original but its on my list to do  i plan on buying this movie to add to my wonderful collection

Sep 26 2006,positive,not so much as scary more funny lol
Sep 25 2006,positive,interesting movie kept me on the edge of my seat and scared me a time or two also made me think a little slow in the beginning but after awhile you get reeled in and it turns out to be a really good movie
Sep 25 2006,positive,much better than i thought it would be  while it uses the same script the omen still delivered the scares creepy dream sequences great acting save for a talented but miscast julia stiles and one fucking awesome decapitation at the end
Sep 25 2006,positive,not as good as the original
Sep 25 2006,negative,the best two hours of sleep ive ever had

Sep 22 2006,positive,never saw the first one but the death scenes in this one were fabulous
Sep 22 2006,neutral,stick with the original
Sep 21 2006,positive,happened again  the original is much better  too many new movies try to rely too much on special effects and not enough on character development  the original omen did a much better job of portraying the spiritual aspect  also the child they got to play damian was not very convincing
Sep 21 2006,negative,was expecting alot better than it turned out
Sep 21 2006,positive,one of the best horros of all time
Sep 20 2006,positive,its pretty good and it actually has a plot but for some reason i wasnt as scared as  mika this scarey movie actually has a plot
Sep 20 2006,positive,the original was the best

Sep 19 2006,negative,wasted my time did have a bad omen before watchin it

Sep 17 2006,positive,a movie with a hidden message very smart
Sep 16 2006,positive,i didnt think it was that good
Sep 16 2006,negative,a lazy unnecessary remake
Sep 15 2006,positive,it could of been scarier
Sep 15 2006,negative,movie was pretty bogus an allstar cast couldnt make any improvements on the original which i didnt like either i sure hope they dont go ahead and redo the other 3
Sep 15 2006,positive,it was really truly scary  i hadnt seen the original so i cannot make a legitimate comparison but it was outstanding in its own right
Sep 14 2006,negative,what a waste the original was just fine brought nothing new in fact damien wasnt even scary
Sep 14 2006,negative,funny more than anythink
Sep 14 2006,neutral,i saw the older version of this which was alright
Sep 12 2006,neutral,great cast but its really not a patch on the original
Sep 10 2006,neutral,img     couldve been worse but stil its a pretty mediocre movie basically the only redeeming point are the deaths pretty slow in some points
Sep 10 2006,positive,really good remake and how freaky is it that it got to be released on 6606
Sep 10 2006,positive,that damian kids givin me the evil eye cathail gillen
Sep 10 2006,negative,not as good as the original
Sep 10 2006,positive,not bad for a remake but the original has top spot on me
Sep 10 2006,negative,i dont even know why i gave this movie wannabe 1 star for that kid is supposed to be the son of satan it looks more like a spoiled little brat that tries to pretend hes mad every time mommy hides his little teddy bear buuááá it didnt make me scared it made me cry because i knew that i would never get that money back  dont waste your time or your money go watch the first one instead
Sep 10 2006,positive,ahead of its time a true clasic so much better than the remake they made recently
Sep 9 2006,positive,really goodnot as good as the 1st but the date it came out 666 helped
Sep 9 2006,positive,watched it alone    scary
Sep 9 2006,positive,the omen wow what a movie i saw this one in the movies and i needed to go to the restroom and i did not go because i did not want to miss a singel moment of the movie
Sep 9 2006,positive,not as good as the originaljust a gimick to cash in on
Sep 9 2006,positive,i jumped so it gets some bonus points
Sep 9 2006,neutral,stupid stupid man directing a movie with juilie stilles grrr stupid 
Sep 9 2006,positive,ok that kid is really scary
Sep 8 2006,negative,worst remake ever and i dont want to watch the original
Sep 7 2006,positive,this was pretty good but not a whole lot different from watching the original  so why bother with a remake
Sep 7 2006,positive,i enjoyed it it held true to the original version at least what i can remember from the original
Sep 7 2006,positive,the kid was creepy but not as creepy as the first omen
Sep 7 2006,positive,scares the crap out of me but puts some fear in the nonbelievers i hope

Sep 6 2006,positive,great why bother remaking it 
Sep 6 2006,positive,not very good isent scary at all
Sep 5 2006,neutral,kinda sucked to slow but the death scenes were pretty cool
Sep 5 2006,positive,personally i am never a fan of remakes though texas cahinsaw was decent in this case they should have left well enough alone gregory peck was incredible and the lighting was amazing for contrasting the dark and light forces this one had julia stiles and i just couldnt see her in the role hopefully they will leave the rest of the series well enough alonestill i did enjoy the reporter and teh effects for many of the death scenes did put a little more umph into the story but some films are not ment to be redeux
Sep 4 2006,positive,i always think scary movies are the best when they use that sliver of reality meaning it could happen  using those signs or omens in the begining were all things that have actually happenedwhich is really scary if you think about it  creepy little kid i think he probably only had like two lines throughout the whole movie  i also enjoyed the ending im glad they ended it that way
Sep 4 2006,positive,this movie is fricken awesome
Sep 4 2006,positive,solid ole school classic horror
Sep 4 2006,negative,this movie is far from a horror suspense or thriller i laughed my rear off
Sep 4 2006,positive,spose not as good as original but still great movie
Sep 4 2006,positive,i was honestly expecting this to be scary but it wasnt  there was one or two bits that made everyone jump but then laugh afterwards and some things were a bit disturbing s  it leaves alot to be explained and doesnt build suspense too well either but all in all was an ok film seamus daveyfitzpatrick what a great name p makes a wicked damien  just look at the face o
Sep 3 2006,positive,remakes are done great  but the classics are always the best
Sep 3 2006,positive,this had the added extra of recent world events the only difference to this then the original are the dream sequences and set today rather then back in the 70s mia farrow is great but was waiting for julia stiles to start dancing i did like how it remained true to the original so if you have never seen the original there is no need too
Sep 3 2006,positive,this is a brillent film
Sep 2 2006,positive,this is wicked i love this movie
Sep 2 2006,positive,the film is highly suspenseful but the anticlimatic finale corrupts the entire viewing experience
Sep 1 2006,negative,hahaha try and scare me if u can not likely tho u little bastard
Sep 1 2006,negative,why remake what didnt need remaking hollywood ripoff
Aug 31 2006,positive,original was a classic  new one average

Aug 30 2006,positive,excellent film it had me jumping in my seat and gettin scared so much it i ended up laughing at myself hard i thought even though in the reviews it didnt seem like a very good film that the omen was a wkd film and was way better than the first since it was more realistic and exciting the little boy in it was so scary and especially at the end when he just turns to looks at the camera at his parents funeral and just smiles gives me the chills a must see film so you must see it now xx
Aug 30 2006,positive,u need a heart to see the whole thing
Aug 30 2006,positive,im sure they only made this remake for 060606 promotional opportunity didnt see the point of another cause its exactly the same as the original just modernised

Aug 29 2006,negative,worst movie of the year boring and dumb
Aug 29 2006,positive,it was really scary especially kates dreams first movie i actually screamed at
Aug 29 2006,negative,saw this on june 6 2006 the 6606 that was the only reason i did see it btw was rubbish
Aug 29 2006,positive,maybe its cause im older maybe its cause we are a bit more desensitised to this kind of film these daysbut this just didnt scare the pants off me like the original
Aug 29 2006,negative,stupid and not the slightest bit scarry  how is the eternal sea interpreted as the field of politics and why are these parents such morons

Aug 28 2006,positive,kinda boring and long
Aug 28 2006,positive,im not a huge fan of remakes but this one is one of the better remakes im a huge fan of the omen film and i just think the boy in this film seems more like the son of the devil

Aug 21 2006,positive,not a bad remake not as good as the first but done well
Aug 21 2006,positive,img        john moores attempt at the omen remake was acceptable but there were flaws firstly and most importantly it wasnt scary moore seemed to try too hard in making the movie scary by adding in cheap scares here and there secondly it was true to the original but not an improvement the only change of improvement was the death scenes that were highly exaggerated and gory and lastly the acting is pretty solid but not convincing enough to make the audience believe that damien is truely evil      the omen is still only a good film and an amateur remake see it but only if you must      a fair attempt
Aug 20 2006,negative,want to see the original

Aug 13 2006,positive,this film is fuked up
Aug 13 2006,positive,omg so scary near de end

Aug 13 2006,positive,this movie was a mixed bag for me good acting great fx but i have a problem with some gratuitous deliberately put in there to scare the bejesus out of  you scenes it makes the movie look cheap schreiber and julia stiles are good mia farrow is excellent and quite creepy as the nanny the original is much much better
Aug 12 2006,negative,some of the visuals were really well done  but there was no need to recreate this movie
Aug 12 2006,positive,its very good remake better than expected

Aug 9 2006,neutral,i wish someone hadnt spoiled a key plot point in this film with a quiz question but one has to expect that everyone doesnt subscribe to common decency still a decent update but the original was still so much better
Aug 9 2006,negative,you know its so bloody annoying when you see trailer for a movie that makes it look like itll be good and then youre left totally baffled because the trailer in its 30 second running time holds more suspense more atmosphere and holds your attention that the whole rest of the bloody movie i mean what was meant to be scaring us here the movie is poorly executed with a bland over analysed storyline a great cast all let down by some overracting and a very bland unimaginative script stay away from this one
Aug 9 2006,negative,a boring and unnecessary remake    josh hutcherson is unintentionally hilarious as damien
Aug 9 2006,positive,supposed to be very scary but ended up not only about the curse actually
Aug 9 2006,positive,mans darkest fears are manifested as an unspeakable horror is unleashed on the worldthis  us diplomat substitues an orphan as his own stillborn baby in order to spare his unknowing wifebut after many grotesque murders and dier warnings the father comes to realize that thier child is  the son of satin
Aug 8 2006,positive,ahh its so scary but its still good
Aug 8 2006,negative,well this was dull  for an evil child all he did was throw a hissy fit and glare at the camera  man i have peds patients that freak out worse than him  the dead hour old baby in the grave was scarier and all it did was grace the screen with its holey head for 5 seconds

Aug 8 2006,neutral,the new one sucks compared to the older one before they knew how to make movies scary now they just put stupid fake snakes or something in a movie and people have wasted 7 to see a stupid movie so the older version of the omen was way better

Jul 27 2006,positive,very slow start but then it got real good in the last quarter havnt seen the original so i cant compare
Jul 27 2006,neutral,like 1998s psycho remake this film is totally pointless and laughable in comparison to its source material the performances especially from a silly hysterical mia farrow and totally bland child actor seamus davey fitzpatrick are especially belowpar
Jul 26 2006,positive,wow incredible movie
Jul 26 2006,negative,a realy bad remake  one of the worst movies of 2006
Jul 26 2006,neutral,this movie wasjust there really nothing spectacular about it also depressing

Jul 25 2006,positive,not that god but i have seen it
Jul 25 2006,positive,very freaky really weird
Jul 25 2006,positive,a shot for shot remake of the original severely miscast especially julia stiles what were they thinking but still an enjoyable horror feast great plot some good genuine suspenseful moments and great scares
Jul 23 2006,positive,not a scenebyscene remake like the vince vaughan version of physcho but very faithful to the original the movie looks dreary and the acting is sometimes wooden but the movie is scary and contains some quality deaths for horrorgore fans
Jul 23 2006,positive,possibly the scariest movie ive ever seen
Jul 22 2006,positive,not bad at all the kid wasnt creepy enough and he tried to hard to get that evil stare into his eyes but the other actors delivered a good performance and some of the new additives were interesting not really scary but a thriller none the less
Jul 22 2006,positive,it had a lame ending
Jul 22 2006,neutral,good actors and i like john moore but i still like the original film much better
Jul 22 2006,negative,nothing on the original  gets bonus point for been released on the 6th of the 6th 06
Jul 22 2006,positive,this is a rather jumpy film tbh
Jul 22 2006,positive,normally im not in favour of remakes but this one is so well made that its suspense held up even though i knew  from reading the book and seeing the original version  what was going to happen but then the dread of knowing what is going to happen before it does is the storys central device so i suppose that makes sense
Jul 22 2006,negative,it is exactly like the first film which i hated different but still lousy actors didnt enjoy it dont recommend it
Jul 22 2006,positive,this is sooo gooodd   lol its no even tht scary a would say it was more funny just cause am so evil
Jul 22 2006,positive,good movie not scary in the slightest but still a good plot i can definatly see why there were fifteen sequals in the 70s though it obviously left it open for another one
Jul 21 2006,positive,saw it on 6606 and it was awesomei loved it much better then i thought it would be
Jul 21 2006,negative,wasnt that impressed i wanted creepy but this tried to scare by having things jump out which is  scary for a second

Jul 21 2006,positive,better than the original
Jul 21 2006,positive,its not as gd as the original bt i still enjoyed jumped at a few bits tho still gd fun
Jul 20 2006,positive,everyone said they hated it so i politely disagreed in fact it is one of the best horror films i have ever seen ok the story was weak and the acting was average but it was scary and the story and acting were enough to hold me through to the end i went wanting a movie that would scare me something that didnt feel like an old movie but still stuck to the original story i was happy to say i got exactly what i wanted     so say your the proud parents of an adopted demon child you notice hes trying to kill you seems reasonable that you would defend yourself right appearantly not although still interesting and damn what a big house yes a little less formal tonight but thats how this movie felt like a big jumbled bunch of images thown togeather yet still it managed to hold my attention the entire hour and 45 minutes i didnt even want to get up to use the bathroom in other words good suspense and the shock horror excellent     i think this movie would have been better if the mother had been cast differently otherwise i wouldnt change a thing julia stiles feels like she should be playing the role of dumb blond in some teeny bopper flick instead of terrified mother of the spawn of satan it just doesnt feel right placing her in this role a darker casting would have done nicely overall the movie gets a 7 mostly for the shock horror parts the rest is for effort
Jul 20 2006,negative,sucked big time dont waste your time on it
Jul 20 2006,negative,the original was so much better this remake actually had me laughing through the whole thing
Jul 20 2006,positive,this movie was very creepy very dark
Jul 20 2006,neutral,img a remake of the original horror classic of 1976 this film offers nothing more than the original film has already given us besides some admittedly impressive death scenes it has its moments and isnt that terrible but theres an annoying distance or separation between the subject matter and the film there is no sense of foreboding and its almost as if the film makers and actors were just bored and wanting to get it over and done with the acting was flawed characters didnt seem to fit well and many portions of the movie were dull julia styles gives a lackluster performance simply because she is so over dramatic its simply to say moores the omen is  just another boring dull and totally unnecessary remake   size4colordarkgreen47510colorsize   centerimg
Jul 20 2006,positive,stylish and suspenseful the remake is as good as the classic but the kid damien thorn should behave like an antichrist not pout like a spoilt kid who cant get some icecream
Jul 19 2006,positive,this was pretty good  not entirely scary though just alittle more on the whole religion aspect of things
Jul 19 2006,positive,movies about evil children always creep me out its kind of funny that people always try and stop prophesies from coming true hello theyre prophesies theyre supposed to happen
Jul 19 2006,neutral,not scary more funny
Jul 19 2006,negative,the film was sooo crapi laughed all thru it this remake is so not gud it was supposed to scare me an i found it comical

Jul 17 2006,positive,thought it was good
Jul 16 2006,neutral,starring liev schreiber julia stiles pete postlethwaite and mia farrow  directed by john moore  written by david seltzer  rated brb for disturbing violent content graphic images and some language  running time approximately 1 hour 50 minutes     i havent yet seen the original version of ithe omeni and after this film im not sure if i have any desire to do so using basically the same screenplay basically may or may not have been necessary there as was used for the original film director john moore has created a mildly engaging mildy horrific horror film which uses elements of some of the best horror classics its original version among said classics yet fails the film fails because it is a remake this has all been done before as is obvious and it has been done since thumbs up though to wonderful performances from mia farrow liev schrieber julia stiles and a slightly underused pete postlethwaite b out of  cb     other opinions     itheghostofcorporatefuturei builds upon the original in every way 810  imegan of suburbiai a better remake than most 610  ilionballoi more of a marketing ploy than a motion picture 510  imuckabeesi sub par and soso at best 410

Jul 15 2006,positive,this film had some gd scars and it made me jump from time 2 time but it had a lack ov story within the film
Jul 14 2006,negative,this was more of a comedy i laughed through the whole thing and found myself rooting on satan jr it was completely inconsistent with the original and a huge let down
Jul 14 2006,negative,best part was mommy falling off the balcony beautifully shot
Jul 13 2006,negative,not scary and does not contain the credible factor of gregory peck
Jul 13 2006,positive,normally i am not a big fan of horror movies but i did like this one      that being said i am a huge fan of liev schrieber and julia stiles  also the film is almost a shotbyshot mimic of the orginal movie  normally that would be something i wouldnt appreciate  but here it works    i think it just reminds me of how scared i was when i saw the original as a child

Jul 11 2006,positive,freaky but not that scary
Jul 11 2006,positive,this movie was really freaky  at times it was sort of gory but still interesting  you really need to pay attention to what is happening because it becomes very confusing  overall it was a great movie  julia stiles plays her part so well  you should definitely go to see this if youre up for an outofyourseat story that will keep you up all night long

Jul 9 2006,positive,this movie is best seen with a crowd of people who have not seen the original  while its a competent film it really adds nothing to the film that preceeded it
Jul 9 2006,negative,boring really nothing creepy about itwell except watching my mate scream at it made it a comedy rather thn a horror lol
Jul 9 2006,positive,just a mere copy of the first movie the acting doesnt deserve anything its not that good but its not that bad either the plot was already known no changes what so ever except for maybe some deaths for a person who didnt see the old movie this movie would be quite cool if you have seen the old one already this one isnt worth the time
Jul 8 2006,positive,why couldnt that kid die that ruined it for me as well as the fact that his dad died
Jul 8 2006,positive,it wasnt a horrible movie but i just didnt care for it as much as i thought i would  there was a great point to be made here about the great tribulation and they turned it into more of a gore fest than an informational movie and they still couldve made it scary
Jul 8 2006,positive,freaky but good what a creepy child
Jul 8 2006,positive,the movie is on the verge of being good it had a plot that should have gone a few different directions than it did but it had a good concept the kid is supposed to scare you but when he gets mad you cant help but laugh looks like he is trying to push out a shit or something
Jul 7 2006,positive,excellent movie with liev shcreiber absolutely blowing gregory peck out of the box to turn this tale into one of the best horror movies period the movie is also helped along by other great actors which adds to this terrific movie a must see for omen fans horror fans and general movie fans 910
Jul 7 2006,positive,this is honestly the only scary movie that has ever actually scared me lol
Jul 7 2006,positive,this is an amazing movie  i couldnt believe that this movie was actually so good  i recommend it to everyone

Jul 7 2006,negative,i was forced to see this movie again and therefore my rating for it has gone down why because i realized it really doesnt make sence at all the plot just ends up not working and it just seems very lame now
Jul 7 2006,positive,good horor a couple a of scary parts
Jul 7 2006,positive,best god damnned remake ever i thoght this would be like one of those sht remakes i was wrong they made all the stuff out dated in the 70s and made in to 21th centuary stuff also seeing it on the first day it screened which was luckly the 6606 just made it better
Jul 6 2006,positive,most remakes are dispointing and i honestly thought this would ruin the omen and disapoint me boy was i wrong the thing that made we like this movie so much was the way john moore modernized if thats a word all the old stuff into a new fresh 21st century classic horror flick
Jul 6 2006,positive,exactly like the first one but i expected more than that in 2006 as far as special effects an all overall dont waste your time
Jul 6 2006,positive,pretty gud as wiv all remade films never as gud as the original but i liked this one it was pretty gud wen u got past all the slow n boring parts in between has to be seen at the cinema to be appreciated tho
Jul 6 2006,neutral,it was okay  different but okay  i didnt like the ending though it was unexspected  it wasnt scary like i thought it would be
Jul 6 2006,positive,realy kwl movie there gunna b anothr out soon
Jul 6 2006,positive,good film as good as the original just had a more modern touch    with the antichrist being born under an american ambassador for england thats a good story line    in the end the mother the 2nd and first nanny and father are all killed  the boy is finally left under custodyof the ambassadors godfather    the president of the united states    some people watched it for the deaths well  one decapitation one was injected with oxygen into their blood stream one was shot several times and one impaled by a large pole along with dozens of gashes from the glass up above    this was an awsome movie    and of course the antichrists mother was a jackle
Jul 6 2006,positive,i actually cired  i shit myself like never before  but it is well good 
Jul 6 2006,positive,the kid is really weird and spooky but the movie good
Jul 6 2006,negative,size2its not just coincidence that a film about the son of the devil would be released on 6606 ironically its the only thing this remake of the 1976 film has going for it     damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick is adopted at birth by a senior diplomat and his wife as time goes on damien shows no attachment to his parents raising questions if there is something wrong with him once learning that damien is truly the devils son his father robert thorn liev schreiber and photojournalist keith jennings david thewlis travel abroad to defeat this evil    unlike the original this lacks any sense of horror and is more of the stereotypical lowbudget thrillers around currently it tries to use scare tactics but fails its cliché after cliché and anything thats wrong with the world or evil is tied in to stretch and make up for the story its missing ithe omeni is just a jumbled mess from the start revealing too much to begin with leaving no suspense whatsoever    daveyfitzpatrick isnt a bad damien but he just isnt put over as an undeniable antichrist his only purpose in this film is to look menacing and thats all he does with only a few lines to say and minimizing his evil acts damien is more so a side character that stops and starts the film continuously     whats worse is the protagonists liev schreiber and julia stiles are two poorly executed characterizations and quite unlikable that you have to cheer on the demon child damien ultimately gives what he gets because stiles is far from the motherly type giving egocentric vibes off to her child thewlis adds to the mystery of the film but his character is too disposable to honestly care about     the film fails in the second half where its primarily one chase sequence after another resulting in absolutely nothing except prolong the inevitable if thats not a sour taste in the mouth the only aspect to wonder about is what outrageous death awaits the person the protagonist crosses next     only damiens nanny mrs baylock played by genrerenown mia farrow delivers an on par performance but like the story there is an unsettling unbalance in her underused character farrow delivers most of her potential in the middle leaving an empty unsatisfying finale     the omen accomplishes nothing and gives nothing back except another weak entry into the many recent remakes of true classics     size
Jul 6 2006,negative,bad not scary at all wasted my money watching it at the theatres
Jul 6 2006,positive,very good for a remake i liked the origional betterit was more intense but this one was good as well julia stiles wasnt the best in this but overall a good cast
Jul 6 2006,negative,the original was ten times better the shock effect is terrible compared to the original considering that it was made 30 years ago for first timers however i would suppose most would say it was a good movie conclusion  good plot terrible rendition  1 star  half for the fact the original plot was still used half for the shitty attempt to release it on 666at least its an effort
Jul 5 2006,positive,well shot atmospheric great acting from schreiber but very unappealing ending for me if they dont remake any more of the omen films there was no point in making this one there was one bit that freaked me the dream sequence in the bath
Jul 5 2006,positive,i heard some people saw the previews and it ruined it for themi saw this with a buddy and it was a 7 12 out of tenthats barely enough to be a recommendable film
Jul 5 2006,positive,kinda week compared to the original
Jul 5 2006,positive,surprisingly good doesnt offer much in terms of horror but none the less contains some entertaining edgeofyourseat thrills

Jul 5 2006,positive,very well made  gr8 film
Jul 4 2006,positive,its not one of those horror movies based on gore this has more of a plot to follow although in saying that there is one or two goreish scenes  the boy plays the part well hes creepy but i expected more out of julia stiles  theres jumpy bits in it which is good and overall its a pretty good movie but be warned the ending isnt so fantastic
Jul 4 2006,negative,worth renting  saw it on 6606 and it added nothing
Jul 4 2006,positive,this movies looks  great and its rated r a real scary movie yeah but i aint feelin the 6606 thing

Jun 28 2006,positive,it has a good story aint it it could actually be a blockbuster if it has better cast  crew
Jun 28 2006,negative,just like the old once

Jun 28 2006,positive,very similar to originals clearly shows they will follow up with same sequels

Jun 28 2006,positive,not scary jst makes u jmp a bit
Jun 27 2006,neutral,i didnt think that this would be very good  and it wasnt really  i think that it could have been a lot better
Jun 27 2006,positive,i didnt see the first one so the remake wasnt ruined
Jun 27 2006,positive,i saw this one in the 80s never forgot it it is the greatest fear because it is the ancient fear of the unknown it is a warning foretold for thousands of years it is our final warning it is the omen
Jun 27 2006,positive,i usally like michael bay movies but the ending could have been better but i did like the way some characters died it remined me of final destination

Jun 27 2006,positive,liked it a fair bit thanks to the casting of schreiber and thewlis competent remake that for my money does the religious thriller thing better than the da vinci code
Jun 27 2006,negative,the first hour or so is interesting but just like the original it dies very quickly and becomes incredibly boring poor
Jun 27 2006,positive,when the jews return to zion  and a comet rips the sky  and the holy roman empire rises  then you and i must die 
Jun 27 2006,positive,the ending is not really that good but the story line is quite interesting though and i watched this movie on the 6606 haha
Jun 27 2006,neutral,eugh i didnt like this at all julia stiles was off somehow and a lot of the acting was just weird in a bad way i did like big pete he was ok and the main guy though i dont know who the hell he is he is gay for the first half then gets cool there were bucket loads of childish and unnecessary scares which did make me jump but were silly none the less a few effects looked quite pleasing but overall it was a very dislikable feature the whole premise of the film is a bit gay but could have been executed well unfortunatley not the boy was annoying and the film is mostly a waste of time no
Jun 27 2006,positive,i fort it be scary but it wernt it didnt make me jump once i need 2 get scared lol
Jun 27 2006,positive,very scary i never want to see it again

Jun 26 2006,neutral,could have been scarier was kinda dull

Jun 26 2006,negative,oh julia stilesno excuses at least there was a cool decapitation
Jun 26 2006,positive,never associating with some one called damien
Jun 26 2006,positive,my friends dragged me out on the 6606 to see it wasnt as scary as i hoped but was still fun to watch nishi and fabian jump
Jun 26 2006,positive,this film was mediocre it was okay i expected better though because i really enjoy horror films the film packed some genuine edgeofyourseat moments though and maybe the film had took some ideas from final destination
Jun 26 2006,positive,haha i fucking screamed
Jun 25 2006,neutral,never saw the original but i didnt have to it seems like every element in the movie ive seen before from watching other horror movies who have probably borrowed from the original
Jun 25 2006,positive,the remake looks better than the orginallol
Jun 25 2006,positive,all in all i would have to say that this movie was pretty cooli will admit that it did drag a bit but the death scenes were kick a i hope theres a sequel
Jun 25 2006,negative,the decapitation was pretty sweet but other than that this movie has nothing going for it
Jun 25 2006,negative,not as gd as i expected
Jun 25 2006,positive,although not my kind of movie it was good  i thought it was scarier is more suspence really
Jun 25 2006,positive,for a scary movie i liked it because i have a weird sense of humour i found bits of it very funny at the age of four i was watching scary movies so nothing scares me anymore however this film did make me jump which is always essential in a good scary movie the plot worked well and the kid was quite unerving
Jun 25 2006,positive,not totally scary but certainly jumpy

Jun 24 2006,neutral,it was ok i was dissapointed
Jun 24 2006,positive,still an okay show its progress is almost the same as the original however what spooked me was how they found actors almost identical to the original movie for the remake oo
Jun 24 2006,positive,the original is soooo much better its still good though
Jun 24 2006,neutral,i saw the omen twice once with my brother and once with my friends  when i went with my brother the movie wasnt scary and wasnt that much fun however interesting so my experience with it the first time was about a 4  but i went with my friends and although the movie didnt get any better one of my friends was screaming the entire time so at least that experience was more entertaining and earned about a 6  so overall for me the movie gets a 5
Jun 24 2006,positive,omg everyone who knows me recognizes how utterly out of control i was when i saw this movie i am soo squimish when it comes to socalled scary movies so i was anticipating the worst going into this movie however i have never laughed so hard before in my entire life when the guys head got chopped off i was dying literally rolling around on the floor ahh good times
Jun 24 2006,negative,very similar to the first one muddled theology

Jun 24 2006,negative,this movie looked pretty good in the previews but in the theatre there was nothing original about it people were killed off ifinal destinationistyle totally lame and the acting was a bit boring all i can really say for this movie is meh
Jun 24 2006,positive,looks well scary but so cooooolllllllllll
Jun 24 2006,positive,it is a very beautifully made movie the bright red in each scene was very nice but it deviated so much from the book that i ended up not liking it as much as i liked the book the cast was terrible mia farrows was able to save the movie to some extent but the actor playing robert butchered the movie and juila stiles wasnt able to do a very convincing job
Jun 24 2006,positive,a great remake  his day has come  and it was scary 
Jun 23 2006,negative,liev schreiber was the only thing i liked about this movie otherwise it sucked more than a hooker
Jun 23 2006,positive,this m0vie issh quite scarybtw tat man c0uld n0t kill the dem0ns s0n at the endhaiz
Jun 23 2006,positive,it was good but it was even better beacusea friend was there
Jun 23 2006,negative,recalling the old 70s version of omen which i have not seen for at least 10 years id have to say my memory is a bit hazy but i know it was better than this first of all let me make it clear that the hollywood flawless feel of largebudget films does not work for horror films it makes everything too clean it makes it too crisp thats why horror films like 28 days later or evil dead are so killer for me they have the unprofessional quality that works since the original omen was made in the 70s it has that same quality that i enjoy in my horrorthrillers     other than that the new omen just pretty much sucks the whole poem about the end of the world with the jews returning to their homeland what the f the whole series of three 6s tatoo thing was lame and cliche as hell no pun intended really it was all just lame lame lame     and the kid that kid was not at all menacing he just looked indifferent while they played some cryptic music and by all means he should be way more powerful apparently they kept all too faithful to the original omen in several ways the jackal mother the suicidal nanny at the birthday party dogs attacking people you name it i dont know why but in this one it just all seemed so contrived and thoughtless     there was also this dream sequence that the mother had a few times as well as the father this jackal in a weird capemirrorsdogsbloodeven their son in what looked like the mask from the jim carrey movie the mask it was absolutely hilarious actually if anything at least this is a bad film that a viewer can have fun making fun of and who the f doesnt like making fun of movies every now and again actually since the last time i checked most horror films seem to be made because their so damn fun to make fun of     so if you havent even seen the original omen i declare that you should go out and do so because it is more worth your time than this s if you have some free time to waste and feel in the mood to make fun of the crap you watch by all means shell out a few bucks for this oh and with the whole 6606 marketing scheme being tied in with the movie damien was also born 6606 in the film 666 may have gotten its most exaustive usage in the history of cinema
Jun 23 2006,positive,img  directed by john moore   colorcyanumpaaucolorrfor disturbing violent content and horrific images      we couldve gotten a really amazing and super scary movie on 666 but instead we get a horror remake but thats okay this remake wasnt anything awful or the word thats been used the most to bash it boring  no i was never bored  the many gory death scenes jumps and suspenseful moments kept me entertained i did wish that the story was a little more involving though because parts of it reminded me of ifinal destination 3i   but i cant really blame anyone for that since those movies borrowed from the original omen      we dont really get to see males play our protagonists in horror that much anymore so it was nice to see liev as our hero instead of julia stiles  i have to admit that the jump scenes were pretty effective despite how predictable they were sorry but i couldnt help it im so easy  then there were those death scenes that were just amazing  i couldnt ask for a more satisfying decapitation at the end it was different from the original too        i wouldve been fine waiting for this on dvd but seeing it in theaters wasnt too bad of an idea  most horror movies get good ratings from me so dont be surprised by the 75 i gave this remake      bsize37510sizeb
Jun 23 2006,positive,the best remake ive ever seen it really shows the exact same to the original omen just a lot scarier and chilling
Jun 23 2006,positive,was ok  was pretty scary but was kind of corny
Jun 23 2006,positive,ok i jumped at the scary bits the film broke down n it seemed predictable that it was gona happen thot it would b sooooo much beta

Jun 23 2006,positive,it made me jump that never happens could of been the caffiene but the movie seemed scary by my standards

Jun 23 2006,neutral,too much talking and not enough scaring
Jun 23 2006,positive,awesome movie i went to it on 6606 pretty creepy
Jun 23 2006,negative,img    bibeen there seen thatib  bb   first of all this movie could have been much scarier if it just relied on the plain horrifying idea of satanpossesion  this movie was very average and probably deserves a lesser rating than i give it but it is very rare for a movie to get worse than a 4 out of 10  second the whole sudden loud noise after long drawn out and predictable silence is just a terrible way to make a horror movie  it is not scary at all and frankly im pissed off the way all the modern horror movies seem to live by it  and third the acting is very par if not sub pari do not recommend this movie     stay classy
Jun 23 2006,positive,one of the few movies that disturb me since the original classic
Jun 23 2006,positive,i think the original is about a million times better  wasnt feeling julia stiles as the mom  but mia farrow was awesome this version was more scaryjumpy than the original and had more current events integrated in it but im partial to the orig as its one of my fave movies ever  
Jun 23 2006,negative,disapointed of a nice story to ends up like tat

Jun 20 2006,negative,there were a few slightly scary moments but the movie just didnt impress me though i am a fan of evil children   a few times i just had to laugh at how stupid things seemed it was predictable and silly but some things were ok the child actor seemed pretty good for the role for the most part  the characters felt cold and distant and had very little chemistry and i just couldnt care about them  some of the music was just annoying i understand what they were going for with it but it became distracting rather than adding to the feel of the movie nothing special and not worth the money spent on the ticket
Jun 20 2006,positive,scary ass hell but worth it
Jun 20 2006,negative,it do not make a break though the child is not seems like so evil and horrible

Jun 19 2006,positive,scary  good one 
Jun 18 2006,positive,exciting horrible death scenes filled with suspension most of the time the ending seems to hint that there will be the omen ii
Jun 18 2006,positive,666 biatches  omg when i went to watch it which was not on 666 because i was working that day there were three of us and it was in theater 9 which looked like 6 when we were walking outand our three ticket stubs turned upside down was666 freaky eh

Jun 18 2006,positive,yeah i dunno not much to say im really bored ha
Jun 18 2006,neutral,nothing much to the all similar storyline
Jun 18 2006,positive,holy crap this movie scared the shiite monkeys outta me one of my biggest fears are satanic things
Jun 18 2006,positive,can beat the first omen
Jun 18 2006,positive,the uncut and extented scenes on the dvd are only a couple seconds longer stupid the movie was pretty good ovarall
Jun 18 2006,positive,this movie raped and sucked at the same time
Jun 18 2006,positive,essentially the same as the original but with stiffer actors and a few dream sequences that dont serve much of a purpose beyond throwing in a few cheap boo scares  decent but youre probably better off just renting the original
Jun 18 2006,negative,this movie was gay and it wasnt even scary
Jun 18 2006,positive,omg this film scared me it makes u think its a must see
Jun 18 2006,negative,this was the gays shit in the world
Jun 18 2006,negative,i was not into this film sure it made me jump but just wasnt really my cuppa tea
Jun 18 2006,positive,really really good movie i didnt like the ending tho
Jun 18 2006,positive,it is a really good movie it has some surprising parts that made my hairs stand up on end i liked it
Jun 18 2006,negative,the only reason i gave this movie a two was that it got points for making me laugh at the worst parts they tried way to hard to remake a movie that didnt need to be remade

Jun 18 2006,negative,not tat scary but its intresting to watch
Jun 18 2006,negative,terrible a waste of time  dont bother   
Jun 18 2006,positive,a competent remake while it stays true to the spirit and layout of the original it doesnt pull a van sant and completely copy it    with many original ideas some added side plots and a big update for modern events including a vital and interesting interpretation of the book of revelations with the events themselves    mountains of fire brought down by god  the twin towers    a star falls from above  columbia tragedy    sea will swallow the earth  new orleans flooding    and of course much much more
Jun 17 2006,positive,it was alot better then i initally expected previous to seeing it i had alot of people tell me that the movie was absolutely horrible but it really wasnt that bad if you are going into the movie expecting a horror movie then i can see how you get disappointed but if you go in looking more at a psychological thriller then its the shit the acting is corny but it is also following in the steps of the original a plesant surprise
Jun 17 2006,positive,man i really wanna see this movie but not alone it looks so good and kinda freaaky my friends dont wanna see it though bc theyre scared of itbut i do it looks good so im gonna rate it five stars  im probably gonna go see it with my bro im not 18 yetlol
Jun 17 2006,positive,wow a really good remake from the origanal film plus what a time to bring it out on the actual 6th day 6th month 6th year the remake to the omen was really cool it kept to the the origanal storyline where liev schreiber has a son  has a birth sign on his head of three 6s what was really good about this film is the way they brought actual events that happen in the world like 911 the great tsunami that happened in boxing day 2005 the rising of the armies which was all leading up to the birth of damien the devils son one thing that made this film good to is when julia stiles who plays the mother of damien starts having bad dreams about damien  they put a few demons in the dream one thing about this demon is it really reminded me of the monster from the village hahaha but getting back to the omen anybody who was a big fan of the classic film i would recommend this film to you wont be disappointed

Jun 17 2006,positive,i might be one of the only people who didnt like the original omen  this was a great remake based on that  the deaths were very well done and the story seemed to move a lot better than in the original  hopefully they will skip the second one and move straight to the third one when he is grown up  i love the recent remakes theyve turned classics into classics

Jun 16 2006,negative,size3fonttimes new romanhis day will come so the movie posters said well it came and now it needs to go this film did not impress me in the least julia stiles for the love of film history your son is the devil reborn how about you act a little more disturbed and scared liev schieveri have nothing bad to comment on i enjoyed his role the child who played damienwell not scary he reminded me of the kid from the shining annoying and with an annoying hair cut        i enjoyed the story i really liked the original but this one was so boring i was so bored that i found time to check my voicemail i was the only one in the movie theater this film had potential but fell flat     fontsize
Jun 16 2006,positive,loved it bit predictable apparently pretty much a duplicate of the original but its a great movie
Jun 16 2006,negative,not scary tiny bit gory usually little scary kids scare the begeezus out of me but not this one he makes me giggle
Jun 16 2006,negative,if you are in the mood for a good scary movie save your gas money and go rent the new remake of the amityville horror it seems the suits at 20th century fox simply saw the opportunity to use the symbolism of the release date 6606 but just didnt deliver the movie about a boy who is destined to be the antichrist lacks any real scares there are two or three jumpscares but as far as suspense and fear are concerned the movie falls short of its 1976 predecessor question is should we start praying for hollywood are they running out of ideas im starting to wonder about all the remakes that are flooding the box office
Jun 16 2006,positive,really really good i love julia stiles
Jun 16 2006,positive,such a good movie but da dogz r soooo scary
Jun 16 2006,positive,i honestly thought i would die on 666
Jun 16 2006,positive,a really solid remake  one of the few remakes that actually got it right  it stays completely faithful aside from a few liberties taken that actually serve the plot and feel of the movie  the pacing is great and keeps the mood tense  my only real complaint lies with the kid who played damien sure hes creepy looking but hes awful in the seens where he actually has to do something more than just stand there and be creepy
Jun 16 2006,positive,i luved this movie
Jun 16 2006,positive,fontarialsize4well colorblack i finally saw the omen  this version only differs in that jerry goldsmith did the score otherwise the dialogue and the action remained the same  except they left out the vision of the 3 comets in the original omen  excellent acting by julia stiles and liev schrieber only this time he was president rather than ambassador to great britain as was gregory pecks character  julia stiles was a bit more wimpy than lee remick  but else wise a very excellent remakecolorsizefont  fontarialsize4color000000colorsizefont   fontarialsize4color000000suenotefresh colorsizefont

Jun 15 2006,positive,defenitely not as good as the original

Jun 15 2006,positive,made me jump a couple times creppy little flick never saw original so story was decent for me
Jun 15 2006,positive,the music apoiled it the style was good as was the shock scenes the acting was good here and there
Jun 15 2006,negative,alright so my friend dragged me to see the omen last week yes its taken me this long just to write my review well i didnt have much expectations for the film going into it didnt really get much after seeing it anyway the film wasnt really bad as a film except it really made me feel like i wasted time i really dont see the point in the film everything that happened was final destinationesque and really didnt scare me nor seem to have a point or meaning to it most people see the film as o yea that was pretty good and well it wasnt bad as i made my way through it but by the end it had me thinking wtf was the point in this i mean even if it was meant to spawn sequels and other parts it really seemed so unnecessary like nothing happened the kid is the devil n does his shit and in the end hes still there and its like nothing happened his face at the end pissed me off neway stupid kid but anyway i just dont think the film was necessary sure it got what it wantedpeople to the box office but in the end it had absolutely nothing memorable in it nor will it be remembered for doing anything new or scary overall its lucky getting away with a 410
Jun 15 2006,negative,this shud not even have been released dont bother watching it
Jun 15 2006,positive,too much glitz and glamour for my taste the original movie filled you with a true fear with its dreamy yet real feeling while this remake did not hollywood completely ruined that the only scares i got out of this movie were the occassional boo moments i have noticed that hollywood has been lacking originality these days with all these remakes instead of new films but at least this one didnt mess up the entire story by changing the complete plot
Jun 15 2006,positive,outstanding i was scared out of my mind
Jun 15 2006,negative,didnt do justice to the original at all
Jun 15 2006,positive,ive never seen the original omen altho i love the soundtrack to it for its dark and creepy mood which i can only assume carries over into the film im hearing from many many people that this remake is a scene for scene recreation of the original film however so now im curious to see it anyway given that i havent seen the original i went in to the movie with a pretty fresh prospective and middle ground expectations i did expect to get scared but i was also expecting something along the lines of url of daysurl in terms of believability    for starters this movie is not scary not even slightly there is one moment where i leaped out of my seat and i give serious props to the director for that moment since it was set up perfectly i didnt see it coming until a split second before it happened and that made it all the better  the moments where they mean for you to get chills are so over played that some people actually have started laughing the kid in the movie is far from creepy and in fact is just so cute when he gets angry that you just want to pinch his cheeks thankfully he only has two lines in the whole movie because both those lines were read awfully bad i mean really really bad like the daughter in url history of violenceurl bad dont expect to see this kid in any more movies in the future i was however very happy to see two of my favorite bit actors url postlethwaiteurl as father brennan who tells the protagonist the truth about his son and url thewlisurl as keith jennings the photographer that helps to unravel the mystery both are very underrated actors and i think they really help to make this movie work  pete does however probably have the most unintentionally funny moment in the movie when he walks up to robert thorn and tells him in all seriousness that he needs to accept jesus christ as his lord and savior that had me rolling in the aisles    all the critics have said the same thing and ill echo it here because its true this movie was made to take advantage of its release date 6606 and as such must be taken with a few grains of salt the first and second acts of the movie are dry and quite fairly boring to watch but the third act is so wonderfully done that it makes up for it truly the climax of the film is possibly the best ive seen yet this year maybe the best ive seen in a horrorthriller film i loved it and the last scene does successfully send chills down your spine    is this movie worth the price of seeing in the theater eh not really maybe for a matinee but dont shell out 10 for a nighttime ticket i do think its worth renting and ill probably grab it when it comes out im actually curious to hear the directors commentary for this film
Jun 15 2006,positive,gory but really good story
Jun 15 2006,positive,pretty good the kid is creepy but i still prefer the original 1976
Jun 15 2006,positive,i like saw it the day it came out and its gd but not like really scary
Jun 15 2006,neutral,wooowweird to sum it up in a word or creepy the acting was pretty good especially by the little boy too good maybe cause dang was it easy to believe that he was possessed
Jun 15 2006,positive,have never watched a more scary movie screamed like i never have before
Jun 15 2006,positive,probly the best horror suspence ill see this year
Jun 15 2006,positive,at a time when remakes a generally crap this is really good good update and not to many new ideas

Jun 15 2006,negative,it was okbut not scary
Jun 15 2006,positive,really enjoyable horror film although havent seen the original personally a good remake worth seeing
Jun 15 2006,neutral,uthe omen remake 2006u     this film manages to get entertainment but not strong entertainment so many of you could walk out of the theater not enjoying the film the acting was poor cinematography was poor and the plot seemed broken and confused however it still manages to scare your girlfriend a few times which comming from john moore behind enemy lines its not that bad of a job for the lack of horror talent     plus a cameo of the origional damion from the first omen harvey stephens pops in as a tabloid photographer which from then on out its pretty much all able to be figured out     dont get too excited for this film it is an alright film however it isnt anything speacial i advise renting this movie if you have any interest in this film to save yourself a few dollars you can go spend that 16 dollars or however much it costs and go out to eat with your sweet heart        u16 blocksu     starring bruce willis as a washed out cop which he gets assigned a little job of taking a fast talking whitness to a court house 16 blocks away unfortunitely bruce willis character ends on your typicall bruce willus gun campain the film is nothing speacial with a small twist on the end worth a see for bruce fans thats all i reconmend
Jun 14 2006,positive,good film it wasnt as scary as the origanal but it was more funny
Jun 14 2006,positive,it was brilliant i luved every bit of it
Jun 14 2006,positive,rotten  the exact same movie with more gore in exstange for no holy music is it worth it no      there comes a time in every boys life when he must realize that he is the son of satin spawed to bring about the apocolips well at least in damienes the new omen seems to be only made for the comeing of the 666 and even though the movie is modernized it seems to be missing what made the original a classic       ill admit the begining of the new movie is cool with the talk of how are recent tragic events is the forshadow to satins riseing i also must say that the pole stabing sene in the new one was done goryer and much better as well however compared to the scenes that were worse and more boring like the monkey scene the dog scene and the babysitter scene the trade in just wasnt worth it yet everyone who watches the knew one must admit the moms nioghtmares are more stupid than scary      the worst part though is the lack of preachy music from the original when i saw the original i thought the music made half the moive and know that its gone half the moive seems to be missing whith out that holy gothic music the omen is no more than a mediocar horror that lacks in apeal
Jun 14 2006,positive,great movie just like the original but better
Jun 14 2006,negative,pretty crap the scariest thing about the movie was everybody else in the movies cheering while some chick hung herself its all for u damien dont bother
Jun 14 2006,negative,it was horrible  i mean i love scary movies but like this was sooo fake and because it ended as a cliffhanger theyre probably going to make an omen 2 i just know it   but i have to say when the nanny gets run over its hilarious
Jun 14 2006,negative,id rather read the bookthats how bad it was
Jun 14 2006,positive,while not overly scary this movie is well done i do think the producerscasting directors should have picked a better mother for damien the son of the devil julia stiles seemed a little too young for the part the overall movie was really good

Jun 11 2006,positive,another runofthemill horror flick with little to give but not much to take away with a cast of talented actors and some good special effects its an average remake that neither hurts nor helps anyone or anything an enjoyable forgettable bit of film thats good for a rainy day

Jun 11 2006,negative,pretty bada couple good scenes of violence didnt even save it
Jun 11 2006,positive,good but not as fantastic as i expected but still worth seeing
Jun 11 2006,positive,this is pretty much a straight retelling of the 1976 original  although schreiber is no peck he does pull of a good performance  where the original had more the feeling of dread in the movie this one has gone more of the route of horror films of today with plenty more scares thrown into the mix
Jun 11 2006,positive,very scary damien get away from my dreams jajaa
Jun 11 2006,positive,decent movie had some really strange twists to it and also had some jumpy parts overall a rent unless you are a huge fan of the others
Jun 11 2006,positive,some parts in this moviee make u jump
Jun 11 2006,positive,looks scary i love scary
Jun 11 2006,positive,i actually liked this movie  i enjoyed the story line and it kept you interested in what was going to happen next  although i wasnt so fond of the last 5 minutes
Jun 11 2006,positive,a mediocre remake thats really all there is to say ive never seen the original but from what i hear this movie is basically the sameliterally framebyframe but again i havent seen the original so i cant say anything about that       this movie had its moments but most of it to me was crap the beginning is clouded by a cheesy montage of damien growing up and everything else up till the end seems rushed        the actor that plays damien character does an awful job all he manages to portray is a pouting kid who hates churchesand screams a lot luckily however the story carried his character through and i was more scared when i couldnt see him        the suspense is best in the end but it seems like there couldve been more done to the entire movie too many boring parts are in the way of small and tooshort scares overall i the omen remake isnt something i will remember a few months from now save the ending which was already in the original
Jun 11 2006,positive,no way as good as the original but still creepy and makes you jump a lot
Jun 11 2006,negative,it was overhyped way too overhyped i garantee it would never of been watch so much if i ddidnt take advantage of the day 6606
Jun 11 2006,positive,why are horror movies so funny haha
Jun 11 2006,positive,this was a good movie but scary and im not to great in scary movies but i still thought it was a good movie overall
Jun 11 2006,neutral,it is based on catholic belief is one thing wrong with it  but also the camera shows how cheap they were at making the movie  at one point in the movie they have a camera man on foot chasing the actors  that could give it a good realistic feeling but according to my beliefs it wasnt very realistic  the antichrist wont raise up like that  he will be completely normal for the jews to think that he is the messiah    putting beliefs to the side though it is still just a descent movie with descent acting
Jun 11 2006,positive,whoa most underrated film ever i heard this was really good but that doesnt begin to explain the greatness of this movie it was so brilliant they incorporated things from real life to make it sound like armegedon the deaths were even more wicked then final destination the acting was stunning and the plot was the smartest thing i ever seen its like the perfect movie

Jun 11 2006,positive,size6a date with destiny or just another day    sizecentersize6img  center  size6  size size4for some todays date evokes 666 a number linked to apocalypse       sizejune 6 clips   by k connie kang   june 6 2006      today is the sixth day of the sixth month six years into the second millennium and for some people that adds up to apocalypse      for others 666  the mark of the beast in the new testament  is a marketing opportunity hollywood today is releasing a remake of the omen a 1976 thriller about a family raising a child born on june 6 1966 who is destined to become the antichrist      the publisher of the popular left behind series christian novels about the end times that have sold tens of millions of copies is issuing yet another book the rapture and   an online gaming site posted 101 odds that there will be an apocalypse today      the church of satan was scheduled to hold a high satanic mass today in hollywood and some heavy metal bands are releasing compact disks      so whats the meaning of the dreaded 666      it is a great conundrum said david m scholer professor of the new testament at fuller theological seminary in pasadena and an authority on the book of revelation the last book of the bible scholars have debated this throughout the history of the church      the number comes from revelation 1318 credited to john      this calls for wisdom if anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast for it is mans number his number is 666      in the omen the image is literal a birthmark of three sixes on the boys head      scholer says the current theory held by most scholars is that 666 is a cryptogram for nero the roman emperor who persecuted christians with unspeakable cruelty      though revelation is written in greek the cryptogram relates to caesar nero in hebrew pronounced keser neron hebrew did not have signs for numbers and instead assigned numerical values to letters in the alphabet      scholer said that adding up the value of the hebrew letters in neros name  100 60 200 50 200 6 and 50  one gets 666      revelation  apocalypse in greek  was probably written between ad 81 and 96 during a time when many believed that nero might come back to life      in ad 68 nero killed himself by slitting his throat that wound and the fear of neros return apparently accounts for revelation 133 one of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound but the fatal wound had been healed the whole world was astonished and followed the beast      this hasnt stopped some interpreters from identifying various people as the beast of revelation  various popes martin luther napoleon saddam hussein and prince charles      ronald wilson reagan was also suggested because each of his names had six letters after the president and nancy reagan moved into their new home in belair she had the address changed from 666 to 668      john p crossley jr director of uscs school of religion says adding to the confusion is that some manuscripts use 616      revelation a letter circulated to seven churches in what is today turkey is like no other book in the bible because it is in the genre of jewish apocalyptic literature full of symbolism      this genre scholer said sought to confront deep and disturbing questions including why do gods faithful people suffer at the hands of the wicked oppressors will there ever be vindication for the faithful      even for regular bible readers revelation is considered difficult to understand because the symbolism is sometimes violent and dramatic with references to angels and strange beasts      after spending this quarter studying revelation under scholer his students  who turned in papers rolled up like scrolls and sealed with wax  said that theyve gained a better understanding of the book      there is a lot of weird stuff in there said jessica handy from holland mich but that makes sense to me now      to her having scholer explain the main themes  including jesus is the lord and god wins in the endwas helpful to see those themes moving throughout makes the rest of it seem less strange handy said      as for associating satan with 666 and the antichrist thats the result of christian authors writing about satan so much said j gordon melton a methodist minister based in santa barbara and author of the encyclopedia of american religions      satanism is itself largely a product of christian paranoia melton said      similarly crossley believes the secular interest in 666 has partly to do with the fundamentalists interpretation of the bible that there will be a literal end time when a beast will rise out of the sea with the number emblazoned on his forehead      when he appears thats the signal for the battle of armageddon to start he said      but theologians do agree on one thing revelation offers a message of hope and encouragement to gods people because it promises that christ will defeat evil in the ultimate cosmic battle      we are looking forward to the physical literal return of christ in which he will defeat his enemies the beast and antichrist and he will establish an intermediate 1000year kingdom on earth followed by an eternal kingdom said d jeffrey bingham chairman and professor of theological studies at dallas theological seminary      the hoopla over 666 could serve a useful purpose he said by reminding people that the bible does say an evil one will rise and ultimately be defeated by christ      but there are others who cant resist marking this day with humor the

Jun 10 2006,positive,looks interesting and scary
Jun 10 2006,negative,out of the very few movies i have gone to this year the omen was sadly one of the better ones i havent even seen the original and i didnt like it people make too many horror remakes these days when was the last time that there was actually an original scare       not only was i not familiar with the original film i was not familiar with the director script or pretty much anything other than the main character who i knew from the recent manchurian candidate remake so you probably get the point i walked in knowing nothing about the movie other than the highly predictable fact that the kid is the devil and i still felt like i knew too much the main parts of the movie involve a camera man and the an embassador running all over europe researching biblical referances to the devil they do all of this to verify what you already know is true from the very first scene of the movie it seems as though you are supposed to be surprised at the fact that he is the devil       the movie had a decent script as well as good direction and acting it just felt like a pointless waste of time which is pretty much what most of it is if you wanna be scared go to the movie rentals cause you sur as hell wont find at the theaters at least wait for something a little more original than this        all ratings out of 5

Jun 10 2006,positive,june 6 2006     bsize5colordarkredacolorsizebny kid named damien has got to be evil the name sounds too much like damnation for him not to be thats a clue i never picked up on with the original omen from 1976 maybe nowadays particulary in the realm of the politics and global terror a threat of damnation from the devils son is more fitting than 30 years ago the movie metaphorically says the antichrist will rise up from a political stance and turn man against his brother until man is no more could this be a reference to our sitting president     politics aside the new omen is actually pretty good and i liked the original a lot it was creepy and disturbing which can no doubt be attributed to the era in which it was made theres just something about the style and decor of the 1970s that makes horror films more frightening and grotesque brown telephones orange wallpaper white furniture fluffy rugs the best horror movies  the exorcist the wicker man halloween  took advantage of these patterns and created an ominous atmosphere      the 2006 omen doesnt have that advantage but its still spooky on its own merits at the beginning the presidents godson robert thorn liev schreiber arrives at a hospital in italy where his wife katherine julia stiles has just lost their baby during childbirth katherine doesnt know it yet and before she can a priest tells robert that another newborn just arrived without a family he insists robert and katherine raise the child as their own and that god will overlook their deception they name the baby damien     five years pass on damiens fifth birthday strange unhallowed events start to occur like the nanny hanging herself from the top of the family mansion or damien practically having a seizure when nearing a church or the monkeys at the zoo going crazy after damien gives them a haunting look then theres the mysterious mrs baylock mia farrow the new nanny who allows a rottweiler from outside to stay at the foot of damiens bed the little boy doesnt mind he just waves at meanlooking dogs     an anxious priest father brennan pete postlethwaite contacts robert and tells him that damien is the antichrist he inists the boy must be killed otherwise katherine will be in mortal danger meanwhile a paparazzo david thewlis from damiens birthday reveals pictures with rays of light which purpotedly foreshadow how someones going to die its easy to see why the vatican is nervous about its cosmic findings of an approaching armaggedon      if youve seen the original omen the remake will not be as shocking or scary however its not a pointless movie like other critics have said sure the same scenes have been shot and the same plot written but theyre reinvisioned and still generate a fair share of rush and excitement      surprisingly director john moore maintains the same eery tone and patience that richard donner created in 1976 part of that reason must be that david seltzer who wrote the original also penned the remakethe filmmakers know what to keep moore builds tension and releases it slowly so that it actually amounts to something more than a mere crescendo of brooding music too many horror movies these days particularly remakes feel the need to skimp on thoughtful ideas and lay on the lurid moments so as not to bore the restless teenage crowd but the omen takes its time and becomes effective a particular scene that stands out takes place in a hospital where the camera exchanges shuddersome closeups between damien and his mothers body guard      which version should you see the original of course since that started the omen phenomenon and still holds up today but dont avoid the new one which is perhaps more lively by todays standards but probably not as longlasting its not a better movie to tell the same story but it works if the remake has one thing going for it more than the original its the look of the actor who plays damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick hes not asked to do much but what he does he does very well and if youre not freaked out by the smirk on his face then maybe you should check your head for a 666 birthmark
Jun 10 2006,positive,this is funny a must see haha

Jun 10 2006,positive,it was good not as scary as i thought it would be though but still made me jump
Jun 10 2006,positive,once again an overhyped movie that got trashed more than it deserved  yes i completely agree there was no need to remake this film the first one is excellent by itself and yes the date seems like a reasonable if stupid excuse but the fact remains that if you had never seen the original you would probably still find this film every bit as mysterious exciting thrilling and frightening as those who viewed the original so many years ago    in addition to that there have been some improvements mainly to the truly beautiful and well thought out art direction  aesthetically the film stays with you haunting your ideas with its palette and bla bla bla its pretty good    the score doesnt pack quite the punch as say ave satanis from the original but nonetheless it gets the job done    julia was both mildly disappointing in parts but also perfectly adequate in others liev as usual delivered well and pete postlethwaite also made a good showing sufficient and typical not unlike any given film appearance by morgan freeman    the omen b
Jun 10 2006,positive,i havnt seen this but i would like to 
Jun 10 2006,positive,much better than i anticipated altho i would say thers alot of crap in this film for starters would people stop going into graveyards at nite time why dont they just fink for a moment and if a dog jumps at u dont just let it bite ur arm split its legs and that will rip open its rib cage or as shaun rightly pointed out kick the fuck out of it its ok nothing to b overly proud of

Jun 9 2006,positive,it was ok it could have been better though  
Jun 9 2006,positive,i like the way they worked in the prophesy of revelations its rather slow in the beginning and theres a couple of token cheap shocks mia farrow was awesome as the nanny and at this stage julia stiles still looks too young to be a mother liev schreiber now i havent seen any of his movies before david thewlis  hey lupin
Jun 9 2006,neutral,ill give this movie props for having extremely awesome sound effects but other than that it was really really bad    at least thats what my mommy says and you should always listen to your mommy especially if she was there when the first omen came out     and stiles fit the roll as well as a doughnut in homer simpsons mouth but only because she died pretty darn awesomely i dont think i could have seen anyone else dying like that without thinking stupid bitch with her it was more of a haha you totally deserve it which im sure is what the director was going for
Jun 9 2006,positive,what to say about the omen it is the omen youve seen it before and if you havent watch the original first this is a well done remake it has the same feel and the same overall spirit     that said it felt like a remake there was no surprise no pop there was nothing but a storyline that had been done as well before it was good but there was nothing new in it the performances were solid the writing was goood casting was dead on but it is just a repeat    i dont know maybe i am saying that a remake wasnt really needed i cant hit it with a five because as a film it was good it just wasnt anything that is going to leave a lasting impression
Jun 9 2006,negative,not someyhing i would waste money on to watch

Jun 9 2006,positive,the way its filmed its not as exciting as the original where tension at some scenes can be felt in the original

Jun 9 2006,positive,centerfontgaramondsize6the omen 2006sizefontcenter     centerimg  centerihes one evil little shiticenter  center center    lefti havent seen the original ithe omeni so i cant really draw comparisons between the 1976 film and this updated remake that revealed itself to the world on 060606 left  left left    lefti also went into the movie with basically zero prior knowledge of the film i didnt bother to see the trailer i was never interested in any of the buzz it was generating upto its release one strong reason i went to see this film was because of the possibility of seeing ithe texas chainsaw massacre the beginningi trailer beforehand left  left left    leftso anyway i saw it and i really enjoyed it having no expectations turned out to be rewarding it was a fun little thriller with solid performances from the main players and a surprisingly ample amount of goreleft  left left    leftdid anyone else notice the striking similarities between this and the ifinal destinationi saga there were some great death scenes in ithe omeni many of which were so ifinal destinationiesque it was uncanny and the references to the photographs predicting fate hello ifd3i maybe thats one of the reasons why i dug this filmleft  left left    leftthe settings are also commendable director john moore utilised some great backdrops in london rome and other mysertious and exciting parts of the worldleft  left left    leftthe story moved along at a perfect pace at some points it got strongly religious but never teetered on the brink of ridiculous or overly confusing it catered to the mainstream cinematic audience which was nice one problem i did have however was the devil child himself damien he hardly ever spoke and seemingly just hung around in the background most of the time when in fact he was the most crucial part of the story we never really got into damiens disturbed head left  left left    leftoverall it was a neat little romp with great performances some thrilling moments a shocking ending and some kickass unexpected violence left  left left    leftbgotta love bone neckcrunching moment at the start of the film a certain evil decapitation when the bitch gets run over in the rain the spearing scene ok all of the death sequences were innovative and coolleft
Jun 9 2006,positive,i watch it it was scary but nice watch it okay i like it

Jun 9 2006,positive,really   interesting but not as scary as i thought it was going to be
Jun 9 2006,negative,so i saw the omen 2006 last night  lets just say that im glad my expectations for the remake of the best horror movie ever the original of course werent very high going into the viewing  every time i watch the original it finds some way to burrow itself into my inner pysche and leave me with a feeling of pure terror  however the remake was just that  a copy  except they forgot to make it scary  the plot is almost exactly the same down to every little detail but the acting and overall portrayal of the characters was nothing more than a cheap imitation  the only real positive aspects of the movie were the two or three dream sequences which ill admit made me jump a little  when it comes to classic movies film makers and actors should just let them remain what they are  classics
Jun 9 2006,positive,i love this movie i love it so much i fell a sleep during it
Jun 9 2006,positive,saw on 666 not scary at all alright plot line jumped at some scenes

Jun 9 2006,positive,why coudn t i see it the 6606
Jun 9 2006,positive,the prophecy is clear the signs unmistakable armageddon is upon us on 6  6  06 the omen is revealedand our darkest fears are realized the omen a contemporary thriller based on the 1976 classic film centers around a young boy named damien the son of an american diplomat and his wife damiens family is unaware he is destined to become the antichrist  until shattering events reveal the terrifying truth the omen will scare you and you will be jumping out of your seat even if you know a scare is about to creep up on you the suspense that builds up to it makes you scream like a little girl thats one thing thats very admirable in this film it provides us with some very frightening moments and very good scares leiv schreiber is superb as the role of the father in fact i can say he is better than gregory peck thats a rather bold statement but in this film leiv seems so natural and comfortable in the role julia stiles although too young for the part does what she can with the role and does a rather good job you can sense her fear as damien stares at her with the strangest of looks mia farrow does a good job as the new nanny why was she american though and is believablescary one thing that is a tad disappointing was the person that played damien although very scary at times some scenes it looked as though he was concentrating way too hard its not easy living up to the legendary actor that made everyone piss in their pants in 1976 but he does do a passable job just not a good enough one to make you cry all the way home one scene that sent chills down my spine was when he is making a pbj sandwich and giving his mother the scariest simplest look also the kills seem to be a bit more elaborate and well thought out which is very respectful im also glad to see that this remake is very true to the original with some tiny changes despite the meh performance from the new kid yes i dont know his name and im too lazy to look it up the omen is the scariest film thus far this year and you will leave the theater with a frightened smile on your face with real scares unlike many horror films these days see no evil is more of an extended fear factor episodewithout the fear the omen is a remake unlike any other     note this is my 66th entry ootalk about freaky
Jun 9 2006,positive,allmost the original not quite there tho
Jun 9 2006,positive,better that i thought it would be

Jun 9 2006,positive,it was a good movie but kinds wierd all at the same time
Jun 9 2006,negative,not even the least bit scary
Jun 9 2006,positive,the new bomenb is very much like the old omen only without the cool music the atmosphere was appropriately creepy and i enjoyed the color scheme but i thought that maybe this remake was just a little too faithful i know its a strange complaint its just that i knew exactly what was going to happen no surprises here nothing really fresh and damien while creepy didnt do much except have that same expression he wore in the preview liev schreiber the manchurian candidate and mia farrow purpose act their pants off but it just seemed kind of pointless in the end     as for bdevils pondb i dont know why i rented it i dont really like either tara reid land of caanan or kip pardue undiscovered but i just keep being drawn to the cover box the plot is simple tara and kip get married after only knowing each other for a few months they decide to take their honeymoon in a remote cabin in the middle of a lake only tara isnt very woodsy and cant swim then when its time to go back kip doesnt want to leave and traps tara there why i dont know i would have sent the whiny bitch back home but whatever neither of them act very well and you can see the plot twists a mile off but the scenery shots were beautiful so at least theres that
Jun 9 2006,neutral,i know postmodern movies are usually remaking something already done in the past but this time its a bit too clear its been done a million times and theres nothing new although i love the image and how they set up the storyboard
Jun 9 2006,neutral,fontlucida consolethe omen original85   the omen remake5      now the original version of this movie well deserves its classic status an interesting and fresh concept at the time executed in a very effective manner the acting in the original was fairly good it was well writen and it had a much creepier atmosphere to it in the remake however some of this greatness was lost in translation the new opening for the movie is completely unneeded and completely changes the storys progression the opening to the original was spot on so why change it the acting apart from the nanny who did a pretty decent job was awful it wasnt completely wooden and devoid of any emotion but it came close the writing remained pretty good and the dream sequences added to the creepyness of the film the death scenes remained great with a little added gore      size4spoiler         size2the change in the photographers death was pretty unnecissary as the originals was great but that said it was still really really cool            size4end spoiler      size2the new dameon also didnt look nearly as creepy as he should have but insead to me came off as kindof silly      underworld evolution5      i thought the first underworld was pretty cool so i decided to check this one out first off this is not a good movie that said it is very entertaining it had some pretty cool action in it and sizesizesizesizefontfontlucida consolekate beckinsale is absolutly gorgeous but thats all the movie really has going for it check it out if you want a shallow but fun movie to watch      the devils advocate10      wow this is one incredible movie excelent excelent story fantastic writing incredible acting all except for those damn southern accents i just loved every second of this movie check it out if youre ready to be blown away      vanity is definitely my favorite sin   font

Jun 9 2006,positive,i really want 2 c this movie as ive heard really good things about it
Jun 9 2006,positive,this remake is icy bore
Jun 9 2006,positive,excellent film scary as hell bt it was gooooood
Jun 9 2006,positive,if you were to rate this movie under horror then this may not be the best horror and terrified movie  this story tells a boy who is believed to be the demon son according to a book of his birth on the 06 06 06  the boy causes the death of his family one by one upon searching for the truth    the truth that robert brought backs the boy damian brings glory and fame but also bringing misfortune to his family he went to search for the truth and found out that his real son was actually murdered the day when he accepted damian now he has to choose to let damian destroy the world or bear the pain to kill damian his adopted son before everything was too late    the music did make the show scary however if compared with other horror show this has more stories and requires lots of solving and revealing of the truth i may categorize it as mysterious type    rate pg may not be suitable for children to watch  
Jun 9 2006,positive,hell ya this movie kicks assi still think old movies are better than remakes
Jun 9 2006,negative,a total pice of crap i only liked liev schreiber and i expected much more scary action and mistery
Jun 9 2006,positive,the original one was better
Jun 9 2006,neutral,an unnecessary remake that suffers from familiarity and bad acting the kid is as ugly as an elephants butt and looks like hed rather ride a tricycle liev schreiber looks like hes asleep julia stiles only seems decent because she is mostly juxtaposed with schreiber the only decent actor in this is david thewlis it doesnt help though that there are some corny bits of dialogue but at least it ensured i got a few unintentional laughs from them the production design and cinematography with a couple of exceptions are the best aspects of the film and if you get the dvd the features are far more interesting than the feature itself the three extended scenes impaling decapitation and finale are much better than that included in the film and lead me to question  why the heck were these exempt from the final cut a great pity considering the detail in the two former scenes particularly anyone who has seen the original will be bored by at least the half point im sorry to say that even the infamous big moments are not worth the time worse still is that there is a severe lack of payoff in the end forget about being scared by this film youll just be bored
Jun 9 2006,neutral,its just a lot of fun
Jun 9 2006,negative,this film is rele rubbish it has no point to it what so ever it takes agaies to build up to the storyline then bang it finished i wouldnt recommend it

Jun 9 2006,positive,exciting but not for weak hearts
Jun 9 2006,positive,it was arite kinda resemble final destination a bit but it was good

Jun 9 2006,positive,that guy is hot   
Jun 9 2006,negative,relies too much on loud shocks to scare it never gets under your skin people just laugh when they watch movies like this
Jun 9 2006,negative,the ending stuck in da air
Jun 8 2006,positive,this movie is horrible and i loved it its campy absurdist entertainment that flies far beyond over the top and doesnt apologize for a second of it having not seen the original since i was quite young it was pretty easy for me to watch without comparing the two and honestly i think i liked this one better anyways    i guess the loveaffair with this movie all starts with the death scenes theyre bad horrendous even they make you step back and say tell me that this isnt happening but it is happening and once you come to terms with it youll love the movie for what it is absurdist escapism and it is entertaining  undeniably so    stiles gets the top billing over schrieber though she mostly just phones it in its a fairly weak performance in a movie that it buoyed by otherwise excellent acting pete postlethwaite is a kookykrazy priest david thewlis who i absolutely adore in just about everything is a paranoid papparazzo whose life hangs in the balance and even michael gambon shows up as the man who knows how to set things right the guiding hand through all of it however is schreiber who is just excellent working under a fairly ridiculous premise he still manages to make his robert thorn 100 believable through it all hes a very talented guy who seems to fly mostly under the radar between this and a great turn in another remake  2004s manchurian candidate  heres hoping he starts showing up in more high profile projects he deserves it    so dont go in to this omen expecting to be scared and certainly dont expect anything great just demand to be entertained and the movie wont disappoint
Jun 8 2006,positive,it was alright special affects werent 2 bad but it was abit slow

Jun 8 2006,negative,the omen is a remake of a 1976 film by the same title  the original is on my list of creepiest movies to watch on halloween for a good reason it is creepy  now to the plot  a husband liev schreiber secretly adopts a son after he is told his child died in childbirth  he doesnt tell his wife julia stiles the kid is adopted and they raise the son as their own  around his fifth birthday some freaky stuff happens aka the nanny hanging scene from the trailer and more  it comes to the husbands attention by way of a seemingly loonytunes priest played awesomely by pete postlethwaite that his son could possibly be the antichrist  now a key to this story is that schreiber is an ambassador and the presidents godson so damiens path to hastening the apocolypse just got a little easier      now if i was forced to choose this or the original id pick the original  the acting in this newer edition is above par compared to most horror movies especially those out lately  as with the recent strain of exorcism movies this one tends to get a little more ridiculous than scary  when the kid gives his freaky glances we laugh  when people die because of silly final destinationesque events we laugh      in closing this movie was one with a ton of potential but it didnt separate itself far enough from the original there was a lack of atmosphere created and the shocker moments just didnt work    410    pace
Jun 8 2006,positive,omg it was great it was strange seeing the stiles chick in that rolebut definately enjoyed it

Jun 8 2006,negative,hadnt seen the original so i wasnt biased towards this youd think a movie with the antichrist would be scarier yes it had some nice effects but so what the kid was a little shit and not scary at all
Jun 8 2006,negative,its ok i guess but it needs more action
Jun 8 2006,positive,the original was better by far
Jun 8 2006,neutral,not that freaky as everyone makes it out to be julia stiles is a good actress but not really suited to the role of the mother i think storyline was great i really enjoyed the plot i still need to see the original

Jun 7 2006,positive,good movie but not really scary apparently the original is a amazing compared to the remake
Jun 7 2006,positive,i loved this remade version  it gave me many surprise and shocking   great i expect 2nd episode too
Jun 7 2006,negative,the omen is a completely pointless remake no doubt a film that is only slightly better than its trailer however the movie is very stylish and does provide a handful of scares however while they are shocking they are not focused on enough tension isnt built for long enough the film just seems to want to gain a quick jump from the audience and then switch to a boring scene as the film uses these quick scares the omen fails to deeply explore the creepiness of the films premise tension and genuine fear are not explored enough either the film uses cheap scares and doesnt provide enough genuine emotion the film is also very uneven it doesnt work well as a whole whenever the omen seems to rise above being an average horror flick it always feels the need to come right back down again damien is only made scary by the look on his face and this isnt that effective he doesnt actually do enough bad things to make him a fearful character there are some effective elements used camera shots and the precise focus on different objects smashing in scary scenes are effective also when julia styles sees the face in the mirror the completely white bathroom that swallows her makes the face alot scarier when you see it the acting is acceptable but nothing topdrawer overall this makes for an average time at the movies but the difference in quality between each scene means that sometimes you will be thinking its good but then other times it really loses track and becomes quite poor i havent seen the original but i would assume its better and suggest you watch that over this messy remake
Jun 7 2006,positive,it was ok some parts made me jump but you can decide for yourself cuz i dont want to give it away with my opinion of it
Jun 7 2006,positive,its good but it could have been altered a bit from the original to give it its own unique touch but overall it was good
Jun 7 2006,positive,i think it look really startery and funny
Jun 7 2006,positive,julia stiles doesnt do her best work in this movie

Jun 7 2006,positive,julia plays a great scaredy cat
Jun 7 2006,positive,quiet scary could be better more dramatic more blood
Jun 7 2006,negative,this remake of the 1976 original omen is a disgraceas any other remake that has come out to the movie theaters for starters the flaws that the first one had werent corrected and second the kid does not scare you as the original didthis one makes you laughhe continously makes a face if like he was about to fart bad
Jun 7 2006,positive,i thought this movie was gunna be a lot better cuz of how the previews showed it  it has some hilarious parts though

Jun 7 2006,positive,i hope that itis as good as the originonal
Jun 7 2006,positive,if youve never seen the original then this movie will feel fresh to you having seen the original some of the movie was predictable based on previous knowledge but was still able to maintain a level of fresh vitality uncommon in most movie remakes        the acting was decent with the lead male actor definitely outshining gregory peck in my mind as for the actors portraying damien i definitely felt the one in the current movie iteration to be more believable though his visual mood swings were to strong and erratic the mother part was good in both the original and current version though i definitely enjoyed the current one more i think as for the nanny she definitely was creepy though i think perhaps that has been a constant negative aspect of the original and the current movie iteration because it becomes an overly predictable part  the priest and photographer both did excellent renditions of their roles        the scary and gore factor in this movie were hit and miss i would say the scary factor was there for most of the audience and actually made me jump at one point which is rare as i havent done that in a movie in over oneandahalf years otherwise the scary side isnt palpable perse other than in the instantjump factor form  as for the gore some of the imagery was better than the original but the use of direct visuals was a little unecessary as it added nothing than a big e from the audience        i think the storyline overall was better developed than the original the character interactions poem remembering and dream sequences which were new all added to the ominous quality of the film there are still some points though where i feel that the directorwriter should have diverged somewhat from the original as the points were contrived and useless in both iterations of the film also some of the key scenes that were carried over to the remake were not correctly updated sort of a hitormiss approach again sadly        in the end the film was definitely good one i would recommend seeing just dont go into it expecting to be scared silly or walk away extatic at its presentation
Jun 7 2006,positive,incredible film the idea of it happening is made realistic by the film the scary parts where pretty frightening with some gruesome happenings similar to final destination  the ending allows for a sequel as well
Jun 7 2006,positive,it was a very good  remake of the older version i truly enjoyed it
Jun 7 2006,positive,my birthday is the 060606 freeky bt wow
Jun 7 2006,negative,the movie really wasnt what i thought it would be i thought we would be jumping out of our seats in fear never happened
Jun 7 2006,negative,it was as lame as i expected  the only thing that saves it is prof lupin david thewlis and prof dumledore michael gambon are in it

Jun 7 2006,negative,well yesterday was june 6 2006 it just so happened to be my nephews 17th birthday and we all went to watch the omen manohman what a waste of money good thing it was cheap tuesday for its opening     i kind of liked the idea that the movie opened shortly after the davinci code hmmm go figure
Jun 7 2006,positive,not as good as the original but still worth it to see in theaters
Jun 7 2006,positive,actual grade 666 out of 10  surprisingly decent horror movie  the original was better for one main reason the music it was horrible here and tremendous in the original  best jump ive ever had during a movie  i like liev schreiber  i sure hope my kids dont turn out looking like little seamus damien
Jun 7 2006,negative,i saw this last night for some reason poorly acted not at all scary and the cinemas auditorium was full of the most irritating people ive ever had the misfortune to come across
Jun 7 2006,positive,havent seen it but i know that its gunna be 1 of my fave movies
Jun 7 2006,positive,scary as hell
Jun 7 2006,negative,this film is trashits a dud of a film

Jun 7 2006,positive,jumpy bitsbut  its a complete remake
Jun 7 2006,positive,fucking rocked suspensful as all hell oh yeah i wanna see it again
Jun 7 2006,positive,im not a fan of the recent trend of remakes but the omen has surprisingly defied expectations in fact it may be better then the original the opening is well done with creepy comparisons to modern day and bible scriptures this and an extra death scene are the only real differences from the original  the problem is if youve seen the original this is just an updating of it with a bigger budget the cast isnt as good either but liev schrieber does pull off a convincing role and the child playing damien is decent when comparing to other child actors the final 15 minutes are intense and well directed you shud definately see it if you havnt seen the original
Jun 7 2006,negative,as to be expected john moores remake is rushed and forgettable the death scenes while graphic are badly paced and there is nothing significant enough here to warrant the remakes existance damian is more cute than anything else and much like in basic instinct 2 the best acting comes from the supporting david thewlis pete postlethwaite fits the redemption seeking priest well though stiles and schreibers onscreen chemistry is seriously lacking character
Jun 7 2006,positive,great to see such things in movies
Jun 6 2006,negative,it was completely campy and i loved it but for the stalwart horror movie goer its not really worth it although see it in a full theatre and make sure you bring someone who screams makes it even better
Jun 6 2006,positive,i havent seen it yet but i keep hearing a lot of good things about it i will see it tomorrow all night it was soldout 
Jun 6 2006,negative,very disapionted oh god it was painful to sit throughtear
Jun 6 2006,neutral,let me get this straight a young couples baby dies the hospital replaces it with a spare devilchild they have laying around satan helps out by sending them the nannyfromhell literally and he then inserts himself further into the situation by becoming the family hound he then spends his time licking himself burying his feces and angling for a chinscratchingessentially rendering satan less and less scary by the second  i still consider the omen a good story but this version is rolled thick with those twin cliches distorted twitchfaces and terror by audiospike consider this the scariest visual in cinematic history is those little girls in the shining yet all they do is stand around looking inbred that should tell you all you need to know about the failures of modern horror films dingy cinematography be biudamneduib rent the original instead  for more of this review including its comic companion piece please visit url
Jun 6 2006,negative,i came in the theater 20 minutes late and missednothing it was pretty stupid although i did think it was funny when they tried to make damien making a pbj sandwich into one of the scarier parts of the movie that was hilarious
Jun 6 2006,positive,looks lyke theres no logic ending
Jun 6 2006,positive,bimg     img     bthe original the omen is one of my favorite horror movies so i was excited yet a bit skeptical of the remake but when i saw the trailer i got my hopes up because i thought it looked promisingb     bi would classify modern remakes into two categories one type being similar to the remake of the texas chainsaw massacre which was really good because it kept the spirit of the original while adding its own flair to events the second category would be blatant ripoffs such as the psycho remake which was identical to the original the remake of the omen falls somewhere in between these two b     bwhat i didnt like was that a lot of the scenes were exactly the same even filmed in the same manneralmost too many were to make things a bit different all they did to the big scenes from the original was just change the means of the kill while keeping everything else virtually identicalb     bwhat i did like was that it had a few smaller quick scenes added in that gave the film a very creepy vibe and definitely had me jumping when i least expected it i also really liked mia farrow here b     boverall i would say itsbb good but not great the original is better and i definitely liked the kid better in the original maybe if the remake changed a little more around it would have really stood outb
Jun 6 2006,neutral,this was imho a big let down i had high hopes for this movie but it really did suck maybe if there were not a billion kids in there screaming and being stupid it may have been better
Jun 6 2006,positive,rather omenous theme
Jun 6 2006,positive,the quality of this film is irrevelant to me  reason being i had fun watching this movie more than any other theater experience in recent years  seeing it on 666 felt naughty and defiant and the theater full of people was really into it  some people really freaked out at parts in the movie which was fun i thouroughly enjoyed each actors part
Jun 6 2006,positive,creating armies on either shore  turning man against his brother  until man exists no more     so goes the prophesy of the antichrist     ithe omeni with the unofficial i666i added on to the title is nothing short of a remake of the original 1976 film with the same name      now that is not to say that it is done in poor taste far from it in fact it lives up to what i remember of it having not seen the original in about 34 years seamus daveyfitzpatrick while not seen in much of the film does a wonderful job in his role as damien a young antichrist he delivers with a chilling innocence that adds to the overall creepiness of the film liev shreiber and julia stiles both offer their acting skills as the father and mother respectively of damien and although many of the death sequences are taken straight from the original it doesnt mean that it is any less eerie to watch as you know that there is impending doom right around the corner and yet you can do nothing to stop it      kudos to the hounds of hell for their portrayal as damiens protector for which im sure they will receive little acclaim rolleyes      ah another thing this kid has the creepiest smile i have ever seen in a child so thank you john moore for giving my subconscious something to ponder on in the wee hours of the morning eek         all in all this is most certainly one of those movies that you should see on one of those dark stormy nights kind of like ithrilleri but not as scary because theres no michael jackson waiting for you and your children to get home so you can have a slumber party
Jun 6 2006,neutral,i have so many problems with this movie they are even not worth listing i know the truth behind 666it felt like i was watching this movie for 666 hours surrounded by 666 annoying hysterical people shouting and clapping when not on their cell phones while i was thinking of 666 ways to kill myself so i would not have to be there anymore admittedly i have seen worse
Jun 6 2006,positive,impressive another kickass 70s horror remake its been several years since ive seen the original got to rewatch it now
Jun 6 2006,positive,i luv the omen tht i just had to catch it on its first day of release it as scary fun n thrilling
Jun 6 2006,negative,for a movie about the son of satan this movie bored the hell out of mewhat a piece of craphalf a star for a entertaining beheading scene and a figure with a cool looking maskother than thatone helluva shitty movie
Jun 6 2006,neutral,a little boring and more shocking than scary got me hyped up for no reason it was okay
Jun 6 2006,positive,it was better than the original
Jun 6 2006,negative,ubthe prophecy is clear the signs are unmistakable on the 6th day of the 6th month in the year 2006 his day will comebu       ithe omeni was ominously disastrous but i was nonetheless so ready to give it a 610 rating to consummate the 666 propaganda until i saw the halfbaked ending
Jun 6 2006,positive,pretty close to the originalwhich might be why i liked it so much
Jun 6 2006,negative,img     bthe omenb  bdirected by bjohn moore  bstarsb liev schrieber julia styles mia farrow david thewlis pete postlethwaite michael gambon seamus daveyfitzpatrick  br  bdisturbing violent content graphic images and some language     inferior remake of the minor 1976 classic ithe omen istarring gregory peck and lee remick about an american diplomat who discovers that his son is the antichrist  made to coincide with the date 6606 as well as peak interest in end times prophecy the remake shoves in more hokey biblical interpretations the european union signals the birth of the antichrist that seem more tim lahaye than hollywood  it also feels rushedyou can almost feel director john moore struggling to cover all the bases that the original covered as quickly as possible  hurredly recreating all the key scenes from the original before hurrying off to something else       another pointless remake
Jun 6 2006,positive,hola how creepy this was
Jun 6 2006,positive,it was scary but well produced
Jun 6 2006,positive,i hope its better then the old one
Jun 6 2006,positive,omg this is such a freaky movie its soo scary but really good
Jun 6 2006,neutral,has nothing on the original
Jun 6 2006,negative,the omen is an awful excuse for a remake its not scary its terribly acted awfully written and decently directed the movie is about 1 hour and 45 minutes in which nothing really happens the films mopes along and gets boring very fast julia stiles is terrible as the mother newcomer seamus daveyfitzpatrick is dissapointingly bad as damienand is barely in the movie although mia farrow is quite good as the nanny its liev schreiber that gives the best performance as damians dad the film gets boring fast and never quite keeps your attention and suffers from a terrible ending     this movie should have been released around halloween instead of a summer even though it was marketed cleaver
Jun 6 2006,negative,not badwait till it comes out for dvd though
Jun 6 2006,positive,it looks like a good movie ive seen the original and it was good
Jun 6 2006,negative,looks to scary for me

Jun 6 2006,positive,amazing film i must say very creepy with some obvious parts in the storyline most worrying thing about the movie was that my friend bobby next to me kept laughing through out the film
Jun 6 2006,positive,not bad but not great
Jun 6 2006,positive,ithe omeni is yet another horror remake  thankfully it doesnt fall into the hapless lineup of redundant remakes that hollywood has been spewing out as of recent  the film is actually well directed the cinematography brings an amazing atmospheric tone to the picture creating eery and haunting visuals  the performances by the cast arent superb but theyre far from bad  they do a fine job of enriching the material that theyre presented with     the film makes for an enjoyable and creepy time at the movies  if youre looking for one i definately recommend ithe omeni
Jun 6 2006,neutral,i laughed so many times in places that werent supposed to be funny and wouldnt be surprised if i saw this playing as a midnight matinee with people chanting kill the kid as the father brings damien to the church  the only thing that saved the rating were the scaryashell moments
Jun 6 2006,negative,loooks bad but it may be good i have not seen it
Jun 6 2006,positive,this is going to be the best movie but i havent seen it lol

Jun 6 2006,neutral,not seen it but sounds good
Jun 6 2006,negative,fonttrebuchet msits rather depressing quite frankly to witness hollywood constantly remaking old hollywood movies sometimes movies that were never much good in the first place because they think theyve got no ideas of their own left and the oddest thing is that they still continue to do this even when audiences greet them rather tepidly since ithe omeni formerly titled ithe omen 666i before producers decided that was probably overkill has now made over 100 million from a budget of only about 25 million it seems highly unlikely that this trend will stop anytime soon     the original ithe omeni worked because it was along with irosemarys babyi and ithe exorcisti a major member of the group of horror movies that braced religion in their macabre plots it also worked because of its inspired casting classic hollywood star gregory peck trying to exorcise his sweet little son yes please try as liev schreiber might he just doesnt hold the immense gravitas and class that peck never i thought a particularly good actor did the failure of the film isnt his fault nor is it that of any of his costars the director the photography or pretty much any of the crew i suppose if you had to blame someone it would be the scriptwriter david seltzer who follows his original script almost exactly only updating things where theyd never have worked in the new time frame ithe omeni feels rushed feels hollow it feels above all unnecessary this was a movie which exists solely to take advantage of a gimmick release date june 6th 2006 666 hollywood has reached a stage where three numbers are more important than actually making a good film     it is where ithe omeni varies from the original that it becomes most interesting mainly because these lonely moments are new if youve seen the original film youll probably enjoy this new film more if you havent youll find yourself replaying it in your head seeing the events before they even happen the film opens with a bang though the boss of schreibers ambassador robert thorn meets an explosive end and there are scattered moments where the shocks do come off well notably in a modernized death scene for katherine thorn julia stiles but then there are moments like the laughably bizarre dreams from which robert suffers with his young son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick dressed in gothic masks and the film throws you right back out into your seat again moores direction is clumsy too often using angles and ideas which jerk the plot so badly that the audience cant help but laugh     his cast are pretty much left to do their own thing and to varying degrees of success schreiber so creepily and icily cold in 2004s ithe manchurian candidatei is lumbered with a stiff role never doing much more than serving as a link between scenes while character actors like postlethwaite gambon and farrow steal their scenes through a combination of hamminess and class stiles gets the chance to inject a little more emotion into her part perhaps a little too histronic when she looses damien in the park but she nails her death scene which deserves to be seen and not read the biggest problem lies with seamus daveyfitzpatrick hes by no means a bad young actor just bad in his approach the original damien came across as totally innocent and therefore more effectively creepy but daveyfitzpatrick seems more knowing more outwardly creepy and ultimately less effective the original worked so well because there was never anyone to incriminate peck slowly came to believe that he ihadi to do what he does but damien never seemed to actually know or understand what he was doing but moore lets us have a sliver of a thought that this new damien is working of his own accord     ithe omenis colour palette is as you might expect dark and rather gothic but its too often used in a pat way one particular scene where schreiber visits postlethwaite in the pouring rain beneath a bridge has the oppressing air of darkness about it despite the fact its actually midday but the darker colours arent used properly theres an overcurrent of glossiness as if cinematographer jonathan sela cant bare to saturate the scene entirely later on as the action transplants itself to italy as thorn and photographer keith jennings david thewlis investigate damiens birth sela becomes more confident in creating a darker atmosphere and is key in the films gradual progression into something more impactful     most intriguing however is its continual use of large airy spaces from the couples mansion home to a psychiatrists office contrasted with how dark and imposing they always are the aforementioned office is a minimalist bare space but the thin windows at the top of its circular shape cast angular shadows everywhere drawing out an unspoken creepiness in a scene otherwise forgettable especially as it enters its second half moore sela and production designer patrick lumb become more amibitious in their use of miseenscene working harder to create the oppressively tragic atmosphere they so desperately desire     but there is one important thing that hasnt been discussed the music the original film was famous for its blazenly religious choir score all the more so for its oscar nomination but its nowhere to be found this time around and all the worse for it jerry goldsmiths score almost lorded over the original film perfectly overscored the entrenched religious themes and placing emphasis on the deep tragedy of the plot marco beltramis score is perfectly servicable but it hasnt the memorability or impact     the ending of the film always struck me as magnificently pessimistic in 1976 despite all the changes going on in the world i imagine the idea of the antichrists spawn being adopted by the president of the usa would be terrifically frightening but today when the president has done probably more damage than the devil himself could do it just doesnt have the same impact the original iomeni lives in its own time frame when you watch it it iisi dated but its atmosphere is still deeply unsettling but this new iomeni is dated even before it leaves the cinema because as soon as it reached the 6 of the 6th 2006 its shelflife had gonefont
Jun 6 2006,positive,it better b as good as the original  
Jun 6 2006,positive,it looks a bit jynxed and im no way watching it when it comes out 6606666 hmm sounds familliar
Jun 6 2006,positive,it looks scary i love scary movies
Jun 6 2006,positive,a solid outting for the remake of the 1976 horror clasic the omen faithfully portrays the armageddon story with stylistic art direction suspenseful moods dashes of gore and wellpaced thrills its an entertaining and effective hollywood horror show and a classy revisiting with an unusually strong cast                                     centerimg                                    leftwhen predictions of the worlds impending doom begin to play out in the eyes of the vatican many begin to fear that the antichrist will soon begin his eventual reign of world terror yet to thorn an american diplomat and his wife katherine damien is just another child but as time goes on and strange occurrances seem to follow damien wherever he goes nanny commits suicide zoo monkeys and apes throw tantrums violent reactions to churches his mother isnt the only one who begins fantasize that damien may not be of this world                                    with strong performances to its credit the omen is a notch above your typical horror film liev schreiber and julia stiles are both effective in their leading performances and newcomer seamus daveyfitzpatrick though not as creepy as what could have been is not a bad damien at all even if he does spur some unintentional snickers from the audience he makes a creepy antichrist with his stature of innocence and disturbing reactions to particular events and with strong supporting performances from the likes of mia farrow the mysterious new nanny david thewlis the photographer who begins to put the puzzle together and cameos from pete postlethwaite and michael gambon theyre to ensure the film is never boring                                    for starters director john moore realizes that in creating an successful horror piece you must first and foremost establish a mood to reflect the films unsettling feeling of impending horror mold threedemensional characters who dont feel as if they were cut out of cardboard and most importantly have a story thats worth being told once the pieces of the puzzle are in place youre free to manipulate and terrorize your audience as much as youre willing and though the omen may be less heavy on actual thrills than psychological horror but the wellplaced scares and haunting images are genuine most of which prove to be jumpworthy                                    centerimg                                    leftaforementioned the omen is an extraordinary piece of visually stylistic direction making it one of the better made films of the genre to be released in some time and in this day and age it makes this remake even more impressive likewise it delivers equally impressive and dare i say artistically conceived death scenes each of which are profoundly brutal and bloody but also eerily memorable sorry folks no pg13 gore to be found here a welcome treat for fans of gore suspense and outright thrills the omen balances itself out quite nicely with this mixed bag of horror                perhaps an integral role for the success of the new remake is in the fact that david seltzer was hired to pen the script seltzer wrote the 1976 classic and remains religious no pun intended to his original creation albeit a few alterations are made to allow the film to have a more updated feel relating events such as the september 11 terrorist attacks the challenger explosion and the european union to predictions made in the book of revelation seltzer incorporates religious discussion without becoming preachy and keeps tension running high throughout                                    its no masterpiece but the omen does what it sets out to do youll jump youll squirm youll cheer youll forget the silliness of the story in the first place the gloomy atmosphere prevails in this shotbyshot remake as everything adds up to a quality film and a worthy horror film at that its slick and welltold and provides the necessary scares to make for a fun popcornmunching experience thatll leave you satisfied and hungry for more                  left                  center                  left                  center

Jun 6 2006,positive,good solid omen film but without the atmosphere and dark musical score of the original but still vgood
Jun 6 2006,negative,img     after thinking about this i had to change this from a 5 to a 2 it was i decided the worst movie that i saw in 2006 and just a very not scary at all huge let down a good yet serious horror movie is i think one of the hardest types of movie to make and they just didnt get it done with this one it seemed sort of mailed in and they could have done a lot better the sense of gloom was present but that is about as scary as it got i was startled once but that is a natural reaction it is not the same as being scared the acting of the father was i thought very wooden and he seemed almost uninterested it also is a little frustrating when watching a movie where the main characters have to catch up for most of the movie to what the viewer already knows i realize it was not a slasher horror movie but the pace was still slow for a good chunk of it i had not seen the original so the ending was the best part a very big let down
Jun 6 2006,positive,seen the old one and it was brilliant

Jun 5 2006,positive,o boi o boi what can i say it was sick it was basically an exact remake of the old one and since the old kidked ass this was good there were a cuple laughters in the audience this was due to the kid he was not convincable what so ever the endwas killed the end of the classic was my favourtie end to any movie and this one was weak
Jun 5 2006,positive,i like the poster   
Jun 5 2006,positive,its coming out tomorrow loved the original hope this ones just as good
Jun 5 2006,negative,i was a little disappointed i thought it would be a lot more scarier than it was and i didnt think it would be exactly the same as the old version
Jun 5 2006,positive,really good watched it 5 times its for you dameon lol
Jun 5 2006,positive,any comparison to the original does not factor into my review i let each film stand on its own if i judge based on previous like experiences i would never have another pizza as good as college days in chicago       julia stiles looks incredible moores use of sound and color make this film a visual heart stopper      my thanks to the producer who made this film possible
Jun 5 2006,positive,very good film that may be predictable but is still a good film topping the original
Jun 5 2006,positive,how could i not give this movie a 6  just kidding     ah it was ok  i guess since id already seen the original i knew what to expect already so it wasnt as surprising or entertaining  i think if i didnt know what was going to happen i might have given it a point higher  basically its the same as the original but a little slicker  its the story of a couple who wind up raising satans son and when he starts growing up they realize hes not normal  there arent any real scares in the plot its just sort of creepy so they tried to add a couple of scares by showing a freaky image accompanied by earripping soundeffects a device that i always think is cheap  i thought the little kid was going to be creepy because he has that creepy look in the trailer  but basically thats all he does in the whole movie is give that one look and i got a little tired of it by the end  there were a couple of death scenes that reminded me of final destination 2 so that was kind of neat i guess  overall it was somewhat entertaining  go see this if you like to watch adults run from squinting little boys
Jun 5 2006,positive,its a priyy sweet movie and they dont have meny movies like that
Jun 5 2006,positive,anyone who doesnt like this movie doesnt know how to enjoy the scare  this remake is a classy thrill ride  julia styles at her best

Jun 5 2006,positive,love this film it was smater than other remakes
Jun 5 2006,positive,really great flick embodying the original loved the last scene
Jun 5 2006,neutral,i really liked the original omen it didnt need to be remade there is nothing that modern filmmaking has brought to this film to make it stand out against the original the deaths are not as disturbing but should we judge this film on its own merits no because its a carbon copy remake there is very little new material worth mentioningthe only positive thing to say is that for anyone who hasnt seen the original its worth a look  on dvd but even then id recommend the original lol      plot outline a remake of the 1976 horror classic the omen 1976 an american official realizes that his young son may literally be the devil incarnate
Jun 5 2006,positive,absolutely fantastic damien is back and better than ever in this ambitious remake which on a rare occasion for remakes actually blows the original away a must must see
Jun 5 2006,negative,story line alittle better then  the first omen
Jun 5 2006,positive,i started to watch this movie with the anticipation that it would be good i was not dissapointed as it was really rather great it was not the best horror movie i have seen but it certainly is a lot better than recent horrors the movie has an even combination of a light peaceful atmosphere and a dark scary one which is pulled off rather well the little boy in the movie is quite distant which adds to the uncertainty of whats going to happen next with a few believable performances and a couple of jumpy moments this movie is a good watch for horror and thriller fans
Jun 5 2006,neutral,one of those moives that make you run to the plop box extra fast in the middle of the night
Jun 5 2006,positive,fuck yeah go u little son of satan

Jun 4 2006,positive,fontarialthe remake of the omen out 666 cute begins with an interesting scene comparing parts of the bible with acts happening today in the world tasteless to some with this in mind i was already very intrigued i have not seen the original omen with mr gregory peck but ive heard it was pretty good for its time however this also might be why i enjoyed this new remake more than several of the other critics in attendancefont  fontarialfont   fontarialread the rest of the review by clicking belowfont  url
Jun 4 2006,positive,ive only seen the old one and it was awsome
Jun 4 2006,negative,a big disappointment doesnt come close to the greatness of the origional and there are very few scares the scares that are present are the jump out at you kind i was so looking forward to seeing this too
Jun 4 2006,positive,i think im going to hell just for seeing it
Jun 4 2006,neutral,it might blownot seen yet but its the omen
Jun 4 2006,positive,weird freaky and freaky weird  the moral to this story never adopt kids coz theres a possibility that they might be devil spawn seriously peeps this movies has some very startling scences i almost hit the roof
Jun 4 2006,negative,fonttimes new roman font    centerfonttimes new romanmovie review the omenfont  center  centerfonttimes new roman font  center  fonttimes new roman            well 2006 has certainly been the year of horror movies at the box office  and although it is bound to have an impressive opening weekend the omen is the least deserving of the bunch  capitalizing on a release date of 6606 the movie wants to give off this notion that it is ultra dramatic and ultra scary  sad as it may be the movie fails in both of those aspects as well as many morefont    fonttimes new roman            the omen is a remake of the 1976 classic and it figures that thirty years later the new version would be another unneeded remake  the story centers on an american diplomat who realizes that the son he has raised damian may actually be the child of the devil  well the child starts causing chaos and starts to turn everyones lives upside down  the american official is played by liev schreiber who was pretty fitting in the role  ive always been a fan of his and he seems to play the roles with ease although his acting may be a little spotty in some of the more emotional scenesfont    fonttimes new roman            besides schreiber everyone else in the movie is a disappointment  julia stiles who plays damians mother may turn out her worst performance as an actress  she is utterly unbelievable as a mother period and her emotional register is more wooden than the crazy nanny replacement that cant think for her own self and is completely controlled by damian  font    fonttimes new romaneven damian seems to be lost is the mess that is this movie  normally children are scary in horror movies for example the ring but damian provides no terror  as hard as damian seamus davey fitzpatrick tries to be creepy it doesnt work  he just looks lost and confused as if unsure how he is supposed to make people freak out  the last actor worthy of mention is father brennan played by pete postlethwaite  okay here is a note for you pete you are not in jurassic park anymore  there are no dinosaurs in this movie so why are you still in character as roland tembofont    fonttimes new roman            the real reason that this movie fails is not in the acting but in everything that it lacks  and first if all that includes a plot  there isnt a hint of plot in the movie for over the first hour  the first hour just seems to be comprised of a random chain of events  and even when the basic plot is mentioned there really is no point  this especially goes for the ending because it can be seen clearly from a mile away  but to put it bluntly nothing happens in the movie  it starts off slow and stays that way throughout the entire movie  in fact there will be more yawns than screams or jumps i promisefont    fonttimes new roman            normally little subtle hints directors throw in add to a movie  but the over use of the color red is plain annoying  yes we understand that damian is the son of the devil but do we really need excessive red on every object  and even when it tries to have action by killing characters it ends up being really anticlimactic  the omen tries to be like final destination in these gory deaths  and even though i never thought id say this id much rather watch the action in that movie  the dramatic music does nothing for the film  it tries to heighten the intensity and it falls far short  in fact it barely made me able to keep my eyes openfont    fonttimes new roman            i honestly would not recommend this movie to anyone  i wouldnt even tell someone that i didnt like to see this movie  the complete lack of scares and utter boredom and pointlessness of the movie contains makes it the worst movie of 2006 up to this point  not just the worst horror movie but the worst movie of the year as of now and it should be pretty tough for the omen to relinquish this title in the upcoming months  in all honesty i would like that hour and forty five minutes of my life backfont
Jun 4 2006,positive,i really thpught it was a good movie but i was hoping for something a little bit better 
Jun 4 2006,positive,this was a good movie
Jun 4 2006,negative,this movie was garbage  starts out so 1337 next thing you know its a stupid thriller with stupid plot lines    not even scary half the movie i was laughing
Jun 4 2006,positive,fucking awesome   good storyline original out beats it tho
Jun 4 2006,positive,most movies of this genre arent too scary maybe this will cahnge my mindset
Jun 4 2006,positive,that movie will freaky be good hell vs heaven
Jun 4 2006,negative,i hated this movie
Jun 4 2006,negative,hmmm dont know never seen or heard of it

Jun 4 2006,positive,keeps true to the original story which is rare with remakes but was entertaining and welldone a very creepy movie
Jun 4 2006,neutral,it is very intersting
Jun 4 2006,negative,i dont really like these movies cause they hurt mt brain lol no i mean to much going on  cant really follow it i like movies where i just laugh and i dont have to feel like im taking a test  
Jun 4 2006,negative,booooring  what crap  i dont know what else to tell you julia stiles sucked that boy sucked the dogs looked fake everything was bad  save your money and wait for it to come out on regular cable  haha
Jun 4 2006,positive,looks awsome and im interested in all this heaven hell god  devil thing so this movie interests me alot and i cant wait to see it
Jun 4 2006,positive,very close to the 1976 classic i find that this damien is a bit more creepier than the 76  damien played by harvey stephens who also plays one of the tabliod photographers in this version plus mia farrow does a great job of playing the crazy weird nanny
Jun 4 2006,positive,awesome kill scenes and it built to a possible sequel
Jun 4 2006,positive,i really want to know whats happening on the 6 of june 2006 so excited
Jun 4 2006,positive,looks scary but awesome
Jun 4 2006,positive,the original the omen was one of the best scary movies of its time this one was just like it awesomeness
Jun 4 2006,neutral,if youve seen the original dont bother  this is nearly an exact duplicate and youll be bored to death without all of the suspense because you know what to expect and when  if this is all new to you by all means check it out and have a good time  in fact id go out on a limb and say its almost better than the original in that respect and i would rate it at 4 stars  however i hate movies that try to scare you with jump out at you moments instead of being genuinely creepy  decent acting among the costars also lends a bit of credit to this preposterous remake  julia stiles breaks out of her teenage typecast and thrust into her first adult leading role and she comes through well oh and the cool art direction is done very spiffily my word as well  notice how stiles outfits seem to match her surroundings at all time  coincidence  i think not
Jun 4 2006,positive,seen only bits of the old one
Jun 4 2006,positive,i really want to see this movie
Jun 4 2006,negative,the original is always better and i hate julia stiles
Jun 4 2006,positive,propa scary thus 1 is not 4 da faint hearted  
Jun 4 2006,positive,damien is cute and does this adorable eye thing but yeah hes evil and the son of the devil i was scared silly at certain parts
Jun 4 2006,positive,it looks bad as hell lol
Jun 4 2006,positive,the story is pretty confusing you really have to be paying attention its pretty good and sticks to the original
Jun 4 2006,neutral,i think it was wicked
Jun 4 2006,negative,sucked with a capital s the best part was the priest and the photographer i like those actors
Jun 4 2006,positive,i heard its gonna be scary i wanna see it so bad
Jun 4 2006,positive,i think its gonna b good  
Jun 4 2006,positive,enjoyable enough remake that is mostly redundant liev schreiber and pete postlethwaite are the stronger points of this movie with their acting surpassing the roles of the original some of the scenes lack the atmosphere of the original but the new moments add tension and fear well however it suffers even more than the original by the nonscary child actor who provokes laughter more than fear
Jun 4 2006,positive,crazy scary and awesome
Jun 4 2006,positive,what can i say im not a horror movie fan but julia stiles is a goddess so i saw it on opening night 666 omigaw to play into the whole antichrist gimmick the theater was crowded with a fun group of college kids and high schoolers and we all made fun of the movie together in unison it was beautiful 3
Jun 4 2006,positive,its sounds realli gd
Jun 4 2006,negative,i liike the first one better
Jun 4 2006,positive,i want to see this movie

Jun 4 2006,positive,looks kool to me and sounds like a prety good story line
Jun 4 2006,positive,amazing if you actually believe in demon rituals and what not amazing
Jun 4 2006,positive,it doesnt look to to scary but just a little scary
Jun 4 2006,positive,looks like id piss my self  ina bad way 
Jun 4 2006,negative,it dosent really sound like my sort of film so really i wouldnt recommend it
Jun 4 2006,positive,a somewhat creepy but painfully cold remake  its almost completely humorless and not convincing in the least but the number one reason to see it must be mia farrows devilishly charming performance which leaves no set unchewed and the number two must be that it features one of the best onscreen decapitations ive ever seen what else its also terribly edited in an attempt to make it seem scary by being mindfuckingly jarring and also its kinda you know boring
Jun 4 2006,positive,this isnt one of those really scary movies its more of a thrilller than it is horror
Jun 4 2006,positive,i lyke da classic 1 beta
Jun 4 2006,positive,just recently seen this film thought it was awesome just like the origional but better graphics
Jun 4 2006,positive,had a lot of fun watching that movie  has a lot of gr8 scary moments d
Jun 4 2006,positive,scariest f movie ever you really come to hate the little terd that is damien in the end makes you wanna hurt the actor 
Jun 4 2006,positive,this is a really scary movie
Jun 4 2006,positive,pretty good more freaky than scary a few cringey bits that made me grit my teeth but not too gruesome and not too scary a bit different from the original me thinks not as good as either exorcism of emily rose or the two new excorcist prequels dominion and exorcist the beginning
Jun 4 2006,negative,almost an exact remake only with a less scary kid very blah with the same anticlimatic ending the only good part was the father kicking nanny ass probably better to just watch the remastered old version
Jun 4 2006,neutral,i really liked the original omen it didnt need to be remade there is nothing that modern filmmaking has brought to this film to make it stand out against the original its not as scary not as honest or raw the original film is genuinely disturbing  from the dogs to the nanny to damien this modern remake just isnt as convincing it has its moments and isnt that terrible but theres an annoying distance or separation between the subject matter and the film its too clean too polished it just isnt evil enough   i cant help labelling it one of those remakes that was pointless like psycho pulse the grudge etc etc though you have to give them a thumbs up for the casting of mia farrow she was pretty well suited ofr her role
Jun 4 2006,neutral,they said its heavily censored here   but i watched it in msia
Jun 4 2006,positive,a lot of story development which i was not expecting
Jun 4 2006,positive,people of the worldget to know the lord thy god as your saviour please dont take this as just a movie know that evil is really out there and the devil is out to destroy us that dont know the lord    i think this was cool scary had me jumping alot
Jun 4 2006,positive,as good as if not better than the original a classic horror flick brought up into present time but nothing was changed everything in the remake was in the originalwith additionswhich didnt detract from the story but enhanced it really really really good movie
Jun 4 2006,neutral,gets too finaldestinationish aka not scary very quickly
Jun 4 2006,negative,movie sucked you could see the boom mike throughout the whole movie people were laughing at how stupid it was and if they were serious bad mvoie
Jun 3 2006,positive,i wana watch the remake version
Jun 3 2006,positive,waaaaa im so scaried i was kind of shocked when my friend asked me to watch it i didnt see the first omen but what i see in this movie is completely freakin me out the movie doesnt good at all but i was kind of scared when damien operate his mission i just thought he is a cute little boy but the nanny is totally crazy i dont like the ending when they tell that damien still alive why devil must win besides the story wasnt good at all i was totally confused with the story but some people said this remake is more scary than the original have and i think maybe the answer is yes
Jun 2 2006,positive,ok remake like some of the updating on it but it still not better than the original
Jun 2 2006,positive,i really enjoyed this remake
Jun 1 2006,neutral,remakes and sequels are as inevitable as the end times are to certain millennial sects combine the two ideas and the result is the remake of ithe omeni the 1976 supernatural horror film that became a box office hit and at least to some a genre classic ironically the original was thrown together to cashin on ithe exorcistsi commercial success several years earlier it worked offering premillennial angst suspense and scares in equal doses plus a zeitgeistinfluenced downer ending gregory peck and lee remick in the lead roles also added an aura of respectability to otherwise blevel material but why a remake and why now profit motive of course explains a great deal but so does the 6606 release date    the remake departs from the original in a few mostly superficial ways instead of being the us ambassador to great britain the more youthful robert thorn liev schreiber in the remake is a deputy ambassador to italy roberts superior is moved from italy to england but before long thorn finds himself taking on the role of full ambassador for his young wife katherine julia stiles the move and promotion portend a bright happier future likewise for their fiveyear old son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick on the surface damien looks like any other fiveyear old born into privilege and wealth well fed cherubic and well adjusted     damien of course is none other than the antichrist here to set armageddon in motion at childbirth damien was switched with richards dead son richard knew about the switch but didnt tell katherine five years later damien begins to exhibit odd antisocial behavior damien acquires fiercely protective dogs as well as a doting governess mrs baylock mia farrow almost immediately after the very public demise of the first nanny katherines affections for damien begin to deteriorate doubts about damiens identity begin to surface and relationships begin to fray    father brennan pete postlethwaite an apostate priest approaches thorn warning him of impending doom a freelance photographer keith jennings david thewlis discovers wispy ethereal objects on several photographs hes taken of father brennan and the first nanny finally aware of damiens true identity thorn is forced to act cue an urgent trip to the middle east and a quick visit to carl bugenhagen michael gambon an archeologist working on a dig bugenhagen is in possession of much needed worldsaving information and an object or two    ithe omeni may not be a shotforshot remake but its close all the major scenes turning points and set pieces are lifted straight from the original with only cosmetic changes the original screenwriter david seltzer irevelationsi iprophecyi again receives solo credit for scripting ithe omeni but he had little if anything to do with the remake director john moore iflight of the phoenixi ibehind enemy linesi adds the occasional visual flourish and jump scare flash or subliminal cuts unlikely to scare the average moviegoer let alone jaded horror fans absent from the original in a misguided attempt to add seriousness where none is required moore slips in archival disaster footage during the precredit sequence moore later includes overemphatic music cues meant to increase tension or fear they dont     performance wise liev schreiber limits himself to the occasional furrowed brow and teary eyes julia stiles is sadly miscast for a role more appropriate for an older more experienced actress whenever stiles wears a highend suit or dress she looks like a teenager playacting at being an adult as for the supporting cast david thewlis seems to be the only grounded noteperfect performer in the entire cast mia farrow was probably added to the cast for her connection to another horror classic involving the devils progeny irosemarys babyi she adds nothing of note here pete postlethwaite and michael gambon overact every chance they get several for postlethwaite one for gambon on the plus side they do look like theyre having a great time chewing scenery as for seamus daveyfitzpatrick as damien lets be kind and just say he was badly miscast either that or moore cant direct children    effects and set piece wise we get exactly what weve come to expect memorably violent and gory scenes lifted unchanged from the original including the nannyatthebirthdayparty scene a wayward priest seeking redemption and safety during a rainstorm in a church hes barred from entry the second maleleads untimely end foreshadowed via a white ethereal light in a photograph a fall from a staircase including impact plus one or two other sudden deaths unlike the original which relied on practical effects and predigital opticals the remake relies on cgi to augment key scenes and sequences which only dilute whatever emotional visceral effect moore intended to give individual set pieces    as for a sequel or sequels the 1976 original spawned two progressively inferior sequels lets hope not but if the remake succeeds at the box office a tricky proposition since the only rationale for releasing a horror film offcycle seems to be the 6606 release date expect to see damien turning meaner and deadlier as he comes into his own if that happens hopefully the producers will scrap remaking idamien omen iii damiens angstridden teenage years and ithe omen final conflicti damien busy making armageddon happen but never getting there and go with fresh or fresher ideas thats probably too much to ask for though
Jun 1 2006,positive,badass movie this one will surely creep under your couch and kill you
May 31 2006,positive,well i watched it on the big screen last night and i was not really impressed as i was with the original  i think it was the kid he just didnt give me the willies or do anything to make you believe he was evil  i just wanted to take him home with me more cute then ruthless
May 31 2006,positive,it was okaythe original was better
May 31 2006,positive,for a remake of a classic horror movie its no dawn of the dead but its a hell of a lot better than the psycho remake
May 31 2006,neutral,this movie couldve been better it was nothing like i thought it would be after seeing the previews and all i saw it opening day and there were only a few good parts that werent shown on the previews
May 30 2006,neutral,the movie is ok but since i havent seen the original i cant really judge it that well but besides that the kid is freaky as hell in all the movie moves too slow
May 30 2006,positive,first that little kid damian is creppy looking as far as remakes go it was pretty good not as scary as i thought it would beand i still prefer the original better
May 30 2006,positive,im sure this movie will be good its scene for scene the origional was great and this is basically a newer version of the exact origional so it will be good
May 30 2006,positive,an exiting movie but a bit dragy at some parts
May 29 2006,neutral,it wasnt the best movie but it was okay
May 29 2006,positive,never saw the original but this was pretty good
May 28 2006,positive,this movie was amazinggg i loved it me and kelsey went and saw it and it was soo scaryy but the only thing i didnt like about it was that the deats look soooo fake
May 28 2006,positive,we are very concerned for the wrong reasons if your questioning in the age of remakes in which we live how can one make a good remake of a bad film the answer is the omen it is a horror with fair performances from an surprisingly varied cast fascinating story and an scary visuals creating a creepy mood and atmosphere more than can be said of the original better than the 1976 version but still not a great film horror or otherwise the chill factor remains medium with the exception of the frightfully scary mrs bradock played by the actress of horror mia farrow
May 28 2006,positive,lol the first film ive ever actually screamed at
May 27 2006,positive,this will prolly scare me to death but i dun care

May 26 2006,neutral,yeah it wasnt bad nor very good either i guess i was psyched to see it on the 6606 date it was still interesting but the girlfriend wasnt terrified much which means as a thrillersuper natural it really didnt do its job
May 26 2006,neutral,this is definitely shockingmost of the time i got thunderstrikes hate the ending
May 26 2006,positive,bryan singer has abandoned the x men to tackle superman instead so brett ratner stepped in and took the helm  ironically rattner was once up for superman so its funny that he and singer have traded films in a manner of speaking     i liked x3 a lot it had loads of action a good solid storyline with all your favorite x men back and the plot packed  some surprising events the basic story premise is that the government has found a way to eliminate in other words  cure the mutant x gene although humans and mutants have learned to coexist this newly propagated cure is  reason for magneto ian mckellen to mount an offensive and wage a war on humans in a fury the world has never seen  i dont want to give anything away just yet but spoilerits amazing just how many x men die in this film or turn into  normal humans i mean honestly no mystique and magneto though he may be back as the end revealsspoiler      production quality vfx sound and editing are all first rate ive really enjoyed x3 for what it is a great summer popcorn flick        the other day i attended a press screening for the omen due out 6606 in terms of plot this new omen is a very faithul  reiteration of the 1976 version by richard donner needless to say the cinematography and the editing and sound mix  are up to a contemporary level and make it thus more watchable in todays rather fast paced cinematic world     the story revolves around us embassador robert thorn liev schreiberwhose son dies during childbirth unbeknownst  to his wife he adopts another newborn in his stead and raises it has his own strange accidents and suicides occur when  someone appears to compromise damiens wellbeing a priest pete postlethwaite warns thorn that his child  is of evil reluctanlty thorn sets out with with the photographer keith jennings david thewlis to solve the mystery     img     img     img     img

May 19 2006,positive,surprisingly good remake thats more than just a brilliant marketing ploy    solidly acted with wellstaged suspense scenes and one of the greatest decapitations in recent memory
May 19 2006,positive,the remake is pretty much exactly the same thing as the first one but its a more modern if you havent seen the first one yet go see it if u did well go see the difference
May 19 2006,neutral,the remake doesnt do anything that the original didnt already do  poor theology despairing undertones underdeveloped characters by actors who normally do better work  if this is where horror is going then we can all expect to be sleeping half an hour into the show from now on

May 13 2006,neutral,this is less a remake and more a release the two films are almost identicle except for the occasional scare shot in the newer version however the only reason that these scare shots have been added is to replace the natural haunting abiance that the original succeeded in achieving but the this version can not all in all it is a good film but i am just not sure of why it was neccessary to remake an already excellent film with updated casting but no updated effects
