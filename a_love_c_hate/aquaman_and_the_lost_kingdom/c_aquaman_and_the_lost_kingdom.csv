"Apr 10, 2024",negative," It's the end of the year and everyone is exhausted and ready for rest — except for the kids, who are hyped up on candy cane sugar and the prospect of the long days of summer stretching out before them.  Fear not! There are a host of kid-friendly films coming out, which you can plonk the kids in front of while you sit in silence, and which you might actually enjoy yourself.  A grab bag of storytelling tropes, generic characters and musical styles from the well-thumbed Disney playbook, Wish unfolds in a one-size-fits-all fairytale land ruled by the sorcerer king Magnifico (a comedically underutilised Chris Pine).  Magnifico's benevolent dream of nurturing and granting the wishes of his constituency has curdled into selfish tyranny: He's keeping all the wishes in the kingdom's mystical vault, to be handed out whenever he deems one of his citizens worthwhile.  But when plucky teenager Asha (Ariana DeBose, doing the thing) wishes upon a star — which looks like a Miyazaki sprite reconfigured as a corporate emoji — she sets in motion a challenge to the sorcerer's supremacy, championing a humanist utopia where the dreams are reclaimed for the people. No points for guessing that this analogy for the dangers of monopolising dreams is drenched in irony, coming from the corporation with a stranglehold on the childhood fantasies of generations.That's just business as usual for the Mouse House (""When it comes to the universe, we're all shareholders,"" is an actual lyric in one of the new songs here). Set that aside and there are sprinklings of the old Disney magic to be found — including an amusing chorus of chickens, a talking goat who might have sprung from Pinocchio's Pleasure Island and a forest full of animals that even features a cameo from Bambi. The showtunes — primarily penned by singer Julia Michaels and songwriter Benjamin Rice — are a little forgettable, though on occasion (This Wish; I'm a Star) they generate sparks. (Plus, it's hard to resist when the refrain from When You Wish Upon A Star is threaded into parts of the score.) Wish isn't about to challenge Frozen for kids' repeat-viewing supremacy, but you could do worse for a pre-teen movie diversion this summer holidays. The impulse to account for how some fictional freak (complimentary) got to be the way they are — especially tempting when wading into that most cash-grabby of genres, the origin story — is one usually best avoided. As with a magic trick, to 'explain' this is to reduce a character to less than the sum of their parts – to sub out a tantalising mystery for a game of connect the dots. It's rather a relief to be introduced to a young Wonka who, as incarnated by Timothée Chalamet, is already a fully formed chocolate wizard (slash magician slash inventor). He's just arrived in a new city after seven years at sea, ready to launch his confectionary career — even if the money-grubbing members of the local ""chocolate cartel"" (Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton) are less than welcoming. Deep Roy played 165 Oompa Loompas (including an entire glam rock band) in Tim Burton's 2005 film adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Will Hugh Grant in 2023's Wonka ever measure up? Director Paul King (Paddington, Paddington 2) applies a fairly light touch when it comes to psychoanalysing his protagonist's obsession – unlike Tim Burton's 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with its flashback to Willy's childhood under the thumb of a sugar-hating dentist.  King preserves and, in fact, amplifies Wonka's magic. What does gets muted in the translation, however, is the unnerving weirdness of Roald Dahl's character – his darkness, his off-putting humour. The misadventures of the bratty Golden Ticket winners in the Wonka factory, as recounted in Dahl's 1964 book, reveal a candy man with a truly warped sense of ""just desserts"". Chalamet's Wonka, meanwhile, is willing to abandon his calling for the sake of new pal Noodle (Calah Lane).  The Dune star gamely gives Willy his all, and proves endearing in the role, convincing even, but he hasn't got a madcap bone in his body. He looks like he belongs in a pre-Raphaelite painting, not a zany sweet shop. If the film isn't quite up to the preternaturally scrumdiddlyumptious standard of its namesake, then it would certainly still pass muster at any of Wonka's rival chocolate companies. It's ducks amuck in this animated adventure from family-friendly hitmakers Illumination Studios (Minions; Sing; The Super Mario Bros. Movie), as a flock of New England mallards find their feathers ruffled on an unexpected trip to the frightening big pond of New York City. Convinced by his wife (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) and ducklings (Caspar Jennings and Tresi Gazal) to take a break from the winter doldrums, a beleaguered drake (Kumail Nanjiani) gathers up the family — and a tagalong deadbeat uncle (Danny DeVito) — and heads south for the warmer climes of Jamaica.  Best laid eggs soon go awry when a cloud of fog sends them off course and tumbling into Manhattan — where the mallard-justed skein run a-fowl of a deranged but resourceful pigeon (Awkwafina, channelling Natasha Lyonne), and fall into the clutches of a dastardly restaurant with Duck à l'Orange on the menu. Much like their Minions and Sing series, Illumination's latest feature is bright and bouncy and largely pitched to audiences who've only recently learned to waddle, with plenty of sight gags that will quack up undemanding audiences.  Screenwriter Mike White (The White Lotus) lands a few serviceable jokes amid the standard-issue story beats, while French director Benjamin Renner (who was Oscar-nominated for 2012's Ernest & Celestine), garnishes the farce with the occasional visual grace note (there's a shot of the ducks cruising across the New York skyline that really is quite poetic).  Keegan-Michael Key, meanwhile, does an amusingly over-the-top accent as a caged Jamaican parrot who longs for his tropical homeland, and — proving it's been a banner year for heron representation — the legendary Carol Kane lends her voice to a trickster bird that gives Robert Pattinson a run for his squawking money. Despite being a sequel to the biggest hit in DC's Extended Universe, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom arrives as the ignominious end of the line for Warner Bros' troubled superhero franchise, with new bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran having officially announced the end for Jason Momoa's underwater beefcake. Having ascended to the throne of Atlantis, Aquaman (Momoa) is dividing his time between regal duties and raising his new baby with Queen Mera (a barely present Amber Heard, not exactly dispelling those wild behind-the-scenes rumours.) That is until David Kane (Candyman's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) — hell-bent on avenging the death of his father in the first movie — happens upon an ancient, all-powerful trident and summons the dark magic of a fabled lost kingdom to wreak havoc upon Atlantis. To protect his people, Aquaman must team up on a quest with his exiled brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), make a whole bunch of lazily written wisecracks and pound a few six-packs of Guinness with his dad (Temuera Morrison). (Let's just try and ignore the fact that they're drinking them straight outta the can.) There's also a plot about global warming and an impending climate catastrophe, which has something to do with the villain burning chunks of a mythical substance called Orichalcum (stop sniggering, it's a thing). In theory, any movie teeming with fantastical ocean creatures, neon-streaked underwater metropolises and Nicole Kidman riding a freakin' cybernetic shark should be a no-brainer blast of escapism. The film borrows liberally from The Lord of the Rings, Jules Verne, Avatar and Star Wars (Martin Short voices a Jabba the Hutt-like gangster fish, bless), among others, yet can't summon much in the way of its own personality.

"Mar 17, 2024",negative," 
Oh, how the mighty have fallen. It’s no secret that superhero movies are on the decline in popularity – just look at the highest-grossing movies of 2023 compared to the past quarter century of box-office statistics. Hollywood studios are panicking, they are losing their guaranteed paycheck and scrambling to find other IPsant that will make up for the gaping hole in their pockets.
 
That is why Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will likely be the last time we will see Jason Momoa’s rendition of Arthur Curry, the half-human lord of Atlantis. When James Wan first dipped his toe into the world of blockbuster superheroes after building a horror empire for Warner Bros. with The Conjuring universe, he seemed like the necessary key to getting the DC universe up off the ground. Wan’s Aquaman is a delight, a nonsensical, hilarious adventure that fed life into the tired superhero formula. So, what went wrong with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom?
 
Where Aquaman felt original, Lost Kingdom is stale, void of all originality. From painful product placement, to the sets of underwater city Necrus that look like they were ripped straight from the architectural plans for Minas Morgul in The Lord of the Rings, the shift in creativity with Wan’s sequel is a constant disappointment. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom lacks imagination and delight, which is what made the first film a blast. The sharp wackiness has been sucked dry, left in the middle of the desert to perish like King Orm (Wan regular Wilson), the Ocean Master that was Promised. There are brief echoes of the first film’s zany antics, mostly after Orm is brought back for some necessary brotherly bonding with Aquaman as they try to derail the plans of the villainous Black Manta (Abdul-Mateen II), but the film zooms by so fast that they’re both literally sprinting to keep up with the plot.
 
The one nice thing that can be said about Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is that out of all of the superhero blockbusters, Wan is perhaps the only director to make the action sequences look unique and good. Wan has banked a living off of playful, engaging cinematography that really sucks the viewer into the film’s world, and he works his magic in Lost Kingdom still. If only it has the script to back it up, to build a film that’s as majestic and animated as the first, but it’s a film that feels dumped. The last hoorah of Synder’s messy DC Extended Universe – one that could have been a thrilling goodbye and a reminder that not all of it was bland – will likely sink to the bottom of the ocean, a forgotten relic of an era. Momoa’s Aquaman deserved a lot more.

"Mar 16, 2024",negative," ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY (1941). It’s rather remarkable, and rather absurd, that Bernard Herrmann, despite writing so many magnificent film scores throughout his career — Psycho, North By Northwest, Taxi Driver, Cape Fear, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad represent but a mere sampling — only won a single, solitary Academy Award during his lifetime. And it wasn’t even for one of his contributions to enduring classics (alas, he only received a wimpy five nominations over 35 years, none for his many Hitchcock collaborations) but rather for a movie that’s not referenced much these days. That’s not a knock against All That Money Can Buy and certainly not a knock against his score — indeed, it’s a delightful piece of work, and it remains the biggest claim to fame of this expansion of Stephen Vincent Benet’s short story “The Devil and Daniel Webster” (also the film’s alternate title over the years). The morality tale finds the famed politician Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold) taking on “Mr. Scratch” (Walter Huston) to save the soul of a simple farmer (James Craig). Craig’s performance is ofttimes downright terrible, but old pros Arnold and Huston pick up the pace, and the movie also offers a chance to catch sensuous French actress Simone Simon (as a wicked temptress) a year before she headlined the classic Cat People. Huston earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his twinkly turn as a mischievous, glad-handing devil, and, in addition to his victory for this film, Herrmann received a second Best Scoring of a Dramatic Picture nomination that year, for something called Citizen Kane. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by film scholar Bruce Eder and Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith; a reading of Benet’s story by Alec Baldwin; and a restoration demonstration. AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM (2023). The 15th and final film in the DCEU, which is mercifully being put out of its misery to make room for the new-and-improved(?) DCU, this opens with one character getting blasted in the face by a stream of baby urine and ends with another cheerfully munching on a live cockroach. I can’t recall every scene from all 33 MCU flicks, but did, say, Captain America or Doctor Strange ever have to suffer such indignities? Then again, that’s par for the course when it comes to a movie as silly, simplistic, and sophomoric as this one. The regurgitated plot finds Arthur Curry / Aquaman (Jason Momoa) again having to contend with the vengeance-driven Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), this time turning to his estranged half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) for aid. Aquaman sported a pair of dull villains in Black Manta and Orm (aka Ocean Master); the sibling shift at least allows Orm to banter with Arthur — it’s a development that perks up Wilson, who was atypically monotonous in the first film — but Black Manta remains as broodily boring as before. As Aqua-Arthur, Momoa doubtless spent hours studying Chris Hemsworth’s Thor as if he were cramming for an exam — like its predecessor, this plagiarizes Thor: Ragnarok’s nyuk-nyuk humor, but the gags again land with the force of a dropped anvil. Nicole Kidman returns as Arthur’s mommy Atlanna, and her check must not have been sizable enough because she can barely disguise her contempt for this material (or perhaps for the genre itself). The visual effects are a slight improvement over the ones from the 2018 Aquaman, but no amount of CGI can conceal a plotline as banal as the one employed here. THE COLOR PURPLE (2023). For those needing a refresher course, this new version of The Color Purple is not based on the 1985 movie, despite that picture’s director (Steven Spielberg), producer (Quincy Jones), and co-star (Oprah Winfrey) all signing on as co-producers. Rather, it’s based on the hit Broadway musical, which, like the ’85 flick, was of course adapted from Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The controversy surrounding the previous screen adaptation — some loved it, some hated it, and one industry wag even accused Spielberg of taking great source material and turning it into a “zip-a-dee-doo-dah Song of the South” — did not circle this version. Alas, neither did the robust sales, as this take was, unlike its highly successful predecessor, a box office bomb (a $94M haul vs. a $15M budget then, a $60M haul vs. a $100M budget now). That’s a shame, because, pound for pound, this is the superior version, wringing as much emotion out of viewers as the previous picture but thankfully leaving aside its tonal inconsistencies (especially those Keystone Kops moments). The cast is excellent — particularly Fantasia Barrino as the hard-luck Celie, recent Rustin Oscar nominee Colman Domingo as the cruel Mister, and Danielle Brooks (deservedly earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) as the spirited Sofia — and the narrative is so strong that the movie need not live or die by its musical numbers (which, for the most part, are deftly executed). Extras in the 4K UHD + Digital Code edition consist of a making-of featurette; a look at the story’s characters; a peek at the creation of the musical numbers; and a look back at Walker’s novel and Spielberg’s film. FEAR AND DESIRE (1953). According to Stanley Kubrick, his career began with the 1956 film noir gem The Killing. He had a strong dislike for his sophomore effort, 1955’s Killer’s Kiss (reviewed here), and absolutely loathed his debut feature. In fact, Kubrick so despised Fear and Desire that not only did he use such words as “embarrassing” and “amateurish” to describe it, he also sought to have all prints destroyed after its release. It remained impossible to locate for decades, only reemerging in the 1990s. Since then, it’s been publicly shown on a number of occasions and often released on home video, but Kino’s new 4K / Blu-ray release changes the dynamics once more. This edition not only includes the 62-minute version that’s been making the rounds ever since the picture’s rediscovery but also contains the 70-minute cut that hasn’t been seen since 1953, when Kubrick screened it under the title Shape of Fear before pulling it and trimming eight minutes of footage. This is exciting, even important, news, but what it doesn’t obscure is the fact that the picture itself remains a Kubrick curio rather than an integral part of his filmography. Written by Howard Sackler (later a Pulitzer Prize winner for The Great White Hope), it follows four soldiers who are trapped behind enemy lines. There are several interesting shot selections (as well as some irksome ones) and peeks at burgeoning Kubrick themes (such as war’s dehumanizing nature), but the story is threadbare and the dialogue heavy-handed. It’s essential viewing for cineastes and Kubrick completists, as long as no one expects an undiscovered masterpiece. A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE (1971). Italian director Sergio Leone turned Clint Eastwood into a superstar with his “Man With No Name” trilogy and also significantly boosted Charles Bronson’s leading-man status with the Western masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. Neither tough guy is on hand for this rowdy epic set against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, but you do get Rod Steiger as a Mexican bandit (a suitably hammy turn, even if his accent often slips into the Southern twang he employed in In the Heat of the Night) and James Coburn as the Irish explosives expert who awakens the self-centered bandido’s anarchic spirit and sense of national pride. As with most Leone works, A Fistful of Dynamite (which also made the rounds under the monikers Duck, You Sucker and Once Upon a Time … the Revolution) is full of sly humor and startling camerawork, and it also finds the legendary Ennio Morricone contributing one of his most offbeat scores. This would prove to not only be Leone’s final Western but also his penultimate feature film — he would later helm the 1984 gangster yarn Once Upon a Time in America before calling it a career. A Fistful of Dynamite was released in the U.S. on two separate occasions in 1972, with running times of 120 minutes and 138 minutes. Fortunately, it’s Leone’s original 157-minute cut that has been making the home-video rounds in recent years, and this new edition from Kino is no exception. Extras include audio commentary by filmmaker Alex Cox (Straight to Hell); audio commentary by film historian and Leone scholar Sir Christopher Frayling; a discussion of Leone by Frayling; a remembrance by co-scripter Sergio Donati; a piece on the movie’s different versions; and trailers for all five of Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns. THE LION IN WINTER (1968). Plenty of swords and knives make appearances in The Lion in Winter, but none can possibly cut as deep as the caustic dialogue penned by scripter James Goldman (adapting his own play) and captured by director Anthony Harvey. Peter O’Toole, who had previously portrayed King Henry II in 1964’s Becket, again tackles the role, this time as an older ruler who spars with his alienated wife, Eleanor of Aquitane (Katharine Hepburn), over which of their sons should become king after he dies. Henry favors the youngest, the bratty and seemingly simple-minded John (Nigel Terry), while Eleanor throws her weight behind the oldest, the fierce yet aloof Richard the Lionheart (Anthony Hopkins in his feature film debut); neither cares for the middle son, the perpetually scheming Geoffrey (John Castle). Also adding to the drama are Henry’s mistress Anais (Jane Merrow) and her brother, France’s King Philip II (Timothy Dalton, also making his movie debut). The gloves are off between all the characters in this rousing period romp showcasing formidable turns by Hepburn and O’Toole (the latter all of 35 during filming but convincingly playing 50). Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (O’Toole, who unjustly lost to Cliff Robertson’s shameless campaigning for the indifferently received Charly), this won for Best Actress (Hepburn’s third of four career wins), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score (John Barry). Trivia aside: While the Directors Guild Award has been a remarkably accurate barometer of who would go on to win the Best Director Oscar — only eight times in 76 years have they differed — this marked the first occasion that the DGA winner did not also snag the Oscar, with Harvey winning the DGA for this film but Carol Reed snagging the Oscar for Oliver! THE LONG RIDERS (1980). The Long Riders sounds like merely a gimmick: Cast real-life brothers as real-life outlaw siblings. But with director Walter Hill (back in his glory years) in charge, it turned out to be one of the last decent Westerns to hit the big screen until the early 1990s brought us the one-two punch of Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven. The Keaches (Stacy, James), the Carradines (David, Keith, Robert), the Quaids (Dennis, Randy), and the Guests (Christopher, Nicholas) respectively portray the James, Younger, Miller, and Ford brothers, and the picture episodically follows them as they rob banks, bicker among themselves, and attempt to forge some semblance of personal lives. In addition to respectively playing Frank and Jesse James, Stacy and James Keach also co-wrote the script and served as executive producers, but they were generous enough not to make themselves rise above the ensemble. All of the characterizations are interesting and all of the performances memorable, although it’s amusing to note that, in this picture dominated by men, the best work comes courtesy of Pamela Reed as the fiery Belle Starr. Blu-ray extras include film historian audio commentary; a making-of featurette; interviews with Hill, the Carradines, the Keaches, Randy Quaid, Nicholas Guest, producer Tim Zinnemann, and composer Ry Cooder; a breakdown of the Northfield Minnesota Raid scene; a short piece in which Hill discusses director Sam Peckinpah (for whom he had written the script for 1972’s The Getaway); and the theatrical trailer. POOR THINGS (2023). Other films fared better throughout awards season (although not many), but Poor Things is the one that earned my vote as the best picture of 2023 (go here for the complete list). Working from Alasdair Gray’s same-named novel, director Yorgos Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara (their 2018 release The Favourite likewise earned my vote as the best picture of that year; go here) have fashioned a true oddity, a Frankenstein Meets Forrest Gump flick filtered through a feminist focus. Emma Stone, taking a bold leap up to the level of today’s greatest actresses, stars as Bella, a suicide victim who’s brought back to life in the most fantastical way by quirky scientist Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under the tutelage of Godwin, the childlike Bella receives an education within the strict confines of home, but as she matures, she realizes she wants to explore the outside world. And thus she takes off with a seedy lawyer (a hilarious Mark Ruffalo), growing ever more bold as she samples life’s perils and pleasures and in the process discovers her true self. To say that Poor Things isn’t for everyone is an understatement, yet those willing to go along for the sometimes gross yet always giddy ride will experience a movie that, much like Barbie, illustrates how a woman who knows nothing of our world’s crippling problems and prejudices might carve her own path in pursuit of becoming fully human and fully independent. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Ruffalo), Director, and Adapted Screenplay, this nabbed Stone a richly deserved Oscar for Best Actress as well as three additional statues for its sets, costumes, and makeup design. QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER (1990). It’s fortuitous for film fanatics that Tom Selleck’s Magnum P.I. duties prevented him from accepting the role of Indiana Jones — yes, he was George Lucas’ first choice, not Harrison Ford (although Steven Spielberg wanted Ford all along) — since he’s long proven himself to be an actor of limited range. His perfectly acceptable but rather one-note style is best utilized in forgettable fare like the box office smash Three Men and a Baby and the box office flops Runaway and Mr. Baseball. Or like Quigley Down Under, a dopey adventure yarn that plops an American cowboy into an Australian setting. Selleck stars as Matthew Quigley, a sharpshooter who journeys to the land down under in the 1860s to work for a wealthy landowner (Alan Rickman) who claims he needs help with keeping the dingo population down. But when Quigley learns that the cattle baron really wants him to exterminate the Aborigines he feels are trespassing on his property, he vehemently and violently refuses, thereby making himself as unwanted as the indigenous locals. As was often the case, Rickman’s the best thing about this clumsy, unfocused, and uneven film, which loses any chance at saving itself whenever an overbearing Laura San Giacomo, as a wayward Texan named Crazy Cora, turns up on screen — and she turns up a lot. Extras in the 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray edition include a vintage behind-the-scenes featurette; an interview with San Giacomo; a piece in which master armorer Mike Tristano discusses the Sharps Rifle, the long-range weapon used by Selleck’s character in the film; and the theatrical trailer. THE 355 (2022). There’s a tendency to attach the word “feminist” to any movie that takes a traditionally male-centric genre and fills the leading roles with women. But that’s a lazy and often erroneous approach. Thelma & Louise is a feminist work; so are the horror film The Descent and the superhero saga Wonder Woman. The 355, on the other hand, simply feels like a standard action yarn in which the central characters just happen to be women instead of Ethan Hunt or Jason Bourne. The picture is a sampling of girl power with a United Nations twist, as five global operatives — American (Jessica Chastain), British (Lupita Nyong’o), German (Diane Kruger), Colombian (Penelope Cruz), and Chinese (Fan Bingbing) — pool their resources in order to stop a wide range of bad guys from activating some gizmo that can basically cripple the world. The 355 is the sort of movie that doesn’t trust the intelligence of its audience — that’s a given when there’s a cityscape shot that captures the Eiffel Tower and the filmmakers feel the need to tag the location as “Paris, France.” Writer-director Simon Kinberg, co-scripting with playwright Theresa Rebeck, is the guy who brought down the once-proud X-Men franchise with the painful Dark Phoenix, and this effort shows the same general inefficiency when it comes to such cinematic niceties as dialogue, characterization, and thrillingly staged action sequences. The 355 isn’t a bad movie — rather, it’s aggressively average — and any lift it receives is, not surprisingly, provided by its powerhouse cast, Kruger in particular. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include behind-the-scenes pieces focusing on the stunt work and the production design; deleted scenes; and VFX breakdowns. THE CRUCIBLE (1996). Written in the midst of the McCarthy era as a thinly veiled attack on the Communist witch hunts that were disrupting the very fabric of the nation, Arthur Miller’s play has long since broken the shackles of that period and emerged as a timeless commentary on the evil that men (and women) do — especially under insincere veneers of righteousness and religion. Small wonder, then, that this superb adaptation, penned by Miller himself, remains as topical as ever (both in 1996 and 2024), with its trenchant themes — of hypocrisy, hatemongering, and political coups d’etat — crawling all over each other like worms in a can. Set in the Salem of 1692, the film finds venal Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) triggering a mass hysteria in which accusations of witchcraft are resulting in the executions of innocent people; among those targeted by the immoral minority are farmer John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen). The lead performances are all impeccable, with Day-Lewis’ zesty rectitude contrasting smartly with Allen’s quiet goodness, which in turn strikes the right balance with Ryder’s unrepentant monstrousness. Yet top acting honors go to the magnificent Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth, the McCarthyesque agent of evil who presides over the trials. The Crucible earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Allen) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Miller), but it should have earned many more, including one for Best Picture — it’s truly one of the great forgotten (and underrated) films of its era. Hi, Joseph; thanks for writing. I’m particularly thinking of the scenes in the Spielberg version with Harpo — here’s all this heavy business with Albert constantly abusing Celie and her living in fear, and then suddenly here’s some slapstick shtick with Harpo crashing through a roof like The Three Stooges."

"Mar 12, 2024",positive," Home › Recommendation › Home Release › That’s all, folks! The DCEU is officially over with the home release of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” From 2013 – 2023, Warner Bros. Pictures has released 15 films featuring characters from DC Comics beginning with The Trinity — Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck), and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) — and now it’s all over with the James Wan-directed (Saw; Malignant) Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. This final film does nothing to shore up or finalize any of the threads from the prior films, but stands alone as a proper sequel to Wan’s 2018 Aquaman, starring Jason Momoa (Fast X) as Arthur Curry. It would be unfair to Lost Kingdom to put any of the weight that the end of the cinematic era possesses onto the film, so, instead, it’s better to consider it as it sees itself, a story apart from the others, focused entirely on giving audiences a Lovecraftian-tinged family adventure, just like the first. Delightfully, both Wan and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (Orphan) return to write the script with Momoa and Thomas Pa’a Sibbett (The Last Manhunt), creating an adventure that leans into what makes comic book stories so great — endless possibility. If you enjoyed the first film and have looked forward to Lost Kingdom, rejoice for the home release also includes nearly two-hours of behind-the-scenes footage that inform how Wan, Momoa, and the rest of the cast and crew closed out their time in Atlantis. Jason Momoa as Aquaman in Warner Bros. Pictures’ action adventure AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. © 2023 Warner Bros. Ent. All Rights Reserved. TM & © DC. Since the end of Aquaman, Arthur has taken on the responsibilities as King of Atlantis, he and Mera (Amber Heard) have married and had a child, and the two split their time between living with Arthur’s father, Tom (Temuera Morrison), and overseeing the kingdom. While Arthur struggles to push through any of his own plans due to the resistance of the Atlantean council, his old foe David Kane/Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is making strides with scientist Dr. Shin (Randall Park) to uncover forgotten Atlantean technology that may help him repair his helmet. What the two discover, however, is far more dangerous than just the means to give Kane the vengeance he hungers for, it may bring about the end of everything. With this being both a home release and the final film in the DCEU, this home release review will be discussing the film without concern for keeping secrets. So if you’d like to learn about the bonus features without necessarily learning about the film, jump to the image of actor Patrick Wilson on set with James Wan below.

The quickest way to describe Lost Kingdom is “more of the same.” Now, how you take that will depend on your own reaction to the first Aquaman. If you found it silly, boorish, and juvenile, you’ll find the same here. If you found it adventurous, comedic, and tinted with horror, that’s exactly what you get. Both can be true at the same time, which is how both the first and second outing were received by this reviewer. Though introduced in director Zack Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), it wasn’t until Justice League (2017) that audiences got the chance to meet Momoa’s half-breed hero. We’re given a character who resents being unable to exist in either world he’s part of, yet who finds himself helping others on the smaller scale until he’s called to action to join in a larger fight. This is carried forward to Aquaman where he must begrudgingly take on his half-brother Orn (Patrick Wilson) for leadership of Atlantis in order to prevent an all-out war between the oceans and the surface and goes even further now that Arthur is on the throne and never wanted to be. The throughline from introduction to Lost Kingdom is clearly defined, even if some of the characterization or presentation shifts a tad along the way, depending on who’s directing and/or writing. Momoa’s Arthur is one who possessed incredible abilities, yet always felt like a man apart from everything and, through his journey in the DCEU, went from loner outcast to team member to found family to creating one of his own. By the end of Lost Kingdom, it even goes a step further into starting to erase the line between his human identity and Atlantean one as Arthur makes Atlantis known to the world. One of the very reasonable complaints is that the film often careens into the juvenile when it probably shouldn’t, such as Arthur getting silly-stupid at the end of his press coverage unveiling the existence of Atlantis, but, not doing so, would kinda be the opposite of who this version of Arthur is. Put another way, it’s not that audiences need to lower their standards for what characters “should” or “shouldn’t do,” but remember that the filmmakers have a specific vision that they seek to keep true to. This version is its authentic self no matter what and much of what makes the character so damned charming comes from Momoa’s embodiment of the role.

But where the first film’s reference was, admittedly gross, within the context of the scene makes a great deal of sense — need something wet to activate an Atlantean machine? Urine’ll do the job. In Lost Kingdom, the two instances are less about being gross and more the state of fatherhood. The first instance shows Arthur changing his son’s diaper and, by using the traditional forward-facing vs. side technique while also failing to cover the penis, he finds himself with an open mouth full of warm urine while his son giggles. Having been peed on many times, even from the defensive side position, it’s less a moment that reduces Arthur, but showcases how happy he is. The man is being peed on and, rather than growing dysregulated, he rolls with it because he’s just delighted to be a father. The second time, well, that’s because Mera made it happen using her own abilities to manipulate water as Arthur manages to duck out of the way, gloating about it. That *she* would do this, again gross as it is, speaks to the way in which the pair have mingled their worlds, almost like a strange callback to her reaction to Arthur’s suggestion of peeing on the machine. This is growth, folks, and often what a healthy marriage looks like wherein both people meet in the middle, while also accepting the other for who they are. This is, of course, where the theme of the film finds its footing with the conflict rising from Arthur’s failure to do the right thing and save Kane’s father in the first film and King Atlan’s (Vincent Regan) inability to stop his own brother, Kordax (Pilou Asbæk), from threatening to destroy the world. Thus, by the end of the film, we come to understand that Lost Kingdom is entirely an adventure story surrounding a tale of family and social responsibility. The Arthur whom we met formally in Justice League is not the one here. That one would’ve been more likely to get angry, even if his own child peed on him, whereas this one rejoices in the opportunity to be near his child. That’s why, in my view, the film is at its strongest when it incorporates the Orn/Arthur brother bonding aspects of the film with the central narrative, not just because Wilson and Momoa have excellent chemistry, but because of how the film handles resolving their conflict through open communication rather than fighting. Even when the film turns predictable and the magical possession that Kane willingly accepts by Kordax if it means finally getting his revenge on Arthur transfer to Orn, it’s resolved through talking and recognition of past mistakes. Humility and love win the day, rather than pride and hatred. Frankly, if the writer’s had slipped in an “Ohana means family” before the end of the film, I wouldn’t have been mad at it.

Just like Black Adam (2022), Shazam 2 (2023), and Blue Beetle (2023), the home release for Lost Kingdom offers a bevy of materials that provide an inside look on the making of the feature. For folks who enjoy learning about the making of movies, that Warner Bros. put so much on-disc and on the digital edition is a surprise, given the typical lack of materials on home releases today. It’s a touch frustrating that there’s no commentary track as one can imagine the kinds of stories any member of the cast or crew could tell; however, given the politics behind the scenes of the film — the Heard/Depp trial, Heard’s public comments about her reduced role, the transition of the DC Studios arm to James Gunn and Peter Safran, and the overall state of WB as a studio — one can certainly understand why creating an opportunity to talk at length in a loose situation might be a bad idea PR-wise. That said, commentary tracks seem to be growing rarer and rarer on mainstream releases, so it’s a bummer nonetheless. However, there’s still plenty to learn as the cast and crew take you through quite literally everything about the film with focuses on each major location, the narrative, and characters. This means we get a closer look at the creatures of the deep from which the horrors come, as well as how they increased the size of this film compared to the last (despite no drumming octopus or kraken to be seen). Be advised that the only way to access the motion comic that accompanies the home release is through the digital edition. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta in Warner Bros.

Admittedly, the CG gets a little iffy at times, the separation between real sets and technological filler being extraordinarily obvious, not to mention the rubbery visage of CG characters in motion, and the film leans too heavily on exposition in order to shave its runtime to under two-hours (minus credits), but it’s still a darn good time. The sets are imaginative, the characters feel lived-in, and the use of practical suits helps reduce the faceless CG enemy-trope of a lot of superhero films while also making the combat feel more tangible and weighted dramatically. Does Lost Kingdom wrap up any threads established from other films? No. Does it really connect to any film outside of Arthur’s stories? Also no. But no one said it had too. An expectation has formed from more than a decade of superhero films that “everything is connected” and that expectation basically failed the DCEU from the start. Tell good stories and the people will come. Connect them as you need to, but it’s ok for there to be solo stories and for them to stay solo stories, like the comics themselves. So, goodbye, DCEU. You were a wild ride where you spent the majority of it course-correcting to what you thought audiences wanted instead of just making damn great movies. What you could have been without all the drama, we’ll never know. See you in the funny pages. *sigh* I loved James Gunn. I was one of the ones who was on the Twitter war to get him rehired. But he broke my heart with how he’s handled DC💔. Unless I’m mistaken, he hasn’t had *control* control over anything before his film. He’s just overseeing the end of what was before it starts all over. He fired Henry Cavill. And he’s just spit in the face of all that’s come before him. I wanted to see Kal-El vs. Black Adam. I was promised that. I SCREAMED like a giddy little girl in the theater with joy and Gunn took my joy away. I also don’t know if we’ll see Gal Gadot again. And I adored her as Wonder Woman.  I wouldn’t say he’s “spit in the face” of the DCEU. He’s worked within it and seems to respect what Snyder did. So much so that some aspects of it are going to remain in the new continuity. Plus, unless my memory is wrong, he wasn’t yet the head of DC Films when BLACK ADAM tanked. I think that announcement came around the release of SHAZAM 2, which started the general malaise for audiences since nothing that the films did would matter. So it was more the folks before Gunn who dropped the ball on Supes v. Black Adam.  It does seem like Gunn is going to create this universe mostly from scratch and I’m willing to give it a shot (as I did with Snyder multiple times) before passing judgement. But then, I’m on the record as not enjoying Cavill’s portrayal of Supes, but that has more to do with the writing and execution than performance. "
"Feb 29, 2024",negative," Jason Momoa's aquatic superhero battles a vengeful old foe bent on causing climate catastrophe in this underwhelming sequel to the DC Extended Universe's big-hitter. Director James Wan's belated follow-up to the 2018 comic-book blockbuster finds Momoa's Atlantean king juggling his regal duties with fatherhood and marriage to Mera (Amber Heard). But the return of a supernaturally powerful Black Manta forces an alliance between Aquaman and his resentful, incarcerated half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). An action-packed prison break in the desert is the catalyst for a buddy movie straight out of the Midnight Run playbook, which sends the bickering siblings on a quest to an island teeming with gruesome, hungry monsters. The evolving bromance between uptight, no-fun Orm and his Tigger-ish sibling lightens the mood but it also leaves little screen time for Nicole Kidman and especially Heard, with a cephalopod sidekick called Topo inserted as a replacement. A functional rather than spectacular slice of comic-book nonsense, then, but considering it is the final instalment of the DCEU franchise, a more rousing swansong would have been welcome."
"Feb 21, 2024",positive," There are also some really unique genre pictures like The Book of Clarence, some very sound family fare like Orion and the Dark and a movie where Jason Statham plays an action hero called a Beekeeper. Trying to turn Madame Web into the next laugh-a-minute disaster midnight movie was bound to happen. We live in a post-meme society, one where any film that’s distinctly flawed but still showing signs of real personality gets shoved into a joke box that labels it “this week’s Worst Movie of All Time.” It’s an exhaustive discourse, as the “Morbin’ Time” effect that doomed Madame Web before it really had a chance. It’s a shame, really, because despite its clear faults, the Dakota Johnson-led spinoff is really one of the more fascinating Marvel movies in some time. Morbius was truly awful; this is not that. Cut from a very particular cloth of risky 2000s comic book movies that likely fell victim to studio meddling, Madame Web feels haphazard and melodramatic in an oddly refreshing way. It’s not really a superhero origin story as much as it is a B-grade sci-fi thriller, and its efforts to canonize its setting into some sort of Marvel future feel so delightfully lifeless and unwilling, like someone dragging their resistant 8-year-old to a piano lesson. The film, on purpose or on accident, shows you how contrived the continuous shared universe mentality is, and it has some (perhaps unintended, but still present and effective) fun with that in a very non-meta way. Don’t necessarily mistake its mistakes for mistakes, we’ll argue. Kevin Feige built the MCU to absolutely avoid movies like this, ones that can fly off the rail at any given moment because of strange decisions and potentially off-putting weirdness due to the unholy blend of unwieldy creative vision, careless studio interference and Michael Bay-approved obviousness of product placement. This movie is his worst Marvel nightmare. Bizarre springs eternal with Madame Web, and that’s kind of nice to have something so baffling in execution and lacking in uniformity sport the Marvel logo. It’s not entirely successful, but there’s not much else like it besides the Venom movies. It’s also got a surprisingly wry sense of humor, as Johnson and S.J. Clarkson mine the corniness of the plot and the very relatable “annoyed millennial unsuccessfully trying to relate to sarcastic Gen Z kids” dynamics (in 2003, sure, but it still hits). Johnson is really quite impressive here, as she’s wholly aware of what kind of movie she’s in and how ridiculous some of it is. Like a pro, she still powers through it by selling the drama in some really shaky dialogue and nailing the punch lines, even when they’re not necessarily there. Some of this movie is dinged from the delivery process, but it’s actually decently intact. If anything, this is really better than most of the recent MCU movies. Madame Web might be really messy and occasionally encourage the wrong kind of audience participation, but if you go in willing to meet it on its wavelength, you might be surprised by how nice it is to watch one of these movies not necessarily know where it’s going or why it’s doing what it is. That’s the joy of risks. They don’t always pay off, but they rarely fail without genuine entertainment value. People will say plenty about this movie, but they cannot call it boring. The first half is pretty excellent, even if it starts to get a little lost in the sauce with the meta-narrative…however, the animation is splendid and most of the script and voice cast are very well-considered. It’s upper-tier DreamWorks, but it doesn’t quite have the conceptual cohesion of something like Inside Out, as great as Kaufman working in this space is. This is exactly what it should be, a rare example of the schlocky, B-grade action movie that strives to be more than a temporary meme soon lost to time. David Ayer cuts down the unnecessary plotting and keeps this humming along at an enjoyable clip, and Jason Statham understands the proper frequency here as well as any actor could. It’s wildly fun in stretches, and being rough around the edges in a good Expendables movie way is more than forgivable. I’d watch more Beekeepers. Josh Hutcherson is a great jerk. This is the kind of movie that would do great business on home video and develop a very loyal cult following and, in like 10 years, would be regarded as a very savvy genre picture that the youths of the time understood more than the folks who didn’t really get on its level. Alas, that’s not the world we’re in anymore, but I sure hope this one finds a second life on streaming because it really is a shame we get a proper successor to the 80s/90s movies like Heathers, The Lost Boys, the 1990s Addams Family movies and Edward Scissorhands that doesn’t immediately find its audience. It’s a movie made by someone who clearly loves the irreverence and aesthetics of Tim Burton, the oblong austerity of Barry Sonnenfeld, the wacky studio comedy vibes of Penelope Spheeris and the buoyant campiness of Joel Schumacher. Plenty of Joe Dante The ‘Burbs vibes in there, too. Maybe this will take off on Netflix or Peacock or something. It’s a good movie and deserved more than what it got being dumped in February with little fanfare. Kathryn Newton, Liza Soberano and Cole Sprouse are all aces. Jeymes Samuel walks a tight rope here between satire and earnest heart, and he does so marvelously. He’s such a confident artist, radiant and grand in the way he envisions his stories and very deft to the touch with the emotions. He’s got an old soul for the old Hollywood scope and booming score that sweeps you off your feet. There is a real dedication present to genre homage while twisting it around to meet his forward-thinking vision. It’s pretty marvelous what he pulls off here, maybe not quite as tight as The Harder They Fall but just as impressive, giddy and resonant. Samuel is a special filmmaker, and this is a very good film that deserved so much more than bad-faith readings and to be dumped in January on a crowded weekend. It’s a definite step down from the insane heights of the first film, but it’s still so much fun and so much more engaging than most of the superhero films made these days. It’s a shame this will be it for the DCEU, if only because you’d rather have unwieldy variance with real risk (hello, Madame Web) involved instead of more sameness. James Wan really did everything he could here to craft a rollicking adventure out of production issues that show the seams in the edit. This really reminded me of a less polished version of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, lacking the gravitas but making up for it in pure, chummy enjoyment. That has to count for something, right? I’m sad to see Jason Momoa’s time as Aquaman end; he was just perfect for the part, but I’m glad he got one last chance to flex his joy in playing the role, even if the vehicle is a bit more dinged up than before. Also, the sunken ship underworld is yet another huge example of why Wan needs to do a Star War. No director right now would be a better fit. I’d bet $5 the pitch for this movie was “Vacation … but with ducks on migration! … but also Finding Nemo … on the quality level of The Secret Life of Pets,” and the entire room stood in applause. It’s okay! Illumination is incapable of making anything but the same perfectly fine, risk-averse family film over and over and over again, which means you always leave reasonably satisfied but wholly static. They clearly just want to be Blue Sky with Minions instead of Scrat, and more power to them. They’ll probably never make a great movie, but they’ll make plenty decent enough ones. 3/4-star movies for days. This was, weirdly, the second-best animated film released in December 2023 about talking birds who must escape evil humans who want to cook them and serve them to consumers… it’s also got the second-best Mike White movie script involving the word “orange.” Go figure."
"Jan 27, 2024",negative,"Sadly, a flaccid, final DCEU film that tries to coast on the chemistry of Momoa and Patrick Wilson that ends up crashing on the rocks with some terrible humor, ridiculous scenarios, nonsensical story beats, and a villain that is supremely wasted. RIP DCEU"
"Jan 27, 2024",negative," The DC Extended Universe As We Know It dies with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (now streaming on VOD services like Amazon Prime Video). It’s the 15th movie in a series that began with a rather rank ape-fart of a movie, Man of Steel, and concludes with Jason Momoa, in AatLK’s final scene, making a pretty on-the-nose reference to Iron Man, as if acknowledging that Marvel done whupped DC’s ass. Wisely, the second solo Aquaman adventure is mostly self-contained, existing in the same somewhat-endearingly idiotic world as 2018’s Aquaman, which was borderline-endearing while so much of the other non-Wonder Woman DC movies were stultifying, ugly-to-the-eye slopfests. So does the second Aquaman – which brings back director James Wan, who, instead of dithering around with comic book movies, should be making more movies like Malignant – live up to the firm OK-ness of its predecessor? Almost! The Gist: Aquaman (Momoa), aka Arthur Curry, is a dad! Hooray! So that means he’s extra-tired all the time: He’s not only a hero who saves seamen from evil pirates, he’s also the king of the undersea empire of Atlantis who commutes to work on a glowing giant seahorse from his landbound seaside house, where he lives with wife Mera (Amber Heard) and changes his baby boy’s diapers and tries not to be peed on. He listens to boring Atlantean bureaucrats all day, sometimes gets into a violent scrape with evildoers, then comes home to toys all over the floor. Why don’t they all live in Atlantis in a king’s castle with servants who can get peed on? Not sure. Arthur is of the land and Aquaman is of the sea and home is everywhere, I guess. Now, please recall the villain from the first movie, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). He’s still around, and still not Over It, It being the death of his pirate father at the hands of Aquaman. His power suit looms in a case of the type that only superheroes and supervillains own: all glass, dramatically lit, holding the costume in far greater reverence than a hanger in the closet could ever provide. Black Manta has a crew of flunkies that includes Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), who feels conflicted: He really wants to see the long-lost worlds under the sea, but in order to do so, is enabling a lunatic to do evil things. What evil things, might you ask? Discovering an ancient trident that possesses him with a green CGI monster who looks like a Lord of the Rings leftover, for starters. And then stealing a bunch of orichalcum from an Atlantean storage facility so he may fuel his evil machines, except that burning the orichalcum means emitting vast amounts of neon-green pollution into the air and rapidly accelerating global warming. See, you sat down to watch a dumbass Aquaman movie, and didn’t realize it was going to be ABOUT something. Fooled ya! Black Manta’s mucking-about raises the interest of the Atlantean council, who consult with Aquaman in a scene that doesn’t at all deserve to be summarized here, but made me wonder how the characters’ voices create such a majestic echo as if they were in a great stone hall, despite being underwater. I mean, their hair flows and the visuals are murky and bleary, so the laws of physics apply there, but shouldn’t their voices go gurglegurglegurgle? I digress. The Atlanteans battle Black Manta in a sequence in which the face of Nicole Kidman, playing Aquaman’s mother Atlanna, is pasted on a CGI body riding a roboshark, so I guess my nitpicking about underwater talking is stupid, just stupid.  The fight to quash Black Manta’s evildoing doesn’t go well, and what with one thing and another, Aquaman decides that the only person who can help him now is his half-brother Olm (Patrick Wilson), who you may recall was the antagonist in the first Aquaman. This will require an uneasy sibling reunion, but not until Aquaman busts Olm out of prison. From there, the two of them quest through underground caverns and across deserts, fighting beasts and bad guys on beaches and in trenches. Eventually, Aquaman’s baby, Aquaman Jr., serves his purpose and is kidnapped by Black Manta, and something has to be done about that. I wonder what Aquaman could do. Get in a fight, I suppose.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: If you ever desired to watch a movie that’s almost wholly comprised of the tonal and visual style of the Jar Jar Binks underwater-world scenes from The Phantom Menace, have I got the movie for you. Memorable Dialogue: This movie includes drivel like “You tellin’ me you never went topside and had a cheeseburger? Or a slice of ’za? Pepperoni?” (Aquaman) to dippy fish-themed almost-puns like “Got any more krill-brained ideas?” (Olm) to exposition mouthfuls like “This whole place must be heat-shielded to protect it from the surface’s thermal satellites!” (Olm). You choose which you prefer. Our Take: Aquaman 2 mostly blows, maybe like one of those deadly poisonous fish that blows up, but it at least has three things going for it: It never, ever takes itself seriously. It’s unburdened by greater DCEU baggage, and mostly tells its own compact story. And Wan seems to be having fun directing this thing, which is full of extravagant video-game-style shots that weave in and around and through the action – and, for better or worse, likely wouldn’t be possible (or at least affordable) if the film didn’t consist of roughly 97 percent CGI.  Of course, the myriad struggles to get the movie made and finally released five years after the first Aquaman means Wan didn’t know until too late that it would be the final punctuation mark on the DCEU, so any hope for a no-holds-barred who-cares let-it-all-hang-out let-’er-rip extravaganza goes unfulfilled. So what everyone settles for is a general regurgitation of the first Aquaman plot, but with a slightly more wide-ranging display of digital “locations” and a larger assemblage of creatures and supporting characters. It all adds up to, well, nothing we haven’t yawned at before, whether it’s DC slop like The Flash or Marvel slop like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, all of these being just-because-you-can-do-anything-with-CGI-doesn’t-mean-you-should-do-it kind of movies.  Now, I didn’t aggressively dislike Aquaman and the Lost Creativity of a Once-Hopeful Franchise Mired With Deflating Box Office Returns; once you get on its goofy wavelength and acclimate yourself to the comin’-in-HOT Momoaness of the character and performance – is Momoa grating or is he fun? Can’t tell! – it’s a perfectly acceptable popcorn movie, even if it’s too busy by half, and blatantly telegraphs a Mighty Trident Battle between protag and antag. It appeals heavily to your inner nine-year-old who’s uncritical enough to think some of this stuff looks pretty cool, and you might actually convince yourself this is true maybe two or three times during its two-hour runtime. Oh, and that bit above about the movie being ABOUT something? It’s really not. The climate-change thing is as empty as gestures get. The subtext here addresses only the end of this wearisome cinematic universe, which lived up to its potential about 2.6 times out of 15 movies. The DCEU kingdom is hereby abandoned. Our Call: I dunno. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom almost has its moments. So let’s crunch the comparison sum: It’s a lesser experience than the first Aquaman, which was mediocre-plus. And what do you get with straight-down-the-middle mediocrity? You get me shrugging and saying SKIP IT. "

"Jan 9, 2024",negative," The year of our Lord 2023 A.D. (C.E.) has not been kind to DC’s big-screen comic-book adaptations. Between the widely reported news of the DCEU’s (DC Extended Universe) demise as an interwoven franchise, a divisive mega-merger between Discovery and Warner Bros., and a new creative team of James Gunn and Peter Safran controlling this year’s DCEU releases (e.g. The Flash) audiences have recognized the increasingly diminishing returns involved and responded accordingly (i.e. negatively). They’re but throwing up their hands in collective frustration, and merited (Shazam: Fury of the Gods) or not (Blue Beetle), deciding to sit them out entirely. This inevitably brings us to the latest — and last — chapter in the DCEU saga, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the belated sequel to 2018’s mega-hit, Aquaman. Once again directed by James Wan (Malignant), Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom initially finds Arthur Curry / Aquaman (Jason Momoa) barely balancing the demands of fatherhood to a newborn, the domestic bliss with Mera (Amber Heard), and with leading the undersea kingdom of Atlantis as the rightful heir to the throne and monarch. Now that Atlantis’s ex-ruler Orm Marius / Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson), a righteous eco-warrior who is also Aquaman’s half-brother, has been permanently exiled to prison, the undersea kingdom enjoys a measure of peace, safety, and stability. Aquaman’s backup foe, David Kane / Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), though, does. Quickly defeated twice by Aquaman in the previous installment, the revenge-minded Kane has learned from previous mistakes. Kane has levelled up, repairing and upgrading his Atlantean armour and equipment to make him Aquaman’s physical equal. He’s also acquired the powerful Black Trident, which is the Atlantean equivalent of Sauron’s ring from The Lord of the Rings. The dark magic-powered Black Trident imbues its holder with vast, destructive powers while corrupting their heart and mind. With the Black Trident-controlled Kane putting a poorly defined and clumsy plan into play, accelerating climate change into a global crisis, Aquaman makes a narratively unjustifiable decision to break Orm free from prison because he’s the only Atlantean who might be able to help Aquaman stop Black Manta. Cue a segue to the only real land-based set piece involving skeletal guards, monstrous mounts, and a genetically engineered cephalopod nicknamed Topo. Based on his limited time onscreen, it’s clear that (a) Topo is a star and (b) deserves his/her/its own spinoff. Given away in all the promo materials, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom all but dispenses with the other supporting characters to turn the sequel into the Aquaman and Orm Power Hour (aka Bosom Brothers). Not surprisingly, that means Mera and Aquaman and Orm’s mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), are left in the rearview. She appears once or twice as needed to push the story forward whenever it goes into neutral. With the fast food-obsessed Aquaman in dude-bro mood, that leaves Orm as the proverbial straight man, doing double-take after double-take at whatever non-sequitur escapes Aquaman’s mouth. It’s not immediately tiresome, but with an undercooked script credited to David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (Momoa received a story credit), painfully predictable drama, occasionally cringe-worthy jokes, and sleep-inducing tedium follow soon thereafter. From there, it’s just a hop, skip, and a dive to the swim to Kane’s marvellous, steampunk-flavoured and Captain Nemo-inspired lair inside a volcano. It’s more than enough for audiences to feel like they’ve seen this superhero film before — because they have, countless times — and wonder where it all went wrong. Aquaman leaves one asking when and why did bland, indigestible corporate superhero products became the norm. Returning for the second and last time to Aquaman and his mythos, Wan directs everything here with a combination of the rigorous efficiency, economy, and competency typical of early 21st-century superhero filmmaking. It’s rare for anything approaching a distinct visual style to emerge from the screen. However, as with the first entry, Wan’s lifelong obsession with monsters in every form, shape, and size shifts into the foreground when the fellowship of the trident find themselves confronted with an army of undead ghouls and misshapen monsters straight of H.P. Lovecraft. For a moment, however brief, it’s almost enough to applaud Wan’s Sisyphean efforts to turn Aquaman’s second go-around into a coherent, compelling superhero entry. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

I have enjoyed the last few superhero films I've reviewed, and there have been a lot of them including The Marvels and Blue Beetle. But none of them have set the box office on fire and perhaps audiences are finally telling the big studios in the only way they'll listen (their wallets) that fewer and better might be the way to go.  Australian summer is where our cinemas - businesses that need to make money and who keep plenty of folk employed - make a good percentage of their annual income. And so when I looked at the list of summer releases for this year and saw the Aquaman sequel at the top of the list, I did that intake of breath between the teeth you make make when you're watching an accident about to happen.  And I can see why, because all of the elements that made the first film successful are back, including Mamoa and Our Nicole, and a tongue-in-cheek approach to its own silliness.  Again responsible for drawing these elements together is industrious and inventive Australian director James Wan, of Saw fame (and also, Canberra readers, one of our very own local sons, a graduate of Lake Tuggeranong College).  In the first Aquaman film, normal human bloke Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) fell in love with mermaid queen from the deep Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) but she was forced to return to the sea, leaving behind the bloke and their son.  That kid was Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who would find out across that film that he was, in fact, some kind of under-sea royalty, involved in all kinds of territorial aquatic shenanigans.  He finds he must now save his brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), the deposed former King of Atlantis, in order for them to both square off against Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II) who has a new weapon he wants to use to kill Curry and his entire bloodline.  Patrick Wilson looks and is gorgeous in this film, and there's a fight scene where Orm and Aquaman square off against some tendrilled bad guys that equals the volleyball match in Top Gun: Maverick for beachfront homoeroticism.  Amber Heard's performance proves that the biosecurity hostage video she shot with Johnny Depp under threat of having her dogs killed by Barnaby Joyce was no fluke. It's hard to tell, with so much CGI at play here, what if anything is real, although plenty of the film's budget went on location filming in Britain and Hawaii. But visually, the film is a spectacular explosion of ideas that might feel like a lot to take in but faithfully reference the Aquaman comic books of the 1960s and '70s.  Director James Gunn was recently hired by DC to fix everything that is keeping fans away from their Superman, Batman et cetera movies and big name stars are being handed gold watches. That'll give the fans plenty to speculate about, but it's entirely possible to watch this two hours of fairy floss untroubled by speculation about any of its stars coming back to these roles in the future.

"Jan 7, 2024",positive,"Not all of the comedy and emotional beats land, but this film is good enough to turn on and watch. It isn’t one of the stronger DCEU entries, but you won’t have a bad time watching this sequel."
"Jan 7, 2024",neutral," The DCEU emits its last gasp—or perhaps gurgle—with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The long-gestating second entry sees Jason Momoa as the superhero, and though Warner Bros. has positioned it as a holiday tentpole, the finished movie might also leave the studio underwater. Since the events of 2018’s Aquaman, Arthur (Momoa) has taken his place as King of Atlantis, married his sweetheart Mera (Amber Heard), and had a son. Apropos of nothing, he’s also grown a dad-bod. Though Atlantis glows with strange, undersea technology and wild-looking merpeople populating the city, Arthur prefers spending his time with his aging dad (Temuera Morrison) in the garage of an old sea shanty, guzzling beer and watching TV. The choice activity for any superpowered royal. Arthur’s happy domestic life gets interrupted by the re-emergence of David Kane/Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a pirate bent on revenge against Aquaman for the death of his father in the first film. In his quest to discover the location of Atlantis, Black Manta discovers an ancient trident linked to a power source that can wipe out the undersea kingdom. The catch: the plan involves heating the Earth, which will also release a nasty race of Lovecraftian mermen. Rather than mobilize his undersea army, Aquaman opts to enlist the help of his brother, the Oceanmaster Orm (Patrick Wilson), who rots in a dry prison after his own attack on Atlantis in the first film. Got all that? Despite the convoluted set-up, director James Wan constructs a simple plot, spending most of the runtime leaping from one action sequence punctuated by goofy one-liners to the next. Momoa, ever game to grin and drop a snarky line, delivers an action-hero performance in the vein of old Arnold Schwarzenegger pictures. Those don’t involve acting in the traditional sense, so much as mugging for the camera to overplayed classic rock songs. Then again, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom doesn’t really have a grip on Arthur as a character. Comic book characters have a plastic quality to them. Different writers can mold their personalities to fit different kinds of stories. Aquaman stories, at their best, examined the character in the context of a reluctant defender, an arrogant warrior with contempt for the surface dwellers he protects. Momoa nailed that characterization in Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Here, he feels more like a watered-down (excuse the phrase) version of Thor in the MCU. Indeed, director Wan—perhaps at the behest of James Gunn and Warner Bros.–seems to want to emulate Taika Waititi’s Thor movies. Much as Thor grew a dad bod, sired a moppet, and had little interest in ruling over his kingdom, Aquaman has become an avatar for all the middle-aged dads in the audience. He can’t have any character depth or real internal conflict, as that might alienate the audience, or worse, force viewers to confront their own. Wan also employs Waititi’s overuse of humor, needle drops and goofy aliens (or in this case, fish people) to make up for a plot both convoluted and superficial. Don’t expect any real philosophical or moral questions here. Wan is too busy filming a singing fish band. That doesn’t mean The Lost Kingdom doesn’t have its graces. The movie has some splendid production design and action setpieces, including an underwater freeway chase and a city made up of pirate ships. Wilson and Abdul-Mateen both deserve credit for going right ahead and giving performances more compelling than the movie around them. Wilson, in particular, brings so much to the Orm-Arthur relationship that it becomes the film’s most interesting subplot. Amber Heard claimed to have reduced screentime, courtesy of her legal woes with ex Johnny Depp, but she has a bigger role than costars Dolph Lundgren and Nicole Kidman. The movie doesn’t give her much to do in terms of range, but she does a fine job with what Wan asks of her. But for all the color, effects, and wild imagery, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom never finds enough originality to have an identity of its own. Much like Arthur himself, so much of the movie feels derivative. Black Manta’s volcano lair seems lifted from a Bond movie, while the surrounding island (which features giant insects and animals for some reason) looks borrowed from King Kong. Black Manta, though an interesting character, also resembles a Bond villain, right down to having a reluctant scientist (Randall Park) and a team of nameless underlings led by a femme fatale. A city of demonic merpeople might as well have carbon-copied one from Lord of the Rings, right down to the architecture and color scheme. Some of the humor—characters eating roaches and at least five urine jokes in the first reel—also induce more cringes than laughter. Kids may have fun with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’s crude humor, bright visuals, and cutaways from Momoa shouting profanity. Parents craving validation through a story that plays like something out of a Choose Your Own Adventure novel also might enjoy it. Everyone else though will likely shrug it off as the cloying cartoon it is. Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, like the rest of the DCEU, once held a lot of promise before corporate meddling, creative turnover, and reactionary decisions reduced it to a pandering mess. Since Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom allegedly marks the end to that continuity, succeeded by one overseen by James Gunn, fans should pray that Warner Bros. serves up an Aquaman that smells a bit less like fish.

"Jan 5, 2024",negative,"A film so risk-averse, it's afraid to step out of its own shadow."
"Jan 4, 2024",neutral," In theaters comes the return of the king in Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom. Jason Mamoa returns as Arthur Curry, a man of two worlds who struggles with both. His mortal enemy Black Manta has been in the shadows and searching for a way to get revenge, and now, he may just have found a new lease on power. Now an ancient evil returns, so Aquaman and his brother must begrudgingly work together to stop this new onslaught. As a review, this film is simplistic, with much of it riding on quirkiness and Mamoa's personality. Nowhere as good as the original, this one has to add extra comic relief to move boring scenes along. So for me, this film gets a C. Lastly,  we circle back to Netflix for Rebel Moon: Part 1: A Child of Fire. Zack Snyder's two-part epic that just released the first part. I have some issues with the current release, but I have very high hopes that the R-rated version will make all things right. A grade of C can become an A with another hour of footage from Snyder!"
"Jan 3, 2024",neutral," On this episode, JD and Brendan discuss the last film of the DCEU in James Wan’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, starring the great Jason Momoa! It’s been an interesting decade for DC, and while it had its ups and downs, there’s no denying that Momoa’s Arthur was one of its best traits. So, to see the DCEU go out with him was a fitting tribute."
"Jan 2, 2024",negative," How the mighty have fallen. In 2018, Aquaman was released and performed incredibly well, making over a billion dollars and providing a breath of fresh air in a year of serious comic book movies. Reshoots, on-set issues, and the fate of a studio have meant its follow up has not fared as well.  Quick history lesson – The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) started om 2013 with Man of Steel, and was meant to rival Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. For many reasons, that hasn’t been the case, and director James Gunn has taken over the DC Universe with a plan to reboot the whole thing. As such, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is the swansong of these Justice League characters, before a new set of heroes takes over. As if that wasn’t enough, co-star Amber Heard’s legal issues have drawn the wrong kind of publicity. It’s easy to forget there’s a film underneath all this controversy. We rejoin Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) struggling with the weight of being King of Atlantis, as well as the responsibilities of being a new father. When an old enemy attacks his home seeking revenge, Arthur must turn to his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), his former enemy, to save the world from destruction.The plot is strikingly similar to Marvel hit Thor Ragnarok – the hero’s kingdom is attacked, forcing him to team up with his brother. Arthur even mockingly calls Orm “Loki” at one point. The enjoyment isn’t the same however, with this adventure treading water through a combination of expensive action scenes and light comedy. It’s entertaining enough, with Momoa’s charm doing most of the heavy lifting, but there’s a familiarity to everything that means you’re never as engaged ats you should be. It’s a movie made to fill a release date, rather than set up a sequel, and so while the standalone adventure is refreshing, there’s always a sense that what we’re watching is just killing time.  Those looking for the reshoot changes won’t have to look too hard. Temuera Morrison returns as Arthur’s father Tom, and there are many heart-to-heart conversations that feel as though they were originally intended to be with Amber Heard. Her character Mera only shows up when it’s absolutely necessary, and has few if any meaningful interactions with her co-stars. Director James Wan has insisted the emphasis was always meant to be on Arthur and Orm, but it feels as though Heard’s time has been kept to a minimum.  As for those with something to do, it’s a mixed bag. Momoa has charisma to spare, and so even the most threadbare scenes benefit from his gung-ho demeanour. Wilson makes the Buddy Cop dynamic work with his co-star, while Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren return as Atlanteans helping Arthur in his quest. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is poorly served as the villain, having no elaborate speeches or character development, instead growling orders as Randall Park adds some laughs playing his unwilling assistant.  It’s a shame that the most entertaining film in the DCEU has been given such a mediocre sequel, presumably due to matters beyond the control of the creatives. Nevertheless, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is as jumbled as the universe it exists in, and a reminder of why there’s a need to start afresh. "
"Jan 1, 2024",neutral," For all its head-scratching choices, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom should probably be renamed something along the lines of Awkwardman and the Lost Opportunity — and it’s difficult to know precisely where things went awry. While not as big of a regression as the Iron Man series saw between its first and second movies, much of what made 2018’s Aquaman a fun “Thor of the sea” adventure is absent from this follow-up, a victim of poor writing, director James Wan’s Malignant-rooted cold streak, and misguided attempts to sideline maligned co-star Amber Heard. After a humorous introduction that catches us up with Atlantis king Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), his wife Mera (Heard), and their son, Arthur Jr., Lost Kingdom takes a weird leap from villainous Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park) exploring the arctic to them wielding ancient technology — from where? Great question! — and Black Manta secretly communicating with some ancient evil entity. The wonky set-up dilutes the impact of an already middling adversary, but provides an excuse for Arthur to team up with his imprisoned half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to stop this more powerful baddie. As the siblings attempt to set their differences aside, Momoa and Wilson (aided by comic-relief intelligent octopus Topo) showcase amusing odd-couple chemistry — one of the few extended stretches in which David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick’s screenplay doesn’t feels compromised by outside forces. Other than Momoa’s charismatic performance and scattered action thrills, few aspects of Lost Kingdom prove consistent, and their attempted synthesis yields plentiful friction. A good deal of the ineptitude is rooted in what appears to be a concerted effort to make Heard look bad, using takes at odds with her confident, composed turn in Aquaman, most notably an embarrassing scream of anguish when her son is in peril. But there’s also the numerous reshoots and new DC honcho James Gunn’s meddling to consider, all of which render this sequel a compromised, patched-together attempt that barely resembles its single-minded predecessor and sends the DCEU out with a whimper."
"Jan 1, 2024",positive," Summary: Black Manta seeks revenge on Aquaman for his father’s death. Wielding the Black Trident’s power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom."
"Dec 31, 2023",neutral," Ten years ago, with much fanfare, the DC Extended Universe
was born. Warner Brothers, riding the wave of success from Christopher Nolan’s Dark
Knight trilogy, decided that rather than stick with stand-alone titles
featuring their best-loved superheroes, they would instead chase Marvel by building
a “shared universe.” The resultant umbrella project was rushed and chaotic with
few standout films and a lot of duds. Justice League, rather than being
DC’s answer to The Avengers, was a colossal misstep from which the DCEU
never recovered. Now, with James Gunn preparing to reboot the entire DC canon,
the task has fallen to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom – never during
production intended to be a final chapter – to close the book on the DCEU.
Perhaps fittingly, this anticlimactic slog is what we have come to expect from
DC movies – an overlong, visually cluttered experience that’s more interested
in special effects and audio engineering than storytelling. The Aquaman
sequel feels like it was mostly constructed in post-production, with CGI
working hand-in-hand with editing to fashion something borderline-coherent. No
matter how much fan love there might be for Jason Momoa, it’s not enough to
save this production. There are essentially three major threads fighting for
screen time. The first, and most enjoyable, relates to the brotherly rivalry
between Arthur Curry (Momoa), King of Atlantis, and his deposed younger
sibling, former King Orm (Patrick Wilson). Circumstances force Arthur to break
Orm out of prison and the two engage in a white-hot love/hate relationship worthy
of a rom-com. (Momoa has about 10x more chemistry with Wilson than with Arthur’s
alleged love interest, Mera, played by either Amber Heard or her cardboard
lookalike.) Then there’s a revenge subplot, with Aquaman baddie Black
Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) determined to wipe out Arthur’s entire bloodline
using the black magic powers of his newly acquired “Black Trident.” Finally,
there’s the weaponization of Climate Change – a plot contortion that recalls Superman IV’s disastrous attempt to meld real-world geopolitical concerns with a
comic book storyline.  The film’s overcluttered CGI at least gives viewers pretty
things to look at for two hours. Rupert Gregson-Williams’ score sounds suitably
epic with discordant beats preparing viewers for big battles and ugly confrontations.
But none of this means much of anything considering how little tension even the
most extreme confrontation generates. The movie is so predictable that it’s
possible to take a bathroom break in the middle of a major fight scene and have
a more exciting time trying to get the automated soap dispenser working
properly. I stepped out for two minutes and missed absolutely nothing. This is
short attention span cinema at its most extreme.  Following the success of Aquaman, Warner Brothers
decided that the best approach was to reform the band. So, in addition to
re-signing most of the actors, director James Wan was lured back. Rumor has it
that early test screenings were disastrous. Amber Heard’s involvement became
divisive after her spousal abuse trial against Johnny Depp. The unclear future
of the DCEU, which apparently resulted in both Michael Keaton and Ben
Affleck filming scenes as Bruce Wayne (neither of which was ultimately used),
hung like the Sword of Damocles over the extensive reshoots. Like The Flash,
the movie was deemed too expensive a property to jettison, so it was released
into theaters with a wing and a prayer – not the best strategy for a
nine-figure production.  To the extent that there’s anything worthwhile to be found
in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom beyond the pretty visuals, one need look
no further than the lead actor. Momoa has an easy, unforced charisma that
shines regardless of whether he’s re-enacting a scene from Three Men and a Baby,
fighting to stay awake during an Atlantean council meeting, or trying to
keep us from dozing off as he goes on an endless search for Black Manta.  As far as the Climate Change element is concerned – this aspect
of the plot is so badly mishandled that it will thrill deniers far and wide.
Climate Change is placed on the same level of fantastical nonsense as Black
Magic Tridents and wondrous underwater cities. I’m sure that screenwriters had
the best of intentions when writing this into the story but the same can be
said of Lawrence Konner & Mark Rosenthal when they sat down at a typewriter
in 1986. What did we get out of that? Nuclear Man.  So I raise my glass to the DCEU – a decade-long cinematic
excursion that, done differently, might have left behind more than a few,
widely-scattered good memories. Some want to blame the pandemic for its failure
but this is more a case of deep structural instability exacerbated by
egomaniacal personalities and inept planning. The first Aquaman may have
been low-brow fun but the second is a chore from start to finish. Momoa, we are
told, will be back with DC in a different role. Hopefully this time he’ll have a
screenplay worthy of his larger-than-life personality. "
"Dec 30, 2023",positive," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  The “Warner Brothers in the ’80s: Enter the Blockbuster” program rolls on at The Brattle Theatre with some piquant pairings, beginning with two from the Purple One, Prince: For “Under the Cherry Moon” the pop star, wanting to take more authorship of his film projects, also directs. The black-and-white 1930s-romantic somewhat-comedy co-starring Kristin Scott Thomas laid an egg at the time of its release. You can catch the 1986 curio with the film that gave Prince the reins to the camera, “Purple Rain” (1984), on Friday. “Superman II” (1980) and Tim Burton’s game-changing “Batman” (1989) are Saturday power-ups, solo films from long before the DC heroes would square off in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” (2016). Burton stays in the show with his comedic romp about a fastidious man-boy and his bike, “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure” (1985), which is paired with the equally idiosyncratic “True Stories” (1986), about the quirky goings-on in a small Texas town. The latter was directed by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, making his directorial debut. The two play New Year’s Day. And speaking of the Heads, there’s an encore presentation of the 40th anniversary restoration of their Jonathan Demme-directed concert film “Stop Making Sense” on Sunday and Monday – a cherry that’s not part of the Warners’ program. On Tuesday it’s Joel Schumacher’s big-haired, bully boy vamps (Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric) in “The Lost Boys” (1987) paired with the film that turned Tom Cruise into Tom Cruise, “Risky Business” (1983). It features the killer Talking Heads tune “Swamp” and a riveting, driving techno score by Tangerine Dream. Not enough can be said about Rebecca De Mornay as the temptation that pulls Cruise’s meandering high school boy Joel from his coddled and dull suburban cocoon. Ramón Menéndez’s tough-love calculus lesson “Stand and Deliver” (1988) is Wednesday, with Edward James Olmos becoming Oscar nominated for his portrayal of real-life Los Angeles high school teacher Jaime Escalante. Playing the late show Wednesday is my favorite “Road Warrior” entry, eponymously labeled and also known as “Mad Max 2” (1981), in which Mel Gibson’s laconic Max tangles with The Humungous and his marauding minions over a tanker of gas in the dessert with the likes of the Feral Kid, Gyro Captain and Warrior Woman to aid him in his post-apocalyptic quest. From there The Brattle goes in on Marty, with the Martin Scorsese double bill of “After Hours” (1985) about a nerd (Griffin Dunne) caught up in late-night madness who can’t get home to safety and comfort – not too far off from “Risky Biz” – and his most celebrated mob classic, “GoodFellas.” It was released in 1990, technically not in the ’80s, but who’s going to complain? If you do, you better watch those kneecaps. Zach Snyder, the action visionary behind early creative jabs such as “Watchmen” (2009) and “300” (2006), has slid toward self-indulgence with turgid fare that only occasionally flashes cinematic flair. Take “Army of the Dead” (2021) or “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”; both are defined by big names, big budgets and pedantic narratives. Same thing here, a fusion of “John Carter” (2012) and “Jupiter Ascending” (2015) that rips whole pages from the Star Wars sagas. Still, the problem isn’t so much that there’s zero semblance of originality, but that the execution is so banal. Like with the dutifully dour Luke Skywalker, we begin on a remote planet where all is peaceful for Kora (Sofia Boutella, so mysterious and game in “Atomic Blonde,” but under a yoke here) and those in her Amish-esque farming village. Then comes a visit from the imperial forces of the tyrannical Motherworld (inspired naming, right?) looking for food and taking what they want by force. Kora, it turn out, is a former Mommyland guard; she unleashes a local uprising that boots the baddies but will surely bring more. So what’s a warrior among the sheep to do? If you’re still scratching your head, gander at the inventively illuminating title. Along her star-hopping quest to assemble that “rebel” force she encounters a griffin-breaking hunk (Staz Nair), whom I think we’re supposed to take as a displaced indigenous person, a somber swordswoman (Doona Bae, “Cloud Atlas”), the nimble, fast-talking thief (Charlie Hunnam) and gruff former rebel general (Djimon Hounsou). On their tail the whole way is the Nazi-attired (yup, pulling from the top of the stock shelf) Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, relishing the rote role with reptilian glee), tasked by the fascist Mommyland to squash the rebels. The ever-affable Sir Anthony Hopkins joins the mix as the voice of a C-3PO knockoff imaginatively named Jimmy, and there’s even the requisite bar scene at some seedy, far-flung outpost where a motley crew of crass and ready-to-rumble aliens size up strangers as they walk through the door – a scene you’ve probably never seen before (100 times). The action sequences and fight choreography do have appeal, but constantly overdo the silly slo-mo, elongate-the-moment flex. There’s also the eternal (and infernal) grunting. It drones on, and there’s a part two to come. (Tom Meek) On Netflix.

"Dec 30, 2023",negative," “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is not a good film. It’s barely even a passable superhero film, which is a shame. Along with a great number of DC Comics fans, I love Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman (he’s among the best casting decisions in the DCEU). But his charisma and amiability are thoroughly squandered here, which is probably the biggest of the film’s many disappointments. He tries his best, but even his leading man star power can’t save this mess. Seeking revenge on Aquaman (Mamoa) for his father’s death, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is back with a powerful new weapon in his arsenal: the mythic Black Trident. With it, Manta is able to unleash an ancient evil that will bring a reign of terror into the kingdom. Seeking help to defeat his enemy, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). The siblings must set aside their differences and join forces to protect Atlantis and save the world from total destruction. The plot is simple and straightforward, and highly capable director James Wan relies on CGI effects for a majority of his storytelling. There’s nothing wrong with that in theory (this IS a superhero action movie, after all), but here everything looks murky at best and goofy at worst. Most of the film (of course) takes place underwater, which limits the type and scope of the action. The biggest problem is that only about 15% of the movie delivers any type of fun, which isn’t a recipe for success. It’s not funny enough nor all that interesting, and the best parts get lost in the clutter. Once Orm arrives, the story does pick up a bit, and it’s enjoyable to watch the two fight together against Manta (who sadly is a second-rate villain). The stakes aren’t high enough and nothing made me care about what was happening on screen. Writing this review is difficult because I’m overcome with such indifference. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is a sequel that doesn’t do much to help the oft-maligned DCEU, and it’s another mediocre entry that proves superhero movie fatigue is a real thing. It’s also a shame that this sad, unremarkable goodbye to what should’ve been Mamoa’s defining character is all that’s afforded to fans. They, and Aquaman, deserved better than this."
"Dec 29, 2023",neutral," If audiences were polled on which cinematic superhero they’d like to have a beer with, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman would surely rank high. Otherwise known as Arthur Curry, he’s a burly, affable guy with the look of a domesticated Hell’s Angel, who wears a bathrobe around the house, enjoys a good hamburger and dotes on his infant son. Arthur has the swagger of a natural-born fighter but is allergic to pretension – that is, while he’s on land. Things are otherwise in his second home below the waves, where he serves as the hereditary ruler of Atlantis, a position that allows him to ride around on a giant seahorse in between sitting through boring meetings with a council of elders who tend to shoot down his better ideas. It’s not hard to imagine why this vision of a double life might resonate with director James Wan, an Australian whose record of commercial success is matched by few in Hollywood. Wan’s first Aquaman film, released five years ago, was among the more endearing recent superhero blockbusters, and like its hero managed to balance the flamboyant and the unassuming. But much as Arthur has learnt the novelty of being king wears off, a degree of creative weariness is visible in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, reportedly a farewell not just to Momoa’s Aquaman but to the entire loose-knit comic-book saga known as the DC Extended Universe (Henry Cavill’s Superman and Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman have likewise been handed their redundancy papers, despite the effective casting of all three). Is this a grand finale tying together all the DC Extended Universe’s loose threads? Not even close, although there’s plenty of full-tilt undersea action to distract us. The plot resembles one of the more fantastical Bond movies, with a scarred supervillain (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who schemes to speed up global warming as roundabout revenge for the death of his dad. Saving the day requires the help of Arthur’s embittered half-brother (Wan regular Patrick Wilson), the main antagonist in the first Aquaman. The resulting sibling squabbles supply the central emotional dynamic, with Amber Heard as Arthur’s bride Mera largely reduced to cheering from the sidelines with her in-laws, played as before by Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman. One jokey moment threatens to give the entire game away: Arthur addresses his brother as “Loki”, acknowledging the parallels with Marvel’s rival Thor franchise. There’s no denying he has a point (he could equally have compared Atlantis with Wakanda, the hidden kingdom in Marvel’s Black Panther). But the exchange raises a host of further questions, now never to be answered. Do the Marvel movies exist in the DC Extended Universe, as well as the comic books? If so, does Arthur enjoy watching them, when kicking back in his home above sea level with pretzels and a pint of Guinness? Does he view them as fantasy, or a form of social realism?"
"Dec 29, 2023",negative,I wasn’t expecting much from Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom. I got even less.
"Dec 29, 2023",positive," The movie is filled with eye candy, with digital effects in almost every scene, and there is plenty of action, leavened by the aforementioned humor. This movie is a bit of enjoyable escapism. "
"Dec 29, 2023",positive," AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM *** (124 minutes) M
In a perfectly fine, thick slice of superhero cinematic chowder Aquaman (Jason Momoa) finds himself battling the same villain he shook down in 2018’s Aquaman (the biggest film from the present DC stable, taking more than $US1.1 billion.) Crazed with vengeance, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is determined to kill Aquaman and all he holds dear, which includes his wife Mera (Amber Heard, in her first film since the Johnny Depp fiasco) and now a baby son. To defeat Manta once and for all – really? They couldn’t dream up a fresh baddie for the sequel? Try harder, Hollywood. –  Aquaman needs to team up with brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who he condemned to a horrible prison hellhole in the first film. There’s nothing much new here, to be honest. The action consists of the usual fireballs, fights and exchanges of energy bolts that come in a pleasant variety of colours (red, green, blue, white). There’s much ado about the mystery of Atlantis, the search for which embroils an inquisitive but rather weak-willed scientist (Randall Park, in a neat comic turn) into the clutches of Black Manta. The mandatory stabs at topicality involve Manta’s plan to accelerate global warming and Aquaman’s attempt to get his underwater council of conservative boneheads to see that the only way to save the world is to put away their sense of moral superiority and make peace with the surface. Again directed by Australian James Wan (SawFurious 7), the film unspools as fine, if unexceptional multiplex mulch, a good way to kill two hours and four minutes (note: the film itself actually clocks out at a relatively lean 113 minutes before the credits roll.) Though Mera is Aquaman’s wife she’s a relatively minor figure, as is Aquaman’s mum, played by a barely recognizable Nicole Kidman who shares the frame with an equally unrecognizable Dolph Lundgren. Veteran Brit John Rhys-Davies provides the voice of a large crustacean and somewhere in the mix is veteran funnyman Martin Short. Despite efforts from fans to have Heard removed from the film, including a petition with four million signatures, the heads at Warner Bros stood by her even though they ran the risk of her having a negative effect on the film. Thus far the film, which has arrived with much less fanfare than we usually get with superhero onslaughts, has taken around $108m globally, which is a little soft but nowhere near The Marvels.  Heard and her agents must be praying that nobody blames her for the under-performance. She has enough to worry about as she tries getting her career back in gear."
"Dec 29, 2023",negative," This Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom review marks the last time we will be discussing a new release from the now-defunct, DC Extended Universe. The Aquaman sequel is the final film of that shared universe that saw other amazing films like Birds Of Prey And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn, The Suicide Squad, and Zack Snyder’s Justice League. However, The Lost Kingdom does not live up to any of those, or even other lesser DCEU films. The sequel is largely a mess of new ideas, about-turns from established characters, and a storyline that genuinely made no sense whatsoever. Read on for my Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom review.  The first Aquaman film was honestly a lot of fun. Sure, there wasn’t a lot of consistency throughout, such as the tonal shift into a rom-com about halfway into the movie, but the ridiculous shenanigans were enjoyable enough. Not to mention seeing the perfect casting of Jason Momoa as Aquaman, this rebellious loner who has to save the world. There is no such redeeming thing in The Lost Kingdom.  The movie tries to do too much with not enough establishing of concepts, so audiences are trying to wrap their mind around one thing, while even more far-fetched ideas keep coming up. The Lost Kingdom deals with Arthur (Momoa) now King of Atlantis, juggling being a ruler with being a father. Seemingly not content with the politics of running a kingdom, Aquaman longs for adventure. The kind of on-the-street (ocean?) level crime fighting he is used to. But an old villain in Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) threatens to upend all of what Arthur is trying to establish, by using crazy Atlantean technology of his own. This is where things fly off the rail a little bit.  This Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom review will focus more on those tonal inconsistencies and where the story seemingly flies off the handle. The movie opens in a very John Hughes-like, Ferris Beuler-type of story with Aquaman himself narrating the recap of his life for audiences. It’s cheesy and feels very out of place in an Aquaman movie. A montage shows his everyday life as a new dad and ruler of Atlantis. But weirdly, Mera (Amber Heard), his wife and mother of his child, is completely absent. The movie also makes it seem like Aquaman is a single dad, but then Mera pops up in a scene or two here and there. It’s confusing and definitely feels like a hodge podge of multiple versions of the story edited together.  In many ways, The Lost Kingdom is emblematic of all the issues that plagued the DCEU in its 10 year-run; no plan or foresight of direction, countless studio interferences, and a failure to understand how to do a shared universe in the first place. Aquaman himself is also seemingly different. But not in a good way. The previous portrayals of the character by Momoa in the other DCEU entries were as a lovable badass, who was also a rebellious loner. Here, Momoa plays him as this goofball who is obnoxious and annoying, shrugging off any sense of somber or serious behavior. It’s a jarring shift in his depiction that is just one of the many confounding decisions highlighted in this Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom review.  Another aspect of this Aquaman sequel is how it’s billed as this buddy-comedy, seeing how Arthur has to team up with his brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson) in order to find where Black Manta is hiding. But they also end up teaming up because Orm is technically good now. I guess. It’s weird. But it also does explain the shift in Aquaman’s behavior. Seeing how the odd couple pairing sees Orm as the straight man who doesn’t know the inner workings of the surface world, it makes sense that Aquaman himself would be the goofy comic relief. It just didn’t make sense with all the other things the character had to do in the story.  The Black Manta storyline had a lot going on. So hell-bent on revenge, Manta teams up with a scientist played by Randall Park, to find more Atlantean technology to rebuild his suit so he can kill Aquaman. Along the way, he finds a Black Trident belonging to the king of the Lost Kingdom of Atlantis. He speaks to him through the Trident, giving him access to all this advanced, destructive technology, bases, ships, and weaponry. It’s like an entirely different movie and exposition crammed into just one character’s arc, which also happens to be the main threat of the story. But none of it services whatever larger story they were trying to tell.  The story also tries to do too much with whatever is happening on-screen. The initial plan seems to be setting up how Aquaman’s heart isn’t in being a King, something he will maybe learn throughout the movie. Similar to Valkyrie’s arc in Thor: Love And Thunder. But that doesn’t go anywhere, as he did exactly what he does in the first movie, go on an adventure and kick butt. The ending just sees Orm tell him he’s ready. Sure.  Then there’s this other angle of how Aquaman wants Atlantis to reveal themselves to the rest of the world, but the others don’t. Similar to T’Challa in Black Panther. It’s spoken of once and then happens in the climax, never fully developing why this is important, so the climax means noting.  There’s also how the brothers bond by going on this new adventure. Like Loki and Thor in Thor: Ragnarok. That arc of how they go from enemies to family throughout the story is also very surface-level and predictable. There are also throwaway conversations and plot points about being a father, family, climate activism, global warming and so much more that none of them are done properly.  The sequel to Aquaman ends the DCEU with such a whimper that it’s almost a blessing given how this movie ended up. None of the stakes mattered, and none of the relationships mattered. The performances are lackluster. Despite an awesome fight scene, Nicole Kidman is a waste in her role as Aquaman’s mother. Amber Heard is nonexistent. While there might be one or two moments of laugh-out-loud comedy between Wilson and Momoa’s dynamic, it’s not nearly enough to make up for everything else going on. In many ways, The Lost Kingdom is emblematic of all the issues that plagued the DCEU in its 10 year-run; no plan or foresight of direction, countless studio interferences, administrative changes, and a failure to understand how to do a shared universe in the first place.  What did you think of this last movie of the DCEU?

"Dec 29, 2023",negative," 2018’s Aquaman was a strange and surprising entry in Warner Brothers and DC’s film slate. After making the unexpected choice to cast the hulking-yet-charismatic Jason Momoa as the titular character, the film seemed to almost show up out of nowhere that Christmas season, as if we never really expected it to happen. Yet there it was, an undeniably charming — if albeit clunky and silly — explosion of bright colors and mild profanity, filled with a bizarre cast that somehow worked. Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Temuera Morrison, and a pink-haired Dolph Lundgren joined Momoa for this whacky romp that somehow worked, even when it probably shouldn’t have. Momoa followed it with a role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League (in both of its iterations), so a sequel became inevitable. What was not inevitable was the disintegration of the Snyderverse — once a grand plan for a series of interconnected, MCU-esque films, now a crumbling ruin. That universe was closed out with The Flash, one of not just the worst superhero films, but one of the worst films of 2023, full stop … and now Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. It’s an ignominious ending to that short-lived universe, to be sure. Directed by James Wan (who helmed the first film), The Lost Kingdom is another silly entry in the franchise. This time, Arthur Curry/Aquaman is now the king of Atlantis, ruling beside his queen, Mera (Amber Heard), while they also deal with life as new parents. Black Manta (Yaya Abdul-Mateen II), the secondary villain from the first film, becomes the primary antagonist this time around, empowered by an ancient technology that threatens not just Aquaman and Atlantis but the entire world. This time, Aquaman must free his imprisoned brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) and go on a quest to find Manta before it’s too late. It’s a complete mess. So many elements of the first film are simply recycled (a quest leading to a secret lair in the desert, the discovery of a mysterious island of secrets) that the newer elements (a clever take on pirate hideouts, the newfound camaraderie of the two brothers) are somewhat dulled. Yet even that aside, the film stumbles left and right, whether it’s due to its shoddy set designs that look like they were made by a community theater stage crew or its uninspired action choreography, it’s hard to tell what the main issue is. It’s unfortunate, too, because the actors are all wholly invested in this crazy collection of nonsense. Momoa was born for roles like this, and he clearly relishes the ridiculousness of it, and Abdul-Mateen II chews his villainous scenery with unbridled enthusiasm. Patrick Wilson seems like he stumbled into the set and just rolled with it, but it sort of works in his favor. Even Nicole Kidman, rocking a silver onesie, winks her way through it. There are undeniably fun parts to it. A CGI octopus named Topo gets some good gags in, and there are some clever action moments to it, even if the film suffers from that frustrating superhero movie tendency to populate themselves with hordes of faceless villains that distract from its main characters. There are some inventive elements (an island of giant mutated creatures is a fun distraction) peppered throughout the film, just enough to keep the viewer from nodding off but not necessarily enough to make the film succeed. Perhaps it’s superhero fatigue. Perhaps it’s the fact that you know that you’re watching a film that is ultimately fruitless since it’s the end of the line in a universe that has come to a screeching and unfortunate halt. But there’s something in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom that prevents the viewer from ever really being invested in it. It’s not a boring film, but rather simply an unfocused and unnecessary one. It’s fun to watch but ultimately unmemorable, filled with actors who appear to have wholly bought into a script that doesn’t quite know what to do with them. It’s a brightly colored, clumsily rendered ending of an era, a mediocre whimper that desperately wanted to be a bang. "
"Dec 28, 2023",neutral,"This Aquaman is never going to be anybody's idea of a good film, but its heart is in the right place and it never left me feeling actually irritated or bored."
"Dec 28, 2023",negative," Aunque no haya sido adrede, resulta apropiado que todos los esfuerzos de construir un universo cinematográfico para los superhéroes de DC en la pantalla grande, concluyan con un personaje voluntariamente ingiriendo una cucaracha. Esto sucede en la sección final de “Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom” y si usted considera eso un “spoiler” que le arruina la película, deme la oportunidad de advertirle que debe respirar profundo y bajar extremadamente sus expectativas de esta producción de Warner Brothers que llega a los cines de Puerto Rico esta semana."
"Dec 28, 2023",neutral, La despedida definitiva del Universo Extendido de DC (o DCEU por sus siglas en inglés) no quedará precisamente en el recuerdo. Esta megaproducción en 3D de 205 millones de dólares de costo (sin contar los cuantiosos gastos de lanzamiento) acumula varios de los vicios del género superheroico de los últimos años.
"Dec 27, 2023",positive,"…a big, fun, knowingly silly slab of studio superhero madness that anchors itself with enough emotion and characterisation to keep things on course …"
"Dec 27, 2023",negative,This is going to end up on my worst of 2023 list for sure.
"Dec 27, 2023",negative," No fue un buen año para el cine de superhéroes. Por un lado, Marvel está desorientada luego de sus diez exitosos años coronados con Avengers: Endgame (2019). La pandemia y Disney+ aligeraron los tiempos. Sus productos se precipitaron y agotaron al público. Ant-Man y la Avispa: Quantumanía (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, 2023), estrenada en febrero, fracasó en taquilla y no trajo nada nuevo. Por el lado de DC, luego del cambio de estrategia con la contratación de James Gunn, decidió dar vuelta la página. Esto fue acompañado con el dilema mediático (The Rock versus Zachary Levi) y de tickets de ¡Shazam!: La furia de los dioses (Shazam! Fury of the Gods, 2023), la despedida de Henry Cavill y la desilusión de Flash (2023). Aquaman y el reino perdido (Aquaman and the lost kingdom, 2023), el último tanque cinematográfico del año, es la decimoquinta y última película del mencionado DCEU y resulta confusa, fallida y de poca gracia. Jason Momoa toma el tridente y vuelve a ponerse en la piel de Arthur Curry/Aquaman para un largometraje que inicialmente se iba a estrenar hace un año. La producción de esta secuela recibió varios golpes (Amber Heard, la pandemia, spin-off cancelado, el retraso de Flash, la huelga de actores) y los resultados están a la vista. El carisma de Momoa, quien brilló con Rápidos y furiosos 10 (Fast X, 2023), no puede hacer nada ante un guion aburrido, previsible y de pésimos chistes. El inicio de esta continuación aparenta entusiasmar gracias a un coqueteo con La cosa: el enigma de otro mundo (The Thing, 1982) o Terror en el espacio (1965). Una premonición de personajes muertos, calcada a la de Avengers: Era de Ultrón (Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015), prepara un terreno peligroso para el superhéroe y, sin dudar, también para el espectador. James Wan se aleja de su talentosa capacidad para tensionar y se hunde en un caos que combina comedia y aventura. En la primera entrega, Momoa mostraba el torso para el suspiro de sus fans. En esta secuela, con el objetivo de marcar que el tono es más familiar, no se saca la remera en ningún instante. Esta búsqueda azucarada no le sienta bien ni al actor de Game of Thrones, ni al regreso de Patrick Wilson (La noche del demonio), ni a la participación fantasmagórica de Amber Heard, ni al exagerado Dolph Lundgren, ni al nervioso Randall Park, ni a una desdibujada Nicole Kidman. El único que sale ileso es aquel que interpreta al personaje más sobrio, aquel que no tiene sonrisas forzadas, aquel que presenta más relación con las películas de Wan. Estamos hablando de Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Watchmen), quien compone al villano de la cinta. A comparación de la película del 2018, ahora los colores son brillosos y la iluminación es más cálida, detalles que sorprenden de una obra de Wan. El hallazgo de ese reino perdido supone la búsqueda de nuevos escenarios y novedosas posibilidades para experimentar en la construcción de la flora y la fauna. Sin embargo, en sintonía a lo ya mencionado, el producto no trae nada distinto y desperdicia una oportunidad. Tanto es así que, por momentos, se la puede confundir con Jumanji: En la selva (Welcome to the jungle, 2017). La comedia insulsa de Aquaman y el reino perdido se puede resumir en un gag asqueroso con una cucaracha en donde Arthur engaña a Orm (Wilson) para que se coma al insecto. “Son como los camarones”, indica el rey mitad atlante, mitad humano. Un pase cómico que toma una relevancia ilógica en una película pensada para la conclusión de un universo en donde desfilaron figuras del tamaño de Batman, Superman o La mujer maravilla. Los efectos especiales y las escenas de lucha no desentonan, pero tampoco satisfacen: no representan un salto cualitativo de su antecesora por más de que sea luego de cinco años. Lo nuevo de DC parece auspicioso. Joker: Folie a Deux (2024), The Batman 2 (2024) y Superman: Legacy (2025) conforman un verdadero tridente para entusiasmar a todo fanático de los comics. Oscuridad, frescura y creatividad vislumbran el destino de la productora al contar con el creador de la trilogía de Guardianes de la Galaxia al frente y cerrar un rumbo que siempre estuvo perdido."
"Dec 27, 2023",neutral," En un año en el que DC no ha brillado con sus películas, Aquaman y el Reino Perdido llega como la mejor propuesta. Una película sin mucha épica, pero con mucha comedia y que no hace daño a nadie. Supone la última cinta del Universo Extendido de DC antes de que James Gunn, copresidente y codirector ejecutivo, transforme la franquicia y haga borrón y cuenta nueva en 2025. Si Aquaman era una producción más grande, la secuela se empequeñece para centrarse sobre todo en la 'buddy movie' que protagonizan los dos hermanos protagonistas, Arthur Curry y Orm -Jason Momoa y Patrick Wilson, respectivamente-. Una dinámica que funciona y que incluye gags que, dependiendo del humor de cada uno, puede funcionar. Es una parte correcta y que encaja mucho con el tono de la original. Hay un continuismo con la primera donde se mantiene la esencia tremendamente divertida y absurda, pero, con una cierta lógica formal y argumental. Uno de sus grandes puntos a favor es que no se toma en serio, sabe perfectamente que viene de los cómics y se mete de lleno en ese universo. El director James Wan ha sabido cómo encarrilarlo y lo adereza con unas escenas de acción perfectamente filmadas que destacan entre las películas de superhéroes.  Sin embargo, no es una cinta perfecta. Abusa del CGI hasta un punto en el que afecta a su estético y puede distraer al espectador. Por otro lado, los personajes no están bien desarrollados y la trama se queda floja. Hay que verla sabiendo qué tipo de producto es y aceptando que no aporta mucho al género de superhéroes."
"Dec 27, 2023",negative," En el plano comercial, el fin de semana se encuentra estelarizado por un lanzamiento específico que tiene asegurada la taquilla, más allá de lo que digan los críticos. Y es que ya sabemos lo mucho que gustan las producciones de superhéroes, más allá de que se diga ahora que estas se encuentran de capa caída. Sin embargo, en términos de prestigio y de calidad, la misma cinta tendrá que lidiar con el estreno simultáneo de varias películas que prometen figurar ampliamente en las próximas ceremonias de premios a raíz de sus méritos artísticos. A continuación, los detalles. Cinco años después de su más reciente aparición en el universo de la acción real, el Aquaman de Jason Momoa regresa a las salas de cine del mundo entero con una película que dividirá a los críticos y a los fans debido al tratamiento particularmente ligero que le brinda a las aventuras de su protagonista. “Aquaman and the Last Kingdom” es una secuela directa de “Aquaman” (2018), lo que llama la atención en vista de que, en la mayoría de los casos, las cintas individuales de superhéroes tienen a sus espaldas otras cintas en las que ha aparecido el mismo personaje, lo que obliga al espectador a estar familiarizado con una multitud de detalles que complican la apreciación del trabajo más reciente. Por ese lado, el filme actual llega no sólo libre de pesos innecesarios, sino que acentúa el carácter juguetón y superficial de su antecesor, que fue de hecho dirigido por el mismo cineasta, James Wan (“Saw”, “Furious 7”). Este tono increíblemente liviano desagradará sin duda a quienes celebran los progresos de esta clase de producciones en lo que respecta a la construcción de personajes y al desarrollo de sus historias, pero, a estas alturas, debido a la saturación de esas mismas propuestas, la idea no deja de resultar refrescante. Momentos de acción, vestuario, maniobras y más quedaron al descubierto en el detrás de cámaras de la película “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” que el actor Jason Momoa mostró en la DC FanDome 2021, .  En este caso, Arthur Curry/Aquaman, que se ha casado con Mera, la reina de la Atlántida (Amber Heard) y se ha convertido en un padre de familia, debe alternar su vida en la superficie de la Tierra con su labor como monarca del mismo dominio subacuático. Pero la llegada de un nuevo peligro representado por un viejo enemigo, David Klane/Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), lo fuerza a regresar al campo de batalla y a solicitar la ayuda de su medio hermano Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson), quien fue puesto por él mismo en prisión al final de la primera entrega. Fuera de comentarios convenientes e inofensivos sobre el cambio climático y las dinámicas familiares, el relato presente en “The Lost Kingdom” es una simple excusa para la elaboración de una película de entretenimiento descaradamente hollywoodense que cuenta con momentos divertidos, espectaculares escenas de acción y locaciones fantásticas. Eso no quiere decir que la cinta sea buena, ni que no hubiera podido ser mucho mejor con la presencia de personajes más interesantes, con situaciones más verosímiles (incluso dentro del tipo de realidad que maneja), con efectos especiales menos dependientes de la tecnología digital (hay momentos que parecen directamente extraídos de un videojuego), y, sobre todo, con alguna clase de química entre Momoa y Heard. Se sabe ahora que, debido a lo sucedido con Johnny Depp, la relación entre los dos actores no fue precisamente ideal durante el rodaje; pero nunca pensamos que eso perjudicaría tanto lo que se ve en la pantalla. Lo que sí parece bastante seguro es que no los veremos más juntos. El caso del accidente aéreo sucedido en una zona remota de los Andes a inicios de los ‘70, que generó un fiero drama de supervivencia de 72 días en el que se involucró el canibalismo y que estuvo protagonizado involuntariamente por un equipo uruguayo de rugby, no es únicamente conocido en Latinoamérica. Debido a su alto perfil internacional y a los debates morales que suscitó, el caso fue llevado a la pantalla grande por Frank Marshall en “Alive” (1993), una película estelarizada por Ethan Hawke que convenció a la audiencia y a los críticos en su momento, pero que no dejó satisfechos a los supervivientes de la vida real debido a que se encontraba evidentemente emplazada en otro territorio (se rodó en Canadá) y estuvo completamente interpretada por actores anglosajones. Las cosas lucen distintas en “La sociedad de la nieve” (“Society of the Snow”), que llega este viernes a salas selectas como preludio del lanzamiento que tendrá el próximo 4 de enero en Netflix. Esta es, además, la apuesta española para competir en la categoría de Mejor Película Internacional del Oscar, y ha sido nominada ya al apartado de Mejor Película en Lengua Extranjera de los Globos de Oro. Sucede que, en este caso, la misma historia es presentada en español, de la mano de un reparto conformado por uruguayos y argentinos y con un sentido de la autenticidad que se ve reforzado por los intentos hechos para reproducir minuciosamente el aspecto de las locaciones reales, tanto con la ayuda de tomas realizadas en el complicado entorno original como con la asistencia de sobreimposiciones digitales en los planos que fueron filmados en Sierra Nevada, España. El deseo de acercarse más a los sentimientos de los supervivientes en medio del devastador suceso se traduce en el empleo de un libro reciente que incluye testimonios de cada uno de ellos a manera de capítulos, y que se titula del mismo modo que el filme. Una de las diferencias con lo que se ha visto anteriormente es que, a diferencia del filme de Marshall, este pone a lo espiritual por encima de lo religioso. Pero la novedad mayor es la decisión tomada por el director y coguionista J.A. Bayona (“The Impossible”, “El orfanato”) para colocar como protagonista y narrador a uno de los fallecidos, Numa Turcatti (interpretado por Enzo Vogrincic Roldán), lo que le permite ofrecer una perspectiva ausente en todos los trabajos guionizados o documentales del pasado. Bayona, de origen español, es también un estupendo director que puede rodar tanto de manera brillante situaciones de desastre ocurridas en la vida real (lo había probado en “The Impossible”) como secuencias íntimas que revelan la verdadera naturaleza de sus personajes. Y en este caso, logra emocionarnos y ponernos más cerca que nunca de unos seres humanos cuya impactante experiencia parecíamos conocer al derecho y al revés. Si lo tuyo no son las mega producciones hollywoodenses volcadas al entretenimiento más simple y desprovistas de carácter propositivo, tu mejor estrategia en estos días es evitar por completo la publicitada entrega de superhéroes que se encuentra en casi todas las salas y dirigirte hacia los cines selectos que exhiben ya la delirante, desafiante y estupenda “Poor Things”. Además de ser la nueva película del gran director griego Yorgos Lanthimos, de tener amplias posibilidades de ser nominada en categorías importantes del Oscar y de haber recibido siete nominaciones para los Globos de Oro (incluyendo las que corresponden a los apartados de Mejor Película - Musical o Comedia y Mejor Actriz - Musical o Comedia), “Poor Things” cuenta con una espectacular actuación de Emma Stone, quien funge también de productora. En vista de la reputación de su creador, que mostró escenas de incesto dentro de una familia profundamente disfuncional en “Dogtooth” (2009), que expuso a sus personajes a la posibilidad de convertirse en animales salvajes si no conseguian rápidamente una pareja sentimental y sexual en “The Lobster” (2015) y que nos presentó a un adolescente trastornado que se obsesionaba con un médico en “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017), no es de extrañar que “Poor Things” siga un camino atípico y escabroso. Watson protagonizó la cinta anterior de Lanthimos, “The Favorite” (2018), un trabajo de época considerablemente medido para lo que se esperaba del realizador. En este caso, asume el rol más intenso de su carrera al entregarse a Bella, una muchacha de la época victoriana cuya extraña conducta está íntimamente relacionada con los experimentos desarrollados por su protector, el extravagante y deforme científico Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Disney nunca barajó otra opción que la de contar con Emma Stone para encarnar a la villana más extravagante y carismática de su catálogo, Cruella de Vil, en la película que repasa la vida del personaje.  Pese a estar comprometida en matrimonio con Max (Ramy Youssef), el joven e inofensivo asistente de Baxter, Bella decide emprender un largo viaje al lado del inescrupuloso abogado Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), fomentada por sus deseos incontenibles de conocer el mundo. El descubrimiento no será sólo geográfico y cultural, sino también -y sobre todo- profundamente sexual, lo que expone a Stone de manera constante -y en más de un sentido-. Pero donde la ganadora del Oscar se luce más es en el desarrollo psicológico de un personaje que, en medio de su natural confusión, resulta tremendamente divertido y felizmente extrovertido. Debido a características que preferimos no revelar para no caer en ‘spoilers’, y que resultan sin duda controvertidas, Bella se comporta con una inocencia inaudita para alguien que luce como ella. El guión, escrito por el australiano Tony McNamara (“The Favorite”) sobre la base de una novela del escocés Alasdair Gray, se esmera por evitar los juicios morales y por ponerse del lado de su protagonista, lo que le quita el carácter profundamente perturbador que han tenido otras obras del mismo autor, hasta el punto de que esto podría ser considerado legítimamente como una comedia. Esta circunstancia ha generado ya polémica en diferentes círculos, incluido el feminista, porque Bella incurre en actividades de servicio -por llamarlas de algún modo- que benefician básicamente a los hombres. Pero esto no le quita ni una pizca de poder a una cinta que se encuentra estupendamente filmada (el paso del blanco y negro al color y el ambiente surreal con que se retrata todo están plenamente justificados) y que, de todos modos, se desarrolla en una suerte de universo paralelo, pese a transcurrir supuestamente en la Europa del siglo 19. El mundo de la lucha profesional ha sido objeto de producciones cinematográficas en múltiples ocasiones, y estas incluyen la recreación de historias que tienen que ver directamente con los clanes de sangre, como sucedió recientemente en “Fighting with My Family” (2019), un drama protagonizado por Florence Pugh que se inspiraba en las experiencias reales de los Bevis, oriundos de Inglaterra. Ahora, las vivencias de los Von Erich, de Texas, llegan a la pantalla grande gracias a los esfuerzos de Sean Durkin, director de las excelentes “Martha Marcy May Marlene” (2011) y “The Nest” (2020), y de la mano de una actuación sobresaliente de Zac Efron, quien sigue siendo recordado por muchos como el ídolo adolescente de la saga de “High School Musical” (2006-2008) y otras comedias de la época, pero que ha dado muestras inequívocas de talento histriónico en títulos recientes como “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” (2019) y “Gold” (2022), donde sus atributos físicos no resultaban imprescindibles. Para tenerlo claro, la musculatura de Efron no juega sólo un rol esencial en “The Iron Claw”, sino que se encuentra más desarrollada que nunca y es aplicada a numerosas escenas de pelea, porque él mismo interpreta a Kevin Von Erich, el integrante del clan que llevó el mayor peso de la responsabilidad en la etapa más exitosa de los Von Erich. Pero el presente filme no es únicamente una recopilación de combates sobre la lona, de enemistades fuera de ella y de competitividades inevitables, sino también un drama con profundas aristas psicológicas que responde a las numerosas tragedias que afectaron a esta familia, manejada por un patriarca dominante que respondía al nombre de Fritz Von Erich (y que es brillantemente interpretado por Holt McCallany). Se trata de circunstancias que son de conocimiento público para cualquiera que se encuentre familiarizado con esta disciplina, pero que, de ser reveladas, se transformarían en ‘spoilers’ para quienes vean esta película sin estar al tanto de ellas. Sea como sea, es necesario decir que, en medio de todo el drama que observamos, Kevin mantiene la mirada más razonable y compasiva de todos los participantes, ajeno a los arranques de ego y de celos de quienes lo rodean; y, más allá de las proezas físicas, Efron logra que este aspecto de la personalidad del luchador sea completamente creíble. No basta con ser una persona decente y con tener buenas intenciones para que las cosas funcionen como deberían funcionar o para ser simplemente respetado. Y eso es algo que tiene muy en claro “The Teachers’ Lounge” (“Das Lehrerzimmer”), el excelente drama alemán que se estrena el 25 de diciembre en el Laemmle Royal y que ha sido elegido por su país de origen para representarlo en la contienda por los Premios de la Academia. La protagonista de la historia es Carla Nowak (Leonie Benesch, excelente), una joven maestra de origen polaco que empieza a trabajar en una escuela secundaria de Alemania y que tiene todas las intenciones del mundo para ser justa en su trato con los estudiantes que le corresponde formar. Sin embargo, luego de que empiezan a circular acusaciones de robo que involucran supuestamente a algunos de ellos, ella misma se ve involucrada en un caso que se la va rápidamente de las manos y que la pone entre la espada y la pared, enfrentada a un grupo de alumnos que empieza a verla con recelo y a un círculo de profesores que buscan imponer las reglas de una manera más tradicional. Filmando con un ‘ratio’ de 4:3 para enfatizar la sensación de claustrofobia que empieza a imponerse a medida que las cosas se complican, el director y guionista İlker Çatak impone inicialmente un fuerte sentido de realismo social, pero termina metiéndonos de lleno en un ‘thriller’ cuyas vibrantes cuotas de suspenso no esperábamos ver en una producción que, además de la temática que maneja, se limita a una sola locación. En un momento ya avanzado de la película, Bradley Cooper ofrece lo que resulta sin duda el esfuerzo más grande de la producción en lo que corresponde al plano expresivo mientras interpreta al legendario conductor y compositor Leonard Bernstein en medio de una presentación en vivo que lo muestra sudoroso y apasionado, y que se encuentra filmada en una sola toma. El momento es digno de verse, claro, pero no es necesariamente el más representativo de “Maestro”, una cinta dirigida, coproducida y coescrita por el mismo Cooper que se lanza este viernes en Netflix luego de haber sido brevemente exhibida en salas selectas y que tiene ya cuatro nominaciones a los Globos de Oro, incluyendo la de Mejor Película - Drama. De hecho, quienes esperen obtener detalles sobre el proceso creativo del legendario autor de la música de “West Side Story” o profundizar en sus técnicas al mando de la batuta quedarán profundamente decepcionados tras ver esto. Cualquier indicio de esperanza de un romance en la vida real entre Lady Gaga y Bradley Cooper fue rotundamente frenado por la cantante y compositora.  Donde la cinta sobresale realmente es en el desarrollo psicológico de sus personajes; y lo decimos en plural porque, aquí, Bernstein no es el único protagonista, sino que lo es también su esposa Felicia Montealegre, encomendada a la actriz británica Carey Mulligan (“Drive”, “Promising Young Woman”). Montealegre, que también era actriz, nació en Costa Rica y se crió en Chile, por lo que tenía todo el sentido del mundo que hubiera sido interpretada por una latina; pero lo cierto es que Mulligan no lo hace nada mal. Al contrario. Las frecuentes interacciones que tiene con Cooper a lo largo de la película son el aspecto más destacado de la misma, así como el que le da a ésta un sentido de autenticidad y de realismo que no se podría haber obtenido sin la existencia de un guión tan sólido, de unos actores tan dotados y de una puesta en escena tan eficiente. Bernstein y Felicia no son los únicos que hablan extensamente, por cierto; hay conversaciones que involucran a otras mujeres de la familia, como la hermana de Leonard, Shirley -que es interpretada por Sarah Silverman-, y la hija de Leonard y Felicia, Jaimie -que es interpretada por Maya Hawke-. Queda claro que Cooper buscaba retratar el lado más íntimo y doméstico del genio musical, lo que lo lleva a soslayar su participación activa en el movimiento por los derechos civiles y sus diversos intereses humanitarios. Tampoco se habla mucho de su naturaleza judía, que se expresaba de modos inusuales. “Maestro” es una obra que celebra y admira a Bernstein, por supuesto, y que le echa una mirada compasiva a los conflictos generados por la aceptación de su propia bisexualidad, pero que no busca la aprobación fácil de sus arranques de inseguridad, de sus infidelidades y de sus contradicciones, incluso cuando no hace mención verbal alguna al modo en que su uso constante del tabaco (porque, visualmente, aparece fumando en casi todas la escenas) tuvo que ver con el enfisema que acabó con su vida.

"Dec 27, 2023",negative," It’s never a good sign when the social and review embargo lifts just a day before the film opens. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” excels in its diversity casting, but fails in building believable and touching intimate moments, making this a stilted and too often awkward two-hour journey about two brothers forging connections of respect and friendship. Amber Heard haters, be forewarned: She may be just a blink-you-miss-her moment in the trailers, but she has a lot of screen time here. Aside from the lack of chemistry between Heard as Mera and Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, there the question of does the DC Extended Universe know how to use the talent they have. I’ll write more on this later. “Aquaman” was the origin story (written by Geoff Johns, Will Beall and director James Wan with screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Beall) and “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is basically a buddy road story. For a quick refresher, in the 2018 “Aquaman,” a humble lighthouse keeper in Maine, Thomas Curry (Māori actor Temuera Morrison) saves the queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman). They fall in love and have a child who they name Arthur, but Atlanna must return to Atlantis and her arranged marriage with King Orvax, the ruler of Atlantis. Atlanna leaves her advisor Nuidis Vulko to teach and train her son. As he grows up, Arthur becomes known in the surface world as the meta human, Aquaman, and excels is fighting.  Some of his fighting includes saving a Russian sub from the pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) and his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Aquaman leaves Jesse to die. Before he died, Jesse asks his son to avenge his death. To do so, David will find an ally in Atlantis: Aquaman’s brother.  Yet this isn’t what brings Aquaman to face his heritage and begin his path toward claiming the throne of Atlantis. It’s the threat to the surface world. Aquaman must fight his younger half-brother King Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson) who has united the kingdoms of the sea in war against the surface world to stop the pollution. In some murky plotting, after bearing a child to Orvax, Atlanna was sacrificed to the creatures of the Trench. Orm blames Arthur for his mother’s death. Although Mera is betrothed to Orm, she aids and even saves Aquaman as he seeks the trident of Atlantis’ first king to give him the upper hand. Along the way, Aquaman finds his mother and brings her back to Atlantis. Once Aquaman beats his brother, he exiles his brother. The film begins with a fake out that I won’t spoil, but Arthur Curry has married Mera and they’ve had a son, Arthur Jr. They live in the lighthouse with Arthur’s father Tom, but they also find time to do boring stuff in Atlantis. Being kind isn’t all adventure and brawling and beer. There’s a lot of diplomatic and bureaucratic duties that go along with being a royal, especially now that the undersea kingdoms were united after the first film. While Aquaman wants to form diplomatic ties with the surface world, the council of the kingdoms are against it.  Elsewhere, marine biologist Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park)  is exploring the Arctic, looking for evidence of Atlantis so that he will finally be taken seriously.  Yet how seriously can you take a researcher who falls in league with a master villain? Global warming has caused ancient ice to melt. Something attacks his colleague. Although David Kane/Black Manta and his team rescues Shin, they continue to explore. Underneath the Arctic ice, David discovers a black trident and when he fits it together, he has strange visions and is given meta human powers and the promise that he will be helped in his plan to destroy Aquaman, his family and Atlantis.  In this lost kingdom, ancient Atlantean machines are discovered and Shin is able to restore them, Yet the machines are powered by orichalcum which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases. The denizens of the underwater world had abandoned this technology because it caused global warming. On the surface world the extreme weather pattern changes are being reported and for the citizens of the seas the orichalcum is causing outbreaks of diseases.  To find Black Manta, Aquaman goes undercover to free his brother from his prison in the Fisherman Kingdom because he is the only underwater dweller known to have dealt with Black Manta (previous film). Once freed from his prison, Orm leads Aquaman to a pirate lair  but remember, even before he was king, Aquaman was a one-man anti-piracy force on the seas. Meeting with the crime lord Kingfish, they learn there’s a South Pacific volcanic island where David Kane is based.  On that island, the orichalcum has caused the earth flora and fauna to mutate. Aquaman and Orm must work together to find and defeat Black Manta. There are many problems with “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” First, you might be able to lose a house in a tornado or a city in the jungle, but a whole kingdom? Secondly,  you have to accept that Queen Mother Atlanna and the Queen Mera would go into battle. Then you have to accept that when the men of Atlantis go into battle they wear armor, or at least Aquaman as king always wears armor. In the previous film, you had to accept that Mera had no ladies-in-waiting and would not be burnt to a crisp in the desert sun like any other ginger and wear high-heel boots walking in the desert dunes and through ancient caves. Yet for most of the first film, Aquaman was wearing regular human clothes that somehow withstood super heroic feats. In this film, the disparity between what Atlanna and Mera wear and what Aquaman and Orm wear is more obvious.  Then there’s Dr. Shin who I thought was a marine biologist, but seems more like an anthropologist and, in this film, he has the knowledge and know-how to get ancient Atlantean technology to work.  Momoa’s characterization of Aquaman is a boisterous brawler who doesn’t feel any angst for the deaths he may have caused, including the death of Jesse Kane. That’s not a good quality in a king or superhero. In this film, he has added family to his concerns, but what about the lives lost behind that?   I remain unconvinced of the chemistry between Heard and Momoa and this film doesn’t build up the brotherly love-hate relationship well with the dialogue. Despite having a story by Jason Momoa, Thomas Pa’a Sibbett, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and director James Wan and a screenplay by Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2” and “Orphan”), the dialogue is only serviceable. What you hope for in a buddy-bonding road film, especially one where the two start out on bad terms, is witty dialogue. Rewatching the first film, I noticed how unremarkable the dialogue was and this film doesn’t offer an improvement there. What makes this film so frustrating is that Momoa has more to give than just heroic posturing as his deliciously deliriously demonic villain in the Fast & Furious franchise demonstrated earlier this year. Wilson must be able to handle comedy as well: He was nominated for Tony Awards for “The Full Monty” in 2001 and “Oklahoma!” in 2002 for the lead characters. Most of the attempts at comedy in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom”  focused on Momoa’s Aquaman’s brawling beer-guzzling persona with Wilson’s Orm the straight man. Even then, the timing seemed off, but the timing seemed off elsewhere such as the scene where Aquaman offers to help Manta, holding on a beat too long.  There’s a lot of comedic gold that went unmined such as both Wilson’s Orm and Heard’s Mera adjusting to life on the surface world and even both Heard’s Mera and Kidman’s Atlanna adjusting to life with surface dwellers. I don’t think the prank Aquaman pulls on his brother helps. The ability to use the technology of the Lost Kingdom could have also been a source of humor, but Black Manta’s troops are all so seriously efficient and unwaveringly loyal  in a way that local and potential toxic bosses and dangerous dictators could only envy.  There are some beautiful moments, especially in the Lost Kingdom that draws from both the Wan and Johnson-McGoldrick’s background in horror. The world building of Atlantis and the other kingdoms is amazing. Much thought went into this, perhaps more than into the actual dialogue and more than dialogue there would be more nuanced performances. I do appreciate the theme of brothers in conflict, but that still remained underdeveloped.  “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” will be released on 22 December 2023. If you’re going to see it, see it in IMAX or 4XD. The press screening on Wednesday was in IMAX and despite the pouring rain and thunderstorm, the rain stopped long enough for the drive to and back. “Aquaman and the lost Kingdom” is not a total loss nor is it a total win for the troubled DC Extended Universe. "
"Dec 27, 2023",negative," Lo único realmente digno de notar sobre Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (EU, 2023), el doceavo largometraje del chambón James Wan (lo mismo te dirige una cinta de terror, que una comedia de acción, que una cinta de superhéroes), es que se trata del cierre del infame DCEU, el universo cinematográfico que, como medida desesperada para competirle a Marvel, DC-Warner dejara en manos de Zack Snyder y este a su vez hiciera una porquería de películas con personajes tan importantes en la cultura popular como Batman y Superman. El resultado de ello es el que todos sabemos: económicamente un desastre (al menos comparado con la competencia) y en cuanto a la crítica, la cosa fue mucho peor: básicamente solo tres de estas cintas se salvan en la memoria -Wonder Woman, Shazam y Blue Beetle- y si acaso solo una fue realmente un hito en el género (de nuevo Wonder Woman), primera en no tratar a su heroína como un pedazo de carne y que auténticamente entusiasmó al público infantil. Luego de pandemias y huelgas, DC-Warner finalmente estrena Aquaman 2, secuela de la muy taquillera cinta original repitiendo exactamente el mismo equipo al mando: Wan dirige, Jason Momoa actúa (¡y participa en el guión!), Patrick Wilson regresa como el hermano de Aquaman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II sigue siendo el malo, Randall Park sigue siendo el patiño, y hasta Amber Heard está de vuelta, aún luego del escándalo con Johnny Depp y por el cual (dicen) mucha de su participación fuera eliminada del corte final. Uno pudiera haber pensado que al ser esta la última cinta de DCEU habrían puesto algo de empeño en al menos irse con algo de dignidad, pero no, básicamente esto se siente como una película que ya tenían hecha, que ya había que sacar y pues ni modo, el último cierra la puerta. La trama: Aquaman ya tiene un hijo con Hera, le sigue dando flojera ser rey, Black Mantha regresa más poderoso que nunca, y se supone que nadie puede detenerlo excepto Orm, el hermano de Arthur, quien se encuentra encarcelado quién sabe dónde y quién sabe por qué (esdeque me dormí bien feo en la primera película, ustedes disculpen). Total que (igual que Thor hizo con Loki), Aquaman tendrá que sacar a su hermano de la cárcel y explicarle la primera mitad de la película para que entienda qué debe hacer. El guión es una mezcla rara entre The Lost World (Spielberg, 1997), Ghostbusters 2 (Reitman, 1989) y la Saga del Señor de los Anillos. Resulta que Black Mantha (qué increíblemente pesado debe ser su traje, con esa máscara horrible enorme) encuentra un tridente negro que (como en el Señor de los Anillos) lo pone loco de poder antes que alguien pueda decir “my precious”. Y si acaso esto no fuera suficiente, resulta que el malo necesita la sangre del linaje de Aquamán para que entonces esta especie de Sauron marítimo renazca y tome el poder (¡como Viggo en Cazafantasmas 2!). Meh! El guión y la trama son meros pretextos para lo que parece interesarle al director: armar sendas escenas de acción (lo acepto, están bien filmadas) plagadas de CGI por todos lados y muchas de ellas incluso bajo el agua. El humor (que en caso de Aquamán siempre fue una marca de la casa) está presente pero no es tan efectivo, si acaso los mejores momentos de humor son los que protagonizan Wilson y Momoa en su versión de pareja dispareja. De hecho es Wilson, y no Momoa, quien se roba la película y hasta la saca un poco a flote. Y hasta aquí mi reporte Joaquín, más allá de algún chistillo y del hecho de que esto es el final, no hay nada memorable en esta película. El final no podía ser más penoso: una referencia a Iron Man, la primera del ya también en el ocaso MCU, pero que definitivamente hizo las co$as mucho mejor que DC. Habría que mencionar la única escena extra: un rolling gag donde Wilson se come una cucaracha sin hacerle gestos, como si fuera un platillo gourmet: igualito le hicimos nosotros con casi todas las películas del DCEU (sobre todo con las de Snyder). Nos dieron cucaracha cuando nosotros pedíamos cine."
"Dec 27, 2023",neutral," Color me surprised twice over. I missed the press screening of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the closing chapter of the DC Extended Universe, and ventured to a theater to check out a screening in IMAX on Christmas Day. The lobby was packed with customers, most of whom were going to see The Color Purple on its opening day. Given how much I’ve forgotten random stuff recently, I’ll go with that as the excuse for why I wasn’t expecting so many people to be watching movies on December 25th. That was surprise number one. Surprise number two, Warner Bros. Pictures’ Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom wasn’t a complete disaster. Sure, it’s not going to earn a spot in the Top 10 (out of 15) DCEU films. But it wasn’t the catastrophic failure that needed to be hidden away by the studio the way some had suggested. If this is the last time we see Jason Momoa’s long, flowing locks drifting around his head in all their CG glory, then at least it can be said Momoa went out giving it his all. No matter the wonky dialogue and despite the recycled feel of the plot, Momoa entertained. 2023’s sequel to the 2018 solo Aquaman film returns Momoa to the undersea world as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, the current King of Atlantis. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II returns as Aquaman’s nemesis, David Kane/Black Manta – the big bad of The Lost Kingdom. The sequel also brings back Patrick Wilson as Orm, Arthur’s jealous, brooding half-brother. Orm still holds a grudge, believing himself the better and more deserving of the two siblings. If Arthur is the DCEU’s Thor, then Orm is its Loki – without the twisted sense of humor, wit, or cleverness. Scratch that, Orm’s not Loki-ish at all, but Momoa’s take on Aquaman is still reminiscent of Chris Hemsworth’s version of Thor. Moving along… The sequel spends a good deal of time on Arthur’s family life. He’s a proud papa, and his dad, Tom (Temuera Morrison), dotes on his first grandchild. Mera (Amber Heard) pops in now and again, mostly to save her hubby, dispense advice, or help take care of Arthur Junior. Nicole Kidman also puts in sporadic appearances to try and get her boys to stop bickering, and to divulge key details on the political life of Atlanteans. Looking for exposition? Kidman’s Atlanna’s full of it. What Arthur doesn’t know about running the undersea world and negotiating with the council could fill volumes. He’d flounder if his mom weren’t there to get him out of fishy situations. While Black Manta is a worthy adversary, in this outing David’s gone full-on crazy after discovering the ruler of the Lost Kingdom’s black trident. Kordax (Pilou Asbaek) gets into David’s head, making promises about how powerful David will become if the Lost Kingdom is returned to its evil glory. But to do so, David will need to cause havoc above ground by heating the planet, and he’ll need to kidnap and kill Junior. Only the King of Atlantis’ DNA can break the curse that holds Kordax captive in a frozen state, and Black Manta stands a better chance at capturing a baby than he does at incapacitating Aquaman – even though Black Manta’s primary motivation from the film’s opening minutes is to kill Aquaman. The story is simple yet manages to get all tangled up in the minutia, what with the world of the Lost Kingdom, the destruction of the environment, and the political shenanigans going on in the undersea universe. The cherry on top of this massive plot ball is the relationship between Arthur and Orm. The dysfunctional relationship between Arthur and Orm is Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’s beating heart. Their love-hate relationship powers the film, and nothing else comes close to having the same impact. Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson are an entertaining duo and have much better onscreen chemistry than Momoa and Amber Heard, who is hardly heard from in this sequel. Arthur’s the cut-up, the class clown, the big man on campus who everyone loves. Orm’s the straight man, playing the part of the reluctant foil in this superhero duo. Together, they make a formidable team and help overcome some of the film’s narrative missteps. As for the action, it doesn’t seem to have progressed much from the first Aquaman. It’s only when the sequel reaches the final battle that the action feels as if there’s anything at stake. Everything leading up to that is so over-the-top and CG-heavy that there’s no sense of urgency or emotional investment in the fight sequences. 2023’s been a crummy year for the DCEU, with problematic stars headlining two of their releases – Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash – which contributed to their disappointing box office performances. Blue Beetle deserved to have drawn in a larger audience, but strikes, the lack of major star power, and a central character that’s unknown to those who aren’t into comics hurt its chances at success. At $128 million worldwide, Blue Beetle has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing film in the DCEU. Put a fork in the DCEU, it’s done after 15 films. And, sadly, despite Jason Momoa’s efforts, the DCEU’s going out with a splat rather than a bang! pow! KABOOM!"
"Dec 27, 2023",negative,"The movie’s silly screenplay simply cannot play to Momoa’s strengths, as either a cracker of quality gags, or a kicker of bad-guy butts."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive," 10 years on, and the DC Extended Universe has come to an end. Starting as we meant to go on with Zack Snyder’s Man Of Steel, we did not exactly go on that way at all. Through it all we have had Snyderverse’s, directorial fracas, reshoots, controversy, barnstorming success, hierarchical change, reshaping, re-evaluations, bold decisions, project shelving, incredible moments, and catastrophic failure. Through the good, the bad, and the mad, no doubt about it, this has been a ride, and this long-delayed sequel to the DCEU’s highest grossing film, in 2018’s Aquaman, is a film that is a strange way to end but also, in many ways, a perfect one. Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is set several years on, as Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) sits as King of Atlantis but also fights as the watery hero Aquaman! It’s a tough balance to maintain, especially as he is also a father now. But the stability of the world is about to be thrown into abject chaos, as the vengeful David Kane (aka Black Manta) (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is desperately seeking vengeance and to attain it will go to any length, as he discovers and unleashes an ancient dark power that threatens to burn the earth to the ground. For better – and (in many minds we are sure) for worse – this is a pure-blooded Aquaman movie through and through, leaning into the craziest facets of this long mocked watery world and hero. The last movie felt loyal to that comic book world, but with this follow-up, director James Wan even further embraces it all to simply ridiculous but fun extent. Affectionately hugging horror (nods range from Tremors to Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and B-Movie madness on a grand spectacle-heavy scale. Delivering something akin to Flash Gordon by way of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Journey to the Centre of the Earth, with Star Wars, James Bond and The Lord of the Rings sprinklings. If that sounds like everything thrown at the screen, well, that is because it bloody well is. Not everything works, a final act showdown is all too easily resolved, certain things are a little messy and some tones don’t swim together too smoothly, but this funny, warm and weird ride is appropriately controversial, divisive and interesting. And, in the most bizarre of ways, is a bigger aiming movie sequel wholly appropriate for this character and this franchise. Jason Momoa’s cool and heartfelt hero and Patrick Wilson’s endearingly self-serious antihero half-brother Orm are this story’s sturdy brotherly anchor at core, with a knockabout chemistry that feels lovable in its own barmy way, while the visually engaging and wild adventure yarn that surrounds the film’s family-focused spirit keeps on going with creative creature designs, wacky lore and even a fishy cabarets that would make Jabba The Hutt ho ho ho in joy.  The film even takes a stab at a few more environmental themes amidst its rapid waves of deep sea battles and hero vs. hate-consumed villain clash. To that latter point, what a particular joy it was to see a superhero film actually have a baddie that they allow to cross lines and be scary without wimping out at the very end with a hand holding hallmark redemption. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II’s terrific Black Manta is certainly an ace in the deck of the movie, who dominates some of the film’s best action sequences, among a cast of some rather weighty names! The first film may well be superior and more tightly put together but this one is certainly worth the ticket this Christmas, delivering precisely the kind of seahorse riding, Octopus-befriending, big screen trident-swirling mayhem you expect, with a lot crammed into every moment of the surprisingly not-too-long duration.  Imperfect of course but lord knows it is engagingly off the (sea)wall stuff, with a Vernian otherworldly edge and a barrage of big screen barminess that just goes for broke, no matter the costs. Which is admirable, if not maybe sensible but as Aquaman himself says early on, “You say everybody’s good at something. Me? I talk to fish…Some people think that makes me a joke. But I don’t care.” Fair play. Opening with Storm the seahorse in an actual storm, and ending with a literal (and figurative) mic drop, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom refreshingly gives zero F’s and just is what it is, making it a perfect send-off for the DCEU."
"Dec 27, 2023",positive," The film was plagued by what seems to be a curse from the get-go, with tales of re-shoots circulating during its production. Then there was the lawsuit involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard – who plays Mera, Aquaman’s wife – and then the reaction of fans when Heard barely appeared in the trailer for the movie, and very little in the movie itself. He once again takes on Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,) who now has possession of a Black Trident that could leave the world in ruins. Black Manta has taken on scientist Stephen Shin (Randall Park) as an assistant. Seeking help, Aquaman decides he must contact his estranged half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson,) the former king of Atlantis, who is being tortured in a dungeon. Mostly, this is an extravaganza of overblown CGI, evident in nearly every frame. I did watch the film at Cinemark in D-Box (the seat moves you along with the action) and that made for a couple of exciting moments. Still, this is a fizzler of a finale for this DC brand. It’s not a horrible movie, but compared to the first “Aquaman” and other worthy DC fare, It reaches only C-level at best. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Dec 26, 2023",positive," En su salto a la pantalla grande, Aquaman ha batallado por conectar con el público. Por lo general, siempre se dicen dos cosas sobre el personaje: que sus poderes son sosos y aburridos, o que la personalidad que le da Jason Momoa a su interpretación del héroe dista mucho de la de su contraparte afable en los cómics. A pesar de esto, su primera cinta en solitario se convirtió en la más exitosa del universo extendido de DC. No es difícil entender por qué, en medio del escepticismo levantado por el rey de Atlantis, muchas personas voltearon a ver el proyecto que le cedía los reflectores. En aquella película de 2018, lo importante era entregar una genuina sensación de asombro. La buena noticia es que esta preocupación sigue presente en la película Aquaman 2: El reino perdido, secuela en la que la autoconsciencia lo es todo. Arthur Curry no era un buen personaje cuando, como consecuencia de las obsesiones creativas de Zack Snyder, se le retrataba como un borracho atormentado y alejado de la sociedad, que sólo aparecía en regiones nórdicas para ser venerado como a una deidad. En el esfuerzo por darle “realismo”, se diluía el gran potencial que tenía el súper creado por Mort Weisinger y Paul Norris en la década de los 40. Por suerte, James Wan tomó las riendas del arco narrativo del hombre acuático, cambiando las reglas que ya se habían establecido y llevando al protagonista a un nivel más adecuado para el universo en el que se desenvuelve. Para esta segunda parte, Wan –quien no teme exagerarlo todo cuando es necesario– continúa explorando la vida de Arthur en el mismo tono que volvió tan distintiva a la primera entrega. Si hace cinco años atestiguamos una shakesperiana y tóxica relación entre hermanos, y el accidentado acenso al trono de un rey que no sabía que era rey, lógicamente la siguiente movida era poner a esos dos hermanos en una aventura trotamundos en la que el villano arma un plan para hacerse con una gran cantidad de poderosas sustancias atlantianas que son capaces de acelerar el calentamiento global, todo esto para vengarse del protagonista, quien mató a su padre. ¡Ah, claro! Además de todo este conflicto, no podían faltar los tintes de creature feature con monstruos gigantes y ciencia ficción de la vieja escuela. A sabiendas de que últimamente existe un gran debate sobre cuándo y cómo utilizar el término camp –que alude a cuando varios elementos de una producción, como las actuaciones, los diálogos y los vestuarios, son empleados de forma estrafalaria–, hay que decir que, para este filme, aplica a la perfección. Sí, el guion de David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick a ratos quiere ser serio y darle a todo cierto peso dramático, razón de que se inserte una torpe subtrama en la que el estelar tiene un hijo que, más adelante, tendrá que proteger de fuerzas malignas. Sin embargo, el escritor no puede evitar sucumbir ante la diversión que supone estructurar un blockbuster basado en una comunidad de personas que controlan el agua y hablan con peces y montan caballos de mar. Para cuando a la mitad de la película Aquaman 2: El reino perdido se empieza a hablar de la existencia de magia negra en uno de los 7 mares –el que da el título–, ya estamos dentro, no hay vuelta atrás. Con todo y que la edición, a cargo de Kirk M. Morri, se siente dispareja y apresurada. Es evidente que muchas escenas no quedaron en el corte final. Y viene la gran pregunta: ¿es un cierre potente para 10 años de la primera iteración del universo de DC en cines? Ni de lejos. Pero un conjunto que, en pleno 2023, se atreve a intentar replicar el espíritu de las producciones de Dino DeLaurentis, Roger Corman y, hasta cierto punto, George Lucas, es bienvenido. Es una inofensiva oda a la unidad familiar y de comunidad que, además, tiene mundos donde hay batallas con láseres, colores neón y una electrizante banda sonora compuesta por Rupert Gregson-Williams, que combina piezas orquestales con música de sintetizador. Ya no se hacen muchas cintas así. Que vengan más. No hacen daño.

"Dec 26, 2023",neutral," After all the reshooting, rebooting, and release date rejiggering, right as 2023 comes to a close,  James Wan’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is finally out. The behind-the-scenes story of the movie has been full of intrigue. Stuff had to be reshot to put Ben Affleck in it, then reshot to take him out. The high-profile Amber Heard trial means she probably had several scenes cut. The movie moved from release date to release date. In the midst of all this, a company-wide relaunch means Aquaman 2 is the  unplanned ending to the entire DCEU. With all of that, you’d hope the movie was a trainwreck, or better yet, a triumph. It’s neither. It’s a very odd place in which I find myself when it comes to this review. As with most films I review, I try to approach the movie on its own merits first and foremost. Then, if applicable, I think about the greater place in its respective franchise or cinematic universe. With Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I can’t help but think about it in terms of the strange, uneven, and ultimately failed endeavor that was the DC Extended Universe. For every unexpected success—Wonder Woman and the first Aquaman—we had a bevy of bloated, po-faced attempts to ape the Marvel model. It was a cinematic universe without a clear vision, ethos, tone, or level of quality.  Aquaman made an ungodly amount of money in 2018, which surprised literally everyone. Jason Momoa’s charisma, the vibrant Atlantean vistas, and James Wan’s innovative and frenetic action sequences all worked in its favor. I will say this for both that movie and its sequel: they remain gleefully unrelated to the other DCEU movies. Sure, Arthur Curry appears in other DCEU products, but none of that infiltrates his story.  This movie finds Arthur and Mera (Heard) married and with a newborn baby. He’s finding the business of ruling Atlantis not everything it’s cracked up to be. He spends most (or all) of his evenings drinking beer at his dad (Temuera Morrison)’s lighthouse. Unfortunately, David Kane, a.k.a. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) still wants revenge from what happened in the first movie. To that end, he has found a mystical black trident which gives him terrible powers. It also affords him knowledge of where to find a long-buried fuel source. That ore causes the Earth to overheat, ruining the surface environment and poisoning the underwater inhabitants. If he succeeds, it’ll free a dormant army of the dead. It’s bad, is what I’m saying. In order to fight Manta, Arthur will need the help of his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who has been imprisoned since the events of the first movie. Can the unlikely family put aside their differences for the good of the planet? Oh, also Randall Park is here as a scientist under Manta’s employ who very quickly decides he doesn’t want to be involved but can’t leave. Park’s Dr. Shin gets a whole lot of screentime, more even than Black Manta, and certainly more than either Mera or Nicole Kidman’s Atlanna. The biggest issue with the movie is you can see all the fingers in the pot. Arthur has a baby, but the baby only matters for the plot. Most of the theming of the first movie—family, duty, romance—take a backseat to lofty environmental messaging, which itself feels pretty tacked on. Mera as a character only exists to get Arthur out of trouble at the last second. The Orm-Arthur relationship is the most fleshed out in the movie, but it isn’t set up at all in the early part of the movie. And Manta is a half-note villain who doesn’t even get to be his own person because a ghost monster has him in a thrall.  Who knows how much the actual plot changed during the many years of production and post-production? As with way too many of these movies, even if you hadn’t heard of all the studio issues, you’d be able to tell something was off. I didn’t love the first Aquaman movie but at least it felt of a piece with itself. All of Momoa’s frat-dude charm here feels oddly out of step with the rest of the movie, but the movie doesn’t even comment on it. He doesn’t succeed or fail because of that, he doesn’t grow or change. And because nothing really resonates, the humor doesn’t feel earned.  Ultimately, who cares? I don’t want to keep kicking this movie, or this franchise, when it’s down. Wan, Momoa, and the rest of the crew have been put in a truly unenviable position. Most of us know this is the end of the franchise, there will be no more Momoa as Aquaman. (Caveat: unless this movie somehow makes bank the way the first one did.) This isn’t the worst movie in the franchise by a longshot. It’s not even the worst DCEU movie to come out this calendar year. It’s simply the last one.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the most rare of movies: a franchise entry released with no hope of furthering a franchise. DC movies need a clean break, and it just stinks for everyone involved they announced the clean break with four more movies on the horizon. It’s enjoyable enough, it has a few decent action sequences. If you want more Aquaman, go see it. At least it has a CGI seahorse. Kyle Anderson is the Senior Editor for Nerdist.

"Dec 26, 2023",positive,Aquaman 2 will appeal to a younger crowd and those just looking for a fun action flick. No one should be going into this with the assumption it's high-art. 
"Dec 26, 2023",negative," Here it is, the last gasp of the DC Extended Universe. Five years after “Aquaman” seemed to signal a big turn in fortunes for Marvel’s competitor, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” is actually closing off its era. What a difference a few years make. James Wan is back in the director’s chair and it must be said that while this is a bloated, rather clunky ride, Wan does manage to add his style in a way that stands out. DC movies have always tried to overcompensate by letting the effects do all the talking. “The Lost Kingdom” doesn’t feel as grand as its predecessor but you can still give the effects team some respect. This movie still feels like a great white shark that Wan just couldn’t control. So it’s been a few years since the events of the last movie and Arthur aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is now king of the underwater civilization of Atlantis. As he tells us over the opening narration, being king is not that easy and comes with many boring bureaucratic hassles. Aquaman is also now a dad with wife Mera (Amber Heard). They don’t live in some oceanic palace but at the pleasant lighthouse cottage belonging to Arthur’s dad, Tom (Temuera Morrison). Out in the seven seas, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) has hired a scientist obsessed with Atlantis, Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), to help him on a quest for revenge against Aquaman. You may recall Black Manta’s father died fighting the aquatic royal at the beginning of the first movie. Just his luck, Black Manta comes across a dark trident holding a menacing power linked to a lost kingdom. This force takes over the vengeful pirate and gives him the power to threaten Atlantis and the whole world. In a telling sign of the DCEU’s fate, 2018’s “Aquaman” remains the studio’s top grossing film, meaning it’s the only one to cross $1 billion. “The Lost Kingdom” is meant to be the final entry before James Gunn revamps the whole universe with his upcoming Superman movie. The results of the reported reshoots and story tinkering are evident in how there’s no link made here to the other DC titles. Expect no cameos from Wonder Woman, the Flash or Batman. The first movie was a clear attempt at catching up to Marvel’s brand of mythic filmmaking where comic book goofiness combines with slick spectacle. Ironically enough, “The Lost Kingdom” has much in common with the MCU’s recent flop, “The Marvels.” Like that movie, this one returns to an even shallower bullet point kind of superhero movie.  It’s always surprising when a popcorn entertainment like this one required three writers, only because the plot aims for nothing higher than a basic costumed romp. “Aquaman” wasn’t necessarily brilliant, but it gave space for some genuine charm and moments of geeky melodrama. Wan, no doubt under pressure to put posteriors in IMAX seats, this time goes for purely mindless action. The crammed plot charges along with predictable detours. When Aquaman discovers Black Manta has returned, he goes on a clandestine mission to a desert prison to liberate his brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), his adversary from the first movie. They are siblings after all, and learn to work together by running through a mutating jungle (where Orm learns the delicacy of eating roaches) and later, blowing up stuff underwater very well. Their best scene involves meeting a slimy undersea gangster, Kingfish (Martin Short). Comic characters like this are too rare in the movie. Another one is an octopus, Topo, who only pops in for one sequence as a skilled agent sent to give Aquaman some backup. Topo, who first appeared in the Aquaman comics in 1956, has the potential to be very likable but disappears. There’s also hype that it plays multiple instruments, which we never see. Most of the cast feel like glorified cameos. Tabloids have been anticipating how Amber Heard would be featured following the scandalous public trial involving ex-husband Johnny Depp. There’s certainly nothing scandalous here. Heard, along with Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna (who surely returned solely for the paycheck) does nothing more than ride CGI beasts, throw a few punches, yell a few commands, control some swirling water and barely talk. Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus gets less lines than the crab king who joins the heroes to fight off the big threat at the end. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, a very good actor, is reduced to shouting lots of cliché lines about getting revenge, with a psychotic look reminding us his character is possessed by the spirit of the dark trident. Randall Park shines a bit more as the pitiful scientist forced to do Black Manta’s bidding before begging Aquaman and Orm to show some mercy. As for Momoa, there’s much else he can do here other than continue the bad boy as king persona, popping open a Guinness and cracking bad jokes. James Wan has always been a visually lively director. His roots are in horror and the DCEU surely wanted him because of “The Conjuring,” which set off another big franchise. “The Lost Kingdom” lacks the pop art majesty of “Aquaman,” but in 3D it still has a few moments of genuine fun when Momoa has to speed through threats to save someone. We also get a wider sense of life in Atlantis during battles that crash through the kingdom’s markets and restaurants. There remain sequences where the skill of the animators is admirable, from the detail in an action scene to quirky underwater nightclub singers. Yet, Wan never lets loose because he has to follow the recycled plot’s beats. Everyone congregates at yet another ominous lair where they must battle the real, even bigger foe controlling Manta, who is connected to some Atlantean, “Lord of the Rings” style history. It’s a lot of set-up for Aquaman to then just lunge his trident and turning the villain into digital pixels.  Moviegoers attending out of simple curiosity will at least not be treated to another superhero movie where you needed to watch the previous dozen to comprehend what’s happening. Wan closes the movie with some scenes of genuine cheer as Aquaman addresses the UN, introducing Atlantis to the surface world and Orm discovers the spell of a cheeseburger. But unlike its predecessors, don’t hold your breath, Wan has no surprises left. “The Lost Kingdom” truly marks the end of a defining phase for the DCEU. Now the studio will go back to the drawing board. For once, the big superhero factories, Marvel and DC, find themselves on equal footing. They both need to re-strategize and reboot their big galaxies. It may not quite be the end, but “The Lost Kingdom” confirms the format is lost at sea and needs to find new shores."

The No Prize is an award Marvel used 40 00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:58,448 to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on 41 00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:03,010 Instagram and in our email newsletter for the person that we feel gave the best answer to 42 00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,092 our question of the week. Last week we asked, what has been your most favorite Marvel or 43 00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:14,095 DC related gift that you've received for the holidays? And either it wasn't a great question 44 00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:19,577 or a lot of people have not received DC or Marvel related gifts because we only got one answer. 45 00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:25,440 So The winner of this week's snow prize is Miggy Mattingian, who said, Hey, what's up, guys? 46 00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,704 Miggy and my favorite DC holiday gift that I received was a Star Labs hoodie. I think you 47 00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:36,766 mentioned in a patron, like bonus episode or maybe on the Discord server that you kind of 48 00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:41,649 missed it when superhero merch was kind of like secret language between fans. And I kind of 49 00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,511 felt that with this hoodie, because only like fans of the show, people who had seen the show 50 00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:50,706 would get the reference and compliment me for it. So, yeah, thanks, guys. Yeah, of course, 51 00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:57,448 Star Labs featured heavily in the Flash television series, of which Miggy was a huge fan. The 52 00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:01,869 Flash is one of his favorite characters as well. And yeah, I've actually seen that hoodie. It's 53 00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,051 a pretty cool hoodie. I like the logo that they came up with for Star Labs in that show. I 54 00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:11,993 would want to own that hoodie. It's a dope gift. Yeah, when it comes to superhero merch, I do 55 00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:17,582 like the type of stuff that's... more inside baseball, you know, like it's not outwardly 56 00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:23,324 like a Spider-Man logo or something like that, but it might be like Oz Corp, the Daily Bugle 57 00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:27,166 or something like that. That's how you separate the true fans from, you know, the people who 58 00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:31,767 just know who Spider-Man is. Right, exactly. It's like the deeper the cut, the bigger the 59 00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:35,408 fan. And I feel like Star Labs is a pretty deep cut. You know, there's probably a lot of people 60 00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,849 out there that see Miggy wearing this hoodie and think that he's a scientist or something. 61 00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:44,504 Which I think is hilarious, which also works, you know, as double purpose. Yep. But congrats, 62 00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,866 Mickey, for winning this week's no prize. If you're the listener, want a shot at winning 63 00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:52,769 your own no prize. Stay tuned to later on in this episode, we'll be asking another question 64 00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,671 of the week. And as our schedule gets more regular outside of the holidays, hopefully we'll get 65 00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,733 more of you guys to answer. And now that that's done, onto the news. 66 00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:13,179 Alright, this past week we learned that Jonathan Majors has been fired by Marvel from his role 67 00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,665 as Kang the Conqueror, which is huge news considering that the entire multiversal saga for the MCU 68 00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:27,691 was basically surrounding his character and all the variants of Kang. So it's really unclear 69 00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:32,155 what's going to happen from this point on. It's hard to know how to feel about this news because 70 00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:36,778 on one hand, you know, as a fan of Marvel movies... You don't want to see any sort of break in 71 00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:41,921 continuity, whether or not Marvel recasts the role or they choose to go with a different 72 00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:47,763 villain as the main antagonist of this multiversal saga. On the other hand, Majors was found guilty 73 00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:53,146 of two of the counts charged against him, including harassment and assault. He was found not guilty 74 00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:58,028 on two other counts, but these charges were enough to basically force Marvel's hand to 75 00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:03,911 avoid any bad press that might come their way by working with... a convicted criminal essentially. 76 00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:08,655 It's unlikely that Jonathan Majors will face any actual jail time for this, but his career 77 00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:14,580 is definitely severely damaged. Yeah, this is actually kind of surprising news to me. I mean, 78 00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,003 I could have seen Disney go either way with this. I thought that because he was acquitted 79 00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:24,868 of the major charges, that they would probably just try and keep him on board and ignore what 80 00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:30,833 had happened. But I guess Disney is in such a rough place culturally and politically right 81 00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:36,599 now. that they really just didn't want to run the risk of more bad press as it were. Yeah, 82 00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,320 I mean, they're not DC. They're not going to keep Ezra Miller around if he was working for 83 00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,382 them, you know? Was Ezra Miller convicted? I don't know. All I know is that dude's crazy. 84 00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:52,223 Oh yeah, he pled guilty to a misdemeanor. But again, I mean, Jonathan Majors also got two 85 00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,465 misdemeanors. So they're misdemeanors. They're not felonies. You know, they could still vote. 86 00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:02,744 But they can't play king. The next time we were supposed to see King of the Conqueror was going 87 00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:08,388 to be in the next Avengers movie, which was gonna be called The King Dynasty. That movie 88 00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:14,193 has since been retitled to just Avengers 5. It's unclear what Marvel is going to choose 89 00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:21,640 to do with the character. I say recast. I mean, so many Marvel roles have been recast. I don't 90 00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,384 understand why I see so many people online saying just do away completely with the character. 91 00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:31,623 I think a lot of that has to do with just the dislike of the general direction for the MCU 92 00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:37,808 currently, but I kind of feel like to correct that you need a character like Kang. Yeah, 93 00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:43,932 I mean you have a point there, but I just think it would be bad optics for another actor. I 94 00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:47,574 don't think you'd be able to find another actor who would want to replace Jonathan Majors in 95 00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:52,818 the role, considering that this whole thing is fairly controversial. You know, it's hard 96 00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:59,230 for I think another actor to appear like they're taking advantage of someone I don't believe 97 00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,731 that. I think if you spin it in a way where it's like, hey, Jonathan Majors did something 98 00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,712 wrong, not Kenny the Conqueror, who's still a really cool character, and now this actor 99 00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:13,614 is going to play that really cool character. I mean, it's not like DC is going to have a 100 00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,795 hard time recasting the Flash. It's not like an actor is not going to want to play the Flash 101 00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:22,856 because of Ezra Miller. I don't get that connection. Well, I mean, that role is probably going to 102 00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:30,791 be recast anyway, since DC is going into a new universe. I don't know. It's hard to say. If 103 00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:35,373 Marvel decided to not recast and instead focus on a new villain, the only other villain I 104 00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:40,236 could think that they could use for this multiversal saga would be Doctor Doom, because he is the 105 00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:45,359 one that patched together Battleworld in the 2015 Secret Invasion. I guess you could also 106 00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:50,161 go with the Beyonder, since the Beyonder was the villain of the original Secret Wars story. 107 00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:56,225 It's just like a lot of story to scrap. Like I guess you could make the argument that Loki 108 00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:03,072 acting as the new Loom. that he resets the timeline and maybe like erases all version of Kang, 109 00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:08,980 I find that hard to believe. I just don't think you could scrap everything. Fair enough. So 110 00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,884 I guess with that in mind, that brings us to our question of the week. 111 00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:22,931 Which actor would you choose to recast Kang in the MCU, and why? Yeah, I'm sure any new 112 00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:28,577 actor that comes into that role, if they do recast, would be rationalized as simply a variant 113 00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:33,901 of the Kang character. So, at least it would be an easy explanation.

Be sure to answer before December 30th. In DC News, we learned 119 00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:03,815 that Matt Reeves' Batman Arkham series that's in development will be set in James Gunn's 120 00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:09,577 and Peter Safran's DC universe. Of course, the Arkham series was originally going to focus 121 00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:14,766 on the Gotham City Police Department. But I guess Warner Brothers scrapped the idea and 122 00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:19,728 Matt Reeves pitched an Arkham series instead, which James Gunn and Peter Safran greenlit. 123 00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:25,149 According to Gunn on social media, the Arkham series was always planned to be set in the 124 00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:30,571 DCU and not part of any else world's universe that Matt Reeves is working on. This is huge 125 00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:36,152 news because we initially believed that Matt Reeves was establishing a series set within 126 00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:43,151 his Batman universe which stars Robert Pattinson. Apparently, he will be developing Batman characters 127 00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:49,135 for two different universes, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. It is strange considering 128 00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:54,698 like the Penguin show that's coming out next year is not going to be in the DCU, but that's 129 00:11:54,718 --> 00:12:00,121 spearheaded by Matt Reeves, who's also spearheading this DCU Batman project. Right, exactly. So 130 00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,583 essentially, he's going to be coming up with like two different versions of the Riddler, 131 00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:08,979 two different versions of the Joker and the Penguin and everything else. I was really hoping 132 00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,724 when I first heard this news that this may be James Gunn's way of just really trying to get 133 00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:22,111 Matt Reeves' Batman into the DCU. And that still may be the case because maybe Matt Reeves won't 134 00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:26,555 like having to develop two different versions of these Batman characters. But I guess we'll 135 00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:32,540 see. It could be fun considering that Matt Reeves' Batman movie takes place in a much more grounded 136 00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,664 reality of DC. So he works on these hyper realistic versions as well as these more comic accurate 137 00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:43,326 versions which I assume the DCU is going to be a little bit more comic accurate and fantastical 138 00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:49,190 and not so grounded in reality. It sounds like a fun challenge honestly. It sounds confusing 139 00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,292 because like how many different jokers are there going to be now? I mean I guess that was inevitable 140 00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:59,655 if James Gunn was going to develop his own version regardless but the fact that it's Matt Reeves 141 00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:04,674 doing versions for both universes just really kind of bothers me. I don't understand why 142 00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:10,995 James Gunn would give Matt Reeves that much say over a fairly integral part of the Batman 143 00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:15,837 character, his rogues as it were, when Matt Reeves is already doing his own thing. Like 144 00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:22,699 does that make sense to you? No, but nothing DC does ever make sense to me, so. Okay. I'm 145 00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:27,640 not surprised. They just make a lot of weird decisions, you know? It's weird. Again, I'm 146 00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,286 hoping this is some sort of brilliant manipulation on behalf of James Gunn to get Maybe I should 147 00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:38,209 be working in this new universe because it's so cool and my Batman could be there. But then 148 00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:43,193 you would have to have Robert Pattinson be a bad dad in the Brave and the Bold movie, which 149 00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:48,237 I'm fine with, honestly, like he's traveling the world. He's meeting all these ladies. He's 150 00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:53,320 got lots of money. Maybe he knocks one of them up. You never know. But like, is he old enough 151 00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:58,604 to have a kid as old as Damien Wayne? As long as he and Talia were both 18, sure. 152 00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:06,364 Sure, okay. So this seems like it's gonna be good news for fans of the upcoming DCU and 153 00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:12,686 not necessarily great news for fans of Reeves take on the Batman universe. I think it's honestly 154 00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:17,588 a win-win for everybody because you know whether you liked Matt Reeves' version of the Batman 155 00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:22,991 or not, you'll still get the villains for that version of Batman and Matt Reeves' genius in 156 00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,913 the DCU as well because the guy is a genius. Yeah, he's pretty good. He's alright. You know 157 00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:34,278 it in your heart to be true. But yeah, I guess we'll see what happens with the Batman projects. 158 00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:39,867 We'll keep you guys updated as to any news that we hear for the Batman series or anything coming 159 00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,309 from Matt Reeves and DC. 160 00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,942 But I think that does it for all the news for this episode. Now let's move on to the main 161 00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:59,589 event, where we review the latest DC film to hit theaters, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. 162 00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:22,964 Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the latest and final film of the DC Extended Universe. I think. 163 00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:28,249 You know, after the Flash things are a little bit grey now, but the film of course stars 164 00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:34,594 Jason Momoa and was directed by James Wan and is the sequel to the billion dollar grossing 165 00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:42,081 2018 film Aquaman, which is the highest grossing DC film of all time worldwide. And that film 166 00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:46,903 was good. I think it's one of the best DC films ever, from a filmmaking perspective at the 167 00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,426 very least. The film looked gorgeous, and the mythic worldbuilding done by James Wan was 168 00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:58,788 phenomenal. When we learned that a sequel was planned for a December 2022 release, I was 169 00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:04,231 pretty excited. But then we got the Amber Heard drama and the sudden purchase of Warner Bros. 170 00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:10,553 by Discovery. The new CEO said he wanted to reboot DC. James Gunn took over DC Studios. 171 00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:16,765 and suddenly the Aquaman sequel lost quite a bit of its luster. The film was pushed back 172 00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:22,929 a year due to COVID setbacks, and after the Flash arrived in theaters, essentially allowing 173 00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:30,653 for a fresh start to DC's new cinematic universe, Aquaman 2 became my least anticipated DC film, 174 00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:36,797 maybe ever. Like, I would have been perfectly fine if the film was shelved as a tax write-off 175 00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:41,587 like Batgirl. That all changed however when we got the first trailer only three months 176 00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:48,409 ago and I was reminded of how awesome the visuals and the world that James Wan created are. I 177 00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:55,210 got pretty hyped, but did the film live up to the hype? It unfortunately did not. We didn't 178 00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,732 need this film, things should have ended with the Flash, and I'm kinda just ready to forget 179 00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:06,790 this film even exists. It was mediocre times for Superhero Movie going You know, it reminded 180 00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:13,114 me a lot of Ant-Man and the Wasp quantumania in that the film was almost essentially computer 181 00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:18,296 animated. There were so many visual effects shots. The humor didn't always stick like quantumania 182 00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:25,400 and the story was a little lackluster. I think 2023's Marvel and DC films were bookended by 183 00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:31,464 some of the more generic offerings that DC Marvel have put out. Which is a huge shame. If you 184 00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:37,548 haven't seen Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom yet. Honestly, I wouldn't bother. Like maybe not 185 00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:42,172 even when this hits streaming. Not because the film is terrible, because the third act is 186 00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:48,078 actually pretty good, but because it's ultimately pointless and has very little redeeming value 187 00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:54,064 outside of CG spectacle. And even that is sometimes amongst the worst I've seen in a long time. 188 00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:59,049 If you still want to see the film, definitely skip this review though because there will 189 00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:04,555 be spoilers. Now the film picks up a few years after the events of the first film, where Aquaman 190 00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:10,417 defeated his brother Orm, the King of Atlantis, to prevent him from amassing an army to destroy 191 00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:15,918 the surface world. As Aquaman learned about the world of Atlantis, he also developed a 192 00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:21,960 romantic relationship with Orm's former fiance, Princess Mera. And between the two films, they 193 00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,778 had a baby, Arthur Jr. And this is in keeping with the comics. Aquaman is pretty unique in 194 00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:33,340 the comics in that he matured a lot faster than other heroes. Like he was the first superhero 195 00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,441 to have a wedding, the first to have a baby, the first to suffer the loss of a child, and 196 00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:45,443 the first hero to get separated as a result. It's pretty heavy stuff, and while the loss 197 00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:52,105 of his family didn't drive him in the same way it did the Punisher, it still deeply affected 198 00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:57,627 him and it took decades for him and Mara to reunite. Yeah, the comic book version of Aquaman 199 00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:02,251 is pretty deep It's interesting that you say that he was one of the first characters to 200 00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,257 kind of mature in his I guess life story And of all the DC superheroes, it's ironic because 201 00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:14,722 Jason Momoa's version of the Aquaman character is Essentially a manchild. Oh, yeah, I'll definitely 202 00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:19,507 be getting to that. Absolutely You're on the nose there. It just served to remind me again 203 00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:24,151 while watching this movie that this doesn't really feel like Aquaman that I know. It's 204 00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:30,376 very much Jason Momoa's take on the character. Or just Jason Momoa. Like not even a take on 205 00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:36,901 a character. It's just Jason Momoa. Now it had been rumored that Aquaman 2 tested horribly 206 00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:43,227 at test screenings, in part because Black Manta killed Arthur Jr. just like in the comics. 207 00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:49,732 Like people walked out of test screenings, which is unheard of. But I could kind of see where 208 00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:54,603 they're coming from now. One of the things I was most interested in going into the film 209 00:19:54,943 --> 00:20:00,186 was to see if the filmmakers had the balls to put Aquaman through such an emotionally heavy 210 00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:05,929 and dark ordeal like suffering the loss of a child. I thought I saw a way they could have 211 00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:11,312 done it in a similar way to the movie Gladiator that could have suited the narrative and the 212 00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:17,736 film. But now it's become painfully obvious that Jason Momoa is no Russell Crowe. Like 213 00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:23,927 tonally, I'd say Jason Momoa ruined the film. I understand it's hard to take a character 214 00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:32,272 like Aquaman seriously, but damn, you have to at least try. I think Momoa probably assumed 215 00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:37,895 that the reason the first film made so much money was because people enjoyed seeing Jason 216 00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:43,658 Momoa play Jason Momoa, who comes across as somewhat of a jokester. But no, we just want 217 00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:49,762 to see Aquaman as a badass, and it's not badass to have your baby piss in your mouth. or make 218 00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:55,965 unfunny jokes every five seconds. Yeah, actually, my favorite moments with Jason Momoa as the 219 00:20:55,985 --> 00:21:00,308 character of Aquaman are his more serious moments where he's acting like the character that I 220 00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,970 know from the comics, where he's very straight faced. Like in the first movie, we got some 221 00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,373 great character moments where he's seemingly transitioning from his man child self into 222 00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:14,356 someone you would believe as a king of this entire kingdom. But there was almost like a 223 00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:20,758 reversion or a lack. of follow through in his character arc from the first film where we 224 00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:25,662 don't really see that noble king. But like there are brief spurts here, but like he's falling 225 00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:30,027 asleep during meetings and stuff like that. It's all really played for gags. And it's not 226 00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:35,572 that funny. No, the only thing he didn't do in this movie is like fart, but he may as well 227 00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:42,154 have. Now the film was intentionally supposed to be message heavy. like showing the power 228 00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:48,259 of brotherhood and cooperation and warning against the dangers of climate change and global warming. 229 00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,765 But because the movie doesn't take itself seriously, it's really hard to take its messages seriously. 230 00:21:55,425 --> 00:22:01,090 This film was originally supposed to go head-to-head against Avatar the Way of Water, and when Warner 231 00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,006 Brothers flinched and pushed the release date, I was kind of pissed, like, ah, come on! No 232 00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:10,907 one cares about Avatar anymore. The first Aquaman improved to what the first Avatar film did 233 00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:16,449 visually. Anyway, we could take him on. And holy shit, was I wrong. Aquaman 2 was embarrassing 234 00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:22,070 enough without having to compare it to Avatar 2. But what's really heartbreaking was that 235 00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,912 there was this potential there for that to not be the case. Like, I was expecting this film 236 00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,882 to be like Avatar meets Taken meets Lord of the Rings. but instead I got Thor Love and 237 00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:39,324 Thunder meets Jumanji meets the Saturday morning Captain Planet cartoon. And the thing is, the 238 00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:45,646 film is so tonally inconsistent and it comes across as so heavily edited and reworked that 239 00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:50,287 I'm guessing there's a better version of the movie out there, but I honestly don't care 240 00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:55,469 enough to hashtag release the wand cut. That was a great description of this movie. Chris 241 00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:01,462 Hemsworth, despite the terrible quality of Thor 11th Thunder. He actually has comedic timing 242 00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:06,104 and comedic instincts. I don't think Jason Momoa has the same thing going for him. I would somewhat 243 00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:11,285 agree. I think he has a little bit there, but it needs to be under the right circumstances, 244 00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:17,607 which makes me nervous for a potential Lobo project. Oh, I'm not worried about Lobo at 245 00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:21,988 all. I think he would nail it because he basically is Lobo, even when he's Aquaman. You know, 246 00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:27,269 you see, we still see him doing donuts in the dirt with the motorcycle, despite the fact 247 00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:32,343 that I've never seen Aquaman ride a motorcycle in the books. I'm trying to think. No, yeah, 248 00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:38,384 I think that'd be really dumb if I saw him ever do that. Now I'm trashing the film, but just 249 00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:44,026 because I was disappointed in it doesn't mean it was all bad. The film, as the trailers promised, 250 00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:49,988 was gorgeous, despite some really embarrassing CG in some spots. For the most part, it was 251 00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:57,178 good. And you know, once Arthur and Orm meet Dr. Shin, the movie starts getting good. Because 252 00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:02,701 that's when we finally understand the stakes of the film. That the entity controlling Black 253 00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:09,346 Manta, Kordax, and the Oricalcum are global threats. And we circle back to Arthur Jr. who 254 00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:13,608 gets kidnapped by Black Manta, which I thought was going to happen much earlier in the film. 255 00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:19,732 The problem is that by the time the movie gets good, it's like two-thirds over, and ultimately 256 00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:23,883 it's too little too late. Yeah, I actually thought the plot was pretty interesting once it was 257 00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:27,966 revealed that the Oro Kalkom, and I swear to God, if I ever hear that word again, it'll 258 00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:35,471 be too soon. But basically it was causing global warming to melt the polar ice caps to free 259 00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:41,095 the lost kingdom and Kordax. Right, exactly. The visuals, while the CGI may not have always 260 00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:47,859 been spot on, the design of everything is exceptional. Like seeing Kordax with his Sauron like get 261 00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,375 up, use his black magic on his Citadel and stuff like that. Just the fact that the seventh kingdom 262 00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:56,998 was even based in Antarctica and had like this entirely different world feel to the other 263 00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,581 seven kingdoms, which we've seen in the previous movie. It's all fantastic. Oh yeah, it's so 264 00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:06,485 well imagined. It's kind of a shame that it's not going to continue. Honestly, that's like 265 00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,148 what's heartbreaking in regards to Aquaman with the DCU ending is that are we ever going to 266 00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:15,811 see this world again? I like the sunken city with all the pirates, like how that's like 267 00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:20,955 the underground in the oceanic world. That was cool. I did love how this film traversed the 268 00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:25,557 globe in the way that the first film was a globe trotting adventure. Like we got to see the 269 00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:31,320 desert, we got to see the jungle, we got to see, you know, the sunken city and Antarctica. 270 00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,583 It was pretty cool. The desert characters were really cool in that they learned how to survive 271 00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:41,806 away from water by hydrating with blood. Like that's pretty hardcore. That's super hardcore. 272 00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:47,649 And those creatures that they were riding were super freaking disgusting. But like in the 273 00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:53,631 best way possible. Ultimately, I think these visuals and these designs are like 90% of why 274 00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:59,454 I enjoyed this film. Oh, you enjoyed it? I mean, it wasn't great. It definitely wasn't terrible, 275 00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:04,957 though. It was really hard for me to enjoy it. I invited my father-in-law to see it with me. 276 00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:11,239 He's former military and I thought it'd be like a cool like bro film to go see. And I was super 277 00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:17,094 embarrassed. It was two Saturday morning cartoons for him, right? Absolutely. Yeah. But let's 278 00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:22,619 move on to the character breakdown, starting with Arthur Curry slash Aquaman played by Jason 279 00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,643 Momoa. As I mentioned earlier, I feel like he ruined the movie in the same way that I feel 280 00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:33,588 like Chris Hemsworth ruined Thor, Love and Thunder by trying to be a comedian. Thor is not supposed 281 00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:38,612 to be a funny character. Neither is Aquaman. I'm really tired of actors playing roles that 282 00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:44,457 they don't understand. And yeah, I'm going to make the case that Jason Momoa doesn't understand 283 00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:49,847 Aquaman. Because, like we mentioned earlier, he plays him like Lobo, so maybe ultimately 284 00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,348 it's best he's rumored to be playing that role in James Gunn's new DCU. In the first film, 285 00:26:55,688 --> 00:27:01,110 Aquaman's arc was that he was worthy to be king because he was able to make tough decisions. 286 00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,811 But it turned out that upon being king, he really wasn't able to make decisions to improve the 287 00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:12,973 kingdom due to the bureaucracy of Atlantis' High Council, who antagonized him for not understanding 288 00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:19,333 Atlantean ways and culture. When sickness spreads among his people, however, and Black Mantis 289 00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:25,678 steals or a calcum from Atlantis, polluting the planet, Arthur realizes that he needs his 290 00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:32,063 brother's help to stop him. Even though Arthur proved to be less kingly and less mature than 291 00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:39,148 Orm, he proved to be the bigger and better man by surmounting and helping Orm overcome Kordax's 292 00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:44,684 temptations of power. Arthur's ultimate destiny has always been to unite the underwater and 293 00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:50,228 surface worlds and at the very end of the film he was finally able to start that process by 294 00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:56,052 revealing Atlantis's existence to the world, though again how anyone is supposed to take 295 00:27:56,072 --> 00:28:02,076 him seriously with that weird mic drop at the end is beyond me. The whole Iron Man callback 296 00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:08,360 was literally the worst fucking joke in any DC film ever. I hated it when he was like, 297 00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:14,817 I'm the king of Atlantis and I'm Aquaman. I was like, what the fuck? What is this? My reaction 298 00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:18,480 exactly. I bet you world leaders were like, oh, no. 299 00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:26,426 Right. That's what I'm saying. The coolest thing for Aquaman, I would say, in this film was 300 00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:31,531 his stealth suit. I actually really liked the way they did that. And I loved that Toppo also 301 00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:38,116 had essentially the same ability. We did not get enough Toppo and Storm in this movie. Yeah. 302 00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:42,571 When you saw his fish speak. power at the end of the first film, he almost seems like unstoppable 303 00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:47,054 in the water, right? So I was kind of hoping that he would use it more within the course 304 00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:52,397 of this film, but he only really used it a few times. Although I did like how he got all the 305 00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:58,000 undersea mammals to use their echolocation to destroy Black Manta's ship. Oh yeah, like the 306 00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,943 sonar waves. That was a really cool way to use his power for sure. Moving on to Ocean Master, 307 00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:11,755 aka Orm, he was played by Patrick Wilson. Watching this made me wish Patrick Wilson was originally 308 00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:16,116 cast as Aquaman because he not only looks the part of the character from the comics to a 309 00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:22,017 T, but also because he took his role seriously. I mean, he took part in quite a bit of the 310 00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:26,259 jokes, but even when he's running with his arms behind his back because, you know, he doesn't 311 00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,660 know how to run on land, or he's eating a cockroach, like he still played it as if it was Orm, not 312 00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,274 Patrick Wilson. I think Jason Mowa's presence actually brought down Patrick Wilson's performance 313 00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:43,117 because whenever they were on screen together, it became apparent that Patrick Wilson was 314 00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:49,520 acting because Jason Momoa wasn't, if that makes sense. The two just had like zero bromance 315 00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,003 chemistry, which is a problem for the film because that was sort of supposed to be the core of 316 00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:59,346 it, their relationship, and the entire second act was supposed to be a buddy comedy. Yeah, 317 00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:03,228 that was my big takeaway from the film as well. They were honestly acting in different films. 318 00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:08,720 It felt that way. Yeah, absolutely. And some of that awkwardness, I feel like, was actually 319 00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,004 reflected in the score. Because when they tried to be silly with that relationship, the score 320 00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:19,129 did like a cartoonish thing such as when Aquaman knocked over that big statue to create a bridge. 321 00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:23,753 That scene played out way worse than I thought it would from the trailers. And I don't know 322 00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:29,339 why, it was just so cringe-worthy. The whole fucking jungle island thing was so cringe-inducing. 323 00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,823 I didn't get the joke regarding the cockroaches. Actually, I did find that funny because you 324 00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:39,828 could just see me doing that to my younger brothers. But he told him that it was like the shrimp 325 00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:45,633 of the land, right? Right. But the joke is that surface dwellers don't actually eat cockroaches. 326 00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:50,538 And so he like tricked him into doing it, but he never told him that it was a joke. Like 327 00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:56,604 he never followed through with the gag. So it was just strange. Honestly, if I got you to 328 00:30:56,644 --> 00:31:00,378 eat a cockroach, I wouldn't tell you. that like you're not supposed to eat it. I'd be telling 329 00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:06,202 everyone else that I got you to eat a cockroach. And so we didn't see that either. We should 330 00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:11,805 have seen Alcon be like, I seriously got Oram to eat a cockroach. We should have definitely. 331 00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:17,508 Now, Oram's arc in the film is really one in which he comes to terms that what he did in 332 00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:24,852 the first film was wrong and that in the end, Arthur really is better for Atlantis. He realizes 333 00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:30,071 over the course of the film, as Arthur continues to surprise him, that there is an honor and 334 00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:36,856 nobility in Arthur's viewpoint and gracious actions, and Orm is moved essentially. Part 335 00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:41,881 of me wanted to take issue with the fact that Orm became a good guy and I kept waiting for 336 00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,264 him to turn bad, but that ended up not happening. I thought that would have been a great turn. 337 00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:51,569 But given the fact that you have stated that Ocean Master actually has done good things 338 00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:55,733 in the books like relinquish the throne when he realized that it rightfully belonged to 339 00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:01,247 Arthur Curry. That kind of helped sell the idea of Oram being a good guy. To me. No, for me 340 00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:07,709 as well. Yeah. In the comics, in the new 52 version of Oram, he's not necessarily a bad 341 00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:13,690 guy. There is sort of like a rivalry, but there's also like a respect between the characters 342 00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,572 of Aquaman and Ocean Master as well. And so, yeah, I thought it worked in the movie also. 343 00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:25,293 Moving on to David Kane, AKA Black Manta. He was played by Yaya Abdul-Mateen the second. 344 00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:31,716 Black Manta is a fantastic character and I thought Yaya did a fantastic job in the role because 345 00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:37,379 he's really able to capture the rage of the character. Like very few villains are as dedicated 346 00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:43,122 as Black Manta in the comics to so completely destroying a hero and his family. And that 347 00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:48,064 also helps that he looks really badass. I do have to say though it's kind of unfortunate 348 00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:54,440 that Black Manta loses some agency doing Cordax's bidding in this film rather than going full 349 00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,563 force against Aquaman. I say kind of because I did actually like the dead king Cordax in 350 00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:06,306 this film and giving Black Manta a reason to kill Arthur Jr. other than he just really hates 351 00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:12,590 Aquaman was a more stomachable decision at the very least. I did think it was somewhat baller 352 00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,433 of him at the end, however, to essentially kill himself maybe rather than accept Aquaman's 353 00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:22,500 help because that felt very in character for Black Manta. Yeah, that was his best character 354 00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,784 moment. Unfortunately, it was probably his last character moment. Yeah, yeah, I think it was. 355 00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:32,528 You're right. We talked about the design of this film. I thought his new gear was incredibly 356 00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:38,413 well designed. You know, everything from the suit to the octopods. It was fantastic. I liked 357 00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:43,117 seeing his beams in action that first seen when he's going up against Mira and he like blasts 358 00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:47,320 her and like everything around him. Those are some deadly lasers. Oh, yeah. Like you could 359 00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,246 see how they were burning people. Definitely deadly. So Aquaman, Ocean Master, and Black 360 00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:56,788 Manta are really the three central characters of the film. I do want to touch briefly on 361 00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:02,429 Dr. Shin and Mara, though. Starting with Dr. Shin, he was played by Randall Park, who's 362 00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:07,731 a great comedic actor. He was the only truly funny character in the film, and at times when 363 00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,192 I don't think he was even trying to be. I mean, I only see him as Jimmy Woo from the Marvel 364 00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:19,778 movies. Nah. This was just Jimmy Woo pretending to be a scientist or something. I was happy 365 00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:24,019 with the amount of screen time that they gave Randall Park here. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. 366 00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:28,880 You know, the first film, Dr. Shin was a minor character, simply trying to prove Atlantis' 367 00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,802 existence to the world and allied himself with Black Manta to do so. Like you said, he got 368 00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:38,443 much more screen time here and he got more than he bargained for with the emergence of Cortex. 369 00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:44,305 But he has a crisis of conscience warning Aquaman of Black Manta's new power and even saving 370 00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:49,481 Arthur Jr. from being killed. So it was nice to see him sort of have that heroic streak 371 00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:55,447 to him. Moving on to Mera, she was played by Amber Heard. She had a slightly bigger role 372 00:34:55,467 --> 00:35:00,192 in the film than I thought she would, you know, based on her own words in court that she was 373 00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:05,057 essentially erased from the movie, which wasn't the case, though there may be quite a bit left 374 00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:10,431 on the cutting-groom floor. I didn't think her performance was terrible. Her involvement in 375 00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:15,955 the film's story was a big question to many due to some reports that her relationship with 376 00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:21,460 Jason Momoa and James Wan wasn't great, but I'm glad she got the screen time that she did 377 00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,185 because Mera should be a big part of Arthur's world, especially when it comes to Arthur Jr. 378 00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:32,069 It's always cool to see her use her powers too. She has a musical power set. I mean, in this 379 00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:38,274 film it was used as Deus Ex Machina on multiple occasions, which was kind of unfortunate. I 380 00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:43,216 actually would have preferred to see Toppo get just one surprise Deo 6 Machina if you're going 381 00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:47,237 to do Deo 6 Machina because you know, you could be invisible and just kind of like spring into 382 00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:51,579 action and be like, ta-da, I'm here. That would have been awesome. I did like the call out 383 00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:55,241 that Nicole Kidman's Atlanta gave the character in reference to the previous film where we 384 00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:58,842 saw Toppo playing the drums. Yeah. She was like running down his credentials and she's like, 385 00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:04,905 he's also really good at multiple instruments. Nicole Kidman looked so weird in this movie. 386 00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:10,307 She had a CGI face, did she not? Did she? I don't think she did. That's how it looked to 387 00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:14,810 me on the screen that I saw. It looked like maybe she had gotten too much Botox and couldn't 388 00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:20,213 really move her face enough. And so they had to move it using special effects. It very much 389 00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:26,376 looked like how Henry Cavill did in the Jostas League movie. Oh, geez. I did not see that 390 00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:31,999 at all. She had a very small role in the movie. She only had like a few lines. So maybe I just 391 00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,858 wasn't paying too much attention to her. But I mean, I believe it. Let's move on to the 392 00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:38,587 story highlights. 393 00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,491 Several years after defeating and imprisoning his half-brother Orm, Arthur has become the 394 00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:56,112 new king of Atlantis and struggles with the bureaucracy, preferring to spend time on land 395 00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:02,234 with his family, including his infant son Junior, who displays the ability to communicate with 396 00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:08,056 fish. Aquaman's nemesis Black Manta, meanwhile, searches the world for Atlantean technology 397 00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:13,457 to repair his power suit and get revenge on the hero for killing his father. With the help 398 00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:19,485 of Dr. Steven Shin, Black Manta finds the lost Atlantean kingdom of Necrus in the Antarctic, 399 00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:24,850 where they're attacked by an underwater monster and Black Manta becomes possessed by a broken 400 00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:31,015 Black Trident. Now I'm not sure why they gave Junior fish speaking powers, because it never 401 00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:36,419 came up in the film again. Like they should have used it again at least once. Yeah, that 402 00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,182 actually would have been cool to have him save the day by calling in a fleet of whales or 403 00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:44,918 something. Right? Yeah, absolutely. They could have totally done that. And I actually thought 404 00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:49,180 they were going to once they sort of set that up at the beginning of the movie. I actually 405 00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,043 really liked these opening Antarctica scenes because they were a good showcase for James 406 00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:59,767 Bond's horror background. Yeah, that tentacle monster was pretty frightening. Yeah, and the 407 00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:04,710 way it just like dragged people into the darkness. It was pretty cool. Within the next five months, 408 00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,013 global warming has increased rapidly, diluting the ocean saltwater and resulting in algae 409 00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:16,077 blooms. that's causing sickness to spread in the underwater kingdoms. Although Arthur wants 410 00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:21,242 to reveal Atlantis to the surface world so that their scientists can work together to solve 411 00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:26,906 the climate crisis, the city's high council refuses to let him. Meanwhile, Black Manta, 412 00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:32,731 now equipped with new Atlantean technology, is caught trying to steal a highly toxic fuel 413 00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:39,897 source known as or a calcum from Atlantis. Mera and many other Atlanteans are badly injured. 414 00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:45,682 in Black Manta's escape. Do you know if Orocalcum is from the comics? It is actually, but it's 415 00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:51,646 also from ancient myths about Atlantis as well. It's supposed to be a medal though, I believe. 416 00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:57,610 Interesting. Upon realizing that Black Manta is using the Orocalcum to pollute the Earth's 417 00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:03,975 atmosphere and raise temperatures, Arthur decides his brother Orm can help him find Black Manta, 418 00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:09,990 to his mother Atlantis and Mira's father Nerus' objections. With the help of a stealth suit 419 00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,873 and a cephalopod named Toppo, Arthur successfully breaks Orm out of his desert prison. Which 420 00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:20,975 was a pretty cool scene. It was a convincing special effect that they used on Patrick Wilson, 421 00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:26,317 going from his skinny mode into his ripped mode. See, I didn't really like that. I mean, I thought 422 00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:31,159 the special effect was fine, but I don't understand how just upon touching water, all of a sudden 423 00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,018 he gets ripped. Well, he was like super dehydrated, right? Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I just 424 00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:41,120 thought it was a convincing special effect. Yeah, definitely convincing. As was Toppo. 425 00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,043 I want a Toppo in real life. How was Toppo surviving on land? Because he's fucking Toppo, dude. 426 00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:52,947 You can do whatever he wants. All right. OK. How dare you question him. We need to do a 427 00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:58,130 Christmas duel episode with Toppo. That's all I'm saying. It's a great idea. Yeah. Orb suggests 428 00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,072 that they visit the Sunken Citadel, a seedy underwater pirate colony ruled by Kingfish, 429 00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:09,392 who may know Black Manta's whereabouts. After a tussle with Kingfish's shark soldiers, Arthur 430 00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:15,075 learns that Black Manta may be on a volcanic island in the South Pacific. After swimming 431 00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:21,038 to the island, Arthur sends Toppo back to Atlantis for help while he and Orm navigate the mutated 432 00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:27,322 jungle, dodging carnivorous plants and giant insects to get to Black Manta's volcano base. 433 00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:32,365 I was super surprised when I saw that Kingfish was voiced by Martin Short. Yeah, I didn't 434 00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:37,279 see that until the credits either. I have no idea who Kingfish is. Apparently he's a character 435 00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,881 in the comics. I initially thought that the character was a stand in for King Shark, which 436 00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:46,282 I thought would have been actually really cool if they had done that. But upon doing further 437 00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:52,125 research, I guess that wasn't the case. I always liked the Jules Verne-esque journey to the 438 00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:56,687 center of the earth aspect that the Aquaman films have. We saw that in the first movie 439 00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,928 where they actually did go to the center of the earth. And then we saw it with this island 440 00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:05,294 in this film where you have like these giant insect creatures and dangerous flora and stuff 441 00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:10,577 like that. It is a pretty neat aspect of these films. Yeah, it kind of feels like James Wan 442 00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:14,680 can do whatever he wants in these movies. He just comes up with these brilliant ways of 443 00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,743 doing them. Like Oric Alcom mutating the environment, that's a pretty cool idea to create some conflict. 444 00:41:21,243 --> 00:41:26,947 And it also creates greater stakes for the film and the danger that Oric Alcom presents. There 445 00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:31,189 was another joke during this part of the film that I really did not appreciate and that was 446 00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:39,140 when Aquaman referred to Orm as Loki and I'm like shut the hell up What are you doing? He's 447 00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:43,682 trying to be like Tony Stark giving everybody nicknames like how Iron Man did in the Avengers 448 00:41:43,722 --> 00:41:50,225 movie the first one But like do Marvel movies exist in the DCEU they must and that's stupid 449 00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:55,287 Well, I mean apparently DC heroes exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because there have 450 00:41:55,307 --> 00:42:00,429 been a number of references to Batman and Superman Oh, that's right. Okay, unless angry about 451 00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:06,170 it now Now, uneasy with Black Manta's actions and using the volcano to spew Orakelkem into 452 00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:12,295 the atmosphere, Dr. Shin begs Aquaman and Orm to rescue him from Manta just before Black 453 00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:18,140 Manta attacks them. During the battle, Orm takes hold of Black Manta's trident, which gives 454 00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,265 him visions of the past. After Atlantis comes to the brothers' rescue and bombs the island, 455 00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:30,458 destroying the volcano, Orm reveals that the trident is possessed by Kordax. the ancient 456 00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:36,681 Atlantean king of Necros, who used orichalcum and black magic to pollute the earth and corrupt 457 00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:42,704 and mutate his people into monsters. Cordax was defeated by his brother Atlin, the king 458 00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:49,148 of Atlantis, who used blood magic to seal his brother and the kingdom of Necros in ice forever. 459 00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:55,571 Black Manta, they learn, is being used by Cordax to melt the ice caps and free the lost kingdom. 460 00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,042 into the villain Cordax, who they also made Atlan's brother. I thought that was genius. 461 00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:11,388 I got to give a big shout out to listener Corey Wooten, who years ago, when we learned that 462 00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:16,653 Pelo Aspect was going to be in the Aquaman sequel, we asked listeners as a question of the week 463 00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:21,698 who they thought he was playing. And Corey Wooten, if you listen to our Falcon and the Winter 464 00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:26,590 Soldier review episode, stated that he thought he was playing Cordax. And he was right. Yeah 465 00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:32,694 Cory bro, you gotta hook me up with the next Powerball numbers. Please. Realizing Cordex 466 00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:38,458 can only be freed from the Blood Magic Ice Prison with the blood of Atlantean royalty, Aquaman 467 00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:43,982 and his family rush to his father's lighthouse, only to find his father Tom dying and Junior 468 00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:49,826 kidnapped. While Tom recovers, Arthur rallies his kingdom to rescue his son, chasing Black 469 00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:55,409 Manta to Antarctica, where Cordex's forces have been unleashed and do battle with the Atlanteans. 470 00:43:55,998 --> 00:44:01,362 Meanwhile, Dr. Shin hides Junior from Black Manta, but both are caught. I thought the movie 471 00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:06,506 really wussed out by not killing Aquaman's dad. I mean, they didn't kill Aqua Baby, and we 472 00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,470 probably figured that was gonna happen, but if they weren't gonna kill Aqua Baby, they 473 00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,874 should have at least killed Aqua Dad. They should have, because there's precedent for that in 474 00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:20,218 the comic as well. Both Aquaman and Black Manta essentially killed each other's fathers. So 475 00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,310 why the hell not kill Tom? They really wussed out, I agree. Aquaman stops Black Manta before 476 00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,512 Junior's blood can be spilled on the altar in front of the frozen Cordax. The two battle, 477 00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:36,735 and Arthur disarms Black Manta of the Trident, only for Orm to get ahold of it and become 478 00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:43,577 possessed by Cordax, successfully drawing Arthur's blood on the altar. As Cordax becomes free, 479 00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:48,900 Arthur and Orm struggle for control of the Black Trident, with their bond as brothers, helping 480 00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,090 them overcome Cordax's influence, and Arthur manages to kill Cordax, with Atlan's trident. 481 00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:01,674 It makes you wonder why if Orm had the trident, why didn't he just prick his finger over the 482 00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:06,617 altar? He has royal blood too, he could have easily undone the curse being possessed by 483 00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:10,639 Kordax. He didn't really need Arthur's blood. Well I think Arthur would have tried to stop 484 00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,502 him, so there was a tussle that was going to result regardless. Fair enough. After Black 485 00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:24,154 Mantis seemingly falls to his death rather than be saved by Arthur, join their allies on a 486 00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:29,656 glacier, where Arthur gives Orm his freedom rather than imprisoning him once again. To 487 00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:35,399 help deal with the damaged atmosphere, Arthur reveals the existence of Atlantis to the UN 488 00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:42,141 and the public. In the mid-credits scene, Orm enjoys a cheeseburger and a cockroach. Which 489 00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:49,664 is a hell of a way to end the DCEU. I mean, it was funny, I laughed, but also like I was 490 00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:53,994 kind of hoping there would be a little bit more after the credits. Yeah, something more substantial. 491 00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:59,896 Right, right. Just to say like, hey, this is all done, but get ready for something new. 492 00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:05,258 I don't know. Yeah, I think the Flash actually did a better job at that. I believe initially 493 00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,059 the Flash was supposed to come out after Aquaman, according to the original release schedule. 494 00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,941 And it's a shame that it didn't stay that way. It's a huge shame. These release dates should 495 00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,067 have been flipped, I feel. I actually think they would have gotten more money out of both 496 00:46:20,107 --> 00:46:23,728 of them if that had been the case. Because it really would have felt like The Flash was this 497 00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:29,091 event film that you had to see because it was setting up something new. Yeah, instead we 498 00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:34,153 got a Flash movie that didn't really serve as a transition and an Aquaman movie that was 499 00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:39,395 kind of pointless. Exactly. It's hard for me to say that things are pointless just because 500 00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:43,777 I think films should stand on their own regardless of if they're part of a cinematic universe 501 00:46:43,797 --> 00:46:48,608 or not. but this film really doesn't do that either in the sense that it has very little 502 00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:55,652 redeemable value on its own. I think despite a worthwhile final act, the scenic CG-heavy 503 00:46:55,692 --> 00:47:02,315 film's attempts at silly humor and serious themes make for a tonally inconsistent finale to the 504 00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:08,019 DCEU. And I think that's the film's biggest sin is that it's tonally inconsistent. I think 505 00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:14,390 a director's main job is tone, and James Wan kind of failed on that here. I'm giving the 506 00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:20,394 film 3 out of 5 stars, which is a 60% rating so it's borderline between a fresh and rotten 507 00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:27,498 tomato. I've decided to not recommend this film, so it is getting a rotten rating from me. I 508 00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:32,501 think it's right between Thor Love and Thunder and Shazam Fury of the Gods, which at least 509 00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:38,185 was tonally consistent. I agree with the 3 star rating. I could also understand why you would 510 00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:43,681 not recommend the film. largely due to its place within the DCEU, where it came chronologically 511 00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:49,385 in that release order. We've seen a lot of superhero films recently make the mistake of going too 512 00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:54,729 comedic with things, whether it's Thor 11th Under or like Modok from the Ant-Man movie. 513 00:47:54,929 --> 00:48:00,353 I hope it's a trend that does not continue into 2024, because I think it results in a lapse 514 00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:06,017 of cinematic quality that exacerbates the current issue that we're seeing of superhero fatigue. 515 00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:13,236 2023 is the year that fatigue really started to set in. And I think films like Aquaman, 516 00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:17,798 The Lost Kingdom are partially to blame. This movie is not helping the genre, and both Marvel 517 00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:22,520 and DC need to do a course correction for the future. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree. And luckily, 518 00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,882 we know that DC is next year. We're going to be getting Joker, Folly, I do. But I think 519 00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:34,025 that's the only live action DC film we're getting. So, yeah, we won't be seeing too much DC within 520 00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:41,159 the next 365 days. Good, finally, geez. Fuck you. I wish we were seeing less Marvel. I freaking 521 00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:46,100 hate watching these movies now. But that does it for this review guys.

"Dec 26, 2023",positive,"Picks up exactly where the first film left off. If you didn't like the first film, it's unlikely this film will win you over. I enjoyed the first film, and I had a good time with this one. The relationship between Aquaman and Orm was the stand out."
"Dec 26, 2023",neutral," In 2013, when Man of Steel premiered, there was the promise of an exciting future of storytelling to be told for the variety of characters within the DC lore.  There was rousing, if controversial, casting decisions, there was no shortage of talented filmmakers on board to forward these narratives, and when everything aligned for whichever project (Wonder Woman, Birds of Prey, The Suicide Squad, for example) the promise of what could be was palpable. But much like the franchise as a whole, James Wan‘s Aquaman sequel, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, never lifts off in the manner expected, or deserved.  Jason Momoa‘s enthusiasm for the character is evident, and the charming actor does his best to keep things afloat, but this lost voyage never finds its way, despite peppered possibilities. Set a few years after the events of the original film, The Lost Kingdom places the duelling responsibilities of Momoa’s character at its centre.  On land, his Arthur Curry is a fresh father, having bore a child with Mera (Amber Heard), and learning fatherhood comes with slapstick complications; cue shots of the young tyke urinating in Arthur’s mouth.  Under the sea, as Aquaman, the King of Atlantis, he struggles with having such a position of power as he doesn’t appreciate answering to his council’s regulations; we all know Aqauman is the epitome of impulsion. His roles as both both a father and as a king merge in a manner he wasn’t expecting though, when David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a high seas mercenary whose father was killed by Aquaman, returns to the fray as Black Manta.  Powered by an Atlantean armoured suit, Black Manta is bent on avenging his father’s death, and in uncovering the mythical Black Trident, he threatens Arthur’s own bloodline and all he knew about Atlantis. In Arthur’s own child being the target and Black Manta’s M.O. being to continually pollute the planet from the sea upwards, The Lost Kingdom does indeed have the ingredients to be an emotionally-charged adventure.  But, whether it’s because the 5-year break between this and the first film is too large a gap, or it can’t help but be tainted with the knowledge it’s closing out this embodiment of DCEU – for those unaware, director James Gunn is overhauling the entirety of the franchise, with a new variation of Superman arriving in 2025 – the concern for the stakes on hand never land in a manner that earns audience investment. On its own accord, The Lost Kingdom is an average (at best) blockbuster-coded actioner that, quite bizarrely, doesn’t conjure enough set-pieces to act as a distraction for audiences who equate bigger to meaning better.  As a sequel to a knowingly fun comic book adventure piece, it drowns in comparison.  But, as stated, Momoa truly dives in headfirst to steer his wronged vessel right where he can, and when the story – which Momoa helped conceive with director Wan and writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Thomas Pa’a Sibbett – allows the actor and Patrick Wilson (returning as Arthur’s imprisoned half-brother, Orm) to bounce off each other and drive the film with their buddy-comedy mentality, The Lost Kingdom momentarily finds its groove. Wilson’s Orm has a presence here that’s similar to what Heard’s Mera provided in the first film, reluctantly joining the rule-breaking Aquaman on whichever quest the Atlantean sees fit to risk life and limb for.  Orm having no real construct of real-world structure means there’s some fun to be had in Aquaman leading him astray, and when it allows Wilson to flex his action muscle, the film is all the better for it.  But, sadly, there’s only so much freedom Momoa and Wilson are able to run with, with the film seemingly unable to decide how much fun it wants to have and how seriously it should take itself. On the mention of Heard, there’s a rabbit hole of rumours and off-set chatter regarding her position within the hierarchy of the production, but as it stands within The Lost Kingdom‘s finality, she’s underused when compared to the original, but utilised more than I suspect many will be expecting.  There was talk that her role was reduced due to both a perceived lack of chemistry between herself and Momoa and the fallout of her public divorce trial with Johnny Depp, but this was continually offset with the word that Mera’s presence in this story was always more limited.  Whatever the truth, Heard is sprinkled throughout, and whilst she doesn’t make much of an impact, the presence of herself and Nicole Kidman alone – the latter returning in glorious heroine mode as Arthur and Orm’s mother, Atlanna – is welcome in a story that’s dominated by male energy. Given the underwhelming response to the majority of the DCEU’s entrants – this year alone, Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash and Blue Beetle have all majorly underperformed at the box office – it’s unlikely that The Lost Kingdom will correct any course for audiences seemingly done with the DC leg.  The early announcement of the franchise overhaul certainly didn’t help with these films all feeling especially useless, but even aside from such, the quality speaks for itself, and Aquaman’s second story lacks overall. There are isolated moments of charm and wit throughout, and the duo of Momoa (whose energy and movie-star wattage can’t be dimmed) and Wilson truly speak to what could have been, but if the first Aquaman was not one you warmed to, then The Lost Kingdom is surely an exploration you won’t find worth diving for.  And if you were a fan of the original (and a billion dollar box office haul says there were many), I’d suggest treading carefully and with tempered expectations. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Dec 25, 2023",neutral,"With a forgettable plot and some charisma coming from its main cast, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom fails to live up to its predecessor and the DCEU it has the privilege of bringing to a close."
"Dec 25, 2023",negative," By all accounts, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is not the comic book sequel director and co-writer James Wan intended on making when filming commenced back in June of 2021. Warner Bros. and its DC Films division went through major upheavals during that time, COVID caused production delays, and at least three reported reshoots forced the original December 2022 release date to move a full year. The plot was apparently overhauled, major characters saw their screen time reduced to almost nothing, and nearly every connection to the larger DC extended universe (DCEU) was completely excised. Add all of that up, and the word “trainwreck” certainly fits. All three definitions, even, as there’s a blink-or-you’ll-miss-it set piece in which Aquaman (Jason Momoa) saves some Atlantean public transportation from being destroyed by his archenemy David Kane aka Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). But it’s the two slang definitions that are the most appropriate. For Wan, this has to be as heartbreaking a directorial endeavor as anything he’s ever experienced. As for the film itself, well, calling it a visually chaotic mess would be considerably underselling the reality of the situation. The strange thing? I got the feeling that Wan, his production team, and likely Momoa himself all kind of said “screw it” at some point and decided to just let their collective freak flags fly. This last hurrah for the DCEU before its top-to-bottom 2025 reboot may be a disaster, but it’s anything but a boring one. At barely two hours, Wan keeps the pace popping and exposition to a minimum. Characters spout what is happening and why in blasts of unhinged word vomit, and there are moments when Wan utilizes silent film techniques to visually tell his story, so he can excise much of the dialogue (or have it spoken entirely off-screen or via narration). This makes this second solo Aquaman adventure far more watchable than it has any right to be. Much like he did with Fast X, Momoa puts the entire sequel on his broad shoulders and carries it with comically joyous aplomb. Wan regular Patrick Wilson (of the Conjuring and Insidious universes) — returning as Aquaman’s duplicitous brother Orm — adds able support, and Abdul-Mateen makes the most of his limited screen time and actually attempts to give a complex, three-dimensional performance. As for the director, he digs into his horror bag of tricks whenever allowed, especially early on, when a sequence featuring a menacing sea beast in an unexplored ice cave is far more frighteningly intense than it has any right to be. The plot? It doesn’t matter, but it has something to do with a lost undersea kingdom that the Black Manta stumbles into, which allows him to take possession of the fabled “Black Trident,” which could help accelerate climate change, unleash a mutated demonic menace, and unintentionally lead to the end of the world for creatures both above and below the sea. Aquaman and Orm join forces to stop him, and every now and then, characters from the previous film (including Amber Heard’s Queen Mera, Nicole Kidman’s Atlanna, and Dolph Lundrgren’s King Nereus) randomly show up to lend a helping hand. The production values are high, and there are passages of eye-popping visual effects wizardry that are undeniably impressive, most notably a stretch in which Aquaman breaks Orm out of his underground desert prison past a cadre of monstrous skeletal guards straight out of a Ray Harryhausen stop-motion fantasy-adventure from the 1960s. Composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (Hacksaw Ridge) returns and delivers a suitably adrenaline-filled (mostly) electronic score, and production designer Bill Brzeski (Iron Man 3) conjures up a handful of gorgeously gonzo sets, not the least of which is Black Manta’s secret volcanic lair, which is like a combination of a James Bond SPECTRE hideout and something straight out of Nazi bunker from Raiders of the Lost Ark. None of this makes Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom any less of a trainwreck, however. There are several instances where much of this sequel comes off like a Hot Shots– or Top Secret!–style parody of superhero flicks, and others where it’s nothing more than a frenetically edited monstrosity that barely holds together. This final dive into the undersea world of the DCEU implodes under the pressure likely generated by all the behind-the-scenes tinkering. As last hurrahs go, this one’s lost at sea.

"Dec 24, 2023",negative," Yet more evidence that the superhero movie industry is foundering comes from this shoddy, scraped-from-the-bottom-of-an-ocean-trench sequel. Jason Momoa, looking a bit like a beefed-up cartoon carrot in his wildly unflattering orange supersuit, returns as Arthur, the human-born heir to the kingdom of Atlantis. He divides his time between family life in a converted lighthouse with his wife, Mera (Amber Heard), their infant son, Arthur Jr, and his royal duties – largely crushingly dull council meetings with hostile merpeople. But an enemy from his past is back, and threatens not just Arthur asnd his people but the entire world, with the use of a long-abandoned Atlantean fuel that rapidly accelerates global heating. The lazily generic plot devices (yet again, an ancient evil artefact offers unlimited powers to its holder); performances so thuddingly clunky that much of the dialogue sinks like a boulder in the sea; the lack of any humour whatsoever: these are all minor irritations compared with the picture’s glib trivialisation of the climate crisis. Time to put a barnacle in it, fish boy."
"Dec 24, 2023",positive,Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is straight up cartoonish. The team up with Jason Momoa (Aquaman) and Patrick Wilson (King Orm) is what really works.
"Dec 24, 2023",negative," Writer/director/producer James Wan does it all, making the invention of new film franchises appear as easy as breathing. Like this past summer’s movie The Flash, however, the franchise informally dubbed “the DC Murder-Verse” has been drawing to a close with reboots on the horizon under new leadership. Aquaman and the Last Kingdom is the final FINAL remnant of Zack Snyder’s darker vision for DC superheroes, now entirely disconnected from the whole (without explanation) into a stand-alone world where supermen, batmen, and wonder women can’t arrive to save the day. Duplicating the cast from the 2018 Aquaman film with MCU alumni Randall Park getting a bigger part, the marketing synopsis is playing it as safe as possible with phrasing like “This time” instead of “In a world…!” The first Jason Momoa film raked in $1.1 billion to become the highest DC film to date, so counting the motorcycle-riding, cheeseburger-eating, Guinness-swigging superhero out would be a mistake. With nothing guarantied for his character going forward and little competition coming soon to a theater near you, will the sequel sink or swim at the holiday box office? All the fun from the first film feels forced this go around, making it hard to ignore the infinite cycle of pretty new location, talks go sour, fight, repeat. Kudos to the production crew for creating hammerhead subs, squidithopters, and mounted rock-burrowing assassin bugs as original visuals from middle-management studio notes. “Can this be like that Star Wars cantina thing but made out of shipwrecks like in The Little Mermaid?” or “What if we stole every cool James Bond villain lair idea and crammed it into the second act?” and finally “Let’s do a big Lord of the Rings-type battle for a finale!” If LOTR was a trilogy about walking from place to place, Aquaman 2 is a sequel about swimming from place to place, covering presumably thousands of miles of ocean at the speed of plot from one danger-prone digital set piece to another. The only weight given to this sequel is Willem Defoe’s character dying off-screen due to scheduling issues, a story that sounds far better than this borrowed and outright stolen mishmash of a film. The stakes, like the characters themselves, are generic at best. Nicole Kidman’s Atlanna and Wilson’s Orm are more serious than ever; Momoa’s Arthur is still never serious enough; Manta is even angrier all the time. Amber Heard’s Mera looks as if all of her shots were edited into scenes filmed separately; for being a new wife and mother, she’s unrealistically absent for most of the family-at-home stuff (wink-wink, nudge-nudge). Randall Park’s character appears to have an actual revelation about what was going on at the DCMV: “Young fool, only now, at the end, do you understand.” Fans of Momoa being himself (read: not Aquaman per se) will probably enjoy hearing random bursts of joy from the actor following choreographed stunt work, so expect a supercut of all the ones they had to remove from the film just waiting for the home disc release extras.  Big showy expensive films released in the late December holiday frame have time to do well, especially in 2023 with more than the usual classic films and niche awards contenders as alternatives. The Lost Kingdom is competing solely with the already-popular Godzilla Minus One still expanding onto more screens. With nothing left in the old DC pipeline, now is as good a time as any to also suggest James Gunn offer Jason Momoa the superhero role he was born to play:  interstellar bounty hunter Lobo…! "
"Dec 24, 2023",positive," Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom could hit $45 million for this four-day holiday weekend, or might have less staying power through Christmas Day on Monday and finish closer to $40 million. Every little bit helps and will give us better indications of precisely how well or how weakly the film will play going forward. But regardless of the box office outcome, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a good final chapter in the DCEU saga, not great but certainly enough eye candy to justify a big-screen viewing. Even a high-end outcome suggests hard times ahead, unless the sequel can leg out even better than its predecessor and top $250 million domestic, which would guarantee a final cume north of $500 million, assuming matching international support at minimum. More likely in that scenario would be a $750 million global total, avoiding a disaster and at least ending the DCEU on a blockbuster note rather than a non-event. But even this would be a massive comedown from the 2017’s Aquaman, which banked $1.15 billion, and point to the holiday scenario I expected for WBD at year’s end. That’s just enough to let WBD generate positive headlines for a solid year-end finish, and combined with Barbie and a couple of well-performing moderate successes it provides cover for the bigger truth about how hard 2023 hit the studios, particularly WBD and Disney. Premium theaters should overperform for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, so if those figures come in where they could and should based on potential, then it will be a good sign for Lost Kingdom’s longterm prospects of hitting the high end of potential box office outcomes. Not that it matters for the DCEU’s future, since there isn’t one. But it helps with the messaging, as noted. The problem is, nothing really suggests we should expect a high-end outcome for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The weak domestic box office opening is bad enough, but worse is the audience reaction — viewers gave it a B grade via Cinemascore, and while “B” means “good” it also means word of mouth is too weak to expect strong holds or much repeat business. (B+ is where a film can tip either way with audiences, and A- is where better holds and longer legs are expected.) My guess is Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom still enjoys a year-end holiday boost through the first week of January, enough to give it perhaps a 3x or even 4x final domestic multiplier, repping about one-third of the final global tally of $550-620 million. Higher end, it could hit $700 million if it surprises overseas, but sadly lower end at $400-450 million is probably more likely of the potential outlier results. Within the 16-film theatrically released DCEU (including Zack Snyder’s Justice League as a separate film from the theatrical version), Lost Kingdom needs only about $202 million to be in the shared superhero universe’s top-10 box office grossers. To make the top half (i.e. top eight highest grossers), it needs only about $365 million. But Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will need north of $655 million to break into the real top-grossing tier of DCEU films, from the 2013 through 2017 five-year era when the films were generating far better box office than the subsequent five-years when not a single DCEU so far managed to reach even $400 million. The threshold for top-five ranking in the DCEU will be close to $750 million, to beat Suicide Squad’s 2016 cume of $745 million, a figure I don’t think Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has much chance of attaining. Aquaman in 2017 was the last film from the original plans for the DCEU, and everything that came after was produced during a period of shifting studio leadership with ever-changing (and rarely fully formed) priorities, continued studio executive interference in creative decisions and in DC’s leadership in general (such as undermining Walter Hamada by approving things he rejected in DCEU projects under his supervision), and a (directly resulting) brutal downturn in audience opinion and box office for the DCEU (probably contributing to broader audience distaste for superhero movies, along with Sony Spider-Man spinoffs Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and Morbius during the same post-2017 period). That may sound mean, but I don’t intend it to be. I personally still liked most of even the weaker-performing DCEU movies, even while recognizing they didn’t offer what audiences want and expect to earn their ticket dollars when they have to choose just a small handful of films from hundreds every year. But at this point, it’s easy enough to see how a poisonous combo of reactionary studio choices and artistic uncertainty led to those films mostly underwhelming in storytelling and thus flopping theatrically. Whether it’s too late or not for the Aquaman sequel to recover and add at least a final moment of collective enjoyment of the DCEU as it rides off into the sunset, we will find out soon enough when we have the full worldwide box office data for the weekend. It all hinges on whether Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom suffers the same lack of oomph to motivate audiences and earn those dollars as the previous eight DCEU releases. To which audiences have thus far replied with a B grade, probably a kiss of death if overseas viewers concur. For myself, I think B is probably the correct grade, but I also think a B grade isn’t — or rather, shouldn’t be — as bad as it apparently is for most audiences. It’s contextual, sure, but a B-level action-packed visual spectacle on par with the best summer popcorn releases in live-action family-friendly “superhero cartoon” storytelling delivered at Christmas on the biggest screen possible is the sort of eye candy escapism I can get behind. Plus, if you need some messaging, it reminds you that melting the planet with unrestrained global warming is bad and probably going to get us all killed if we don’t stop being lazy and seeking cheap feel-good solutions that require little or no actual change in behavior or consumption. And we do get a bit of fun parenting moments early on, plus the emotional stakes of threatening the hero’s family, plus a villain driven by revenge over the loss of his own family, plus a brother team-up that reverses everything about the first film’s relationship and characterizations in exchange for some fun sibling squabbling. But all of that gets surface-level attention, enough to satisfy that it exists within the film so the story can get to what it’s meant for, and that is running around the world from one action set-piece to another, full of strange creatures and inevitable brightly colored CGI fights. Your mileage may vary, but it’s worth noting that I loved the first Aquaman (which I will never tire of pointing out is basically exactly the film I described wanting several years earlier, right down to suggesting Momoa’s casting), and so I was happy to revisit that world and those characters, even in a lighter and less awe-inspiring story, and with far less emotionally effective arcs. In a more crowded marketplace of other good or great films, then, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom might be a tougher sell, even to me. But director James Wan is one of the best at what he does, and he gets every ounce of entertainment value and excitement out of it. There’s a ton of CGI and action, and it always looks pretty terrific, it’s always brightly colored and easy to see, and you don’t lose track of where things are happening from the fast-edits and busy elements. Lost Kingdom plays all of the “greatest hits” from the first film, if the selections were made based on what’s loudest and easiest for the audience to sing along. At barely over two hours runtime, it’s around 20 minutes shorter than the first Aquaman. It does this by speeding up the pacing, simplifying the plot, and replacing character moments and emotional arcs with additional faster action scenes. It’s focused on delivering primarily the action spectacle of the first film, as well as a heavier dose of humor and “yahoo” moments from Momoa. In those ways, then, if you’re going to pay to see movies at premium theaters then it should probably be a film like Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which delivers what those formats are made to do best — I saw it in Dolby Cinema, my personal favored choice for viewing, so I got to see Lost Kingdom with amazing 3-E sound, eye-popping visuals, gorgeous colors. The cast are all returning in fine form, albeit with less to do involving less interesting things. Momoa leans more into the “surfer-dude mixed with biker dude” vibe, laughs considerably more often, and reminds us why this superhero business is all so easy for him. Patrick Wilson is buffer this time around, but his personality is toned down to “slightly crabby” (no pun intended) and just a bit misunderstood in his “I should be ruler and destroy all who challenge me” perspective. It’s what happened with Loki, and follows a frustrating trend in superhero movies lately to try to redeem every villain as quickly as possible — Loki’s changes took place across many films, to slowly changing degrees, in the face of increasing personal loss, amid increased exposure to and understand of other worlds and peoples’ perspectives, and in the face of a great deal of introspection and challenges. Loki earned his redemption arc, in other words, and films seeking to mimic it need to put in the work first, otherwise it feels like a cheap also-ran. Luckily, Wilson is good enough and the team-up fun enough that we usually don’t mind overlooking these problems long enough to enjoy the experience. But the film is a B grade precisely because it misses so many great opportunities in its efforts to strip away characterization and deeper arcs in favor of faster pacing and action sequences. This is a perpetually recurring but entirely false impression in Hollywood, thinking audiences want is more of the spectacle and VFX, and that it should come at the expense of character and earned emotional stakes. But the action is rarely enough to sustain without enough audience investment in the characters and their journey. More of what the first Aquaman film got so right in the character storytelling is what’s missing in the sequel, and what would’ve elevated it into A-grade range. The best part of the entire film is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II’s Black Manta. He is a Bond villain with higher aspirations, and every time he’s on screen I was reminded of why I love the Aquaman world so much. The secondary villain Kordax is honestly no match for Abdul-Mateen’s sneering anger and self-certainty that he’ll kick every butt that gets in his way. What’s missing is a better examination of Black Manta being pulled in different directions by Kordax, with competing voices in his head vying for control and power. That would’ve been a perfect additional element and even seems to be set up without the payoff, but Abdul-Mateen’s Manta deserved more to his story, even as he wrings every drip of sinister presence and villainy from his time on screen. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman get some supporting screen time, and show up in a few key moments to participate in the action spectacle and save the day, but Heard is definitely relegated to a smaller role this time around. Wilson’s turn as Aquaman’s sidekick inherently displaced Heard, but I hope Mera’s much more limited role wasn’t a studio reaction to the anti-Heard toxicity among segments of obsessively hostile, hateful, and mostly sexist fans. Unfortunately, I’m not in the mood to give benefit of the doubt to studio leadership at this point, as this film wasn’t under Gunn’s and Safran’s supervision and was more affected by WBD oversight. Randall Park makes the most of his screen time as Doctor Shin, and gets more of an arc with supporting subtext to walk him through his evolving perspective than anyone else in the film. It’s an odd choice to place the burden of earned redemption on Park’s Shin while mostly relying on a few overt moments and brief dialogue exchanges to redeem Wilson’s Orm (aka Ocean Master), but that’s indicative of why Lost Kingdom somehow is essentially a redo of the first film with just enough to feel fun but too little to care much about it all after it ends. If you enjoyed the first Aquaman, you will probably like Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, even though it will feel like a slimmed down continuation of that film to settle a couple of lingering arcs and questions, tying things up and giving you one last trip around Atlantis to admire the cool visuals. It won’t bring as much emotional satisfaction, and everything shines just a bit less, but it’s the last chapter of the DCEU, so it tries to at least remind us one last time what it was like when we still cared and could still have a good time in this world of superheroes."
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," Warner Brothers and DC finish the job of wasting the great casting coup of their “Justice League” era comic book film adaptations in a dead fish of an Aquaman sequel, “Aquaman and the Lost City.” It’s a lifeless patchwork of comic book movie “world building” and tropes, pieced together by four credited “story” authors, shot and re-shot, surrounded by rumors that Amber Heard has been edited out of it (She isn’t, but haters gon’hate.) and almost zero buzz. Earnest efforts to make it jokier, probably at the behest of humorous he-man star Jason Momoa, come to naught. Trying to turn Aquaman’s (somewhat) evil brother (Patrick Wilson) into a sort of Loki figure/foil and object of Aquaman’s fun fail.  And the story is just a “payback” tale from the first “Aquaman” outing, the one where Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) was a villain foiled, and now he’s back to find ancient undersea tech that will end life on Earth and while he’s at it, “take from him what he took from you.” Randall Park plays the scientist no one believes in as he looks high and low for proof of Atlantis.At some point, there’s a scene in which he must have been given a bloody nose. Blood turns up in his beard in insert shots later in this edit.  But the people you kind of feel sorry for are Heard, given enough scenes to justify a paycheck, and Nicole Kidman. It’s been years and years since our favorite redheaded Aussie Oscar winner has been in a movie this bad. There is some environmental messaging in here, which will annoy the same folks who’re made whenever Amber Heard gets work. Aquaman notes the state of the seas and the environment at large and mutters “I’m tired of nothing ever getting done.” But Momoa flexes, hops on a bike (his first, best destiny is anything with motorcycles in it) and does his damnedest to carry or will this picture into something worth watching — big laughs, macho joking around — “I’m gonna go start a fight.” – all of it looks like he’s trying too hard, and almost none of it works.  At this point, with Marvel over-saturating the “content” marketplace and out of ideas and DC almost never getting it right, make it stop, make it go away or maybe take a break and a breather on this over-exposed genre seem like the best options. The technology to make these movies eye candy of the first order is here. But the people making them are at a loss for a decent story to put these superheroes in, much less a movie that matters."

"Dec 23, 2023",negative," AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM is a tired pastiche of the super-hero/sci-fi genre most notable for being a perfect distillation of the phenomenon known as “super-hero fatigue”. Smothered by its been-there, seen-that vibe, it presents little to recommend it beyond Randall Park as both the embodiment of egregious exposition and the voice of reason. He is the only one who can balance the essential absurdity of the goings-on with a nimble, ahem, undercurrent of emotional angst. The rest, despite the breezy brawny bro-charm of Jason Momoa returning in the title role, and Patrick Wilson as his half-brother and nemesis, Orm, discovering the down side of being a rule-abiding prig, is a tedious, disjointed exercise in overkill. Aquaman, aka Arthur, is tiring of his role as the new king of Atlantis after discovering that the boredom of committee meetings and the bureaucracy that boasts wasting time as its principle accomplishment is less rewarding than the heroic battles that seized the throne from Orm. It may have suited Orm before, but Arthur prefers the simple life in his father’s seaside cabin with wife Mera (Amber Heard) and baby son, Arthur, Jr. Alas, Orm may be safely tucked away, imprisoned by the oxymoronic desert-dwelling Fishermen, but his other nemesis, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still plotting revenge against Arthur for killing his father in the last film. His solution? Send Dr. Shin (Park) to search for the a lost city of Atlantis and use that antique, but still advanced, technology to end Aquaman and all that he loves. That includes the Earth, which allows for a timely subplot about industrial pollution and climate change. One can only speculate on what this flick was intended to be before Ms. Heard garnered such negative press in her court fight with ex-husband, Johnny Depp. The producers felt that they had no choice but to re-imagine the nearly completed film, excising her as much as possible and engaging in what turns out to be extensive reshoots of distinctly kludgy rewrites. Hence, there’s the voice-over montage of the idyllic life in the cabin, and of the dull life in the splendors of Atlantis, to establish Arthur’s new life. Mera is there, silently holding the baby and sitting by Arthur’s side on the thrones under the sea, and then she’s not anywhere once the montage is over. Arthur commiserates with his father (Temuera Morrison) about the struggles of being a single parent without any explanation of why he has become one. The she pops up again later when Black Manta attacks Atlantis, then, still later she and Arthur’s mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) send him off with Orm to defeat Blank Manta once and for all. It is understandable that sunk costs may have precluded starting this flick over from scratch, and from scrapping it altogether, but it’s hard to, ahem, fathom why releasing such hash will keep the franchise going. Make no mistake. Films have succeeded when the plot goes off the rails. THE BIG SLEEP, for example, but that had the chemistry of Bogart and Bacall going for it, and an absorbing story about the decadence that lurks beneath the veneer of high society. Plus an ironic, wisecracking gumshoe with a sense of chivalry worthy of The Round Table. Here we have Martin Short voicing a knock-off of Jabba the Hut from the Star Wars universe, and Arthur and Orm as a bickering odd couple after the former saves the latter from those ci-mentioned oxymorons in order to, of course, save the planet. Both actors are good, playing to their strengths, but the dialogue and situations are obvious and uninspired, then the ultimate villain’s lair in an extinct volcano feels like another knock-off, this time from the James Bond franchise. It >all< feels like a knock-off. Sets that were probably very expensive look like so much foam and shiny acrylic paint, while fight scenes that have all the hallmarks of careful choreography are directed with the urgency of chilled lox. Without the schmear. Wan does, to be fair, do much better in the small moments such as Park’s Greek chorus of commentary, or when Orm responds to a plea for help from a fellow-Atlantean with an enigmatic coldness. Suddenly it’s interesting for a few moments. For the rest,  not even the manly form of Jason Momoa can sell a giant seahorse as a dashing aquasteed. The ennui is crushing. AQUAMAN AND THE LOST CITY is simultaneously too jokey and too preachy (Kidman is so solemn she’s practically a marble statue) for its own good. When the next film inevitably, ahem, splashes across screens in a few years, let’s hope they’ve settled on one idiom or the other."
"Dec 23, 2023",neutral," Welcome to The #Content Report, a newsletter by Vince Mancini. I’ve been writing about movies, culture, and food since the aughts. Now I’m delivering it straight to you, with none of the autoplay videos, takeover ads, or chumboxes of the ad-ruined internet. Support my work and help me bring back the cool internet by subscribing, sharing, commenting, and keeping it real. This is the first line of Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom, delivered by star Jason Momoa via voiceover as he rides a giant iridescent seahorse on his way to pound a few pirates attempting to take over a container ship in the middle of a rainy sea. It’s sort of emblamatic of director James Wan’s entire approach to the material: This is really stupid, why not have some fun with it? The #Content Report, By Vince Mancini is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Wan’s first Aquaman, released in 2018, stood out as a goofy, absurdist beacon in what was then an otherwise hopelessly over-earnest and continuity-driven genre, back when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was still the undisputed cultural juggernaut every other studio was forced to mimic. The last few years have seen Marvel’s money machine sputter and die, a victim of the narrative bloat that naturally goes along with trying to reconcile 33 different films and however many TV serieses into a single fictional universe. And now, at last, it seems people have really, truly, finally gotten sick of this shit. If anything represents a triumph of the human spirit, it’s that.  Fast-forward to 2023 and it still feels like James Wan is the only one having fun, yet not even the guy who gave us Furious 7 (the best Fast movie, do not dispute me) and Malignant can enjoy himself quite enough to transcend the entire format. Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom is good for the occasional laugh, but it can’t reverse the decay in an obviously dying genre. If Aquaman 2 were just a movie about Jason Momoa traversing the seas on fantastical sea creatures and bashing up pirates, with an occasional interlude to drink Guiness with his dad, it’d probably be pretty good. Momoa isn’t the world’s greatest actor and still has a tendency to rush through his lines in extended mumbles on occasion, but he’s still the best in the world at being Jason Momoa. And a lot of times a movie needs Jason Momoa more than it needs a great actor.  But… you know… gotta have a whole universe in these things, and that requires a Big Bad with an evil plan and whole backstory and blah blah blah, and the next thing you know you’re knee deep in alternate universes.  Okay, so Aquaman 2 doesn’t exactly have a multi-verse, but after part one introduced us to the previously-hidden undersea world of Atlantis (of which Aquaman is now king), we now find that there is an entire other, evil version of Atlantis also hidden underwater. But, like, under icecaps and volcanos and shit. Bizarro Atlantis? Sure, why not. Randall Park, playing a wise-cracking scientist, goes looking for Atlantis under the north sea ice cap one day, only to find a big scary octopus thingy that kills his friend instead. Then this guy the Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen) shows up, along with his whole militia, to “help” Randall Park further explore this undersea world. (The scary octopus one, anyway, which I guess is different from the undersea world where Aquaman is… you know what? Not important). This Black Manta guy, who is very serious, wants to kill Aquaman, because Aquaman killed Black Manta’s father in the last movie (don’t really remember that part, mostly I remember a giant octopus who played drums). And I guess exploring under this ice cap helps Black Manta further that goal somehow? Unclear! Not a lot of coherent motivations in this movie, to be honest.  Anyway, Black Manta discovers a magical trident that immediately possesses him like the ring in Lord of the Rings, giving him a psychological connection to an ancient evil king who promises to give Manta Aquaman-killing powers. Soon, Manta has a whole fleet of ancient evil boats powered by orichalcum, an energy source infinitely more powerful and damaging to the environment than even fossil fuels. Manta (with the help of poor Randall Park) has to steal the orichalcum from the Atlanteans, who stopped using it long ago, but keep it in ancient vaults for some reason. Soon Manta is trying to terra form the entire planet with a massive orichalcum furnace that he keeps burning 24/7. Which, again, furthers his goal of killing Aquaman somehow.  Aquaman has to stop this guy, and in order to do that best, he concludes that he should go free his brother, Orm (Orm!), played by Patrick Wilson, who is being held in a desert prison guarded by vampire creatures (where he was put after Aquaman vanquished him in the previous movie). This leads to a whole scene of Aquaman infiltrating the vampire prison in the desert with his superintelligent octopus sidekick, kicking the asses of various giant scorpion horses and vampire ghouls along the way. It’s hard not to respect how few black-clad commandos there are in Aquaman 2. James Wan simply refuses to do something that easy; he is to CGI bad guy monsters what Homer was with the star wipe.  So it seems that Black Manta controls an orecchiette mine (I’m never going to remember orichalcum, I’m sorry) on an island in the South Pacific. Only all the orecchiette he’s burning in his giant furnace is mutating all the flora and fauna! So when Aquaman and Orm (Orm!) get there to stop Black Manta’s evil plans, they first have to fight off all manner of giant bugs, rats, and man-eating flowers, Godzilla-style.  Aquaman 2 isn’t much for coherence, but boy does it have a lot of stuff. It might be one of the most stuff-filled movies I’ve ever seen, breezing effortlessly from desert vampires and giant scorpions to evil submarines and giant fauna, ultimately culminating in an ungodly orgy of Atlantean sea beasts doing barely comprehensible battle with an entire army of zombie demon people — these last being the civilization of Necris, led by the ancient evil king who gave Black Manta the vision, and once the rival of the king of Atlantis, before his greed and orecchiette-burning turned his entire civilization into ghouls who were encased in the ice caps until Mantis thawed them out again. Hopefully Aquaman and Orm (Orm!) can vanquish them back to a different realm whence they can stay until required by a plot device in a future movie. It’s exhausting just recounting it all, and you can’t help but be a little impressed with the sheer volume of inventiveness, even if it mostly kind of looks like half-assed CGI wingdings crammed together most of the time. Even when it’s mostly bad, there’s a vibe to it missing from a lot of other movies like this. It’s ludicrous but never lazy; Wan is a maximalist for maximalism’s sake, and the glee he seems to take in all this is occasionally contagious in spite of the material. It’s just a shame that he has to try to cram in all these kingdoms.  It’s the old portal problem. Once you’ve already had a superhero save the world, pretty soon he has to save the universe, then the space-time continuum, then the fabric of reality and matter itself... If you never kill off any characters, they have to keep existing somewhere. And so you inevitably end up with a kind of Mormon afterlife superhero universe where everyone just sort of gets their own planet. And where’s the drama in that? Do we need this much continuity in movies? It is hostile to basic reason. No one cares! Just start the story over again wherever you feel like it! Wan does what he has to do, but eventually the story all comes down to a pro wrestling-esque fist fight, albeit with magical tridents and lots of CGI window-dressing. I think Jason Momoa might’ve yelled “Nobody messes with my woman!” at one point, or something to that effect. I don’t really remember, the memory began to degrade basically the second it was formed. Probably for the best. I think my favorite part of the trailer was Black Manta saying he was going to “burn Aquaman’s kingdom to the ground”. Burn his undersea kingdom to the ground. "
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," Well, folks. It all ends here. We’ve seen four DCEU films in the year that was 2023, and as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom hits theaters, it becomes clear that the franchise, as we knew it, is no more. With a reset being prepped over the next year, Jason Momoa helms this final film. Does Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom go out with a splash? Or will it fade away with a mere whimper? Read on.  The movie opens as Aquaman (Jason Momoa) struggles with “adulting.” He’s happily coupled with Mera (Amber Heard), and they now have an adorable baby. However, he also is the King of Atlantis. While it is “Good to Be the King,” it’s hard. Especially if you’re Arthur Curry. So, when Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) resurfaces with a renewed quest for vengeance, Aquaman sees few options that don’t involve teaming up with his conflicted brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). Will they be able to save Atlantis? YAHYA ABDUL-MATEEN II as Black Manta in Warner Bros. Pictures’ action adventure “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release.

Nicole Kidman, Randall Park, Temuera Morrison, Dolph Lundgren, Martin Short and John Rhys-Davies co-star in the movie. James Wan directs Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom from a script by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. From the outset, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom finds itself weighed down by a clunky script with no idea what it wants to be. Ultimately, with a lead like Jason Momoa and a character like Aquaman, the film is at its best when it leans into the absurdity inherent in this story. Aquaman rides sea horses for crying out loud. Jason Momoa shines when he can exist as his winking, jovial self. This is true in every movie. He has a very specific charm.  Unfortunately, the script’s struggles result in massive tonal swings throughout the story. As a result, there are many moments when it feels like no one is in the same film. This is at its most pronounced when the story shifts to focus on Black Manta.  Abdul-Mateen II is digging into some bleak, villainous places to bring his villain back to life. However, despite how hard he tries to inject life into these sequences, they fall flat, especially opposite Momoa and Wilson. To make matters worse, Abdul-Mateen II (and, to a lesser extent, Wilson) spends large portions of the film stuck delivering clunky exposition dumps. Johnson-McGoldrick’s script attempts to shoehorn new lore, new technology and new locations into this roughly two-hour movie, and the age-old adage of “show, don’t tell” is completely ignored. To be blunt, large sections of this film feel like clumsy videogame cutscenes.  Similarly, in a world that gave us Avatar: The Way of Water, Aquaman struggles when venturing into his underwater home. Surprisingly, a 3D screening does little to dispel any videogame comparisons. It only serves to flatten what in previous films were beautiful ocean backdrops and highlight clunky effects on the humans. Underwater hair will never look right, it seems.  (L-r) PATRICK WILSON as Orm and JASON MOMOA as Aquaman in Warner Bros. Pictures’ action adventure “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” a Warner Bros.

We’ve lived with this franchise since 2013, after all. Kids, not in the slightest. There’s no closure. There isn’t even an awareness of life outside Aquaman’s small sphere. Ultimately, The Flash brings more closure to this universe. Watching this decade-spanning series go with this basic, paint-by-numbers sequel is honestly pretty disappointing. Here’s to seeing where James Gunn takes things in 2025.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."
"Dec 23, 2023",positive," Someday, now that it’s all over, someone’s going to write a big fat tell-all about just what exactly happened to the DCEU, a project with certainly as much potential as the Marvel stuff, but one so grossly mismanaged that the studio and filmmakers destroyed multiple massive tentpole films with second-guessing and endless rewrites and reshoots, and eventually just tossed the whole thing right in the trash. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the final entry in this iteration. Thankfully, despite years of tinkering, it’s not as much of a coffin nail as it could be. In fact, it’s actually sort of fun. We rejoin Arthur Curry, the King of Atlantis (Jason Momoa), now a father of a baby son conceived with Queen Mera (Amber Heard). His kingdom is mired in bureaucracy, but other than that things seem to be going smoothly. That is, until Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the big bad from the first movie, turns up. Somehow, he’s got hold of ancient Atlantean tech and a massive crew of mercenaries, and he’s still hellbent on avenging the death of his father at Aquaman’s hands. He gets possessed by the spirit of a big black trident called… “the Black Trident,” and then sets about using some weird green stuff called oricalchum to accelerate global warming for reasons it’s honestly too silly to reveal here. The finest quality that the original film possessed — in fact, maybe the engine that made it work at all — was its unabashed dorkiness. Everyone, thankfully, got together and collectively realized that there was absolutely no way to make Aquaman seem cool and that taking any of it seriously was a terrible idea. That lesson has blessedly been followed for this installment, The Lost Kingdom spends most of its time as a buddy road movie with Arthur bonding with his former enemy, half-brother Orm (an always-game Patrick Wilson), and cracking silly jokes while riding glowing seahorses or goofing off with his octopus sidekick Topo. Yes, you read that right, and no, there’s not enough Topo in this movie. It’s all deeply silly stuff, the film hurtling through its nonsensical plot and caring not one iota for realism or logic. Even its climate-change warnings seem like a bit of a goof; it’s giving the kind of energy you might have found in one of Stephen Sommers’ ’90s-era Mummy flicks. Director James Wan simply has a knack for a level of ludicrousness, which he augments with a pleasingly colorful visual design, and when the action starts happening, it’s at least relatively fluid. On the other hand, this is obviously a salvage job of epic proportions. Shifting release dates and tales of endless re-shoots and script drafts have dogged this one for years (its first reported screenings were in 2021). Clearly, it’s been heavily tinkered with. Whole entire scenes take place in mostly digital wide shots packed with CG doubles for the actors. Endless gobs of expository dialogue are delivered by the back of someone’s head or during shots establishing locations. Most of Amber Heard’s shots in the climactic action sequences look uncannily like a digital double (let’s not speculate on why they might have cut her from most of the movie). But even for a film created largely from people standing in front of a green screen, The Lost Kingdom feels haphazardly cobbled together; there’s an undeniable mishmash of tones at play, as well as plenty of hiccups in momentum. Still, given that production nightmare, things could have been a lot worse. Nobody was exactly clamoring for a second Aquaman movie anyway, but the first one made a billion bucks or two, so here we are. Under the circumstances, it’s fair to consider that it might even be the best version of itself that was ever possible. Weirdly, this movie ends with Arthur doing an “I am Aquaman!” mic drop; referencing the (Marvel) movie that jump-started all this superhero stuff in the first place to mark the end of the DC universe seems oddly fitting. Perhaps, we’ve at last reached a real tipping point. At the very least, this version of the franchise is over, and we don’t have to care or think about it anymore, ever again.

"Dec 23, 2023",positive,"I’m not going to pretend this movie is anything new or great, but it does occasionally manage to be fun and subversive enough to act as a solid sequel and a fitting sendoff to an extended superhero universe that never really found its footing. "
"Dec 23, 2023",negative," NOW IN THEATERS! James Wan’s Aquaman and the Last Kingdom is the stupidest superhero film I’ve ever seen. That list includes Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, all the Fantastic Fours, and, yes, Howard the Duck. Each of these films, despite their evident failures, had at least sparks of redeeming value, be it unintentional camp, unrealized ambition, a go-for-broke attitude, a good performance, or whatever. The latest Aquaman has no redeeming value. Judging by the audience’s reactions on the way out of the theater, it will have a hell of a time recouping its bloated $205M price tag. Who wants to be subjected to water torture for 2 hours? Oh, f**k it. Does anyone really care about the plot in films like this anymore? The Lost Kingdom is a big middle finger to the audience, with no character development, no emotional arc, special effects that would have seemed blurry ten years ago, and Amber Heard. Clearly, the producers couldn’t replace or edit her character out, post-that-debacle, so instead they opted for reducing her character to the bare minimum requirements. Heard’s Mera shows up sporadically to serve the plot and then disappears, possessing the motivation of a sea anemone. But then, the same applies to the entire narrative; “slap-dash” would be a compliment when it comes to describing the editing/pacing/headache-inducing assault on the senses that is this sordid excuse for entertainment. You’d think scenes of characters piercing waves on translucent seahorses, or Aquaman battling giant insects, or armies clashing would at least inspire an inkling of a sense of awe or wonder, but you’d be wrong. Like being stuck in a turbulent, spinning submarine, it just provokes seasickness and seems to go on and on. Momoa hams it way up – as in, the dial’s turned to 100. It’s like he’s got nothing to lose: a pompous, self-aware, nearly humorless showcase of underserved star power. I liked him well enough in the first one, but his one-note shtick wears thin very quickly. Kidman phones it in big time, in perhaps one of the most embarrassing performances of her career. Was someone feeding her lines on set? Because, I swear, she hasn’t the soggiest clue what the eff is going on. Add a dose of agenda-pushing, in this case, the Big, Poorly-Addressed Issue being Global Warming, and I’ll go even further than simply stating Aquaman and the Last Kingdom is one of the worst superhero films – it’s one of the worst films ever, period. But then, I thought Wonka was Cats–level atrocious, and behold: critics seem to like it, audiences are lapping it up. Perhaps with age, I am becoming an old curmudgeon. Or maybe I just expect more from our filmmakers and from the audiences that lap up whatever is served to them. I implore you to go see The Holdovers this Christmas season and not waste your hard-earned cash on dreck like this. One thing that I can confidently say about Aquaman is that it tries really hard not to disappoint. I mean, this movie really goes for it! In... LOS ANGELES ASIAN PACIFIC FILM FESTIVAL 2022 REVIEW!

"Dec 23, 2023",positive," Superheroes are so busy doing amazing things, it’s easy to forget many of them also live normal lives in which they have friends, families, and interests that don’t involve interrupting crimes or stopping villains. Of course, there are challenges to keeping these worlds separate and it has the potential to be catastrophic if or when they collide. Watching these heroes evolve can be very engaging and relatable since viewers are less likely to connect with the characters’ more daring antics. In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the underwater champion is now a devoted father juggling his commitments as king of Atlantis. After defeating his power-hungry brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) assumed the throne. While he enjoys using his abilities to defend the surface and water worlds alike, he finds many of his other kingly duties boring. On the other hand, caring for his infant son with Mera (Amber Heard) and bonding with his dad (Temuera Morrison) over fatherhood is the highlight of each day. But Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still seething after his previous defeat, vowing to finally avenge his father by combining ancient and modern technology to create unstoppable weaponry with the aid of a well-meaning scientist (Randall Park). Except Manta’s revenge could come at the cost of the entire planet as he’s convinced he must sacrifice the world to achieve his goals. Since his first appearance in 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Aquaman has been one of the current DCU’s most appealing heroes. He’s self-assured, funny and determined, drawing viewers in with his charming personality. It’s always felt like the character had a lot in common with Momoa, but the partition separating the actor from the superhero seems to be even thinner now. Arthur’s wardrobe looks like it was lifted directly from Momoa’s closet. He also presented writer-director James Wan with a treatment for the film that rested on Aquaman being a father and environmentalist, mimicking his own life. All the rest of the original cast also reprises their roles, maintaining the familiarity of their earlier appearances. Though seeing Park appear on screen is a bit of a surprise, since he’s one of a short list of actors to appear in both the Marvel and DC universes, particularly this close together. As Arthur must call on Orm for help, there’s opportunity for some amusing banter between the brothers. The teasing continues for much of the narrative, generating a fair amount of laughter throughout. Conversely, Black Manta’s story is very hostile with no room for humour, creating a stark contrast between the two and forcing Aquaman to shift gears when they share the screen. While this picture is still better than many of DC’s other offerings, the studio continues to struggle with balancing light and dark. However, as it’s now under new management with James Gunn and Peter Safran becoming co-CEOs, there’s no telling where the future lies. To that end, where most credit sequences provide a sneak peek for upcoming stories, this one stays grounded in the present. The film is available in 3D, but don’t expect any gimmicks like exploding debris flying towards the audience. Instead, it’s used to provide depth to many of the scenes — the value of that will be based on individual preferences. That said, the action sequences are expectedly big with giant land and sea creatures, new mechanized enemies and an army of mutated monsters. One of the most intriguing machines is an octopus-shaped vehicle that can travel via land, air and sea, while also quickly overpowering its opponents. Parts of the two-hour film feel a little bogged down, but it does well to keep a lively pace and wrap everything up the best way possible, even if it’s a tad abrupt.

"Dec 23, 2023",negative,"The DCU sets up Jason Momoa's Aquaman to be rowdy and drunk, and then makes him a Daddy...go figure. Momoa is the highlight, along with the Lobster who keeps losing limps, but the film can't overcome the same old, same old superhero storyline and battles."
"Dec 23, 2023",positive," Aquaman, aka Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), battles Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) in director James Wan’s “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” (Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Comics.) Ten years and 15 movies later (16 if you count Zack Snyder’s re-edit of “Justice League”), the DC Extended Universe arrives at its apparent endpoint with “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” — and at least we’re going out with a laugh. Director James Wan, who helmed 2018’s “Aquaman,” creates a fairly rousing spectacle, full of big action moments and serviceable special effects. But the biggest, most watchable effect of them all is Jason Momoa, a frat-boy comedian in the body of an undersea god. In the five years since the last movie, Aquaman, aka Arthur Curry, has had some changes in his life. One is that he’s now the king of Atlantis, and finding the job is pretty boring — all greeting royal visitors and attending endless sessions with the Council of Atlantis, which won’t let him do any of the kingly things he wants to do, such as establish diplomatic relations with the surface dwellers who don’t know of Atlantis’ existence. Even more important, though, is that Aquaman is a dad. He and his queen, Mera (Amber Heard), have a baby boy, Arthur Jr., who’s living on land — in part so Arthur’s landlocked dad (Temuera Morrison) can be called upon as a live-in babysitter while Aquaman is beating up pirates and being king. Arthur learns that an old enemy has returned: David Kane, aka Black Manta (again played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Kane is in search of an ancient Atlantean power that will restore his energy suit. He’s enlisted Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), the hapless marine biologist who’s been searching for Atlantis, to help find this power source in Antarctica. Kane’s plan is to power up so he can take revenge on Aquaman, who allowed Kane’s father to die in the first movie. Shin helps Kane find that power source: The Black Trident, a weapon of Atlantean myth. When Kane touches the trident, he becomes possessed by an ancient monster bent on reclaiming global power — using a long-banned Atlantean fuel that produces enough greenhouse gases to make global warming happen even faster. (Yes, Momoa — who shares story credit on the movie — is a not-so-secret eco-warrior. So that’s another reason to like him.) After Kane’s first attack on Atlantis, using some stolen ancient Atlantean tech Shin found in Antarctica, Aquaman realizes the only way to beat Kane is to team up with the last person on Earth he wants to see again: His half-brother, Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson), with whom Aquaman battled for the throne in the first movie. Aquaman must bust Orm out of a desert prison — the first of many set pieces on the way to the big all-the-marbles battle at the movie’s conclusion. The “we ain’t brothers and we ain’t friends” banter between Aquaman and Orm is pretty good, as action movies go, and Momoa and Wilson have some good buddy-comedy rapport. And it’s fun to see the gang back together, including Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus, Nicole Kidman as the retired queen Atlanna, and even Heard (whose role feels truncated here, possibly focus-grouped out of some big scenes). The weak spot here is the villain — Kane’s revenge motivation is dull, and the backstory to explain the ancient baddie who takes Kane over comes too late and is too sketchy to be interesting.  Watching “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” nearly made me wish director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran, who are now tasked with rebuilding DC’s movie fortunes from the ground up, would consider keeping Momoa around for future installments. He’s got the looks, the muscles and the charm of a happy-go-lucky superhero — it would be cool if somebody would just let him keep doing that."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"Just like toxic seaweed, it's a tangled and rotten mess of a superhero film with uneven visual effects, cringeworthy dialogue, and a sloppy plot. The filmmakers mistakenly think that Aquaman's charisma is defined by 'surf dude' whooping and hollering. "
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," The DCEU comes to an ignominious end with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, a sequel to the 2019 blockbuster. DC’s cinematic output has been wildly uneven, from highs like Wonder Woman to lows like Shazam! Fury of the Gods. That kind of all-over-the-place track record is reflected in this new outing. It’s a hot mess. The story is simultaneously overly complicated and overly simplistic. Villian Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) has vowed to destroy Aquaman (Jason Momoa) for killing his father in the first film. To do this, he harnesses a special element called Orichalcum that contains great power, along with a link to a fabled lost kingdom. Using the Orichalcum has the negative side effect of speeding up global warming. That’s the basic gist of the story – a standard, low-stakes “You killed my [whatever], so now I’m going to kill you!” tale. Aquaman turns to his imprisoned brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) for assistance in foiling Black Manta. At the same time, the movie tries to build a mythology. There’s complex talk about the creation of a unique trident and the history of the kingdom of Necrus, which was inhabited by demons and became frozen in time. None of this is particularly satisfying because Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom only utilizes those concepts as exposition. When something needs explained, there’s a boring information dump, after which the plot moves on to whatever’s next, without providing much big-picture context. This approach leads to a disjointed feel. Various sections don’t seem to go together. A sequence where Aquaman and Orm venture to a land where the climate has mutated rats and grasshoppers to thousands of times their normal size is the only genuinely entertaining part, but it comes out of nowhere and is promptly forgotten. Same goes for an encounter with a crime lord Kingfish (voiced by Martin Short) whose sole purpose is to point the brothers in the right direction. What a long way to go for such a minimal outcome. Important characters from the original are weirdly sidelined. Nicole Kidman is back as Aquaman’s mother Atlanna. She gets little screen time, and when she does, the Oscar-winning actress is reduced to spewing platitudes at the aquatic superhero, as opposed to having a function as she did in the first film. Amber Heard, who plays Aquaman’s wife Mera, is likewise shoved into the background. The movie keeps emphasizing what a family man Aquaman has become, yet there are few scenes in which he interacts with his spouse. What Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom does offer is an overload of CGI action scenes that become virtually identical by the end. To be fair, several of the images in these scenes look cool in 3D. However, the underwater fights are too cluttered and chaotic to generate tension. Excessive mayhem is not the same as true excitement. Characterization gets tossed aside in the process. Basically, anything the original did well, the sequel botches. DC Films is set to have a different vision going forward, courtesy of new CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran. Their stated aim is to bring more consistency to the DC label onscreen. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a prime example of why an overhaul is desperately needed."
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral," BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — Maybe it has been the long string of bad movies made that were based on DC Comics characters – “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” “Black Adam,” “The Flash” – that have made “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” less of a disaster than expected. The new offering in the endless stream of superhero films is rife with problems from juvenile jokes to an incoherent script but there have been plenty of worse offerings. Jason Momoa returns to the role of the King of the Sea. His old enemy, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), is back and he is stronger than ever because of some ancient Atlantean technology – including a powerful Black Trident – he found buried under the ice in Antarctica. The villain’s plan is to speed up global warming to thaw an evil being who has been a popsicle for centuries. Aquaman realizes he can’t stop the plot on his own and recruits his brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), to help him end the threat. And that is where the script begins to unravel. The first “Aquaman” film had Orm trying to wipe out those who live on land. All is forgiven with a couple of lines of dialogue simply to help move along the plot of the sequel. There isn’t much time to worry about how the brotherly love  makes no sense because writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick cuts-and-pastes every idea from the writer’s handbook: fatherhood, royal uprisings, environmental disasters, greed and brotherly bonds. They are bobbled together in a manner so loosely stitched there are gaping holes big enough for a whale to pass from one plotline to the next. Even a big moment where Aquaman declares himself to the world is a problem as the fish man has been saving the planet for years. The biggest reason the writing problems aren’t as prominent is that by its nature, Aquaman requires more computer-generated imagery than any of the other comic book inspired movies. From the endless flowing of hair to an unlimited army of demons, there are only a few scenes where characters can be quietly developed. The film shows all the signs of the reshoots that director James Wan – who is better known for horror films – had to do in an effort to try and give the film a better story structure. The film never finds a smooth flow but starts and stops as each new idea arises. Any good plot moments are tarnished by jokes aimed at the playground crowd. The fatherhood angle anchors Aquaman but having his infant son urinate on his father’s face – not once but twice – is as cheap a joke that can be made. Please note that even when months pass in the story, baby Arthur doesn’t age. Maybe it is an Atlantean way. Even the casting has problems. Randall Park plays the scientist who helps Black Manta find the lost kingdom. His appearance in the DC world (despite being in the initial “Aquaman”) is jarring as Park has been in more Marvel productions from “WandaVision” to “Ant-Man.” It is like looking at the starting lineup for the Los Angeles Dodgers and there is one San Francisco Giant on their bench. Despite all the story mistakes, bad writing and disjointed script, there is a spark of fun at the heart of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” and it comes from Momoa. He gives his best shot at making the film entertainment, but it is like trying to make jokes at a funeral. And the funeral might be for the end of the current wave of DC Comics movies. Should this be the end, then at least Momoa went down swinging and provided more entertaining moments than the previous three or four DC comics inspired movies combined. That is not high praise because that total remains very low. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," I will say this for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the long-in-the-works sequel to 2018’s Aquaman starring Jason Momoa in the title role: I laughed quite a bit. Does it matter that the funniest parts weren’t supposed to be humorous? Not really. It’s the essential conundrum with this piece of intellectual property from DC Comics. The very concept is absurd, occasionally with a tongue-in-cheek wink. And it’s difficult not to snicker when Oscar-winner Nicole Kidman is forced to spout nonsensical dialogue (“I’ll be sending a cephalopod with you”) and repeat the word “orichalcum”—the legendary metal of Atlantis, which emits greenhouse gases—with deadly seriousness."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," The omens were never good for the last superhero movie of 2023. A changing release date, a growing indifference towards the genre which treated Marvel and DC with equal contempt and Jason Momoa’s widely quoted comments about Aquaman’s future didn’t bode well for the return of the King of Atlantis. The only positive seemed to be the new release date, chosen to capitalise on the holiday market. The sad truth is that Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom needs all the luck it can get. Five years since Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Momoa) had his own film, he now has his hands full as King of Atlantis, as well as being part of the Justice League and planning a wedding. Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), on the other hand, is determined to avenge his father’s death and take down Aquaman once and for all. Armed with the evil powers of the Black Trident, he sets out on a path of destruction, so Aquaman turns to his imprisoned brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) for help. It’s an unlikely alliance, but it’s his best – and only – option. Just like Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, the irreverent rock god of superheroes has undergone a personality change and the film follows suit. This time around, his throwaway lines land with a thud and there’s a general sense of desperation even before the opening catch-up has left the screen. Yet again, there’s a smattering of sixties rock classics –  although Spirit In The Sky is a strange choice of theme tune for an aquatic hero – and DC has released the film in various formats, including that old chestnut, 3D. It doesn’t add anything, except the observation that the only thing not thrown at the film was the kitchen sink. If only some of the budget had been devoted to improving the CGI, we might have stood a chance of recognising Dolph Lundgren and understanding what on earth was going on during the many fight scenes. Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom is a soggy mess – unfunny, over-long and a damp squib when compared to the original and that, let’s face it, was no classic. But at least it has some energy and a sense of fun. It’s not just the kingdom that’s been lost. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is out now on Premium Digital Ownership And Rental and will be available on 4K UHD, Blu-ray and DVD on 18 March."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive,"  It's not easy being king, and it looks like Aquaman is learning this the hard way. Although being a new parent is no walk in the park, it's much better than dealing with the roadblocks and obstructive politics of the Atlantis council and grappling with the rapidly growing threat of climate change. Atlantis is at a crossroads. They must choose whether they wish to stay hidden or reveal themselves to an equally volatile surface world, and Arthur, a product of both worlds, is stuck in the middle.   But politics will have to wait. David Kane, aka Black Manta, has returned, still hellbent on taking revenge on the man who killed his father, and he's willing to take the entire world down with him. With the help of scientists, he has found the Black Trident -- a weapon of immense power forged in the dark, eldritch trenches of Atlantis's history. With this weapon, Black Manta has found a volatile energy source that will spell doom for all the Earth, above and below water. In order to stop Manta, Aquaman will have to join forces with the man who knows him best -- his half-brother, Orm. With the future of his family, kingdom, and all of Earth at stake, Aquaman will have to defy tradition, play nice with his worst enemy, and build a few bridges if possible.   The long-awaited follow-up to 2018's Aquaman has been thwarted on all sidesfrom bad publicity, scandal, and poor marketing from Warner Bros. Despite its tempestuous start, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, directed by James Wan with a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, is a solid film that stays afloat on its own merits. This is as bombastic and grandiose an offering as is typical for theDC Cinematic Universe, and the deluge of drama is a lot to take in, even for the most seasoned of viewers. There is a lot going on in this film, both technically and in the subtext.   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom brings up a lot of ideas in its formidable two-hour runtime. Some of these get addressed fully, while others are lost at sea, only touched upon or resolved in passing. Family, ecology, and forgiveness are the main sticking points here. There are thinly veiled allegories for the current political zeitgeist in the United States, such as hostile, bureaucratic government councils, xenophobia, and a hint of the ongoing culture war. While it would have been interesting to dig into these deeper, Wan casts these more prickly and predictable politics aside in favor of the more immediate, character-driven plot. As it is, the global warming theme is handled with surprising sensitivity. While the Atlanteans are clearly struggling with the rapidly changing climate -- partially Black Manta's doing as well as the surface dwellers' -- Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom does not cast them as helpless victims, dredging up a past and moral ambiguity that feels human and believable.   Jason Momoa's performance as Aquaman works best when he is allowed to express tender humanity and humor -- best achieved when he has an equally tender and human partner to spar with. High-stakes action and explosions aside, it's a real treat seeing Aquaman being a parent, cracking a beer, confiding in his father, and struggling in unglamorous and relatable ways. Even when he's pummeling some unlucky monster or dropping some vulgar witticism, Momoa's Aquaman is deeply emotional and eloquent, elevating this sequel into some genuinely deep and affecting territory. His chemistry with Watchmen and The Conjuring alum Patrick Wilson -- once again giving a nuanced performance as the disgraced former king Orm -- is natural, intimate, and, at times, genuinely hilarious. Having been brought down to the lowest possible level after the events of Aquaman, Orm's character progression is compelling. Stoic and reserved, Wilson explores the character's depth and plays the straight man to Momoa's Wise Guy.   Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's Black Manta is more intense this time around, brought to the brink of madness. He provides a more simmering sort of vindictiveness that can be felt through the screen, making for some truly unsettling sequences. While the entire cast delivers solid performances, the standout performance is the least advertised and most surprising --that of Randall Park as the anti-villainous marine biologist Dr. Shin. An Atlantis fanboy turned unwilling accessory to war and ecological damage, his subtle character progression adds to this film's drama and urgency. Shin is a consistent source of nervous comic relief, contrasting with Arthur's fratboy humor and Orm's deadpan delivery.   While Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay evokes plenty of gasps and laughs, the dialogue is inconsistent. It's stilted in places while smooth, witty, and heartfelt in others. Some attempts at humor don't always land, making for some particularly awkward exchanges. That said, this isn't a huge surprise, given the DCU's track record for bombastic and declarative dialogue.   From a technical standpoint, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has a lot going on. Sometimes, it tries to cover too much, even for its generous runtime. While Wan has a good sense of space, characterization, and direction, he seems beholden to the current DCEU formula, cramming too much action and movement into one sequence. This can make some pivotal action scenes near incomprehensible and even dizzying, especially those taking place in the urban enclaves of Atlantis. This is less obvious in the more open, cavernous spaces of the climactic final battle, much to the film's benefit. The action sequences vary in pacing, quality, and scale, with some being more effective than others. While none of the fight scenes are bad, the action is instantly improved once Orm is back in the picture, adding dynamism to the brothers' back-to-back fighting style.   Being a DCU film, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is filled to the brim with special effects. At times it's pretty seamless. The subterranean and sub-aquatic tech, ships, architecture, and weaponry are stunning. But the effects can be distracting. Environments that rely more heavily on CGI, especially in certain areas of Atlantis, are less immersive and break the flow of the narrative and the visuals. The sea creature designs that make up the less humanlike population of Atlantis are the worst offenders. Except for a couple of characters, these beings almost feel as though they belong in a separate film, obeying different laws of physics than the human cast they spar with.   Aquaman and the Lost King is well-lit, just skirting the current curse HDR has placed on the majority of the cinematic landscape. While the color correction does leave a lot to be desired -- some scenes in Atlantis look washed out as opposed to watercolored -- it does work in some instances, such as the muted and grounded tones of Arthur and his father's rocky, seaside lighthouse home. It also works for grounded and tender moments, like Arthur's heart-to-heart conversations with his father.   Along with its over-the top usage of visual effects and crowded storyline, Aquaman and the Lost King suffers from its overwrought sound design. This film features an overdesigned and nondescript soundtrack, with swelling scare chords and Hans Zimmer-style horns. The composition is loud, bombastic, and typical of the DCEU -- a missed opportunity given the lush, watery setting of Atlantis. However, there are flashes of good composition and music in spaces. There is a lovely recurring synth pad progression in some pivotal moments that creates a foreboding mood of atmosphere and urgency. Unfortunately, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is practically drowned under the sound design, adding to the sensory overload of the movie.   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has strong sea legs in terms of storytelling, but it feels weighed down by its overstuffed elements and flooded sound design. Although marketing may not have given this film the proper gear to paddle with, its solid narrative helps it stay afloat, providing a satisfying and fitting end to this character's arc.   For all its grand visions, action, and explosive panoramic adventures, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is strongest when it explores Arthur's quieter and more intimate side. There is a tender humanity to this tale, with the central characters at their most vulnerable. Mera spends the majority of the film gravely injured or fearing for her son's life alongside Arthur. Atlanna must grapple with her feelings for both her sons, especially Orm, in spite of his criminal actions. Arthur struggles with parenthood and self-doubt as a reluctant political leader, and his father, Tom, allows himself to be vulnerable around his son and infant grandson. David Kane's vengefulness and grief consume him, and Dr. Shin feels powerless to stop the carnage that he unwillingly becomes an accessory to. Not least of all is the tension between the brothers. In some instances, the great action reads almost as a sideshow to these smaller-scale, character-driven scenes.  Aquaman balances his duties as king and as a member of the Justice League, all while planning a wedding. Black Manta is on the hunt for Atlantean tech to help rebuild his armor. Orm plots to escape his Atlantean prison. A pop culture enthusiast, writer and artist with a love of sci-fi, fantasy, horror and aliens. She actually went to school to talk about comics! With Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom looming, Arthur Curry will need help to battle the sadistic Black Manta. Here is everything fans need to know."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," Acting as if it was necessary to rush to the finish line, James Wan’s breathlessly paced follow-up to the billion-dollar hit that was Aquaman may signal the end of the line for this iteration of the DC Universe, but it’s not without a gonzo amount of spectacle. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom once again packs every frame with a ridiculous amount of visual splendor as we follow Jason Momoa’s bro-with-pathos take on the superhero who talks to fish. Is it fun? Sure. Does it have much to offer outside of an elaborate undersea adventure? Not really. How much does that matter? Well, as I said, the DCU is getting a reset after this, so take what you want out of this last hurrah for Arthur Curry and Co. in its current form. Set several years after Arthur (Momoa) took the throne of Atlantis from his scheming half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), he’s now a bored king who balances unengaging bureaucratic affairs with being a husband and father, and having the occasional skirmish with pirates. Meanwhile, David Kane, aka Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), is still seeking revenge against Aquaman for leaving his father to die. With help from Atlantis-obsessed marine biologist Stephen Shin (Randall Park), Kane finds a black trident that imbues him with the powers of a lost enemy of the other ocean kingdoms. With Kane now being much more powerful, Arthur’s only solution is to break Orm out of prison and team up with him to stop the possessed Manta from doing something drastic. While I’ve seen a superhero sequel rely on an uneasy alliance between half-siblings before, this film is less Thor: The Dark World and more The Mummy Returns. There seems to be such a reliance on the familiarity of the Aquaman universe that there’s barely any time to take stock of how wild it all is. So, rather than taking any time to get our feet wet, this film dives right in, repeating some beats of the original but keeping the action constantly moving, opening up the movie to exploring more reasons for sequences full of special effects. None of that is necessarily a complaint. I can’t say there’s a movie that looks nearly as visually remarkable in this way, this side of Avatar: The Way of Water. That said, the confines of a superhero movie do hold Wan back from equaling James Cameron’s unquestionable abilities as the champion blockbuster filmmaker. Many of these DC films tend to be overflowing with characters, as there are so many potential directions. I understandably see the need to fill out all the side roles with notable actors, depending on what happens next. While there’s still an extended cast list in this movie, there seems to be perfunctory reasoning for each of them being around, with little done to add those extra bits of detail to establish further personality. Momoa and Wilson get the lion’s share of screen time and don’t suffer as a result. However, it’s easy to see the strings when Mera (Amber Heard) only shows up to save her husband in critical moments, Dolph Lundgren’s Nereus is there to agree or oppose big decisions, Temuera Morrison’s Tom Curry only has fatherly advice to offer, and Nicole Kidman’s Atlanna is primarily an exposition machine. The previous film introduced us to Arthur’s parents by having Kidman eat fish from a bowl. Atlantis had more of a sense of wonder to it. Oh, and Julie Andrews showed up to play a giant crab monster. I’m not saying this movie doesn’t have a sense of weirdness (Torpo, the drum-playing octopus from the first film, apparently moonlights as a tactical operative, allowing him to tag along for the film’s second act). Still, it does feel a bit more on rails to pair this film down as much as possible to be only a little more than two hours. 2018’s Aquaman felt like a challenge met as far as delivering an epic sea adventure about a man coming into his own into the role he had always denied but was destined for. Here, Arthur is on more of a monster-of-the-week-type journey. It’s not the worst way to handle things, but I did feel a bit antsy about not getting enough “movie” in this movie. Sadly, better time could have been spent with Abdul-Mateen. The actor does all he can with the role, but given how much time we spend watching his side of things, one would hope for more than a fairly one-note character who is reduced even further, given his possessed state. Oddly, Randall Park gets more time to shine in these sections of the film as he becomes conflicted by the heinous actions taken by his mercenary partner (note to self: don’t trust mercenaries). Ultimately, it becomes notable that for an Aquaman sequel with so many undersea kingdoms to explore, we don’t actually meet many new characters, leaving things in a state that’s not all that evolved from where we last saw everyone. Sure, there’s one notable moment featuring a variety of sea creatures that feels the most like a side adventure from Star Wars as possible. Still, for the most part, this film seems fine settling in with the folks we already know and adjusting some of those relationships (mild spoiler: brothers learn to bond). Does the film aim to go anywhere else with its ideas? Well, it expands on the environmentalist concerns of the first by having a plotline literally involving manufactured greenhouse gas emissions that are heavily affecting global warming concerns, but it’s not as if this is a nuanced approach or has much to say beyond, “Yeah, that’s bad.” Meanwhile, Arthur doesn’t have much of a chance to grow either. However, I’m still all for the fun Momoa is clearly having, which plays nicely against Wilson’s pessimistic, uptight handling of Orm. With all of that said, the action is first-rate and executed in a manner that will impress those who know there’s more physical work involved in so much of the CG-enhanced spectacle than they may realize. Wan’s knack for visualizing elaborate set pieces once again pays off here, with cinematographer Don Burgess and the rest of the crew doing what’s needed to keep up with all the craziness on display. Whether or not the stakes of this film are meaningful enough to the viewer, I still have an appreciation for these richly conceived moments that convince me I’m watching superheroes on screen. While Warner Bros. may have left Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom out to dry in terms of various rumors regarding the production, the delays that took place, and now having to sit as the final statement on this version of the DC Universe, Wan didn’t throw in the towel. While less of an accomplishment compared to the first, this still feels like a film full of effort from all involved to deliver a rousing enough adventure. The areas where it comes up lacking notwithstanding, I had fun with this brother-buddy action-comedy. I was even given a giant sea horse, a cocky octopus, and an evil volcano lair to appreciate in the process. The tide may have turned, but Arthur is still, “My man.”"
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," There’s no getting around how nonsensical Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is. The multi-postponed sequel to James Wan’s 2018 original, starring Jason Momoa as the titular fishman, combines the intelligence of Fast & Furious with Lord of the Rings-wannabe aesthetics. In the name of stupidity, you’ll witness Momoa and friends riding on giant seahorses, a hammerhead submarine, and a baby peeing in Aquaman’s mouth.  It’s wild but admittedly entertaining. While bad guys do typical bad things and say standard bad-guy dialogue, a goofy smile will be slapped on your face when Momoa and the scene-stealing Patrick Wilson run amok and attempt to be serious in a movie that you cannot take as such.  Here, we pick up with Momoa’s Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, who is now sitting on the throne of Atlantis. He worked hard to reach and earn that status in the previous film; however, it’s much more tedious than anticipated. A lot of creatures are arguing with each other, and Aquaman’s demands for change are getting shot down by an underwater council. (Hmm. This sounds familiar.) Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, pictured right) will stop at nothing to take Aquaman (Jason Momoa) down once and for all. This time, Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force.  Fortunately, he has his newborn son, sometimes-there wife (Amber Heard) and pop-pop (Temuera Morrison) to escape the ocean-bottom boredom and keep his compass pointed north. But, in classic superhero fashion, when you do a lot of good in the previous movie, you can anticipate a baddie to cook up some madness.  Everyone, welcome back Yahya Abdul-Mateen II’s Black Manta. He’s still thirsty for Aquaman's blood and driven by the need to avenge his father’s death. But now, he’s got some smart tech people and the strength of ancient evil on his side in the form of a black-and-green trident.  Hey, we can all bang our heads on keyboards and package it as art, right? It’s all good fun. Don’t worry! Yes, expect eye rolls aplenty, especially in the film's opening. But then, after maybe 20 minutes or so, this underwater heist (involving this special green ooze or something) supercharges the amusement meter. Director James Wan throws his signature wide pan shots and kinetic energy into the mix during a cat-and-mouse game, elevating the material to a realm better worth your time. To defeat Black Manta, Aquama (Jason Momoa, right) will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction. Actually, there are quite a few solid action sequences. Look out for Momoa and Wilson’s prison escape sequence that rolls out into a Pirates of the Caribbean style of looney. Wilson and Wan clearly understand each other, and Wilson knows how to dial into some otherworldly awesome. Do you remember where he took Insidious 2? Insidious 2 is a good example of this movie’s tone. It’s just straight-up bonkers and laundry-folding entertainment at its finest. So, yeah. You’ll laugh at parts the movie probably didn’t want you to laugh at, especially one baby-snatching sequence that involves all the heroes letting out the most dramatic “nooooo”s you’ve ever heard in your life. And this is coming from a guy who sat through all of George Lucas’ tweaked versions of Star Wars. Plus, this Aquaman has a cute and funny octopus character and a turtle-crab creature (voiced by John Rhys-Davies of Lord of the Rings fame).

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,Feels like everyone just stopped trying a while ago and left this last whimper from the DCEU to float into theatres. 
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," Given their fairly simple story bases, their easy-to-understand characters that are already defined and previously presented from their source medium – comic films are falling into the rut of blending together in a four-colour melange of expected plots and character outcomes.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is Warner Brothers/ DC Comics latest sacrificial offering to the altar of comic properties. And while the film isn’t bad in itself, it’s pretty clear that there’s a bit of a schism in deciding how to present this film and its hero.  The story: building on the foundations of the previous film, which established Aquaman/Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the lost heir to the throne of the underwater mythical Kingdom of Atlantis, this sequel sees Arthur as a married man to Mera (Amber Heard), daughter to King Nereus of Xebel  (Dolph Lundgren). He’s a father, and oh yeah, the King. It’s a tough job, but somebody has to do it.  He’s a working man, living a good life on land and in the sea, leading his xenophobic Atlanteans and struggling to get some sleep while learning to change the diapers of his infant son. The audience is supposed to accept Arthur as this working-class hero who also has noble blood lineage and able to withstand the enormous pressures of the depths and bench-press Russian Akula-class attack submarines. Second banana villain, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) shows up out of revenge for the death of his father in the first film. Assisted by Atlantis-obsessed scientist, Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), they discover a forgotten lost Kingdom that has a power source capable of giving Black Manta the power he needs to avenge his father’s death, but at the cost of the world’s climate. When does Arthur Curry sleep? This illustrates the conflict in presenting our hero. He’s a super-hero, a king of an underwater kingdom, yet he loves his moments living with his father, lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison) on land with his family. There are light-hearted family moments that are meant to make him more human and relatable, despite his super-powers and access to technology and a culture, light-years ahead of anything on land.  Humour is meant to be the glue in which director James Wan cements the character to the storyline. It’s similar to the way we were introduced to Marvel’s The Guardians of the Galaxy in which the hero, Star-Lord, a teen-ager abducted by alien scavengers, grows up to be a wise-cracking, 80’s music-lovin’ irreverent space-rogue. Humour brings down the lofty and elevated tones that our four-colour heroes represent in comic pages and there’s a lot of that sort of humour in this film.  It’s old hat though. Not to say that the comedic moments of Arthur getting peed on by his infant son or trash-talking his younger half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) aren’t funny. But by now, it’s a formulaic mechanism used to curry favour with the audience. It added an element of predictability to the film that was patently apparent to the audience who, at the screening I attended, laughed as if at dad jokes..  It’s a comic-fantasy that gets a passing grade, but not a high one. What’s weird is that is actually a high score for the Warner Brothers brand of comic movies. Jason Momoa’s reliance on low-brow jokes and simple family values as the primary motivations for the character of Aquaman is a bit hard to accept with his chosen superhero role. Isn’t being a King enough of a job? Why would he bother to protect the seas while at the same time live in an abandoned lighthouse on a rocky shore? He’s the King of Atlantis – surely, he could find a better home in the depths for his family? But part of accepting the schtick of comic stories is that we accept these character choices and go along with them in the spirit of a willing suspension of disbelief. Still, it’s a lot to swallow.  The family moments of reconciliation do manage to elicit a level of feel-good spirit with the audience. That, and the cameo moments of character voices by the likes of Martin Short and one of my particular favourites, John Rhys-Davies, are genuine comedic surprises that add a level of unexpected endearment.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom isn’t an unentertaining film, but the missing scenes - like Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton’s rumoured Batman appearances - definitely do make one wonder if there will be an extended version of the film. However, when you consider that these might not work well with the schlock, it does manage to provide an extra significance for the what was really lost in this film.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Directed by James Wan. Starring Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Temeura Morrison, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Martin Short, John Rhys-Davies. Opens in theatres Friday, December 22."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  Who could have guessed “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” would be this bad? It isn’t so much being released as being allowed to wash up on shore. Who could have guessed “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” would be this bad? It isn’t so much being released as being allowed to wash up on shore. In “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” the title character (Jason Momoa, right) enlists his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to battle the villain Black Manta, figuring two fish heads are better than one in the battle against aquatic evil. The first: “How bad could it be?” Answer: Extremely bad. The CGI-drenched movie isn’t so much being released as it is being allowed to wash up on shore. There wasn’t even a red-carpet premiere in L.A. for it. The second: “How much of Amber Heard has been cut out of it?” Answer: A lot. She’s been reduced from Jason Momoa’s co-star to cameo status. Nobody was expecting this “Aquaman” sequel to be a winner. Not with all the reports of delays and reshoots. The changes included trimming Heard’s scenes to placate Johnny Depp fanboys, following her courtroom defeat in a defamation suit sparked by Depp, her former husband. This is also the final film in the DC Extended Universe, which is wheezing to a close after 10 years of highs (“Wonder Woman,” the first “Aquaman”) and more recent lows (“Black Adam,” “The Suicide Squad”). It will be replaced by a new film franchise of DC Comics characters, cleverly titled DC Universe. The abandonment of the DCEU could have been a creative boost for returning “Aquaman” director James Wan. Freed from having to connect the dots of an ongoing franchise, he could have created a stand-alone film with fresh ideas and a new villain. To quote the dude-bro dialogue of screenwriter David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Momoa’s buff, scruffy and smirking Aquaman is now “the king of frickin’ Atlantis.” He’s also the delighted father of a newborn son with wife Mera (Heard), who is absent so much that Aquaman almost seems like a single dad. Aquaman will be obliged to “save the world’s ass” from an environmental threat posed by a bilious green substance called orichalcum, which is like climate change on steroids. To do so he’ll have to wade through a couple of leftover grudges from the previous film. The first involves Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), the humourless pirate turned bug-helmeted supervillain, who is still grieving his father’s death and still determined to make Aquaman and all of Atlantis pay for it. He’s assisted by a reluctant Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), another returning character, who “just wanted to see Atlantis” and instead finds himself forced to be Black Manta’s tech guy. The second grudge involves Aquaman’s estranged half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), the former king of frickin’ Atlantis, who is wasting away in jail on account of his bad-assery in the previous film. When Black Manta acquires a magical Black Trident and, along with it, the air-polluting and glacier-melting powers of orichalcum, Aquaman turns to Orm for assistance, figuring two fish heads are better than one in the battle against aquatic evil. Orm isn’t interested, natch, and has to be dragged into the fray. The potential for buddy-comedy hijinks is there and some of it is realized. The film earns a slight chuckle when the duo end up on an island and Aquaman cons Orm into eating a giant live cockroach, which Orm actually finds delicious. But the potential for laughs is mostly squandered, as the banal banter follows along predictable lines that could be summarized as “You suck! No, you suck!” Other returning characters are similarly ill-used, including Nicole Kidman as warrior mom Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as politically minded King Nereus and a musical CGI octopus named Topo. Speaking of CGI, it’s the worst aspect of “The Lost Kingdom.” Grossly overblown and palpably fake, all the more so in the 3D version I saw, it makes the underwater scenes look like a crowded fish tank abandoned by its owner. It’s as if he went to the studio’s digital vault and just grabbed any creepy thing he could find, possibly in the vain hope of distracting viewers from noticing he’s created what might just be the worst movie of 2023.

"Dec 22, 2023",positive," It’s last swim for the troubled DC Extended Universe, planned for an overall rethink, as Jason Momoa returns as the King of Atlantis in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” In some important ways, the sequel laps the original. In others, it — and its mega-franchise — seem destined to sink without a ripple. When last we saw Arthur Curry (Momoa), he was lying face-down drunk in a puddle in the jokey post-credits scene of “The Flash.”  But storywise, we left him in triumph at the end of 2018’s “Aquaman,”  having defeated his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who was driven by  semi-hilarious delusions of grandeur (“Ocean Master,” Orm wants them to call him). Arthur has  become  King of Atlantis.  Leaving aside the outmoded notions of the first film (Why isn’t Arthur’s mom, Queen Atlanna, allowed to rule? She is played by Nicole Kidman), the whole setup smacks of too much, too soon.  Arthur, essentially a biker dude from the surface world who can swim fast and talk to fish but does not know Atlantean history or how the nation’s political system works,  is apparently fit to be king. Cool.  James Gunn and Peter Safran have shared the beginnings of their eight- to 10-year plan for a more coherent series of Superman, Batman and other superhero movies and shows, and it won’t be Marvel 2.0, Gunn promised. Anyhoo, the end of the last film left the door open to  Ocean Master rejoining the fold. As they clapped him in chains, Arthur said, “When you’re ready, let’s talk.” And that’s just what happens when the ineffectual  villain of the first one, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), finds an ancient Atlantean weapon  and suddenly becomes  much more powerful. Bringing big One True Ring energy, Manta finds himself guided by a malevolent force  to destroy the world by burning fuel that releases greenhouse gases. So nice brother Arthur has to recruit mean brother Orm to stop that, because they agree it would be bad, and we’re off.  “Lost Kingdom” rings alarm bells over the climate crisis in earnest if clumsy fashion. It’s always jarring to hear members of an ancient undersea civilization speaking in American surface idioms, perhaps never more so than when the queen decries “greenhouse gases” — do they even have greenhouses in Atlantis? In real life, Momoa is a dedicated environmental activist and co-wrote the story, so his sincerity isn’t in question; one just wishes they could have made that pill go down easier. (By the way, 1987’s disastrous “Superman IV: The Quest for Peace”   was from a story co-written by its star, the late Christopher Reeve.) The experience of watching “Lost Kingdom” (directed by James Wan, as was “Aquaman”) is often a fun one, though. Where the first movie felt like a superhero version of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” this sequel is a buddy cop movie: Arthur, the freewheeling, fight-first-sort-it-out-later one and Orm,  the  by-the-book stickler.  Wilson is a skilled actor who doesn’t play a one-note foil for Momoa’s antics. Along with some good work by returning screenwriter and longtime Wan collaborator David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Wilson fleshes out Orm’s motivations and worldview enough to make his redemption arc believable.  The  underwater worlds are just fine, though there’s a lack of physics in the CGI action that rob the fights of dramatic weight. As a sequel, “Lost Kingdom” feels lighter, which is an improvement. Despite  reducing the chemistry-free interactions between Arthur and his lady love, Mera (Amber Heard), it leans into the idea of superhero as family man, to humanizing effect. This leads to some new-parenting jokes — most viewers won’t expect to see Momoa peed on as much as he is here.  The first “Aquaman” was, by far, the biggest grosser in the DC Extended Universe, and  Momoa has expressed doubt over the likelihood of his return as the character in the new plans. Losing him would be a shame. He balances the mellow biker-dude vibe with something hidden inside that’s ready to be roused. These movies allowed Arthur not to be the smartest guy in the room, a refreshing reversal. All of it resulted in  one of the DCEU’s most alive-feeling characters.  And for a franchise with  arguably more failures than successes, that’s not something to throw away easily. (One of the strengths of incoming rebooter James Gunn is reconceiving lightly regarded characters, as he did with  “Guardians of the Galaxy.”) “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” may not be consequential in the long run, but it’s a mostly diverting, upbeat closer, one that could hint at the tone of things to come."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Let’s get this over with so we can pretend it never happened. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) is not good. For a Warner Bros feature presentation, the same studio that gave us Barbie (2023) and closed 2022 with Babylon, what we have is 124 minutes of fish vomit. Fish vomiting is rare, so when it happens, it’s an indication of a fatal condition and time for little Chips to visit Sea World by way of the nearest commode. Who cares what it’s about the backstory you get in the first ten minutes is a mish-mosh of a backstory that was part Aquaman (2018) and part transcribed fever dream from a film that wasn’t actually produced. Everything else that unfolds over the next 104 minutes is Arthur complaining about responsibility while splitting time between dry land where his baby son lives with Grandpa Tom (Temuera Morrison) and under the sea where he has to be King of Atlantis. Apparently being king is boring because he never shuts up about it. Other returning Good Guys are Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), Orm (Patrick Wilson), and King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren). Antagonists are Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who’s still salty from the actions of the original, and his rescuer/hostage Dr David Shin (Randall Park). There’s a convoluted plan to accelerate global warming so Manta can get at the gooey center of a glacier in the Antarctic, obtain a mantle of power, destroy Aquaman, and rule the world. Shin regrets most of his choices and whining comprises the bulk of his on-screen time. The whole of the story has a very loose, sophomoric feel. Jason Momoa is listed as one of the writers, and yes, it contains the dialogue of a man who likes acting cool but only learned how to act cool from 1960s rebellion movies. If he had sleeves, there’d be a pack of smokes rolled up in them. Right off the bat, everything about Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom looks artificial, like a fresh wig right out of the bag, four-day-old lip filler, and red velvet cake box mix-artificial. Every scene has a green-screen shimmer to it, and the scenes that were green-screened weren’t digitally smoothed. The casual viewer may find themselves thinking, is this an actor, or has everyone been replaced with CGI? I thought that a lot, as if scenes not needing dialog were inserted and CGI scans used to speed up postproduction. Hailey Bailey’s The Little Mermaid (2023) has a more polished look and she spent most of the movie chilling with an animated crab. I don’t like trashing hard work, especially for an industry that’s been so maligned over the last eight months, but Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom looks awful. It looks rushed and incomplete, and the story is sloppy. Jason Momoa for all of the irreverence of Arthur’s previous appearances, feels the most ad-libbed, and not in a good way. He’s very strong and he’s very pretty, but unless there’s a director willing to work with him on his delivery, he will never not look like all of his roles were better suited for silent films. There’s a certain actress whom I won’t name because I refuse to give her ink, who probably looks the most artificial, outside of the seahorse that actually neighs or the genetically enhanced octopus who acts rings around Wilson and Mamoa. Every time she was on screen (screentime that audiences were assured would be diminished because no one likes her) – the screening I attended went dead silent. Whatever diminished role she may have had, there was still plenty of screen time. It’s like seeing your high school bully accept an award for saving kittens she pretends she didn’t strap to branches in trees. There are better movies to close out 2023, like Blue Beetle, or John Wick 4. Maybe even Nimona on Netflix. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom should be way down on your list of “Things To See Before 2024”, right alongside Necrotic Big Toe and Overfull Fast Food Dumpster. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) is rated PG-13 for swears, people getting punched in the face, people getting shot, people getting run through, and underwater zombies. I just wanted to say that I tremendously liked this review. I’ve been going over the various critics reviews to decide if I should watch the movie and the moment I started this review, I couldn’t help but keep reading, taken by your creativity and imagination. The review stood out so much from the rest of articles by its fresh, sharp and witty language, and the amount of visible care that was put into the writing. The only unpleasant thing I was expecting to see was praise of a certain actress which I still – to my surprise and disdain- see in 9 out of 10 reviews. I was so pleased to find the opposite – appreciate honesty and integrity of this article."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom provides not so much a coda to the DCEU as it does a pathetic epitaph. This ship is good and sunk. One of the most amusing bits of the 2000s HBO sitcom Entourage was the fake movies that existed within the TV show. While protagonist Vincent Chase was fictional, the Hollywood he moved through was not. Real actors playing versions of themselves cameoed as they helped build Chase’s fictional movie star career, with each faux film working as a parody of some trend or fad at the time. The most infamously pointed of these was Aquaman, a phony superhero flick designed to poke fun at the recent Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie. I thought about that gag for the first time in years while watching Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom this holiday weekend, and not just because it also revolved around DC’s most waterlogged superhero, Arthur Curry. Rather the uncanny, gnawing sensation that stalks Aquaman 2 like some bloodthirsty tuna is that you’re not watching a real movie. Something this soulless, this devoid of personality, ambition, or creative spark cannot be real, right? Someone in the projector room’s gotta be putting our leg, or we’re going to discover that we are really watching a movie-within-a-movie, like how Last Action Hero begins with Arnold Schwarzenegger starring in a satire of one of his guns-and-biceps joints, Jack Slater IV. Unfortunately, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is very real, and its sheer ineptness as a narrative, as a follow-up to 2018’s passable spectacle Aquaman, or even as some kind of final word on the DC Extended Universe, is breathtaking. This denouement of the DCEU is less a wake or celebration than it is an example of hasty studio obligation. They say a few platitudes, hoist up the body while it’s still warm, and toss it into the drink. But then the audience has to sit there and watch the carcass slowly float around the boat for 124 minutes before it finally succumbs to the inky and merciful black. The storytelling of the piece has clearly been hacked to pieces from the start. Reports and rumors suggest Aquaman 2 was largely reshot twice, and reedited three times in lieu of increasingly bleak audience test scores. I cannot attest to if all of that went down, but from the jump, there’s clearly been some craven tinkering and skullduggery behind the scenes. The film limply begins by stitching together a generic action sequence where Jason Momoa’s Aquaman fights pirates (I think), puts up with domestic annoyances as an infant son shoots urine at his beard, and awkwardly remembers flashbacks to how the kid was born between films that were released five years apart. It’s all held together by Momoa’s voiceover narration, popsicle sticks, chewing gum, and a prayer for a deliverance that never comes. The absolute hollowness of the film is most explicit in the realization that Mera, Aquaman’s mermaid queen and a co-lead of the last film as played by Amber Heard, is barely in this montage of alleged marital bliss. In fact, she’s barely in the movie despite being the mother of this child who figures prominently to the film’s plot. When Mera does appear, any bits of dialogue she appears about to say have been removed, leaving Heard about 10 lines of exposition in the whole movie—which is barely above the number of bodily fluid jokes David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick’s screenplay desperately employs in a doomed attempt at levity. In an effort to appease the ugliest corners of the internet, Aquaman 2 throws Heard under the jet ski, but doesn’t even have the courage of its convictions to succumb to online thuggery. So she just sits there in the background, an emblem of a film so afraid of rocking the boat that it starts poking holes in its own hull. The real story, such as it is, involves the first film’s superfluous side villain, who at last has become relevant: Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). The groovy looking fiend has discovered the One Ring of Power a black trident with the ability to psychically link him with an ancient sentient evil who wishes Black Manta to bring the magical accessory to his seat of dark sorcery power. In return for the service, they’ll rule the world together, but only after kind of destroying it because the trident is also causing super-accelerated climate change. Uh huh. To stop him, Aquaman and his mother Atlanna (Oscar-winner Nicole Kidman, visibly regretting the paycheck and current industry trends that led her to such a fate) devise a plan to rescue Aquaman’s half-brother and mortal enemy from the last movie, Orm (Patrick Wilson). It turns out that Orm knows how to find Black Manta. Buddy comedy hijinks ensue as Wilson and Momoa hit the watery trail. To be clear, certain elements of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom work just fine, and the chemistry between Momoa and Wilson is at the top of that list. In the previous film, these two actors got relatively little screen time to bounce off one another, and when they did, it was usually laden with blankets of exposition. In The Lost Kingdom, the exposition dumps are mostly left to other characters, so instead Momoa and Wilson get to just vibe in what are easily the best portions of the movie. Wilson plays the straight man to Momoa’s cowabunga bro-iness. Similarly, director James Wan remains an impressive visual stylist, and at the risk of damning with faint praise, he creates perhaps the second best looking live-action superhero movie in 2023, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Wan’s embrace of translucent and psychedelic colors pop, especially in contrast to the tsunami of gray sludge comprising most Marvel Studios pictures. Wan and production designers Bill Brzeski and Sahby Mehalla also have a ball building real sets to represent the ancient evil of the Trench culture that gave the world the black trident. It’s a shameless rip-off of the Mordor and Isengard aesthetic from Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings movies, of course, but at least it won’t cause your eyes to glaze over like the Quantum Realm or whatever the hell The Flash’s CG climax was supposed to be. Yet despite Wan’s visual flourishes, it’s hard to believe this was the movie he set out to make—or that it was ultimately crafted by anyone outside a boardroom’s worth of suits who crowded sweatily around an editing bay to offer their latest batch of “notes.” Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is an empty, cynical movie that sandwiches nearly every superhero movie cliché inside of two hours and then stuffs in plenty more from early 2000s sequels that likewise wanted to crowbar in feel-good family sitcom-ery. Think The Mummy Returns or The Legend of Zorro (except those movies didn’t write out the wife/mother character). It’s a parody of itself that never feels real. The fact Aquaman 2 must stand as the final word on the DCEU is as dispiriting as it is appropriate. The DCEU began full of ambition and pretension, imagining itself to be the “American mythology of our times,” but was in such a hurry to get to those mythos that it disastrously threw Batman, Wonder Woman, and even Aquaman for half a second into its Death of Superman flick. Now, living in the ruins of extinguished audience interest and a total absence of hype, The Lost Kingdom attempts to be the most milquetoast, middle of the road superhero film you might ever ever seen, with absolutely no connection to the other parts of the DCEU. Rumors suggest both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck filmed cameos as Batman for various incarnations of this thing, and you can pretty easily figure out where they would have been slotted in at the end. Yet right down to its pitiful mid-credits sequence gag, Aquaman 2 goes out of its way to live and die alone—to not tease one more second being spent in these toxic and corrosive waters. It’s probably for the best, because the DCEU ship has sunk, and despite his super powers, Aquaman simply gets to be the last one to gasp for breath before going under. Afterward, all that is left is still and quiet."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive,"Regardless of its merits or shortcomings, there are some references to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Even with its messiness, Wan's full imagination is at its finest when unleashed, and his capacity to bring Aquaman's world to life can be spectacular. "
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral,"Despite being reasonably entertaining, it doesn't negate that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is such a significant nothing burger of a blockbuster."
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral, It's Christmas weekend and there are some new movies that you can check out. Hope Madden and George Wolf of MaddWolf give us their takes on the newest releases. 
"Dec 22, 2023",neutral," James Wan’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a minimum viable product, plopped into the theater with an apathy as pervasive and all-encompassing as the ocean itself. Despite being the successor to a film that got over with fans on the strengths of some big creative swings, Aquaman 2’s job is to simply exist—the last cynical hope of squeezing a few nickels out of the unsalvageable mess that is Warner Bros.’s last decade of superhero movies. There’s some logic to the approach. Disconnected from having to exist as part of a larger universe, the film keeps things nice and tidy, demanding nothing of viewers. Despite some wild gesticulating toward the idea of Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as a bro-ey husband and father to an adorable newborn, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’s central concern is that Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) still wants revenge for Aquaman killing his father in the first film.  In searching for some Atlantean technology to give him an edge, Black Manta comes across a black trident and a deposed sea king named Kordax, who grants Black Manta his power and technology in order to take his own revenge on Atlantis. After a botched theft leaves the underwater kingdom in ruins, Aquaman decides to take the fight to Black Manta, but he’ll need help from his imprisoned brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), because…well, it’s not really clear why beyond giving Momoa someone to play his bro shtick off of who isn’t Amber Heard.  Just like the first film, Wilson acquits himself with a regal stoicism that feels like an act of defiance, and he has good straight-man chemistry with Momoa that carries the stretch of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom where it turns into a buddy comedy adventure. Also of note is Randall Park, who, as a scientist who just wanted to find Atlantis, plays his character’s complicity in Black Manta’s crimes like he’s auditioning for Oppenheimer.  For his part, Wan finds momentary pockets to crank the unhinged ocean weirdness of the first film up a notch, particularly with a smart cephalopod sidekick and the gothic design of Kordax’s city, which suggests a water-logged recreation of Return of the King’s Minas Morgul.  But the game efforts of the cast, including Martin Short’s brief stint as what can only be described as pansexual Jabba the Hutt, are ultimately futile. The hurried, horse-blinder construction of the film—hitting plot milestone after plot milestone as fast as humanly possible, cohesion or depth be damned—makes it come across like even Wan can’t wait for the whole thing to be over. Anything resembling substance or depth feels utterly vestigial as a result.  While Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’s underwater sections channel some of the first Aquaman’s sense of weirdo spectacle, the moments set on land that focus on Arthur as a family man feel utterly disconnected from the feel, look, and plot of the rest of the film. It’s a separation made more egregious by the fact that the visibility of Heard’s Mera—Arthur’s wife and the mother of his child, lest we forget—is virtually nonexistent until the plot absolutely can’t function without her. Given that exploring Arthur’s relationship to his family above and below sea level is one of the things that made the first film unique, if not engaging, the meager lip service paid to everyone else in Arthur’s family unit aside from Orm feels like willful neglect."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," For some of us there’s a pinch of sadness baked into the new Aquaman movie. This marks the final film in what was once called the DC Extended Universe. The DCEU started incredibly strong and offered moviegoers with a healthy alternative to the lighter Marvel formula. Sadly, some poor studio decisions combined with dismissive reactions from many cut from the MCU cloth led to the superhero universe’s demise before it ever had the chance to fulfill its original vision. James Gunn has been hired to reboot the DC Universe but who knows how that’s going to turn out. As it is, “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” clears the way for Gunn. In terms of expectations, this is a movie that felt doomed from the start as critical pitchforks were already sharpened and torches pre-lit. That’s a shame because “Aquaman 2” is a hoot – a proudly wacky and over the top romp full of wild world-building and cool action. Color me surprised. James Wan returns to direct following the massive box office success (over $1.1 billion) of the 2018 first film. And of course Jason Momoa reprises his role as the rambunctious and reluctant King of Atlantis, Arthur Curry. As the movie begins, Arthur has married Mera (Amber Heard) and the two have a healthy baby boy, Arthur Jr. All is well in the world, right? Well, of course not. First off, being King of Atlantis has proven to be a lot harder and more demanding than Arthur expected. In addition to his underwater peacekeeping and diplomatic duties, there’s also political turmoil between him and the Atlantean council of bureaucrats. He believes it’s past time they reveal themselves and form an alliance with the surface dwellers. The cynical council is determined to keep their existence a secret. But a bigger and far more deadlier challenge arises with the return of David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a ruthless high-seas mercenary whose burning drive to avenge his father’s death has pushed him over the edge. David has recruited Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), a marine biologist obsessed with proving the existence of Atlantis. Together they search for Atlantean artifacts which David needs to repair and upgrade his Black Manta armor before he can take on Aquaman. While searching in the Arctic David discovers the mysterious Black Trident, a weapon of immense power that connects its wielder with its creator, Kordax (Pilou Asbæk), the ruler of the lost Atlantean kingdom of Necrus. Kordax pledges to provide David with the means to defeat Aquaman in exchange for freeing him from his icy prison. David and Arthur inevitably clash, fighting to a draw. Realizing David is more powerful than when they first met (see the first film), Arthur seeks help from the last person he wants to ask, his imprisoned half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson). As the movie progresses we see Wan dabbling in numerous genres, nodding to several of his inspirations, and just doing his own wild and crazy thing. It’s a bit like what you’d get if you rolled together a buddy comedy, a creature feature, and sci-fi fantasy. Certain moments will have you thinking it’s underwater Star Wars while later scenes give off distinct Lord of the Rings vibes. And then there’s Wan’s own inventive world-building. From deep-sea cities, to a mutated volcanic island, to a decayed kingdom buried under ice, Wan and his digital effects team have a field day creating fantastical places and populating them with a gonzo variety of life. Bouncing from one visually stunning location to the next turns out to be an absolute blast. Wan’s vision for “Aquaman 2” is often awe-inspiring, sometimes thrilling, routinely funny, and consistently entertaining. The great comic chemistry between Momoa and Wilson provides some big laughs. Temuera Morrison’s return as Arthur’s father brings some heart. The film’s self-awareness adds to the fun, providing us with such patent silliness as loyal octopus sidekicks and Dolph Lundgren riding a seahorse. It’s such a bonkers mix and I get that mileage may vary depending on your tastes. But Wan has mostly delivered beyond what I expected. And even with some noticeable flaws, “Aquaman 2” is a satisfying swan song for the late and sometimes great DCEU. I left that movie film with A feeling of sadness and an empty feeling. That picture reminded me of what I’m missing. So went straight to Red Lobster and got the fisherman platter. Got full. It’s funny, well over a month ago I told a friend of mine that it would get negative reviews. It never had a chance. As I wrote, many had their pitchforks sharpened and their torches lit well before it came out.  I just came from seeing it, Keith. Heck, I like the character so I was gonna say I was glad to see it no matter what.. The good for me – the visuals. The bad for me – the story, the ripping-off of other movies, and the tons of mythology casually tossed out to advance the action. I have to believe if you, I, or any other movie lovers locked ourselves in a room for a couple of weeks we could have come up with a better, more cohesive, not-so-lazy storyline. It’s a mess. That’s interesting. I got a kick out of the story. And while it certainly borrows from other movies, I felt it had enough of its own wacky ideas and flavor to keep me onboard. And I love its self-awareness.  I’ll watch it eventually when I decide to complete the DCEU (though I’m dreading Black Adam) though I did hear Patrick Wilson kind of steals the film a bit and allows his character to be funny and relaxed.  More of him and less Amber Turd. It seems that most people are skipping it. I really enjoyed it, especially on the big screen. Like you I enjoyed the first one. This is a fun compliment to it."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," There’s something oddly poetic about how the plot of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” revolves around a fallen empire gasping for its last shot at relevance. It’s emblematic of the DC Cinematic Universe, which, let’s be honest, never really found its stride as “The Lost Kingdom” marks the final nail in the coffin before the new brass reboot it in 2025. You can sense the lack of urgency throughout “Aquaman 2” as it’s evident nobody really seemed interested in this project, except for lead star Jason Momoa who is trying to inject some life into what’s presumably his last time wielding the golden trident.  On some level, “The Lost Kingdom” is exactly what you’d expect: the script is pure nonsense, there’s several unfunny gags, and it possesses the visual effect prowess of something you’d play on the Playstation 2 in 2004. So, I'd suspect the DC completionists out there will more than likely get their fill, which makes writing a review somewhat counterintuitive. You’re either going to see this movie, or you’re not. I really doubt there’s an inbetween. Still, if you must know how I endured this two-hour snooze fest, please read on at your leisure.  It’s crazy to think a year ago we were blessed with one of the most visceral and immersive movie-going experiences of a generation with “Avatar: The Way of Water.” A film that set the bar for how to film digital underwater sequences, which, it turns out, involves filming scenes underwater. What a concept! You won’t be shocked to know “The Lost Kingdom” didn’t film its sequences underwater, in fact, I’m not sure they even shot them on land as half of the sludge could very well have been A.I generated.  Perhaps the screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldnick’s also solicited some ChatGPT for aid in the plotting considering “The Lost Kingdom” is a very busy movie. It’s almost like director James Wan knew this was the last straw and if he wanted to explore any untapped worlds or villains, now was the time. The vast, expansive plot introduces a wide range of characters, creatures, political factions, and even Aquaman’s adorable offspring and then completely forgets about them in lieu of an eventual showdown with the film’s big baddie, David Kane (Yaya Abdul-Mateen II) a.k.a Blank Manta. Oh, did you forget about him? No worries, the movie begins with one of those half-assed narrations that catches audiences up to speed because, obviously, we’re not going to remember what happened in the 2018 predecessor, which may as well have been a half-century ago.  Mantra is out for vengeance after witnessing the newly anointed King of Atlantis leave his father for dead, and he’ll do whatever he can to achieve it. Including unearthing remnants of a hidden kingdom, namely something called Orichalcum, a magical goo that, more or less, causes global warming. Mantra also discovers a black trident that causes him to be possessed by another baddie named Necrus, who was the leader of the fallen kingdom and needs someone to do their evil bidding. You know, bad guy stuff.  This forces Aquaman to team up with his imprisoned brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson) who is giving Tom Hanks in “Cast Away” when he’s busted out, but don’t worry, he gains muscles once reconnected with the water, because that’s just how it works in this universe! You really feel for Wilson throughout the movie as he’s reduced to unspooling mountains of exposition and eating cockroaches for a laugh.  All he does is grumble, moan, and then complain about being ousted for the throne by his half-brother. Elsewhere, Amber Heard, despite having third billing, says approximately three words during the whole thing and Nicole Kidman tries keeping a straight face while delivering lines like: “This could lead to total global annihilation.” Shout-out to Martin Short for being the only watchable element in this trash heap, voicing a fish pirate who crosses paths with Aquaman midway through the movie.  This all leads to lame superhero mashups with some of the worst needle drops in recent memory (clearly, they watched “Guardians of the Galaxy” a few too many times). “The Lost Kingdom” is dull, dark, and tonally all over the place and even goes as far as to knock off “Iron Man” in the final moments. Sure, there’s statements involving climate change and it tries fostering a message of unity, not to mention Wan’s last minute desperation of throwing horror nods into the movie can be inspired, but “The Lost Kingdom” ends this era of the DC universe where it was always destined to land: rock bottom. "
"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"""A superhero sequel without a soul, or any kind of self-belief, 'Aquaman 2' gives into the worst instincts of the DCEU just as it bows out for good."""
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," After ten long years, the DCEU has finally come to a close with the premiere of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, but the long-awaited sequel to the billion-dollar blockbuster Aquaman isn’t interested in tying up the loose ends left behind by The Flash’s mid-credit scenes or Wonder Woman 1984’s unfinished trilogy. Instead, James Wan’s film is solely focused on bringing Arthur Curry’s (Jason Momoa) story to a heartfelt end.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom opens with a clever recap of the events preceding it, as told by a beleaguered Arthur who is balancing superhero duties, kingly duties, and fatherhood like a champ. After dethroning his quarrelsome half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) in Aquaman, Arthur and Mera (Amber Heard) got married and had a baby named Arthur Jr. (or “Junior,” as they affectionately call him). They seem to split their time between the ocean and the surface, with Arthur and his father Tom (Temuera Morrison) providing a significant amount of care to the landlubber baby. However, the film does establish that the baby shares some of his father’s attributes—even if he’s too young to make it beneath the sea.  In addition to getting caught up with Arthur and Mera’s almost picture-perfect life, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom quickly establishes that it fully intends to pay off the post-credit scene from Aquaman. Dr. Shin (Randall Park, who seems perpetually stuck as the over-eager sidekick in superhero franchises) has been aiding and abetting David Kane’s (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) obsessive pursuit to find ancient technology that will help him kill Aquaman once and for all. In the first film, Arthur made an enemy out of Kane when he killed his father, prompting the younger mercenary to take up arms and become the vengeful Black Manta.  The first act of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom can be a bit of a slog as it lays out all of the information that audiences need to know about the past and present world state. Part of this is due to the fact the film—which was originally slated to premiere last December—is arriving five years after Aquaman swam into theaters. Audiences have probably forgotten a lot of the finer details about Arthur’s story. It also doesn’t help that there’s a sort of nihilistic emotion swirling around the film. It’s the final film in the DCEU and, for a lot of people, it doesn’t really “matter” in a larger sense. It’s not building to anything, and that’s what makes it great. Rather than getting bogged down in the “big picture” of the DCEU, this film is solely focused on its main character and those directly involved in his personal story. This is why the second act, where things really pick up for the film, takes it from an okay film to a swimmingly good time.  The growing situation with Black Manta, finds Arthur out of his depth as a leader and it pushes him to track down where Orm is being held in prison. Orm might have bad blood with his half-brother, but Arthur holds no ill will towards the man who was raised to hate his very existence. Through the forced proximity of their situation and Orm’s time in isolation, the brothers slowly begin to mend their fractured relationship, which the film uses as a neat parallel to the actual big bad puppetting Black Manta’s actions.  When Kane found the Black Trident buried within the melting ice caps, he became possessed by the King of Necrus (Pilou Asbæk), who quarreled with his brother King Atlan (Vincent Regan), forged the Black Trident, and drove his entire kingdom to ruin with his corrupted powers. It’s a neat little parallel that arrives in the film’s second act and it ultimately pushes Arthur and Orm’s plot lines forward in a lot of compelling ways. Even in the first Aquaman, Patrick Wilson’s performance was leagues beyond the performances of his peers, but with The Lost Kingdom, his skill as an actor is even more obvious. By design, Orm is a man of few words. Where Arthur is unrestrained, loud-mouthed, and very brash—Orm is reserved, thoughtful with his responses, and very quiet. While their dynamic works quite well with the buddy-cop styling of the sequel, it also forces Wilson to do a lot of subtle things with his performance.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom may be Momoa’s final outing as Arthur Curry and thus, the final chapter in the character’s story, but he undergoes the least amount of development from Act 1 to Act 3. Whereas Orm goes on an entire journey of understanding, with a through-line running all the way back to the first film. The plot forces him to reassess his preconceived notions about his half-brother, reconsider his feelings about the surface and humans, and actively choose to be a better person. What’s remarkable is that so much of the development isn’t necessarily there in the dialogue, or even in the showy action sequences, but it is all there in Wilson’s physical performance. The best moments, in fact, are reserved for the little looks, subtle smirks, and understanding that Wilson shows through his facial expressions.  That’s not to say that Momoa isn’t consistently great with Arthur. He has been one of the more enjoyable characters in the DCEU, despite his scattershot appearances. But Arthur Curry is the lovable, overly friendly dog that is just bound and determined to win over Orm’s disinterested cat. You can always count on Momoa for bawdy laughs, physical humor, and the sweet bond he shares with Morrison’s Tom.  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom feels like the “good old days” of comic book movies. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick’s script consistently doles out corny jokes, well-timed quips, and humorous snark; while delivering believable stakes, heartfelt emotion, and interpersonal conflict. Coupled with the thrilling action sequences and impressive VFX visuals—the film doesn’t leave much to be desired. The only thing that could’ve made it better, would’ve been a critics’ screening that wasn’t in headache-inducing 3D.  The DCEU films—like their MCU peers—have struggled to find a consistent tone within the shared universe. But both Aquaman films have delivered the same level of quality in their storytelling and styling. Jason Momoa’s Arthur Curry has always been larger-than-life, using his bravado and drunken carousing to mask his insecurities with his dual identities as a human and Atlantean. Arthur may not go on a profound or transformative journey in either movie, but at least he’s been consistently the same character. When situations get difficult or tensions flare, he’s ready with a disarming grin, a toss of his hair, or a well-placed pop culture reference that flies right over poor Orm’s head. "
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," That’s the opening joke of “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” which — depending on your level of loyalty to Jason Momoa’s title character — will either tickle your funny bone or fall flat as a flounder. Somewhere between the earnestly entertaining first film (2018) and this winking-and-mugging sequel, director James Wan seems to have decided that an amphibious superhero with Soundgarden-length hair wasn’t funny enough on his own; he has to crack wise, too. The film begins with a quick catch-up: Aquaman has become King of Atlantis,  married Queen Mera (a barely seen Amber Heard) and had a baby (named Arthur Jr.). Cue the superhero-in-suburbia jokes: Aquaman padding around in a bathrobe, changing diapers at midnight and falling asleep on the throne. It’s a proud moment for papa when the infant Arthur communicates telepathically with a tankful of goldfish. Meanwhile, melting ice caps have revealed a hidden trove of orichalcum — here envisioned as an ancient energy-source with environmentally destructive possibilities — which falls into the hands of David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). “Thank God for global warming,” says Kane, who blames Aquaman for his father’s death and plans to exact revenge on all of humanity. He has another weapon, too: a Black Trident that can awaken the zombie warriors of the Kingdom of Necrus. What follows is a meandering story that reunites Aquaman with the half brother he once imprisoned, Orm (Patrick Wilson). There’s a jailbreak sequence in a desert, a trek through a perilous jungle and a meeting with the corpulent crime boss Kingfish (the voice of Martin Short), all of which feel pretty lifeless thanks to the stiff computer animation. At least we get some passable buddy-comedy moments between the brothers. While Momoa’s Aquaman swaggers and joshes, Wilson’s Orm plays the uptight straight man — the Charles Grodin of the sea — and winds up providing the film’s few funny moments.  The sidelining of Heard — following, if not directly related to, a sordid court battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp and a cruel fan petition against her — robs this film of romance and turns it into a bromance. Wan has said that was always the intention. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” might have worked better, though, if it didn’t work so hard to win us over."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," Yikes! It feels like there’s a couple of missing words at the end of that title. The lost kingdom of…something or other? Atlantis? Heaven? Spiders? The Crystal Skull? The Planet of the Apes? Fife? But audience enthusiasm for comic-book future world-building has been drained to an all-time low, and what’s left over, quivering like a beached jellyfish, is this unasked for and unwanted Aquaman sequel, delayed several times and finally hitting screens for Xmas 2023 with the splatter of a seaweed pancake in time to slam the door firmly shut on the DCEU. ‘The Tide is Turning’ says the po-faced poster for James Wan’s Aquaman 2, and it’s right; after decades of inanity, the tide is turning against these vapid tent-pole comic-book movies and not a moment too soon. We starts with one of these glib recaps which always do a great job of alienating casual viewers before the usual CGI slopfest begins; Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) has married Mara (a barely-in-it Amber Heard) and had a baby which pisses in his face several times in the light comedy segment of the opening. ‘Being king all day isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, it’s all board meetings and politics, ‘ complains Aquaman, making you wonder why he bothers getting out of his watery scratcher to rule Atlantis in the first place. A few hackneyed needle drops from the 60’s (Born to be Wild, Spirit in the Sky, twice) announce our main narrative, which is something about Randall Park, an orichalcum furnace which is causing climate change and Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who was seen off quickly in the first movie but like the reduced percentage of the audience, is unwisely back for more low-energy camp shenanigans. ‘Free me from my prison and I will grant you the strength to avenge those who murdered your father!’ is a good example of the cringe/hambone dialogue we get here; you really don’t want to hear Dolph Lundgren in a fish-man wig talking about ‘ultrasonic energy that disrupts the neurosystem,’ and probably you don’t need me to tell you why. ‘What IS going on? Temuera Morrison asks, and I’m genuinely f**ked if I know. ‘This is worse than I could have possibly imagined,’ says someone else, my notes become less than clear after a certain amount of this sub-aquatic bilge. Aquaman eventually stops gabbing to his mom (Nicole Kidman) and shifts into gear hooking up with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to uncork an overflowing toilet of dumped exposition. ‘I will burn his kingdom to ass!’ Can Arthur Curry ever forget Topo the drum-playing, genetically-engineered Cephlopod and find true happiness? Who knows or cares. Barbenheimer condemned what remains of this genre to the bin-juice of history, and the sooner Aquaman and his tiresome fish-man pals drink up their product-placed pints of Guinness and vacate the premises the better. ‘I need an extraction now,’ someone says, and that’s how I felt after twenty minutes of this muck. With the MCU and DCU firmly on the rocks, it’s clear that audiences just liked Batman, Spiderman and Iron Man and not much else really sticks. Momoa and Wilson just about generate some marginal Christmas panto charm together, but Aquaman 2 feels like the last gasp of something that died out with Thanos’s fancy glove; it’s 2023, and it feels like we’ve all finally grown out of comic books, and maybe that’s all for the better. Just came from seeing it. The visuals were great, the actors really tried with what they were given. And that’s ALL the good for me, The bad, heaping piles of mythology tossed out to advance the story…a story which was super-lazy, a rip-off of other movies at times, and an overall mess. I really believe if you, I, or any other movie lovers locked ourselves in a room for a couple of weeks we could have come up with a more compelling plot. Now, I do not think it is the death of the cinema comic book superheroes…but we’re trending in a very bad direction to be sure. I thought Iron Man 3 would be the significant downturn of the comic book movie, but it breathed in new life, showed that any film could be the best in a franchise. But Aquaman 2 was like an old sequel, rehash the elements, but no compelling reason to do so. No real stamp of any kind of authorship. No real vision. I thought once Marvel and DC cycled through their popular characters, they’d run out of ideas, but it took about a decade longer than I expected. With multiverses as connected universes, I can’t see how any storyline in MCU or DCU can matter to anyone but fanboys anymore. It really is time they stopped making these, they must have made enough money by now. I don’t suppose you’re allowed to DNF if you have to review the movie so I salute you for getting through it. A crope from me thanks! Crope is the only appropriate response, and this is close to a CGS, and I liked the first one! May have to knock a star off the original, but this is 205 million dollars of bilge. Well, that was a fun review. No chance I’ll be watching this, as the first one was more than enough. Seems like the comic book wave has truly peaked and these movies are just guttering out. Makes you wonder what the next big thing is going to be. I do try and keep thing light and lively around here. It’ll be two or three years before we get whatever product gets green-lighted post Barbenheimer, but it’s notable how quickly audience and press energy has turned the momentum around on the big franchise beasts. I thought the first Aquaman was passable, but this stinks from the head down. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes. All images are copyrighted to their respective owners.

"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"Words I would use to describe Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom: random, scattered, busy, pointless, corny, loquacious, and tedious."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative,"An overproduced, asinine, anemic and underwhelming spectacle that's just disappointing as Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire. Perhaps it would work better as a video game rather than a movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," “Raise the curtains, hit the lights, strike up the band for the final night.” So sings the title character amid the action finale of Anna and the Apocalypse, arguing that — even as humanity nears extinction amid a zombie outbreak — fighting the good fight is still worth it even in the face of inevitable defeat. James Wan would probably agree, clearly unwilling to go quietly into that dark (k)night as he raises the curtain and lights the lights. There’s no raging at the dying of the light to be found in this cheerfully spectacular, visually astonishing, gee-whiz pulpy action fantasy. But if this is DC Films’ time to go, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom gives us one hell of a show.  The Lost Kingdom is set four years after half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) took the throne of Atlantis by force to stop his half-brother (Patrick Wilson) from destroying the surface world. Leadership has become a drag on the novice king, with those who sympathized with the “kill the land animals to save the sea” sentiment refusing to accept Curry’s idea to reveal themselves to the world. Being king isn’t so fun when you’re not really a dictator, is it?  That it flirts with the notion of superheroes helping to solve real-world macro-problems as opposed to just the latest world-ending supervillain threat makes it an ironic series finale to both the DC Films franchise and the notion of DC/Marvel movies as uncontested pop culture titans. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom won’t “save” DC Films, the superhero genre or Warner Bros. Discovery from their latest issues, but it’s a relentlessly endearing and eye-popping Imax-worthy spectacle. Once upon a time, that was enough for well-earned fortune and glory.  It's really frustrating how the press and internet in general is going about this movie. Yeah, there's quite a lot to say about everything around it, but it's gotten to a point where most people just can't talk Aquaman 2 without bringing up either the Amber Heard controversy, Warner Bros. and DC's past box office flops, or comparing the movie to The Marvels in terms of how it'll do at the box office. Also, are we just gonna start comparing every big-budget movie to The Marvels now? Yes, that film was a massive flop, but not every comic-book movie or just ""movie"" that comes out afterwards is going to suffer the same fate. "
"Dec 22, 2023",positive," Jason Mamoa returns for possibly the last time as the aquatic DC superhero in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” There’s over $200 million worth of eye candy in the story of our hero’s attempt to save the world from Black Manta and global warming….and about $5 worth of originality in the screenplay. It’s a merely adequate aquatic adventure. Emma Stone gives an Oscar caliber performance in the bizarre horror comedy, “Poor Things,” a feminist rethinking of the themes from Frankenstein. It’s bold, original. visually spectacular and very disturbing, with irreverent adult content that barely misses an NC-17 rating. For open-minded audiences, it’s a playfully nutty experience. “The Iron Claw” is one unique bird, an arthouse pro wrestling drama. Zac Efron leads the cast in the true story of the Von Erich clan, a family of grapplers who experienced more than their share of triumphs and tragedies. Its edgy tone may be grating to some viewers, but it’s surprisingly empathetic. File the animated comedy “Migration” under the ‘pleasant surprises’ category. The makers of the “Minions” movies offer a tale about a family of ducks that encounters many dangers when they decide to fly off to Jamaica. It’s a witty, imaginative and fast-moving family feature. Take a Star Wars movie, remove the sense of humor and adventurous fun, and you might have something that looks like the Netflix space opus, “Rebel Moon.” Zack Snyder’s dreary and derivative sci-fi flick is, sad to say, the first in a trilogy. It delivers the action and visuals, but it’s a bloated and humdrum drama."
"Dec 22, 2023",negative," About halfway through Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I realized reviewing this movie would be a chore. Not because the movie is bad (it is) or because it was complicated (it isn’t). It simply dawned on me that I wasn’t retaining a single goddamn thing about it. Gibberish fantasy words dissipated in my temporal lobe. “Profound” character moments fell lifeless and limp onto the floor of the IMAX theatre, failing the jump from screen to my heart. The closest thing to arousal was the constant invocation by characters about an ancient substance called orichalcum, emphasis constantly on the C-U-M. Nothing mattered. Nothing stuck. This doesn’t put it far off from the first Aquaman except for the fact that Lost Kingdom also has all the hallmarks of this late stage in the superhero era of cinema culture — shittier special effects, horrifically spliced reshoots and a story no one seemed all that committed to telling. James Wan returned to the director’s chair, a decision that shackled him to the prolapsed production for almost three years and constant reshoots. It will always be a mystery what story inspired him to take the job in the first place because it’s pretty clear any artistic intention at the outset was diluted and destroyed by the finished product. The movie picks up a couple years after the first film. Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is now the king of Atlantis and extremely bad at his job. He still lives on the surface with his dad, Tom (Temuera Morrison), and his son, lil’ baby Arthur Jr. Arthur’s wife, Mera (Amber Heard), hangs out with them sometimes depending on whether they could cut around the actress in the editing room. Arthur likes to spend his days drinking Guinness with his dad and avoiding work; whenever he’s forced to swim down to Atlantis, it’s clear he has zero aptitude for leadership. Trouble starts brewing when his nemesis, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), becomes empowered by the long lost Black Trident and sets out to ruin our hero’s life. Aquaman is forced to rescue his previously villainous brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), to take down their now mutual foe. Most of the beats are just traditional sequel stuff. The former villain is redeemed; the classic villain is given a power up; the hero reverts a little bit to struggle with responsibilities he won in the first film. Lost Kingdom’s main problem is that none of these characters were ones anyone left the first movie particularly attached to, and nothing they do here gives them further dimension or weight. Wan once again spends a vast amount of creative effort building his undersea kingdoms (of which there are still a half-dozen for some convoluted reason), but all the visual-effects and concept artists in the world are meaningless when the humans grounding the story are this bland and unremarkable. Reshoots are a major part of a film’s production cycle and the explosion of their use in franchise films — as well as the reporting on such reshoots — has made the practice noteworthy to the audience at large when it was previously just part and parcel. Marvel has usually merged its extra footage with new material fairly seamlessly (in some films better than in others). Warner Brothers and DC have always had more trouble with theirs — take a gander at Ben Affleck in the Joss Whedon cut of Justice League, for instance — but Lost Kingdom takes the cake. Entire sequences are clearly shot in front of very, very poor green-screen; a decent amount of the dialogue has clearly been added in later, over wide shots of characters whose mouths you can’t see; and even Arthur Jr. is recast halfway through the film with a child who looks nothing like the one we meet at the start of the film. That last one is truly the most bizarre to me. Frankly, even referring to Lost Kingdom as “finished” is generous. Someone once said a book is never finished, only abandoned. That rather adequately describes this one, except instead of putting it in the Safe Haven box, Warner Brothers should’ve just tossed it in the ocean."
