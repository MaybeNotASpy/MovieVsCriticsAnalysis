Apr 10 2024,negative, its the end of the year and everyone is exhausted and ready for rest  except for the kids who are hyped up on candy cane sugar and the prospect of the long days of summer stretching out before them  fear not there are a host of kidfriendly films coming out which you can plonk the kids in front of while you sit in silence and which you might actually enjoy yourself  a grab bag of storytelling tropes generic characters and musical styles from the wellthumbed disney playbook wish unfolds in a onesizefitsall fairytale land ruled by the sorcerer king magnifico a comedically underutilised chris pine  magnificos benevolent dream of nurturing and granting the wishes of his constituency has curdled into selfish tyranny hes keeping all the wishes in the kingdoms mystical vault to be handed out whenever he deems one of his citizens worthwhile  but when plucky teenager asha ariana debose doing the thing wishes upon a star  which looks like a miyazaki sprite reconfigured as a corporate emoji  she sets in motion a challenge to the sorcerers supremacy championing a humanist utopia where the dreams are reclaimed for the people no points for guessing that this analogy for the dangers of monopolising dreams is drenched in irony coming from the corporation with a stranglehold on the childhood fantasies of generationsthats just business as usual for the mouse house when it comes to the universe were all shareholders is an actual lyric in one of the new songs here set that aside and there are sprinklings of the old disney magic to be found  including an amusing chorus of chickens a talking goat who might have sprung from pinocchios pleasure island and a forest full of animals that even features a cameo from bambi the showtunes  primarily penned by singer julia michaels and songwriter benjamin rice  are a little forgettable though on occasion this wish im a star they generate sparks plus its hard to resist when the refrain from when you wish upon a star is threaded into parts of the score wish isnt about to challenge frozen for kids repeatviewing supremacy but you could do worse for a preteen movie diversion this summer holidays the impulse to account for how some fictional freak complimentary got to be the way they are  especially tempting when wading into that most cashgrabby of genres the origin story  is one usually best avoided as with a magic trick to explain this is to reduce a character to less than the sum of their parts  to sub out a tantalising mystery for a game of connect the dots its rather a relief to be introduced to a young wonka who as incarnated by timothée chalamet is already a fully formed chocolate wizard slash magician slash inventor hes just arrived in a new city after seven years at sea ready to launch his confectionary career  even if the moneygrubbing members of the local chocolate cartel paterson joseph matt lucas and mathew baynton are less than welcoming deep roy played 165 oompa loompas including an entire glam rock band in tim burtons 2005 film adaptation of charlie and the chocolate factory will hugh grant in 2023s wonka ever measure up director paul king paddington paddington 2 applies a fairly light touch when it comes to psychoanalysing his protagonists obsession  unlike tim burtons 2005 charlie and the chocolate factory with its flashback to willys childhood under the thumb of a sugarhating dentist  king preserves and in fact amplifies wonkas magic what does gets muted in the translation however is the unnerving weirdness of roald dahls character  his darkness his offputting humour the misadventures of the bratty golden ticket winners in the wonka factory as recounted in dahls 1964 book reveal a candy man with a truly warped sense of just desserts chalamets wonka meanwhile is willing to abandon his calling for the sake of new pal noodle calah lane  the dune star gamely gives willy his all and proves endearing in the role convincing even but he hasnt got a madcap bone in his body he looks like he belongs in a preraphaelite painting not a zany sweet shop if the film isnt quite up to the preternaturally scrumdiddlyumptious standard of its namesake then it would certainly still pass muster at any of wonkas rival chocolate companies its ducks amuck in this animated adventure from familyfriendly hitmakers illumination studios minions sing the super mario bros movie as a flock of new england mallards find their feathers ruffled on an unexpected trip to the frightening big pond of new york city convinced by his wife voiced by elizabeth banks and ducklings caspar jennings and tresi gazal to take a break from the winter doldrums a beleaguered drake kumail nanjiani gathers up the family  and a tagalong deadbeat uncle danny devito  and heads south for the warmer climes of jamaica  best laid eggs soon go awry when a cloud of fog sends them off course and tumbling into manhattan  where the mallardjusted skein run afowl of a deranged but resourceful pigeon awkwafina channelling natasha lyonne and fall into the clutches of a dastardly restaurant with duck à lorange on the menu much like their minions and sing series illuminations latest feature is bright and bouncy and largely pitched to audiences whove only recently learned to waddle with plenty of sight gags that will quack up undemanding audiences  screenwriter mike white the white lotus lands a few serviceable jokes amid the standardissue story beats while french director benjamin renner who was oscarnominated for 2012s ernest  celestine garnishes the farce with the occasional visual grace note theres a shot of the ducks cruising across the new york skyline that really is quite poetic  keeganmichael key meanwhile does an amusingly overthetop accent as a caged jamaican parrot who longs for his tropical homeland and  proving its been a banner year for heron representation  the legendary carol kane lends her voice to a trickster bird that gives robert pattinson a run for his squawking money despite being a sequel to the biggest hit in dcs extended universe aquaman and the lost kingdom arrives as the ignominious end of the line for warner bros troubled superhero franchise with new bosses james gunn and peter safran having officially announced the end for jason momoas underwater beefcake having ascended to the throne of atlantis aquaman momoa is dividing his time between regal duties and raising his new baby with queen mera a barely present amber heard not exactly dispelling those wild behindthescenes rumours that is until david kane candymans yahya abdulmateen ii  hellbent on avenging the death of his father in the first movie  happens upon an ancient allpowerful trident and summons the dark magic of a fabled lost kingdom to wreak havoc upon atlantis to protect his people aquaman must team up on a quest with his exiled brother orm patrick wilson make a whole bunch of lazily written wisecracks and pound a few sixpacks of guinness with his dad temuera morrison lets just try and ignore the fact that theyre drinking them straight outta the can theres also a plot about global warming and an impending climate catastrophe which has something to do with the villain burning chunks of a mythical substance called orichalcum stop sniggering its a thing in theory any movie teeming with fantastical ocean creatures neonstreaked underwater metropolises and nicole kidman riding a freakin cybernetic shark should be a nobrainer blast of escapism the film borrows liberally from the lord of the rings jules verne

Mar 17 2024,negative,  oh how the mighty have fallen its no secret that superhero movies are on the decline in popularity  just look at the highestgrossing movies of 2023 compared to the past quarter century of boxoffice statistics hollywood studios are panicking they are losing their guaranteed paycheck and scrambling to find other ipsant that will make up for the gaping hole in their pockets   that is why aquaman and the lost kingdom will likely be the last time we will see jason momoas rendition of arthur curry the halfhuman lord of atlantis when james wan first dipped his toe into the world of blockbuster superheroes after building a horror empire for warner bros with the conjuring universe he seemed like the necessary key to getting the dc universe up off the ground wans aquaman is a delight a nonsensical hilarious adventure that fed life into the tired superhero formula so what went wrong with aquaman and the lost kingdom   where aquaman felt original lost kingdom is stale void of all originality from painful product placement to the sets of underwater city necrus that look like they were ripped straight from the architectural plans for minas morgul in the lord of the rings the shift in creativity with wans sequel is a constant disappointment aquaman and the lost kingdom lacks imagination and delight which is what made the first film a blast the sharp wackiness has been sucked dry left in the middle of the desert to perish like king orm wan regular wilson the ocean master that was promised there are brief echoes of the first films zany antics mostly after orm is brought back for some necessary brotherly bonding with aquaman as they try to derail the plans of the villainous black manta abdulmateen ii but the film zooms by so fast that theyre both literally sprinting to keep up with the plot   the one nice thing that can be said about aquaman and the lost kingdom is that out of all of the superhero blockbusters wan is perhaps the only director to make the action sequences look unique and good wan has banked a living off of playful engaging cinematography that really sucks the viewer into the films world and he works his magic in lost kingdom still if only it has the script to back it up to build a film thats as majestic and animated as the first but its a film that feels dumped the last hoorah of synders messy dc extended universe  one that could have been a thrilling goodbye and a reminder that not all of it was bland  will likely sink to the bottom of the ocean a forgotten relic of an era momoas aquaman deserved a lot more  a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands
Mar 16 2024,negative, all that money can buy 1941 its rather remarkable and rather absurd that bernard herrmann despite writing so many magnificent film scores throughout his career  psycho north by northwest taxi driver cape fear the day the earth stood still and the 7th voyage of sinbad represent but a mere sampling  only won a single solitary academy award during his lifetime and it wasnt even for one of his contributions to enduring classics alas he only received a wimpy five nominations over 35 years none for his many hitchcock collaborations but rather for a movie thats not referenced much these days thats not a knock against all that money can buy and certainly not a knock against his score  indeed its a delightful piece of work and it remains the biggest claim to fame of this expansion of stephen vincent benets short story the devil and daniel webster also the films alternate title over the years the morality tale finds the famed politician daniel webster edward arnold taking on mr scratch walter huston to save the soul of a simple farmer james craig craigs performance is ofttimes downright terrible but old pros arnold and huston pick up the pace and the movie also offers a chance to catch sensuous french actress simone simon as a wicked temptress a year before she headlined the classic cat people huston earned a best actor oscar nomination for his twinkly turn as a mischievous gladhanding devil and in addition to his victory for this film herrmann received a second best scoring of a dramatic picture nomination that year for something called citizen kane bluray extras include audio commentary by film scholar bruce eder and herrmann biographer steven c smith a reading of benets story by alec baldwin and a restoration demonstration aquaman and the lost kingdom 2023 the 15th and final film in the dceu which is mercifully being put out of its misery to make room for the newandimproved dcu this opens with one character getting blasted in the face by a stream of baby urine and ends with another cheerfully munching on a live cockroach i cant recall every scene from all 33 mcu flicks but did say captain america or doctor strange ever have to suffer such indignities then again thats par for the course when it comes to a movie as silly simplistic and sophomoric as this one the regurgitated plot finds arthur curry  aquaman jason momoa again having to contend with the vengeancedriven black manta yahya abdulmateen ii this time turning to his estranged halfbrother orm patrick wilson for aid aquaman sported a pair of dull villains in black manta and orm aka ocean master the sibling shift at least allows orm to banter with arthur  its a development that perks up wilson who was atypically monotonous in the first film  but black manta remains as broodily boring as before as aquaarthur momoa doubtless spent hours studying chris hemsworths thor as if he were cramming for an exam  like its predecessor this plagiarizes thor ragnaroks nyuknyuk humor but the gags again land with the force of a dropped anvil nicole kidman returns as arthurs mommy atlanna and her check must not have been sizable enough because she can barely disguise her contempt for this material or perhaps for the genre itself the visual effects are a slight improvement over the ones from the 2018 aquaman but no amount of cgi can conceal a plotline as banal as the one employed here the color purple 2023 for those needing a refresher course this new version of the color purple is not based on the 1985 movie despite that pictures director steven spielberg producer quincy jones and costar oprah winfrey all signing on as coproducers rather its based on the hit broadway musical which like the 85 flick was of course adapted from alice walkers pulitzer prizewinning novel the controversy surrounding the previous screen adaptation  some loved it some hated it and one industry wag even accused spielberg of taking great source material and turning it into a zipadeedoodah song of the south  did not circle this version alas neither did the robust sales as this take was unlike its highly successful predecessor a box office bomb a 94m haul vs a 15m budget then a 60m haul vs a 100m budget now thats a shame because pound for pound this is the superior version wringing as much emotion out of viewers as the previous picture but thankfully leaving aside its tonal inconsistencies especially those keystone kops moments the cast is excellent  particularly fantasia barrino as the hardluck celie recent rustin oscar nominee colman domingo as the cruel mister and danielle brooks deservedly earning a best supporting actress oscar nomination as the spirited sofia  and the narrative is so strong that the movie need not live or die by its musical numbers which for the most part are deftly executed extras in the 4k uhd  digital code edition consist of a makingof featurette a look at the storys characters a peek at the creation of the musical numbers and a look back at walkers novel and spielbergs film fear and desire 1953 according to stanley kubrick his career began with the 1956 film noir gem the killing he had a strong dislike for his sophomore effort 1955s killers kiss reviewed here and absolutely loathed his debut feature in fact kubrick so despised fear and desire that not only did he use such words as embarrassing and amateurish to describe it he also sought to have all prints destroyed after its release it remained impossible to locate for decades only reemerging in the 1990s since then its been publicly shown on a number of occasions and often released on home video but kinos new 4k  bluray release changes the dynamics once more this edition not only includes the 62minute version thats been making the rounds ever since the pictures rediscovery but also contains the 70minute cut that hasnt been seen since 1953 when kubrick screened it under the title shape of fear before pulling it and trimming eight minutes of footage this is exciting even important news but what it doesnt obscure is the fact that the picture itself remains a kubrick curio rather than an integral part of his filmography written by howard sackler later a pulitzer prize winner for the great white hope it follows four soldiers who are trapped behind enemy lines there are several interesting shot selections as well as some irksome ones and peeks at burgeoning kubrick themes such as wars dehumanizing nature but the story is threadbare and the dialogue heavyhanded its essential viewing for cineastes and kubrick completists as long as no one expects an undiscovered masterpiece a fistful of dynamite 1971 italian director sergio leone turned clint eastwood into a superstar with his man with no name trilogy and also significantly boosted charles bronsons leadingman status with the western masterpiece once upon a time in the west neither tough guy is on hand for this rowdy epic set against the backdrop of the mexican revolution but you do get rod steiger as a mexican bandit a suitably hammy turn even if his accent often slips into the southern twang he employed in in the heat of the night and james coburn as the irish explosives expert who awakens the selfcentered bandidos anarchic spirit and sense of national pride as with most leone works a fistful of dynamite which also made the rounds under the monikers duck you sucker and once upon a time  the revolution is full of sly humor and startling camerawork and it also finds the legendary ennio morricone contributing one of his most offbeat scores this would prove to not only be leones final western but also his penultimate feature film  he would later helm the 1984 gangster yarn once upon a time in america before calling it a career a fistful of dynamite was released in the us on two separate occasions in 1972 with running times of 120 minutes and 138 minutes fortunately its leones original 157minute cut that has been making the homevideo rounds in recent years and this new edition from kino is no exception extras include audio commentary by filmmaker alex cox straight to hell audio commentary by film historian and leone scholar sir christopher frayling a discussion of leone by frayling a remembrance by coscripter sergio donati a piece on the movies different versions and trailers for all five of leones spaghetti westerns the lion in winter 1968 plenty of swords and knives make appearances in the lion in winter but none can possibly cut as deep as the caustic dialogue penned by scripter james goldman adapting his own play and captured by director anthony harvey peter otoole who had previously portrayed king henry ii in 1964s becket again tackles the role this time as an older ruler who spars with his alienated wife eleanor of aquitane katharine hepburn over which of their sons should become king after he dies henry favors the youngest the bratty and seemingly simpleminded john nigel terry while eleanor throws her weight behind the oldest the fierce yet aloof richard the lionheart anthony hopkins in his feature film debut neither cares for the middle son the perpetually scheming geoffrey john castle also adding to the drama are henrys mistress anais jane merrow and her brother frances king philip ii timothy dalton also making his movie debut the gloves are off between all the characters in this rousing period romp showcasing formidable turns by hepburn and otoole the latter all of 35 during filming but convincingly playing 50 nominated for seven academy awards including best picture and best actor otoole who unjustly lost to cliff robertsons shameless campaigning for the indifferently received charly this won for best actress hepburns third of four career wins best adapted screenplay and best original score john barry trivia aside while the directors guild award has been a remarkably accurate barometer of who would go on to win the best director oscar  only eight times in 76 years have they differed  this marked the first occasion that the dga winner did not also snag the oscar with harvey winning the dga for this film but carol reed snagging the oscar for oliver the long riders 1980 the long riders sounds like merely a gimmick cast reallife brothers as reallife outlaw siblings but with director walter hill back in his glory years in charge it turned out to be one of the last decent westerns to hit the big screen until the early 1990s brought us the onetwo punch of dances with wolves and unforgiven the keaches stacy james the carradines david keith robert the quaids dennis randy and the guests christopher nicholas respectively portray the james younger miller and ford brothers and the picture episodically follows them as they rob banks bicker among themselves and attempt to forge some semblance of personal lives in addition to respectively playing frank and jesse james stacy and james keach also cowrote the script and served as executive producers but they were generous enough not to make themselves rise above the ensemble all of the characterizations are interesting and all of the performances memorable although its amusing to note that in this picture dominated by men the best work comes courtesy of pamela reed as the fiery belle starr bluray extras include film historian audio commentary a makingof featurette interviews with hill the carradines the keaches randy quaid nicholas guest producer tim zinnemann and composer ry cooder a breakdown of the northfield minnesota raid scene a short piece in which hill discusses director sam peckinpah for whom he had written the script for 1972s the getaway and the theatrical trailer poor things 2023 other films fared better throughout awards season although not many but poor things is the one that earned my vote as the best picture of 2023 go here for the complete list working from alasdair grays samenamed novel director yorgos lanthimos and screenwriter tony mcnamara their 2018 release the favourite likewise earned my vote as the best picture of that year go here have fashioned a true oddity a frankenstein meets forrest gump flick filtered through a feminist focus emma stone taking a bold leap up to the level of todays greatest actresses stars as bella a suicide victim whos brought back to life in the most fantastical way by quirky scientist godwin baxter willem dafoe under the tutelage of godwin the childlike bella receives an education within the strict confines of home but as she matures she realizes she wants to explore the outside world and thus she takes off with a seedy lawyer a hilarious mark ruffalo growing ever more bold as she samples lifes perils and pleasures and in the process discovers her true self to say that poor things isnt for everyone is an understatement yet those willing to go along for the sometimes gross yet always giddy ride will experience a movie that much like barbie illustrates how a woman who knows nothing of our worlds crippling problems and prejudices might carve her own path in pursuit of becoming fully human and fully independent nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture supporting actor ruffalo director and adapted screenplay this nabbed stone a richly deserved oscar for best actress as well as three additional statues for its sets costumes and makeup design quigley down under 1990 its fortuitous for film fanatics that tom sellecks magnum pi duties prevented him from accepting the role of indiana jones  yes he was george lucas first choice not harrison ford although steven spielberg wanted ford all along  since hes long proven himself to be an actor of limited range his perfectly acceptable but rather onenote style is best utilized in forgettable fare like the box office smash three men and a baby and the box office flops runaway and mr baseball or like quigley down under a dopey adventure yarn that plops an american cowboy into an australian setting selleck stars as matthew quigley a sharpshooter who journeys to the land down under in the 1860s to work for a wealthy landowner alan rickman who claims he needs help with keeping the dingo population down but when quigley learns that the cattle baron really wants him to exterminate the aborigines he feels are trespassing on his property he vehemently and violently refuses thereby making himself as unwanted as the indigenous locals as was often the case rickmans the best thing about this clumsy unfocused and uneven film which loses any chance at saving itself whenever an overbearing laura san giacomo as a wayward texan named crazy cora turns up on screen  and she turns up a lot extras in the 4k ultra hd  bluray edition include a vintage behindthescenes featurette an interview with san giacomo a piece in which master armorer mike tristano discusses the sharps rifle the longrange weapon used by sellecks character in the film and the theatrical trailer the 355 2022 theres a tendency to attach the word feminist to any movie that takes a traditionally malecentric genre and fills the leading roles with women but thats a lazy and often erroneous approach thelma  louise is a feminist work so are the horror film the descent and the superhero saga wonder woman the 355 on the other hand simply feels like a standard action yarn in which the central characters just happen to be women instead of ethan hunt or jason bourne the picture is a sampling of girl power with a united nations twist as five global operatives  american jessica chastain british lupita nyongo german diane kruger colombian penelope cruz and chinese fan bingbing  pool their resources in order to stop a wide range of bad guys from activating some gizmo that can basically cripple the world the 355 is the sort of movie that doesnt trust the intelligence of its audience  thats a given when theres a cityscape shot that captures the eiffel tower and the filmmakers feel the need to tag the location as paris france writerdirector simon kinberg coscripting with playwright theresa rebeck is the guy who brought down the onceproud xmen franchise with the painful dark phoenix and this effort shows the same general inefficiency when it comes to such cinematic niceties as dialogue characterization and thrillingly staged action sequences the 355 isnt a bad movie  rather its aggressively average  and any lift it receives is not surprisingly provided by its powerhouse cast kruger in particular extras in the 4k uhd  bluray  digital code edition include behindthescenes pieces focusing on the stunt work and the production design deleted scenes and vfx breakdowns the crucible 1996 written in the midst of the mccarthy era as a thinly veiled attack on the communist witch hunts that were disrupting the very fabric of the nation arthur millers play has long since broken the shackles of that period and emerged as a timeless commentary on the evil that men and women do  especially under insincere veneers of righteousness and religion small wonder then that this superb adaptation penned by miller himself remains as topical as ever both in 1996 and 2024 with its trenchant themes  of hypocrisy hatemongering and political coups detat  crawling all over each other like worms in a can set in the salem of 1692 the film finds venal abigail williams winona ryder triggering a mass hysteria in which accusations of witchcraft are resulting in the executions of innocent people among those targeted by the immoral minority are farmer john proctor daniel daylewis and his wife elizabeth joan allen the lead performances are all impeccable with daylewis zesty rectitude contrasting smartly with allens quiet goodness which in turn strikes the right balance with ryders unrepentant monstrousness yet top acting honors go to the magnificent paul scofield as judge danforth the mccarthyesque agent of evil who presides over the trials the crucible earned two academy award nominations for best supporting actress allen and best adapted screenplay miller but it should have earned many more including one for best picture  its truly one of the great forgotten and underrated films of its era hi joseph thanks for writing im particularly thinking of the scenes in the spielberg version with harpo  heres all this heavy business with albert constantly abusing celie and her living in fear and then suddenly heres some slapstick shtick with harpo crashing through a roof like the three stooges

Mar 12 2024,positive, home  recommendation  home release  thats all folks the dceu is officially over with the home release of aquaman and the lost kingdom from 2013  2023 warner bros pictures has released 15 films featuring characters from dc comics beginning with the trinity  superman henry cavill batman ben affleck and wonder woman gal gadot  and now its all over with the james wandirected saw malignant aquaman and the lost kingdom this final film does nothing to shore up or finalize any of the threads from the prior films but stands alone as a proper sequel to wans 2018 aquaman starring jason momoa fast x as arthur curry it would be unfair to lost kingdom to put any of the weight that the end of the cinematic era possesses onto the film so instead its better to consider it as it sees itself a story apart from the others focused entirely on giving audiences a lovecraftiantinged family adventure just like the first delightfully both wan and david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick orphan return to write the script with momoa and thomas paa sibbett the last manhunt creating an adventure that leans into what makes comic book stories so great  endless possibility if you enjoyed

arthurs father tom temuera morrison and overseeing the kingdom while arthur struggles to push through any of his own plans due to the resistance of the atlantean council his old foe david kaneblack manta yahya abdulmateen ii is making strides with scientist dr shin randall park to uncover forgotten atlantean technology that may help him repair his helmet what the two discover however is far more

release photo credit christian black    dc comics  2023 warner bros ent all rights reserved tm   dc the quickest way to describe lost kingdom is more of the same now how you take that will depend on your own reaction to the first aquaman if you found it silly boorish and juvenile youll find the same here if you found it adventurous comedic and tinted with horror thats exactly what you get both can be true at the same time which is how both the first and second outing were received by this reviewer though introduced in director zack snyders batman v superman dawn of justice 2016 it wasnt until justice league 2017 that audiences got the chance to meet momoas halfbreed hero were given a character who resents being unable to exist in either world hes part of yet who finds himself helping others on the smaller scale until hes called to action to join in a larger fight this is carried forward to aquaman where he must begrudgingly take on his halfbrother orn patrick wilson for leadership of atlantis in order to prevent an allout war between the oceans and the surface and goes even further now that arthur is on the throne and never wanted to be the throughline from introduction to lost kingdom is clearly defined even if some of the characterization or presentation shifts a tad along the way depending on whos directing andor writing momoas arthur is one who possessed incredible abilities yet always felt like a man apart from everything and through his journey in the dceu went from loner outcast to team member to found family to creating one of his own by the end of lost kingdom it even goes a step further into starting to erase the line between his human identity and atlantean one as arthur makes atlantis known to the world one of the very reasonable complaints is that the film often careens into the juvenile when it probably shouldnt such as arthur getting sillystupid at the end of his press coverage unveiling the existence of atlantis but not doing so would kinda be the opposite of who this version of arthur is put another way its not that audiences need to lower their standards for what characters should or shouldnt do but remember that the filmmakers have a specific vision that they seek to keep true to this version is its authentic self no matter what and much of what makes the character so damned charming comes from momoas embodiment of the role lr patrick wilson as orn and jason momoa as aquaman in warner bros pictures action adventure aquaman and the lost kingdom a warner bros pictures release  2023 warner bros ent all rights reserved tm   dc in some cases this presentation is viewed as nearly cavemanish due to the few jokes related to urine that occur in both of the two solo films but where the first films reference was admittedly gross within the context of the scene makes a great deal of sense  need something wet to activate an atlantean machine urinell do the job in lost kingdom the two instances are less about being gross and more the state of fatherhood the first instance shows arthur changing his sons diaper and by using the traditional forwardfacing vs side technique while also failing to cover the penis he finds himself with an open mouth full of warm urine while his son giggles having been peed on many times even from the defensive side position its less a moment that reduces arthur but showcases how happy he is the man is being peed on and rather than growing dysregulated he rolls with it because hes just delighted to be a father the second time well thats because mera made it happen using her own abilities to manipulate water as arthur manages to duck out of the way gloating about it that she would do this again gross as it is speaks to the way in which the pair have mingled their worlds almost like a strange callback to her reaction to arthurs suggestion of peeing on the machine this is growth folks and often what a healthy marriage looks like wherein both people meet in the middle while also accepting the other for who they are this is of course where the theme of the film finds its footing with the conflict rising from arthurs failure to do the right thing and save kanes father in the first film and king atlans vincent regan inability to stop his own brother kordax pilou asbæk from threatening to destroy the world thus by the end of the film we come to understand that lost kingdom is entirely an adventure story surrounding a tale of family and social responsibility the arthur whom we met formally in justice league is not the one here that one wouldve been more likely to get angry even if his own child peed on him whereas this one rejoices in the opportunity to be near his child thats why in my view the film is at its strongest when it incorporates the ornarthur brother bonding aspects of the film with the central narrative not just because wilson and momoa have excellent chemistry but because of how the film handles resolving their conflict through open communication rather than fighting even when the film turns predictable and the magical possession that kane willingly accepts by kordax if it means finally getting his revenge on arthur transfer to orn its resolved through talking and recognition of past mistakes humility and love win the day rather than pride and hatred frankly if the writers had slipped in an ohana means family before the end of the film i wouldnt have been mad at it lr patrick wilson and directorproducerwriter james wan on the set of warner bros pictures action adventure aquaman and the lost kingdom a warner bros

the cast or crew could tell however given the politics behind the scenes of the film  the hearddepp trial heards public comments about her reduced role the transition of the dc studios arm to james gunn and peter safran and the overall state of wb as a studio  one can certainly understand why creating an opportunity to talk at length in a loose situation might be a bad idea prwise that said commentary tracks seem to be growing rarer and rarer on mainstream releases so its a bummer nonetheless however theres still plenty to learn as the cast and crew take you through quite literally everything about the film with focuses on each major location the narrative and characters this means we get a closer look at the creatures of the deep from which the horrors come as well as how they increased the size of this film compared to the last despite no drumming octopus or kraken to be seen be advised that the only way to access the motion comic that accompanies the home release is through the digital edition yahya abdulmateen ii as black manta in warner bros pictures action adventure aquaman and the lost kingdom a warner bros pictures release  2023 warner bros ent all rights reserved tm   dc admittedly the cg gets a little iffy at times the separation between real sets and technological filler being extraordinarily obvious not to mention the rubbery visage of cg characters in motion and the film leans too heavily on exposition in order to shave its runtime to under twohours minus credits but its still a darn good time the sets are imaginative the characters feel livedin and the use of practical suits helps reduce the faceless cg enemytrope of a lot of superhero films while also making the combat feel more tangible and weighted dramatically does lost kingdom wrap up any threads established from other films no does it really connect to any film outside of arthurs stories also no but no one said it had too an expectation has formed from more than a decade of superhero films that everything is connected and that expectation basically failed the dceu from the start tell good stories and the people will come connect them as you need to but its ok for there to be solo stories and for them to stay solo stories like the comics themselves so goodbye dceu you were a wild ride where you spent the majority of it coursecorrecting to what you thought audiences wanted instead of just making damn great movies what you could have been without all the drama well never know see you in the funny pages sigh i loved james gunn i was one of the ones who was on the twitter war to get him rehired but he broke my heart with how hes handled dc unless im mistaken he hasnt had control control over anything before his film hes just overseeing the end of what was before it starts all over he fired henry cavill and hes just spit in the face of all thats come before him i wanted to see kalel vs black adam i was promised that i screamed like a giddy little girl in the theater with joy and gunn took my joy away i also dont know if well see gal gadot again and i adored her as wonder woman  i wouldnt say hes spit in the face of the dceu hes worked within it and seems to respect what snyder did so much so that some aspects of it are going to remain in the new continuity plus unless my memory is wrong he wasnt yet the head of dc films when black adam tanked i think that announcement came around the release of shazam 2 which started the general malaise for audiences since nothing that the films did would matter so it was more the folks before gunn who dropped the ball on supes v black adam  it does seem like gunn is going to create this universe mostly from scratch and im willing to give it a shot as i did with snyder multiple times before passing judgement but then im on the record as not enjoying cavills portrayal of supes but that has more to do with the writing and execution than performance 
Feb 29 2024,negative, jason momoas aquatic superhero battles a vengeful old foe bent on causing climate catastrophe in this underwhelming sequel to the dc extended universes bighitter director james wans belated followup to the 2018 comicbook blockbuster finds momoas atlantean king juggling his regal duties with fatherhood and marriage to mera amber heard but the return of a supernaturally powerful black manta forces an alliance between aquaman and his resentful incarcerated halfbrother orm patrick wilson an actionpacked prison break in the desert is the catalyst for a buddy movie straight out of the midnight run playbook which sends the bickering siblings on a quest to an island teeming with gruesome hungry monsters the evolving bromance between uptight nofun orm and his tiggerish sibling lightens the mood but it also leaves little screen time for nicole kidman and especially heard with a cephalopod sidekick called topo inserted as a replacement a functional rather than spectacular slice of comicbook nonsense then but considering it is the final instalment of the dceu franchise a more rousing swansong would have been welcome
Feb 21 2024,positive, there are also some really unique genre pictures like the book of clarence some very sound family fare like orion and the dark and a movie where jason statham plays an action hero called a beekeeper trying to turn madame web into the next laughaminute disaster midnight movie was bound to happen we live in a postmeme society one where any film thats distinctly flawed but still showing signs of real personality gets shoved into a joke box that labels it this weeks worst movie of all time its an exhaustive discourse as the morbin time effect that doomed madame web before it really had a chance its a shame really because despite its clear faults the dakota johnsonled spinoff is really one of the more fascinating marvel movies in some time morbius was truly awful this is not that cut from a very particular cloth of risky 2000s comic book movies that likely fell victim to studio meddling madame web feels haphazard and melodramatic in an oddly refreshing way its not really a superhero origin story as much as it is a bgrade scifi thriller and its efforts to canonize its setting into some sort of marvel future feel so delightfully lifeless and unwilling like someone dragging their resistant 8yearold to a piano lesson the film on purpose or on accident shows you how contrived the continuous shared universe mentality is and it has some perhaps unintended but still present and effective fun with that in a very nonmeta way dont necessarily mistake its mistakes for mistakes well argue kevin feige built the mcu to absolutely avoid movies like this ones that can fly off the rail at any given moment because of strange decisions and potentially offputting weirdness due to the unholy blend of unwieldy creative vision careless studio interference and michael bayapproved obviousness of product placement this movie is his worst marvel nightmare bizarre springs eternal with madame web and thats kind of nice to have something so baffling in execution and lacking in uniformity sport the marvel logo its not entirely successful but theres not much else like it besides the venom movies its also got a surprisingly wry sense of humor as johnson and sj clarkson mine the corniness of the plot and the very relatable annoyed millennial unsuccessfully trying to relate to sarcastic gen z kids dynamics in 2003 sure but it still hits johnson is really quite impressive here as shes wholly aware of what kind of movie shes in and how ridiculous some of it is like a pro she still powers through it by selling the drama in some really shaky dialogue and nailing the punch lines even when theyre not necessarily there some of this movie is dinged from the delivery process but its actually decently intact if anything this is really better than most of the recent mcu movies madame web might be really messy and occasionally encourage the wrong kind of audience participation but if you go in willing to meet it on its wavelength you might be surprised by how nice it is to watch one of these movies not necessarily know where its going or why its doing what it is thats the joy of risks they dont always pay off but they rarely fail without genuine entertainment value people will say plenty about this movie but they cannot call it boring the first half is pretty excellent even if it starts to get a little lost in the sauce with the metanarrativehowever the animation is splendid and most of the script and voice cast are very wellconsidered its uppertier dreamworks but it doesnt quite have the conceptual cohesion of something like inside out as great as kaufman working in this space is this is exactly what it should be a rare example of the schlocky bgrade action movie that strives to be more than a temporary meme soon lost to time david ayer cuts down the unnecessary plotting and keeps this humming along at an enjoyable clip and jason statham understands the proper frequency here as well as any actor could its wildly fun in stretches and being rough around the edges in a good expendables movie way is more than forgivable id watch more beekeepers josh hutcherson is a great jerk this is the kind of movie that would do great business on home video and develop a very loyal cult following and in like 10 years would be regarded as a very savvy genre picture that the youths of the time understood more than the folks who didnt really get on its level alas thats not the world were in anymore but i sure hope this one finds a second life on streaming because it really is a shame we get a proper successor to the 80s90s movies like heathers the lost boys the 1990s addams family movies and edward scissorhands that doesnt immediately find its audience its a movie made by someone who clearly loves the irreverence and aesthetics of tim burton the oblong austerity of barry sonnenfeld the wacky studio comedy vibes of penelope spheeris and the buoyant campiness of joel schumacher plenty of joe dante the burbs vibes in there too maybe this will take off on netflix or peacock or something its a good movie and deserved more than what it got being dumped in february with little fanfare kathryn newton liza soberano and cole sprouse are all aces jeymes samuel walks a tight rope here between satire and earnest heart and he does so marvelously hes such a confident artist radiant and grand in the way he envisions his stories and very deft to the touch with the emotions hes got an old soul for the old hollywood scope and booming score that sweeps you off your feet there is a real dedication present to genre homage while twisting it around to meet his forwardthinking vision its pretty marvelous what he pulls off here maybe not quite as tight as the harder they fall but just as impressive giddy and resonant samuel is a special filmmaker and this is a very good film that deserved so much more than badfaith readings and to be dumped in january on a crowded weekend its a definite step down from the insane heights of the first film but its still so much fun and so much more engaging than most of the superhero films made these days its a shame this will be it for the dceu if only because youd rather have unwieldy variance with real risk hello madame web involved instead of more sameness james wan really did everything he could here to craft a rollicking adventure out of production issues that show the seams in the edit this really reminded me of a less polished version of black panther wakanda forever lacking the gravitas but making up for it in pure chummy enjoyment that has to count for something right im sad to see jason momoas time as aquaman end he was just perfect for the part but im glad he got one last chance to flex his joy in playing the role even if the vehicle is a bit more dinged up than before also the sunken ship underworld is yet another huge example of why wan needs to do a star war no director right now would be a better fit id bet 5 the pitch for this movie was vacation  but with ducks on migration  but also finding nemo  on the quality level of the secret life of pets and the entire room stood in applause its okay illumination is incapable of making anything but the same perfectly fine riskaverse family film over and over and over again which means you always leave reasonably satisfied but wholly static they clearly just want to be blue sky with minions instead of scrat and more power to them theyll probably never make a great movie but theyll make plenty decent enough ones 34star movies for days this was weirdly the secondbest animated film released in december 2023 about talking birds who must escape evil humans who want to cook them and serve them to consumers its also got the secondbest mike white movie script involving the word orange go figure
Jan 27 2024,negative,sadly a flaccid final dceu film that tries to coast on the chemistry of momoa and patrick wilson that ends up crashing on the rocks with some terrible humor ridiculous scenarios nonsensical story beats and a villain that is supremely wasted rip dceu
Jan 27 2024,negative, the dc extended universe as we know it dies with aquaman and the lost kingdom now streaming on vod services like amazon prime video its the 15th movie in a series that began with a rather rank apefart of a movie man of steel and concludes with jason momoa in aatlks final scene making a pretty onthenose reference to iron man as if acknowledging that marvel done whupped dcs ass wisely the second solo aquaman adventure is mostly selfcontained existing in the same somewhatendearingly idiotic world as 2018s aquaman which was borderlineendearing while so much of the other nonwonder woman dc movies were stultifying uglytotheeye slopfests so does the second aquaman  which brings back director james wan who instead of dithering around with comic book movies should be making more movies like malignant  live up to the firm okness of its predecessor almost the gist aquaman momoa aka arthur curry is a dad hooray so that means hes extratired all the time hes not only a hero who saves seamen from evil pirates hes also the king of the undersea empire of atlantis who commutes to work on a glowing giant seahorse from his landbound seaside house where he lives with wife mera amber heard and changes his baby boys diapers and tries not to be peed on he listens to boring atlantean bureaucrats all day sometimes gets into a violent scrape with evildoers then comes home to toys all over the floor why dont they all live in atlantis in a kings castle with servants who can get peed on not sure arthur is of the land and aquaman is of the sea and home is everywhere i guess now please recall the villain from the first movie black manta yahya abdulmateen ii hes still around and still not over it it being the death of his pirate father at the hands of aquaman his power suit looms in a case of the type that only superheroes and supervillains own all glass dramatically lit holding the costume in far greater reverence than a hanger in the closet could ever provide black manta has a crew of flunkies that includes dr stephen shin randall park who feels conflicted he really wants to see the longlost worlds under the sea but in order to do so is enabling a lunatic to do evil things what evil things might you ask discovering an ancient trident that possesses him with a green cgi monster who looks like a lord of the rings leftover for starters and then stealing a bunch of orichalcum from an atlantean storage facility so he may fuel his evil machines except that burning the orichalcum means emitting vast amounts of neongreen pollution into the air and rapidly accelerating global warming see you sat down to watch a dumbass aquaman movie and didnt realize it was going to be about something fooled ya black mantas muckingabout raises the interest of the atlantean council who consult with aquaman in a scene that doesnt at all deserve to be summarized here but made me wonder how the characters voices create such a majestic echo as if they were in a great stone hall despite being underwater i mean their hair flows and the visuals are murky and bleary so the laws of physics apply there but shouldnt their voices go gurglegurglegurgle i digress the atlanteans battle black manta in a sequence in which the face of nicole kidman playing aquamans mother atlanna is pasted on a cgi body riding a roboshark so i guess my nitpicking about underwater talking is stupid just stupid  the fight to quash black mantas evildoing doesnt go well and what with one thing and another aquaman decides that the only person who can help him now is his halfbrother olm patrick wilson who you may recall was the antagonist in the first aquaman this will require an uneasy sibling reunion but not until aquaman busts olm out of prison from there the two of them quest through underground caverns and across deserts fighting beasts and bad guys on beaches and in trenches eventually aquamans baby aquaman jr serves his purpose and is kidnapped by black manta and something has to be done about that i wonder what aquaman could do get in a fight i suppose  what movies will it remind you of if you ever desired to watch a movie thats almost wholly comprised of the tonal and visual style of the jar jar binks underwaterworld scenes from the phantom menace have i got the movie for you memorable dialogue this movie includes drivel like you tellin me you never went topside and had a cheeseburger or a slice of za pepperoni aquaman to dippy fishthemed almostpuns like got any more krillbrained ideas olm to exposition mouthfuls like this whole place must be heatshielded to protect it from the surfaces thermal satellites olm you choose which you prefer our take aquaman 2 mostly blows maybe like one of those deadly poisonous fish that blows up but it at least has three things going for it it never ever takes itself seriously its unburdened by greater dceu baggage and mostly tells its own compact story and wan seems to be having fun directing this thing which is full of extravagant videogamestyle shots that weave in and around and through the action  and for better or worse likely wouldnt be possible or at least affordable if the film didnt consist of roughly 97 percent cgi  of course the myriad struggles to get the movie made and finally released five years after the first aquaman means wan didnt know until too late that it would be the final punctuation mark on the dceu so any hope for a noholdsbarred whocares letitallhangout leterrip extravaganza goes unfulfilled so what everyone settles for is a general regurgitation of the first aquaman plot but with a slightly more wideranging display of digital locations and a larger assemblage of creatures and supporting characters it all adds up to well nothing we havent yawned at before whether its dc slop like the flash or marvel slop like antman and the wasp quantumania all of these being justbecauseyoucandoanythingwithcgidoesntmeanyoushoulddoit kind of movies  now i didnt aggressively dislike aquaman and the lost creativity of a oncehopeful franchise mired with deflating box office returns once you get on its goofy wavelength and acclimate yourself to the comininhot momoaness of the character and performance  is momoa grating or is he fun cant tell  its a perfectly acceptable popcorn movie even if its too busy by half and blatantly telegraphs a mighty trident battle between protag and antag it appeals heavily to your inner nineyearold whos uncritical enough to think some of this stuff looks pretty cool and you might actually convince yourself this is true maybe two or three times during its twohour runtime oh and that bit above about the movie being about something its really not the climatechange thing is as empty as gestures get the subtext here addresses only the end of this wearisome cinematic universe which lived up to its potential about 26 times out of 15 movies the dceu kingdom is hereby abandoned our call i dunno aquaman and the lost kingdom almost has its moments so lets crunch the comparison sum its a lesser experience than the first aquaman which was mediocreplus and what do you get with straightdownthemiddle mediocrity you get me shrugging and saying skip it 
Jan 19 2024,neutral,black manta is a cardboard cutout angry villain
Jan 16 2024,negative,while the first aquaman was a tsunami of dumb fun spectacle this dizzy sequel sinks into abysmal depths due to an unbearable weight of massive silliness full review in spanish
Jan 15 2024,negative,wan leaves things open enough to perhaps get the gang back together but unless someone can find a way to do the character and atlantis justice it might be best for aquaman to hang up his suit and trident 
Jan 12 2024,neutral,the lost kingdom struggles to provide much substance with its style the highlight is the chemistry between our two former foes there are opportunities to lean more into the emotional stakes but the script never commits
Jan 10 2024,neutral,not funny enough not dramatic enough not well acted enough  but i wasnt bored

Jan 8 2024,positive, your digital subscription includes access to content from all our websites in your region  access unlimited news content and the canberra times app premium subscribers also enjoy interactive puzzles and access to the digital version of our print edition  todays paper i have enjoyed the last few superhero films ive reviewed and there have been a lot of them including the marvels and blue beetle but none of them have set the box office on fire and perhaps audiences are finally telling the big studios in the only way theyll listen their wallets that fewer and better might be the way to go  australian summer is where our cinemas  businesses that need to make money and who keep plenty of folk employed  make a good percentage of their annual income and so when i looked at the list of summer releases for this year and saw the aquaman sequel at the top of the list i did that intake of breath between the teeth you make make when youre watching an accident about to happen  and i can see why because all of the elements that made the first film successful are back including mamoa and our nicole and a tongueincheek approach to its own silliness  again responsible for drawing these elements together is industrious and inventive australian director james wan of saw fame and also canberra readers one of our very own local sons a graduate of lake tuggeranong college  in the first aquaman film normal human bloke tom curry temuera morrison fell in love with mermaid queen from the deep atlanna nicole kidman but she was forced to return to the sea leaving behind the bloke and their son  that kid was arthur curry jason momoa who would find out across that film that he was in fact some kind of undersea royalty involved in all kinds of territorial aquatic shenanigans  he finds he must now save his brother orm patrick wilson the deposed former king of atlantis in order for them to both square off against black manta yahya abdulmanteen ii who has a new weapon he wants to use to kill curry and his entire bloodline  patrick wilson looks and is gorgeous in this film and theres a fight scene where orm and aquaman square off against some tendrilled bad guys that equals the volleyball match in top gun maverick for beachfront homoeroticism  amber heards performance proves that the biosecurity hostage video she shot with johnny depp under threat of having her dogs killed by barnaby joyce was no fluke its hard to tell with so much cgi at play here what if anything is real although plenty of the films budget went on location filming in britain and hawaii but visually the film is a spectacular explosion of ideas that might feel like a lot to take in but faithfully reference the aquaman comic books of the 1960s and 70s  director james gunn was recently hired by dc to fix everything that is keeping fans away from their superman batman et cetera movies and big name stars are being handed gold watches thatll give the fans plenty to speculate about but its entirely possible to watch this two hours of fairy floss untroubled by speculation about any of its stars coming back to these roles in the future 
Jan 7 2024,positive,not all of the comedy and emotional beats land but this film is good enough to turn on and watch it isnt one of the stronger dceu entries but you wont have a bad time watching this sequel
Jan 7 2024,neutral, the dceu emits its last gaspor perhaps gurglewith aquaman and the lost kingdom the longgestating second entry sees jason momoa as the superhero and though warner bros has positioned it as a holiday tentpole the finished movie might also leave the studio underwater since the events of 2018s aquaman arthur momoa has taken his place as king of atlantis married his sweetheart mera amber heard and had a son apropos of nothing hes also grown a dadbod though atlantis glows with strange undersea technology and wildlooking merpeople populating the city arthur prefers spending his time with his aging dad temuera morrison in the garage of an old sea shanty guzzling beer and watching tv the choice activity for any superpowered royal arthurs happy domestic life gets interrupted by the reemergence of david kaneblack manta yahya abdulmateen ii a pirate bent on revenge against aquaman for the death of his father in the first film in his quest to discover the location of atlantis black manta discovers an ancient trident linked to a power source that can wipe out the undersea kingdom the catch the plan involves heating the earth which will also release a nasty race of lovecraftian mermen rather than mobilize his undersea army aquaman opts to enlist the help of his brother the oceanmaster orm patrick wilson who rots in a dry prison after his own attack on atlantis in the first film got all that despite the convoluted setup director james wan constructs a simple plot spending most of the runtime leaping from one action sequence punctuated by goofy oneliners to the next momoa ever game to grin and drop a snarky line delivers an actionhero performance in the vein of old arnold schwarzenegger pictures those dont involve acting in the traditional sense so much as mugging for the camera to overplayed classic rock songs then again aquaman and the lost kingdom doesnt really have a grip on arthur as a character comic book characters have a plastic quality to them different writers can mold their personalities to fit different kinds of stories aquaman stories at their best examined the character in the context of a reluctant defender an arrogant warrior with contempt for the surface dwellers he protects momoa nailed that characterization in zack snyders justice league here he feels more like a watereddown excuse the phrase version of thor in the mcu indeed director wanperhaps at the behest of james gunn and warner brosseems to want to emulate taika waititis thor movies much as thor grew a dad bod sired a moppet and had little interest in ruling over his kingdom aquaman has become an avatar for all the middleaged dads in the audience he cant have any character depth or real internal conflict as that might alienate the audience or worse force viewers to confront their own wan also employs waititis overuse of humor needle drops and goofy aliens or in this case fish people to make up for a plot both convoluted and superficial dont expect any real philosophical or moral questions here wan is too busy filming a singing fish band that doesnt mean the lost kingdom doesnt have its graces the movie has some splendid production design and action setpieces including an underwater freeway chase and a city made up of pirate ships wilson and abdulmateen both deserve credit for going right ahead and giving performances more compelling than the movie around them wilson in particular brings so much to the ormarthur relationship that it becomes the films most interesting subplot amber heard claimed to have reduced screentime courtesy of her legal woes with ex johnny depp but she has a bigger role than costars dolph lundgren and nicole kidman the movie doesnt give her much to do in terms of range but she does a fine job with what wan asks of her but for all the color effects and wild imagery aquaman and the lost kingdom never finds enough originality to have an identity of its own much like arthur himself so much of the movie feels derivative black mantas volcano lair seems lifted from a bond movie while the surrounding island which features giant insects and animals for some reason looks borrowed from king kong black manta though an interesting character also resembles a bond villain right down to having a reluctant scientist randall park and a team of nameless underlings led by a femme fatale a city of demonic merpeople might as well have carboncopied one from lord of the rings right down to the architecture and color scheme some of the humorcharacters eating roaches and at least five urine jokes in the first reelalso induce more cringes than laughter kids may have fun with aquaman and the lost kingdoms crude humor bright visuals and cutaways from momoa shouting profanity parents craving validation through a story that plays like something out of a choose your own adventure novel also might enjoy it everyone else though will likely shrug it off as the cloying cartoon it is jason momoas aquaman like the rest of the dceu once held a lot of promise before corporate meddling creative turnover and reactionary decisions reduced it to a pandering mess since aquaman and the lost kingdom allegedly marks the end to that continuity succeeded by one overseen by james gunn fans should pray that warner bros serves up an aquaman that smells a bit less like fish david reddish is the awardwinning writer behind the novels the passion of sergius  bacchus and the sex drugs  superheroes series hes also a noted entertainment journalist having written for such publications as wealth of geeks

Jan 5 2024,negative,a film so riskaverse its afraid to step out of its own shadow
Jan 4 2024,neutral, in theaters comes the return of the king in aquaman the lost kingdom jason mamoa returns as arthur curry a man of two worlds who struggles with both his mortal enemy black manta has been in the shadows and searching for a way to get revenge and now he may just have found a new lease on power now an ancient evil returns so aquaman and his brother must begrudgingly work together to stop this new onslaught as a review this film is simplistic with much of it riding on quirkiness and mamoas personality nowhere as good as the original this one has to add extra comic relief to move boring scenes along so for me this film gets a c lastly  we circle back to netflix for rebel moon part 1 a child of fire zack snyders twopart epic that just released the first part i have some issues with the current release but i have very high hopes that the rrated version will make all things right a grade of c can become an a with another hour of footage from snyder
Jan 3 2024,neutral, on this episode jd and brendan discuss the last film of the dceu in james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom starring the great jason momoa its been an interesting decade for dc and while it had its ups and downs theres no denying that momoas arthur was one of its best traits so to see the dceu go out with him was a fitting tribute
Jan 2 2024,negative, how the mighty have fallen in 2018 aquaman was released and performed incredibly well making over a billion dollars and providing a breath of fresh air in a year of serious comic book movies reshoots onset issues and the fate of a studio have meant its follow up has not fared as well  quick history lesson  the dc extended universe dceu started om 2013 with man of steel and was meant to rival marvels cinematic universe for many reasons that hasnt been the case and director james gunn has taken over the dc universe with a plan to reboot the whole thing as such aquaman and the lost kingdom is the swansong of these justice league characters before a new set of heroes takes over as if that wasnt enough costar amber heards legal issues have drawn the wrong kind of publicity its easy to forget theres a film underneath all this controversy we rejoin arthur curryaquaman jason momoa struggling with the weight of being king of atlantis as well as the responsibilities of being a new father when an old enemy attacks his home seeking revenge arthur must turn to his brother orm patrick wilson his former enemy to save the world from destructionthe plot is strikingly similar to marvel hit thor ragnarok  the heros kingdom is attacked forcing him to team up with his brother arthur even mockingly calls orm loki at one point the enjoyment isnt the same however with this adventure treading water through a combination of expensive action scenes and light comedy its entertaining enough with momoas charm doing most of the heavy lifting but theres a familiarity to everything that means youre never as engaged ats you should be its a movie made to fill a release date rather than set up a sequel and so while the standalone adventure is refreshing theres always a sense that what were watching is just killing time  those looking for the reshoot changes wont have to look too hard temuera morrison returns as arthurs father tom and there are many hearttoheart conversations that feel as though they were originally intended to be with amber heard her character mera only shows up when its absolutely necessary and has few if any meaningful interactions with her costars director james wan has insisted the emphasis was always meant to be on arthur and orm but it feels as though heards time has been kept to a minimum  as for those with something to do its a mixed bag momoa has charisma to spare and so even the most threadbare scenes benefit from his gungho demeanour wilson makes the buddy cop dynamic work with his costar while nicole kidman and dolph lundgren return as atlanteans helping arthur in his quest yahya abdulmateen ii is poorly served as the villain having no elaborate speeches or character development instead growling orders as randall park adds some laughs playing his unwilling assistant  its a shame that the most entertaining film in the dceu has been given such a mediocre sequel presumably due to matters beyond the control of the creatives nevertheless aquaman and the lost kingdom is as jumbled as the universe it exists in and a reminder of why theres a need to start afresh 
Jan 1 2024,neutral, for all its headscratching choices aquaman and the lost kingdom should probably be renamed something along the lines of awkwardman and the lost opportunity  and its difficult to know precisely where things went awry while not as big of a regression as the iron man series saw between its first and second movies much of what made 2018s aquaman a fun thor of the sea adventure is absent from this followup a victim of poor writing director james wans malignantrooted cold streak and misguided attempts to sideline maligned costar amber heard after a humorous introduction that catches us up with atlantis king arthur curry jason momoa his wife mera heard and their son arthur jr lost kingdom takes a weird leap from villainous black manta yahya abdulmateen ii and dr stephen shin randall park exploring the arctic to them wielding ancient technology  from where great question  and black manta secretly communicating with some ancient evil entity the wonky setup dilutes the impact of an already middling adversary but provides an excuse for arthur to team up with his imprisoned half brother orm patrick wilson to stop this more powerful baddie as the siblings attempt to set their differences aside momoa and wilson aided by comicrelief intelligent octopus topo showcase amusing oddcouple chemistry  one of the few extended stretches in which david leslie johnsonmcgoldricks screenplay doesnt feels compromised by outside forces other than momoas charismatic performance and scattered action thrills few aspects of lost kingdom prove consistent and their attempted synthesis yields plentiful friction a good deal of the ineptitude is rooted in what appears to be a concerted effort to make heard look bad using takes at odds with her confident composed turn in aquaman most notably an embarrassing scream of anguish when her son is in peril but theres also the numerous reshoots and new dc honcho james gunns meddling to consider all of which render this sequel a compromised patchedtogether attempt that barely resembles its singleminded predecessor and sends the dceu out with a whimper
Jan 1 2024,positive, summary black manta seeks revenge on aquaman for his fathers death wielding the black tridents power he becomes a formidable foe to defend atlantis aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother they must protect the kingdom
Dec 31 2023,neutral, ten years ago with much fanfare the dc extended universe was born warner brothers riding the wave of success from christopher nolans dark knight trilogy decided that rather than stick with standalone titles featuring their bestloved superheroes they would instead chase marvel by building a shared universe the resultant umbrella project was rushed and chaotic with few standout films and a lot of duds justice league rather than being dcs answer to the avengers was a colossal misstep from which the dceu never recovered now with james gunn preparing to reboot the entire dc canon the task has fallen to aquaman and the lost kingdom  never during production intended to be a final chapter  to close the book on the dceu perhaps fittingly this anticlimactic slog is what we have come to expect from dc movies  an overlong visually cluttered experience thats more interested in special effects and audio engineering than storytelling the aquaman sequel feels like it was mostly constructed in postproduction with cgi working handinhand with editing to fashion something borderlinecoherent no matter how much fan love there might be for jason momoa its not enough to save this production there are essentially three major threads fighting for screen time the first and most enjoyable relates to the brotherly rivalry between arthur curry momoa king of atlantis and his deposed younger sibling former king orm patrick wilson circumstances force arthur to break orm out of prison and the two engage in a whitehot lovehate relationship worthy of a romcom momoa has about 10x more chemistry with wilson than with arthurs alleged love interest mera played by either amber heard or her cardboard lookalike then theres a revenge subplot with aquaman baddie black manta yahya abdulmateen ii determined to wipe out arthurs entire bloodline using the black magic powers of his newly acquired black trident finally theres the weaponization of climate change  a plot contortion that recalls superman ivs disastrous attempt to meld realworld geopolitical concerns with a comic book storyline  the films overcluttered cgi at least gives viewers pretty things to look at for two hours rupert gregsonwilliams score sounds suitably epic with discordant beats preparing viewers for big battles and ugly confrontations but none of this means much of anything considering how little tension even the most extreme confrontation generates the movie is so predictable that its possible to take a bathroom break in the middle of a major fight scene and have a more exciting time trying to get the automated soap dispenser working properly i stepped out for two minutes and missed absolutely nothing this is short attention span cinema at its most extreme  following the success of aquaman warner brothers decided that the best approach was to reform the band so in addition to resigning most of the actors director james wan was lured back rumor has it that early test screenings were disastrous amber heards involvement became divisive after her spousal abuse trial against johnny depp the unclear future of the dceu which apparently resulted in both michael keaton and ben affleck filming scenes as bruce wayne neither of which was ultimately used hung like the sword of damocles over the extensive reshoots like the flash the movie was deemed too expensive a property to jettison so it was released into theaters with a wing and a prayer  not the best strategy for a ninefigure production  to the extent that theres anything worthwhile to be found in aquaman and the lost kingdom beyond the pretty visuals one need look no further than the lead actor momoa has an easy unforced charisma that shines regardless of whether hes reenacting a scene from three men and a baby fighting to stay awake during an atlantean council meeting or trying to keep us from dozing off as he goes on an endless search for black manta  as far as the climate change element is concerned  this aspect of the plot is so badly mishandled that it will thrill deniers far and wide climate change is placed on the same level of fantastical nonsense as black magic tridents and wondrous underwater cities im sure that screenwriters had the best of intentions when writing this into the story but the same can be said of lawrence konner  mark rosenthal when they sat down at a typewriter in 1986 what did we get out of that nuclear man  so i raise my glass to the dceu  a decadelong cinematic excursion that done differently might have left behind more than a few widelyscattered good memories some want to blame the pandemic for its failure but this is more a case of deep structural instability exacerbated by egomaniacal personalities and inept planning the first aquaman may have been lowbrow fun but the second is a chore from start to finish momoa we are told will be back with dc in a different role hopefully this time hell have a screenplay worthy of his largerthanlife personality

narratives same thing here a fusion of john carter 2012 and jupiter ascending 2015 that rips whole pages from the star wars sagas still the problem isnt so much that theres zero semblance of

Dec 30 2023,negative, aquaman and the lost kingdom is not a good film its barely even a passable superhero film which is a shame along with a great number of dc comics fans i love jason momoa as arthur curry  aquaman hes among the best casting decisions in the dceu but his charisma and amiability are thoroughly squandered here which is probably the biggest of the films many disappointments he tries his best but even his leading man star power cant save this mess seeking revenge on aquaman mamoa for his fathers death black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is back with a powerful new weapon in his arsenal the mythic black trident with it manta is able to unleash an ancient evil that will bring a reign of terror into the kingdom seeking help to defeat his enemy aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson the siblings must set aside their differences and join forces to protect atlantis and save the world from total destruction the plot is simple and straightforward and highly capable director james wan relies on cgi effects for a majority of his storytelling theres nothing wrong with that in theory this is a superhero action movie after all but here everything looks murky at best and goofy at worst most of the film of course takes place underwater which limits the type and scope of the action the biggest problem is that only about 15 of the movie delivers any type of fun which isnt a recipe for success its not funny enough nor all that interesting and the best parts get lost in the clutter once orm arrives the story does pick up a bit and its enjoyable to watch the two fight together against manta who sadly is a secondrate villain the stakes arent high enough and nothing made me care about what was happening on screen writing this review is difficult because im overcome with such indifference aquaman and the lost kingdom is a sequel that doesnt do much to help the oftmaligned dceu and its another mediocre entry that proves superhero movie fatigue is a real thing its also a shame that this sad unremarkable goodbye to what shouldve been mamoas defining character is all thats afforded to fans they and aquaman deserved better than this
Dec 29 2023,neutral, if audiences were polled on which cinematic superhero theyd like to have a beer with jason momoas aquaman would surely rank high otherwise known as arthur curry hes a burly affable guy with the look of a domesticated hells angel who wears a bathrobe around the house enjoys a good hamburger and dotes on his infant son arthur has the swagger of a naturalborn fighter but is allergic to pretension  that is while hes on land things are otherwise in his second home below the waves where he serves as the hereditary ruler of atlantis a position that allows him to ride around on a giant seahorse in between sitting through boring meetings with a council of elders who tend to shoot down his better ideas its not hard to imagine why this vision of a double life might resonate with director james wan an australian whose record of commercial success is matched by few in hollywood wans first aquaman film released five years ago was among the more endearing recent superhero blockbusters and like its hero managed to balance the flamboyant and the unassuming but much as arthur has learnt the novelty of being king wears off a degree of creative weariness is visible in aquaman and the lost kingdom reportedly a farewell not just to momoas aquaman but to the entire looseknit comicbook saga known as the dc extended universe henry cavills superman and gal gadots wonder woman have likewise been handed their redundancy papers despite the effective casting of all three is this a grand finale tying together all the dc extended universes loose threads not even close although theres plenty of fulltilt undersea action to distract us the plot resembles one of the more fantastical bond movies with a scarred supervillain yahya abdulmateen ii who schemes to speed up global warming as roundabout revenge for the death of his dad saving the day requires the help of arthurs embittered halfbrother wan regular patrick wilson the main antagonist in the first aquaman the resulting sibling squabbles supply the central emotional dynamic with amber heard as arthurs bride mera largely reduced to cheering from the sidelines with her inlaws played as before by temuera morrison and nicole kidman one jokey moment threatens to give the entire game away arthur addresses his brother as loki acknowledging the parallels with marvels rival thor franchise theres no denying he has a point he could equally have compared atlantis with wakanda the hidden kingdom in marvels black panther but the exchange raises a host of further questions now never to be answered do the marvel movies exist in the dc extended universe as well as the comic books if so does arthur enjoy watching them when kicking back in his home above sea level with pretzels and a pint of guinness does he view them as fantasy or a form of social realism
Dec 29 2023,negative,i wasnt expecting much from aquaman and the lost kingdom i got even less
Dec 29 2023,positive, the movie is filled with eye candy with digital effects in almost every scene and there is plenty of action leavened by the aforementioned humor this movie is a bit of enjoyable escapism 
Dec 29 2023,positive, aquaman and the lost kingdom  124 minutes m in a perfectly fine thick slice of superhero cinematic chowder aquaman jason momoa finds himself battling the same villain he shook down in 2018s aquaman the biggest film from the present dc stable taking more than us11 billion crazed with vengeance black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is determined to kill aquaman and all he holds dear which includes his wife mera amber heard in her first film since the johnny depp fiasco and now a baby son to defeat manta once and for all  really they couldnt dream up a fresh baddie for the sequel try harder hollywood   aquaman needs to team up with brother orm patrick wilson who he condemned to a horrible prison hellhole in the first film theres nothing much new here to be honest the action consists of the usual fireballs fights and exchanges of energy bolts that come in a pleasant variety of colours red green blue white theres much ado about the mystery of atlantis the search for which embroils an inquisitive but rather weakwilled scientist randall park in a neat comic turn into the clutches of black manta the mandatory stabs at topicality involve mantas plan to accelerate global warming and aquamans attempt to get his underwater council of conservative boneheads to see that the only way to save the world is to put away their sense of moral superiority and make peace with the surface again directed by australian james wan sawfurious 7 the film unspools as fine if unexceptional multiplex mulch a good way to kill two hours and four minutes note the film itself actually clocks out at a relatively lean 113 minutes before the credits roll though mera is aquamans wife shes a relatively minor figure as is aquamans mum played by a barely recognizable nicole kidman who shares the frame with an equally unrecognizable dolph lundgren veteran brit john rhysdavies provides the voice of a large crustacean and somewhere in the mix is veteran funnyman martin short despite efforts from fans to have heard removed from the film including a petition with four million signatures the heads at warner bros stood by her even though they ran the risk of her having a negative effect on the film thus far the film which has arrived with much less fanfare than we usually get with superhero onslaughts has taken around 108m globally which is a little soft but nowhere near the marvels  heard and her agents must be praying that nobody blames her for the underperformance she has enough to worry about as she tries getting her career back in gear
Dec 29 2023,negative, this aquaman and the lost kingdom review marks the last time we will be discussing a new release from the nowdefunct dc extended universe the aquaman sequel is the final film of that shared universe that saw other amazing films like birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one harley quinn the suicide squad and zack snyders justice league however the lost kingdom does not live up to any of those or even other lesser dceu films the sequel is largely a mess of new ideas aboutturns from established characters and a storyline that genuinely made no sense whatsoever read on for my aquaman and the lost kingdom review  the first aquaman film was honestly a lot of fun sure there wasnt a lot of consistency throughout such as the tonal shift into a romcom about halfway into the movie but the ridiculous shenanigans were enjoyable enough not to mention seeing the perfect casting of jason momoa as aquaman this rebellious loner who has to save the world there is no such redeeming thing in the lost kingdom  the movie tries to do too much with not enough establishing of concepts so audiences are trying to wrap their mind around one thing while even more farfetched ideas keep coming up the lost kingdom deals with arthur momoa now king of atlantis juggling being a ruler with being a father seemingly not content with the politics of running a kingdom aquaman longs for adventure the kind of onthestreet ocean level crime fighting he is used to but an old villain in black manta yahya abdulmateen ii threatens to upend all of what arthur is trying to establish by using crazy atlantean technology of his own this is where things fly off the rail a little bit  this aquaman and the lost kingdom review will focus more on those tonal inconsistencies and where the story seemingly flies off the handle the movie opens in a very john hugheslike ferris beulertype of story with aquaman himself narrating the recap of his life for audiences its cheesy and feels very out of place in an aquaman movie a montage shows his everyday life as a new dad and ruler of atlantis but weirdly mera amber heard his wife and mother of his child is completely absent the movie also makes it seem like aquaman is a single dad but then mera pops up in a scene or two here and there its confusing and definitely feels like a hodge podge of multiple versions of the story edited together  in many ways the lost kingdom is emblematic of all the issues that plagued the dceu in its 10 yearrun no plan or foresight of direction countless studio interferences and a failure to understand how to do a shared universe in the first place aquaman himself is also seemingly different but not in a good way the previous portrayals of the character by momoa in the other dceu entries were as a lovable badass who was also a rebellious loner here momoa plays him as this goofball who is obnoxious and annoying shrugging off any sense of somber or serious behavior its a jarring shift in his depiction that is just one of the many confounding decisions highlighted in this aquaman and the lost kingdom review  another aspect of this aquaman sequel is how its billed as this buddycomedy seeing how arthur has to team up with his brother orm patrick wilson in order to find where black manta is hiding but they also end up teaming up because orm is technically good now i guess its weird but it also does explain the shift in aquamans behavior seeing how the odd couple pairing sees orm as the straight man who doesnt know the inner workings of the surface world it makes sense that aquaman himself would be the goofy comic relief it just didnt make sense with all the other things the character had to do in the story  the black manta storyline had a lot going on so hellbent on revenge manta teams up with a scientist played by randall park to find more atlantean technology to rebuild his suit so he can kill aquaman along the way he finds a black trident belonging to the king of the lost kingdom of atlantis he speaks to him through the trident giving him access to all this advanced destructive technology bases ships and weaponry its like an entirely different movie and exposition crammed into just one characters arc which also happens to be the main threat of the story but none of it services whatever larger story they were trying to tell  the story also tries to do too much with whatever is happening onscreen the initial plan seems to be setting up how aquamans heart isnt in being a king something he will maybe learn throughout the movie similar to valkyries arc in thor love and thunder but that doesnt go anywhere as he did exactly what he does in the first movie go on an adventure and kick butt the ending just sees orm tell him hes ready sure  then theres this other angle of how aquaman wants atlantis to reveal themselves to the rest of the world but the others dont similar to tchalla in black panther its spoken of once and then happens in the climax never fully developing why this is important so the climax means noting  theres also how the brothers bond by going on this new adventure like loki and thor in thor ragnarok that arc of how they go from enemies to family throughout the story is also very surfacelevel and predictable there are also throwaway conversations and plot points about being a father family climate activism global warming and so much more that none of them are done properly  the sequel to aquaman ends the dceu with such a whimper that its almost a blessing given how this movie ended up none of the stakes mattered and none of the relationships mattered the performances are lackluster despite an awesome fight scene nicole kidman is a waste in her role as aquamans mother amber heard is nonexistent while there might be one or two moments of laughoutloud comedy between wilson and momoas dynamic its not nearly enough to make up for everything else going on in many ways the lost kingdom is emblematic of all the issues that plagued the dceu in its 10 yearrun no plan or foresight of direction countless studio interferences administrative changes and a failure to understand how to do a shared universe in the first place  what did you think of this last movie of the dceu let me know in the comments below or follow me on x formerly twitter at theshahshahid for more reviews

Dec 29 2023,negative, 2018s aquaman was a strange and surprising entry in warner brothers and dcs film slate after making the unexpected choice to cast the hulkingyetcharismatic jason momoa as the titular character the film seemed to almost show up out of nowhere that christmas season as if we never really expected it to happen yet there it was an undeniably charming  if albeit clunky and silly  explosion of bright colors and mild profanity filled with a bizarre cast that somehow worked willem dafoe nicole kidman temuera morrison and a pinkhaired dolph lundgren joined momoa for this whacky romp that somehow worked even when it probably shouldnt have momoa followed it with a role in zack snyders justice league in both of its iterations so a sequel became inevitable what was not inevitable was the disintegration of the snyderverse  once a grand plan for a series of interconnected mcuesque films now a crumbling ruin that universe was closed out with the flash one of not just the worst superhero films but one of the worst films of 2023 full stop  and now aquaman and the lost kingdom its an ignominious ending to that shortlived universe to be sure directed by james wan who helmed the first film the lost kingdom is another silly entry in the franchise this time arthur curryaquaman is now the king of atlantis ruling beside his queen mera amber heard while they also deal with life as new parents black manta yaya abdulmateen ii the secondary villain from the first film becomes the primary antagonist this time around empowered by an ancient technology that threatens not just aquaman and atlantis but the entire world this time aquaman must free his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson and go on a quest to find manta before its too late its a complete mess so many elements of the first film are simply recycled a quest leading to a secret lair in the desert the discovery of a mysterious island of secrets that the newer elements a clever take on pirate hideouts the newfound camaraderie of the two brothers are somewhat dulled yet even that aside the film stumbles left and right whether its due to its shoddy set designs that look like they were made by a community theater stage crew or its uninspired action choreography its hard to tell what the main issue is its unfortunate too because the actors are all wholly invested in this crazy collection of nonsense momoa was born for roles like this and he clearly relishes the ridiculousness of it and abdulmateen ii chews his villainous scenery with unbridled enthusiasm patrick wilson seems like he stumbled into the set and just rolled with it but it sort of works in his favor even nicole kidman rocking a silver onesie winks her way through it there are undeniably fun parts to it a cgi octopus named topo gets some good gags in and there are some clever action moments to it even if the film suffers from that frustrating superhero movie tendency to populate themselves with hordes of faceless villains that distract from its main characters there are some inventive elements an island of giant mutated creatures is a fun distraction peppered throughout the film just enough to keep the viewer from nodding off but not necessarily enough to make the film succeed perhaps its superhero fatigue perhaps its the fact that you know that youre watching a film that is ultimately fruitless since its the end of the line in a universe that has come to a screeching and unfortunate halt but theres something in aquaman and the lost kingdom that prevents the viewer from ever really being invested in it its not a boring film but rather simply an unfocused and unnecessary one its fun to watch but ultimately unmemorable filled with actors who appear to have wholly bought into a script that doesnt quite know what to do with them its a brightly colored clumsily rendered ending of an era a mediocre whimper that desperately wanted to be a bang 
Dec 28 2023,neutral,this aquaman is never going to be anybodys idea of a good film but its heart is in the right place and it never left me feeling actually irritated or bored
Dec 27 2023,positive,a big fun knowingly silly slab of studio superhero madness that anchors itself with enough emotion and characterisation to keep things on course 
Dec 27 2023,negative,this is going to end up on my worst of 2023 list for sure
Dec 27 2023,negative, its never a good sign when the social and review embargo lifts just a day before the film opens aquaman and the lost kingdom excels in its diversity casting but fails in building believable and touching intimate moments making this a stilted and too often awkward twohour journey about two brothers forging connections of respect and friendship amber heard haters be forewarned she may be just a blinkyoumissher moment in the trailers but she has a lot of screen time here aside from the lack of chemistry between heard as mera and jason momoas aquaman there the question of does the dc extended universe know how to use the talent they have ill write more on this later aquaman was the origin story written by geoff johns will beall and director james wan with screenplay by david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and beall and aquaman and the lost kingdom is basically a buddy road story for a quick refresher in the 2018 aquaman a humble lighthouse keeper in maine thomas curry māori actor temuera morrison saves the queen of atlantis atlanna nicole kidman they fall in love and have a child who they name arthur but atlanna must return to atlantis and her arranged marriage with king orvax the ruler of atlantis atlanna leaves her advisor nuidis vulko to teach and train her son as he grows up arthur becomes known in the surface world as the meta human aquaman and excels is fighting  some of his fighting includes saving a russian sub from the pirates led by jesse kane michael beach and his son david yahya abdulmateen ii aquaman leaves jesse to die before he died jesse asks his son to avenge his death to do so david will find an ally in atlantis aquamans brother  yet this isnt what brings aquaman to face his heritage and begin his path toward claiming the throne of atlantis its the threat to the surface world aquaman must fight his younger halfbrother king orm marius patrick wilson who has united the kingdoms of the sea in war against the surface world to stop the pollution in some murky plotting after bearing a child to orvax atlanna was sacrificed to the creatures of the trench orm blames arthur for his mothers death although mera is betrothed to orm she aids and even saves aquaman as he seeks the trident of atlantis first king to give him the upper hand along the way aquaman finds his mother and brings her back to atlantis once aquaman beats his brother he exiles his brother the film begins with a fake out that i wont spoil but arthur curry has married mera and theyve had a son arthur jr they live in the lighthouse with arthurs father tom but they also find time to do boring stuff in atlantis being kind isnt all adventure and brawling and beer theres a lot of diplomatic and bureaucratic duties that go along with being a royal especially now that the undersea kingdoms were united after the first film while aquaman wants to form diplomatic ties with the surface world the council of the kingdoms are against it  elsewhere marine biologist dr stephen shin randall park  is exploring the arctic looking for evidence of atlantis so that he will finally be taken seriously  yet how seriously can you take a researcher who falls in league with a master villain global warming has caused ancient ice to melt something attacks his colleague although david kaneblack manta and his team rescues shin they continue to explore underneath the arctic ice david discovers a black trident and when he fits it together he has strange visions and is given meta human powers and the promise that he will be helped in his plan to destroy aquaman his family and atlantis  in this lost kingdom ancient atlantean machines are discovered and shin is able to restore them yet the machines are powered by orichalcum which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases the denizens of the underwater world had abandoned this technology because it caused global warming on the surface world the extreme weather pattern changes are being reported and for the citizens of the seas the orichalcum is causing outbreaks of diseases  to find black manta aquaman goes undercover to free his brother from his prison in the fisherman kingdom because he is the only underwater dweller known to have dealt with black manta previous film once freed from his prison orm leads aquaman to a pirate lair  but remember even before he was king aquaman was a oneman antipiracy force on the seas meeting with the crime lord kingfish they learn theres a south pacific volcanic island where david kane is based  on that island the orichalcum has caused the earth flora and fauna to mutate aquaman and orm must work together to find and defeat black manta there are many problems with aquaman and the lost kingdom first you might be able to lose a house in a tornado or a city in the jungle but a whole kingdom secondly  you have to accept that queen mother atlanna and the queen mera would go into battle then you have to accept that when the men of atlantis go into battle they wear armor or at least aquaman as king always wears armor in the previous film you had to accept that mera had no ladiesinwaiting and would not be burnt to a crisp in the desert sun like any other ginger and wear highheel boots walking in the desert dunes and through ancient caves yet for most of the first film aquaman was wearing regular human clothes that somehow withstood super heroic feats in this film the disparity between what atlanna and mera wear and what aquaman and orm wear is more obvious  then theres dr shin who i thought was a marine biologist but seems more like an anthropologist and in this film he has the knowledge and knowhow to get ancient atlantean technology to work  momoas characterization of aquaman is a boisterous brawler who doesnt feel any angst for the deaths he may have caused including the death of jesse kane thats not a good quality in a king or superhero in this film he has added family to his concerns but what about the lives lost behind that   i remain unconvinced of the chemistry between heard and momoa and this film doesnt build up the brotherly lovehate relationship well with the dialogue despite having a story by jason momoa thomas paa sibbett david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and director james wan and a screenplay by johnsonmcgoldrick the conjuring 2 and orphan the dialogue is only serviceable what you hope for in a buddybonding road film especially one where the two start out on bad terms is witty dialogue rewatching the first film i noticed how unremarkable the dialogue was and this film doesnt offer an improvement there what makes this film so frustrating is that momoa has more to give than just heroic posturing as his deliciously deliriously demonic villain in the fast  furious franchise demonstrated earlier this year wilson must be able to handle comedy as well he was nominated for tony awards for the full monty in 2001 and oklahoma in 2002 for the lead characters most of the attempts at comedy in aquaman and the lost kingdom  focused on momoas aquamans brawling beerguzzling persona with wilsons orm the straight man even then the timing seemed off but the timing seemed off elsewhere such as the scene where aquaman offers to help manta holding on a beat too long  theres a lot of comedic gold that went unmined such as both wilsons orm and heards mera adjusting to life on the surface world and even both heards mera and kidmans atlanna adjusting to life with surface dwellers i dont think the prank aquaman pulls on his brother helps the ability to use the technology of the lost kingdom could have also been a source of humor but black mantas troops are all so seriously efficient and unwaveringly loyal  in a way that local and potential toxic bosses and dangerous dictators could only envy  there are some beautiful moments especially in the lost kingdom that draws from both the wan and johnsonmcgoldricks background in horror the world building of atlantis and the other kingdoms is amazing much thought went into this perhaps more than into the actual dialogue and more than dialogue there would be more nuanced performances i do appreciate the theme of brothers in conflict but that still remained underdeveloped  aquaman and the lost kingdom will be released on 22 december 2023 if youre going to see it see it in imax or 4xd the press screening on wednesday was in imax and despite the pouring rain and thunderstorm the rain stopped long enough for the drive to and back aquaman and the lost kingdom is not a total loss nor is it a total win for the troubled dc extended universe 
Dec 27 2023,neutral, color me surprised twice over i missed the press screening of aquaman and the lost kingdom the closing chapter of the dc extended universe and ventured to a theater to check out a screening in imax on christmas day the lobby was packed with customers most of whom were going to see the color purple on its opening day given how much ive forgotten random stuff recently ill go with that as the excuse for why i wasnt expecting so many people to be watching movies on december 25th that was surprise number one surprise number two warner bros pictures aquaman and the lost kingdom wasnt a complete disaster sure its not going to earn a spot in the top 10 out of 15 dceu films but it wasnt the catastrophic failure that needed to be hidden away by the studio the way some had suggested if this is the last time we see jason momoas long flowing locks drifting around his head in all their cg glory then at least it can be said momoa went out giving it his all no matter the wonky dialogue and despite the recycled feel of the plot momoa entertained 2023s sequel to the 2018 solo aquaman film returns momoa to the undersea world as arthur curryaquaman the current king of atlantis yahya abdulmateen ii returns as aquamans nemesis david kaneblack manta  the big bad of the lost kingdom the sequel also brings back patrick wilson as orm arthurs jealous brooding halfbrother orm still holds a grudge believing himself the better and more deserving of the two siblings if arthur is the dceus thor then orm is its loki  without the twisted sense of humor wit or cleverness scratch that orms not lokiish at all but momoas take on aquaman is still reminiscent of chris hemsworths version of thor moving along the sequel spends a good deal of time on arthurs family life hes a proud papa and his dad tom temuera morrison dotes on his first grandchild mera amber heard pops in now and again mostly to save her hubby dispense advice or help take care of arthur junior nicole kidman also puts in sporadic appearances to try and get her boys to stop bickering and to divulge key details on the political life of atlanteans looking for exposition kidmans atlannas full of it what arthur doesnt know about running the undersea world and negotiating with the council could fill volumes hed flounder if his mom werent there to get him out of fishy situations while black manta is a worthy adversary in this outing davids gone fullon crazy after discovering the ruler of the lost kingdoms black trident kordax pilou asbaek gets into davids head making promises about how powerful david will become if the lost kingdom is returned to its evil glory but to do so david will need to cause havoc above ground by heating the planet and hell need to kidnap and kill junior only the king of atlantis dna can break the curse that holds kordax captive in a frozen state and black manta stands a better chance at capturing a baby than he does at incapacitating aquaman  even though black mantas primary motivation from the films opening minutes is to kill aquaman the story is simple yet manages to get all tangled up in the minutia what with the world of the lost kingdom the destruction of the environment and the political shenanigans going on in the undersea universe the cherry on top of this massive plot ball is the relationship between arthur and orm the dysfunctional relationship between arthur and orm is aquaman and the lost kingdoms beating heart their lovehate relationship powers the film and nothing else comes close to having the same impact jason momoa and patrick wilson are an entertaining duo and have much better onscreen chemistry than momoa and amber heard who is hardly heard from in this sequel arthurs the cutup the class clown the big man on campus who everyone loves orms the straight man playing the part of the reluctant foil in this superhero duo together they make a formidable team and help overcome some of the films narrative missteps as for the action it doesnt seem to have progressed much from the first aquaman its only when the sequel reaches the final battle that the action feels as if theres anything at stake everything leading up to that is so overthetop and cgheavy that theres no sense of urgency or emotional investment in the fight sequences 2023s been a crummy year for the dceu with problematic stars headlining two of their releases  shazam fury of the gods and the flash  which contributed to their disappointing box office performances blue beetle deserved to have drawn in a larger audience but strikes the lack of major star power and a central character thats unknown to those who arent into comics hurt its chances at success at 128 million worldwide blue beetle has the dubious distinction of being the lowestgrossing film in the dceu put a fork in the dceu its done after 15 films and sadly despite jason momoas efforts the dceus going out with a splat rather than a bang pow kaboom
Dec 27 2023,negative,the movies silly screenplay simply cannot play to momoas strengths as either a cracker of quality gags or a kicker of badguy butts
Dec 27 2023,positive, 10 years on and the dc extended universe has come to an end starting as we meant to go on with zack snyders man of steel we did not exactly go on that way at all through it all we have had snyderverses directorial fracas reshoots controversy barnstorming success hierarchical change reshaping reevaluations bold decisions project shelving incredible moments and catastrophic failure through the good the bad and the mad no doubt about it this has been a ride and this longdelayed sequel to the dceus highest grossing film in 2018s aquaman is a film that is a strange way to end but also in many ways a perfect one aquaman and the lost kingdom is set several years on as arthur curry jason momoa sits as king of atlantis but also fights as the watery hero aquaman its a tough balance to maintain especially as he is also a father now but the stability of the world is about to be thrown into abject chaos as the vengeful david kane aka black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is desperately seeking vengeance and to attain it will go to any length as he discovers and unleashes an ancient dark power that threatens to burn the earth to the ground for better  and in many minds we are sure for worse  this is a pureblooded aquaman movie through and through leaning into the craziest facets of this long mocked watery world and hero the last movie felt loyal to that comic book world but with this followup director james wan even further embraces it all to simply ridiculous but fun extent affectionately hugging horror nods range from tremors to texas chainsaw massacre and bmovie madness on a grand spectacleheavy scale delivering something akin to flash gordon by way of 20000 leagues under the sea and journey to the centre of the earth with star wars james bond and the lord of the rings sprinklings if that sounds like everything thrown at the screen well that is because it bloody well is not everything works a final act showdown is all too easily resolved certain things are a little messy and some tones dont swim together too smoothly but this funny warm and weird ride is appropriately controversial divisive and interesting and in the most bizarre of ways is a bigger aiming movie sequel wholly appropriate for this character and this franchise jason momoas cool and heartfelt hero and patrick wilsons endearingly selfserious antihero halfbrother orm are this storys sturdy brotherly anchor at core with a knockabout chemistry that feels lovable in its own barmy way while the visually engaging and wild adventure yarn that surrounds the films familyfocused spirit keeps on going with creative creature designs wacky lore and even a fishy cabarets that would make jabba the hutt ho ho ho in joy  the film even takes a stab at a few more environmental themes amidst its rapid waves of deep sea battles and hero vs hateconsumed villain clash to that latter point what a particular joy it was to see a superhero film actually have a baddie that they allow to cross lines and be scary without wimping out at the very end with a hand holding hallmark redemption yahya abdulmateen iis terrific black manta is certainly an ace in the deck of the movie who dominates some of the films best action sequences among a cast of some rather weighty names the first film may well be superior and more tightly put together but this one is certainly worth the ticket this christmas delivering precisely the kind of seahorse riding octopusbefriending big screen tridentswirling mayhem you expect with a lot crammed into every moment of the surprisingly nottoolong duration  imperfect of course but lord knows it is engagingly off the seawall stuff with a vernian otherworldly edge and a barrage of big screen barminess that just goes for broke no matter the costs which is admirable if not maybe sensible but as aquaman himself says early on you say everybodys good at something me i talk to fishsome people think that makes me a joke but i dont care fair play opening with storm the seahorse in an actual storm and ending with a literal and figurative mic drop aquaman and the lost kingdom refreshingly gives zero fs and just is what it is making it a perfect sendoff for the dceu
Dec 27 2023,positive, the film was plagued by what seems to be a curse from the getgo with tales of reshoots circulating during its production then there was the lawsuit involving johnny depp and amber heard  who plays mera aquamans wife  and then the reaction of fans when heard barely appeared in the trailer for the movie and very little in the movie itself he once again takes on black manta yahya abdulmateen ii who now has possession of a black trident that could leave the world in ruins black manta has taken on scientist stephen shin randall park as an assistant seeking help aquaman decides he must contact his estranged half brother orm patrick wilson the former king of atlantis who is being tortured in a dungeon mostly this is an extravaganza of overblown cgi evident in nearly every frame i did watch the film at cinemark in dbox the seat moves you along with the action and that made for a couple of exciting moments still this is a fizzler of a finale for this dc brand its not a horrible movie but compared to the first aquaman and other worthy dc fare it reaches only clevel at best to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 26 2023,neutral, after all the reshooting rebooting and release date rejiggering right as 2023 comes to a close  james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom is finally out the behindthescenes story of the movie has been full of intrigue stuff had to be reshot to put ben affleck in it then reshot to take him out the highprofile amber heard trial means she probably had several scenes cut the movie moved from release date to release date in the midst of all this a companywide relaunch means aquaman 2 is the  unplanned ending to the entire dceu with all of that youd hope the movie was a trainwreck or better yet a triumph its neither its a very odd place in which i find myself when it comes to this review as with most films i review i try to approach the movie on its own merits first and foremost then if applicable i think about the greater place in its respective franchise or cinematic universe with aquaman and the lost kingdom i cant help but think about it in terms of the strange uneven and ultimately failed endeavor that was the dc extended universe for every unexpected successwonder woman and the first aquamanwe had a bevy of bloated pofaced attempts to ape the marvel model it was a cinematic universe without a clear vision ethos tone or level of quality  aquaman made an ungodly amount of money in 2018 which surprised literally everyone jason momoas charisma the vibrant atlantean vistas and james wans innovative and frenetic action sequences all worked in its favor i will say this for both that movie and its sequel they remain gleefully unrelated to the other dceu movies sure arthur curry appears in other dceu products but none of that infiltrates his story  this movie finds arthur and mera heard married and with a newborn baby hes finding the business of ruling atlantis not everything its cracked up to be he spends most or all of his evenings drinking beer at his dad temuera morrisons lighthouse unfortunately david kane aka black manta yahya abdulmateen ii still wants revenge from what happened in the first movie to that end he has found a mystical black trident which gives him terrible powers it also affords him knowledge of where to find a longburied fuel source that ore causes the earth to overheat ruining the surface environment and poisoning the underwater inhabitants if he succeeds itll free a dormant army of the dead its bad is what im saying in order to fight manta arthur will need the help of his halfbrother orm patrick wilson who has been imprisoned since the events of the first movie can the unlikely family put aside their differences for the good of the planet oh also randall park is here as a scientist under mantas employ who very quickly decides he doesnt want to be involved but cant leave parks dr shin gets a whole lot of screentime more even than black manta and certainly more than either mera or nicole kidmans atlanna the biggest issue with the movie is you can see all the fingers in the pot arthur has a baby but the baby only matters for the plot most of the theming of the first moviefamily duty romancetake a backseat to lofty environmental messaging which itself feels pretty tacked on mera as a character only exists to get arthur out of trouble at the last second the ormarthur relationship is the most fleshed out in the movie but it isnt set up at all in the early part of the movie and manta is a halfnote villain who doesnt even get to be his own person because a ghost monster has him in a thrall  who knows how much the actual plot changed during the many years of production and postproduction as with way too many of these movies even if you hadnt heard of all the studio issues youd be able to tell something was off i didnt love the first aquaman movie but at least it felt of a piece with itself all of momoas fratdude charm here feels oddly out of step with the rest of the movie but the movie doesnt even comment on it he doesnt succeed or fail because of that he doesnt grow or change and because nothing really resonates the humor doesnt feel earned  ultimately who cares i dont want to keep kicking this movie or this franchise when its down wan momoa and the rest of the crew have been put in a truly unenviable position most of us know this is the end of the franchise there will be no more momoa as aquaman caveat unless this movie somehow makes bank the way the first one did this isnt the worst movie in the franchise by a longshot its not even the worst dceu movie to come out this calendar year its simply the last one  aquaman and the lost kingdom is the most rare of movies a franchise entry released with no hope of furthering a franchise dc movies need a clean break and it just stinks for everyone involved they announced the clean break with four more movies on the horizon its enjoyable enough it has a few decent action sequences if you want more aquaman go see it at least it has a cgi seahorse kyle anderson is the senior editor for nerdist he hosts the weekly pop culture deepdive  podcast laser focus you can find his  film and tv reviews here follow him on  instagram and  letterboxd
Dec 26 2023,positive,aquaman 2 will appeal to a younger crowd and those just looking for a fun action flick no one should be going into this with the assumption its highart 
Dec 26 2023,negative, here it is the last gasp of the dc extended universe five years after aquaman seemed to signal a big turn in fortunes for marvels competitor aquaman and the lost kingdom is actually closing off its era what a difference a few years make james wan is back in the directors chair and it must be said that while this is a bloated rather clunky ride wan does manage to add his style in a way that stands out dc movies have always tried to overcompensate by letting the effects do all the talking the lost kingdom doesnt feel as grand as its predecessor but you can still give the effects team some respect this movie still feels like a great white shark that wan just couldnt control so its been a few years since the events of the last movie and arthur aka aquaman jason momoa is now king of the underwater civilization of atlantis as he tells us over the opening narration being king is not that easy and comes with many boring bureaucratic hassles aquaman is also now a dad with wife mera amber heard they dont live in some oceanic palace but at the pleasant lighthouse cottage belonging to arthurs dad tom temuera morrison out in the seven seas black manta yahya abdulmateen ii has hired a scientist obsessed with atlantis dr stephen shin randall park to help him on a quest for revenge against aquaman you may recall black mantas father died fighting the aquatic royal at the beginning of the first movie just his luck black manta comes across a dark trident holding a menacing power linked to a lost kingdom this force takes over the vengeful pirate and gives him the power to threaten atlantis and the whole world in a telling sign of the dceus fate 2018s aquaman remains the studios top grossing film meaning its the only one to cross 1 billion the lost kingdom is meant to be the final entry before james gunn revamps the whole universe with his upcoming superman movie the results of the reported reshoots and story tinkering are evident in how theres no link made here to the other dc titles expect no cameos from wonder woman the flash or batman the first movie was a clear attempt at catching up to marvels brand of mythic filmmaking where comic book goofiness combines with slick spectacle ironically enough the lost kingdom has much in common with the mcus recent flop the marvels like that movie this one returns to an even shallower bullet point kind of superhero movie  its always surprising when a popcorn entertainment like this one required three writers only because the plot aims for nothing higher than a basic costumed romp aquaman wasnt necessarily brilliant but it gave space for some genuine charm and moments of geeky melodrama wan no doubt under pressure to put posteriors in imax seats this time goes for purely mindless action the crammed plot charges along with predictable detours when aquaman discovers black manta has returned he goes on a clandestine mission to a desert prison to liberate his brother orm patrick wilson his adversary from the first movie they are siblings after all and learn to work together by running through a mutating jungle where orm learns the delicacy of eating roaches and later blowing up stuff underwater very well their best scene involves meeting a slimy undersea gangster kingfish martin short comic characters like this are too rare in the movie another one is an octopus topo who only pops in for one sequence as a skilled agent sent to give aquaman some backup topo who first appeared in the aquaman comics in 1956 has the potential to be very likable but disappears theres also hype that it plays multiple instruments which we never see most of the cast feel like glorified cameos tabloids have been anticipating how amber heard would be featured following the scandalous public trial involving exhusband johnny depp theres certainly nothing scandalous here heard along with nicole kidman as queen atlanna who surely returned solely for the paycheck does nothing more than ride cgi beasts throw a few punches yell a few commands control some swirling water and barely talk dolph lundgren as king nereus gets less lines than the crab king who joins the heroes to fight off the big threat at the end yahya abdulmateen ii a very good actor is reduced to shouting lots of cliché lines about getting revenge with a psychotic look reminding us his character is possessed by the spirit of the dark trident randall park shines a bit more as the pitiful scientist forced to do black mantas bidding before begging aquaman and orm to show some mercy as for momoa theres much else he can do here other than continue the bad boy as king persona popping open a guinness and cracking bad jokes james wan has always been a visually lively director his roots are in horror and the dceu surely wanted him because of the conjuring which set off another big franchise the lost kingdom lacks the pop art majesty of aquaman but in 3d it still has a few moments of genuine fun when momoa has to speed through threats to save someone we also get a wider sense of life in atlantis during battles that crash through the kingdoms markets and restaurants there remain sequences where the skill of the animators is admirable from the detail in an action scene to quirky underwater nightclub singers yet wan never lets loose because he has to follow the recycled plots beats everyone congregates at yet another ominous lair where they must battle the real even bigger foe controlling manta who is connected to some atlantean lord of the rings style history its a lot of setup for aquaman to then just lunge his trident and turning the villain into digital pixels  moviegoers attending out of simple curiosity will at least not be treated to another superhero movie where you needed to watch the previous dozen to comprehend whats happening wan closes the movie with some scenes of genuine cheer as aquaman addresses the un introducing atlantis to the surface world and orm discovers the spell of a cheeseburger but unlike its predecessors dont hold your breath wan has no surprises left the lost kingdom truly marks the end of a defining phase for the dceu now the studio will go back to the drawing board for once the big superhero factories marvel and dc find themselves on equal footing they both need to restrategize and reboot their big galaxies it may not quite be the end but the lost kingdom confirms the format is lost at sea and needs to find new shores

000527246  000531767 just know who spiderman is right exactly its like the deeper the cut the bigger the 59 000531807  000535408 fan and i feel like star labs is a pretty deep cut you know theres probably a lot of people 60 000535608  000538849 out there that see miggy wearing this hoodie and think that hes a scientist or something 61 000539242  000544504 which i think is hilarious which also works you know as double purpose yep but congrats 62 000544584  000547866 mickey for winning this weeks no prize if youre the listener want a shot at winning 63 000547906  000552769 your own no prize stay tuned to later on in this episode well be asking another question 64 000552789  000557671 of the week and as our schedule gets more regular outside of the holidays hopefully well get 65 000557751  000601733 more of you guys to answer and now that thats done onto the news 66 000607374  000613179 alright this past week we learned that jonathan majors has been fired by marvel from his role 67 000613659  000620665 as kang the conqueror which is huge news considering that the entire multiversal saga for the mcu 68 000621025  000627691 was basically surrounding his character and all the variants of kang so its really unclear 69 000627731  000632155 whats going to happen from this point on its hard to know how to feel about this news because 70 000632215  000636778 on one hand you know as a fan of marvel movies you dont want to see any sort of break in 71 000636818  000641921 continuity whether or not marvel recasts the role or they choose to go with a different 72 000642061  000647763 villain as the main antagonist of this multiversal saga on the other hand majors was found guilty 73 000648183  000653146 of two of the counts charged against him including harassment and assault he was found not guilty 74 000653206  000658028 on two other counts but these charges were enough to basically force marvels hand to 75 000658068  000703911 avoid any bad press that might come their way by working with a convicted criminal essentially 76 000704051  000708655 its unlikely that jonathan majors will face any actual jail time for this but his career 77 000708715  000714580 is definitely severely damaged yeah this is actually kind of surprising news to me i mean 78 000714620  000719003 i could have seen disney go either way with this i thought that because he was acquitted 79 000719043  000724868 of the major charges that they would probably just try and keep him on board and ignore what 80 000724908  000730833 had happened but i guess disney is in such a rough place culturally and politically right 81 000730873  000736599 now that they really just didnt want to run the risk of more bad press as it were yeah 82 000736639  000741320 i mean theyre not dc theyre not going to keep ezra miller around if he was working for 83 000741340  000746382 them you know was ezra miller convicted i dont know all i know is that dudes crazy 84 000746902  000752223 oh yeah he pled guilty to a misdemeanor but again i mean jonathan majors also got two 85 000752263  000757465 misdemeanors so theyre misdemeanors theyre not felonies you know they could still vote 86 000758005  000802744 but they cant play king the next time we were supposed to see king of the conqueror was going 87 000802784  000808388 to be in the next avengers movie which was gonna be called the king dynasty that movie 88 000808428  000814193 has since been retitled to just avengers 5 its unclear what marvel is going to choose 89 000814213  000821640 to do with the character i say recast i mean so many marvel roles have been recast i dont 90 000821660  000826384 understand why i see so many people online saying just do away completely with the character 91 000826684  000831623 i think a lot of that has to do with just the dislike of the general direction for the mcu 92 000831663  000837808 currently but i kind of feel like to correct that you need a character like kang yeah 93 000837928  000843932 i mean you have a point there but i just think it would be bad optics for another actor i 94 000843952  000847574 dont think youd be able to find another actor who would want to replace jonathan majors in 95 000847594  000852818 the role considering that this whole thing is fairly controversial you know its hard 96 000853158  000859230 for i think another actor to appear like theyre taking advantage of someone i dont believe 97 000859270  000904731 that i think if you spin it in a way where its like hey jonathan majors did something 98 000904771  000909712 wrong not kenny the conqueror whos still a really cool character and now this actor 99 000909732  000913614 is going to play that really cool character i mean its not like dc is going to have a 100 000913654  000917795 hard time recasting the flash its not like an actor is not going to want to play the flash 101 000917815  000922856 because of ezra miller i dont get that connection well i mean that role is probably going to 102 000922876  000930791 be recast anyway since dc is going into a new universe i dont know its hard to say if 103 000930831  000935373 marvel decided to not recast and instead focus on a new villain the only other villain i 104 000935393  000940236 could think that they could use for this multiversal saga would be doctor doom because he is the 105 000940376  000945359 one that patched together battleworld in the 2015 secret invasion i guess you could also 106 000945379  000950161 go with the beyonder since the beyonder was the villain of the original secret wars story 107 000950321  000956225 its just like a lot of story to scrap like i guess you could make the argument that loki 108 000956325  001003072 acting as the new loom that he resets the timeline and maybe like erases all version of kang 109 001003633  001008980 i find that hard to believe i just dont think you could scrap everything fair enough so 110 001009100  001011884 i guess with that in mind that brings us to our question of the week 111 001016406  001022931 which actor would you choose to recast kang in the mcu and why yeah im sure any new 112 001023012  001028577 actor that comes into that role if they do recast would be rationalized as simply a variant 113 001028757  001033901 of the kang character so at least it would be an easy explanation but record your answer 114 001033941  001038365 at

batman arkham series thats in development will be set in james gunns 120 001103935  001109577 and peter safrans dc universe of course the arkham series was originally going to focus 121 001109657  001114766 on the gotham city police department but i guess warner brothers scrapped the idea and 122 001114806  001119728 matt reeves pitched an arkham series instead which james gunn and peter safran greenlit 123 001119808  001125149 according to gunn on social media the arkham series was always planned to be set in the 124 001125169  001130571 dcu and not part of any else worlds universe that matt reeves is working on this is huge 125 001130631  001136152 news because we initially believed that matt reeves was establishing a series set within 126 001136432  001143151 his batman universe which stars robert pattinson apparently he will be developing batman characters 127 001143371  001149135 for two different universes and im not sure how i feel about that it is strange considering 128 001149215  001154698 like the penguin show thats coming out next year is not going to be in the dcu but thats 129 001154718  001200121 spearheaded by matt reeves whos also spearheading this dcu batman project right exactly so 130 001200161  001203583 essentially hes going to be coming up with like two different versions of the riddler 131 001203963  001208979 two different versions of the joker and the penguin and everything else i was really hoping 132 001209019  001214724 when i first heard this news that this may be james gunns way of just really trying to get 133 001214924  001222111 matt reeves batman into the dcu and that still may be the case because maybe matt reeves wont 134 001222171  001226555 like having to develop two different versions of these batman characters but i guess well 135 001226595  001232540 see it could be fun considering that matt reeves batman movie takes place in a much more grounded 136 001232600  001238664 reality of dc so he works on these hyper realistic versions as well as these more comic accurate 137 001238704  001243326 versions which i assume the dcu is going to be a little bit more comic accurate and fantastical 138 001243627  001249190 and not so grounded in reality it sounds like a fun challenge honestly it sounds confusing 139 001249390  001254292 because like how many different jokers are there going to be now i mean i guess that was inevitable 140 001254352  001259655 if james gunn was going to develop his own version regardless but the fact that its matt reeves 141 001259755  001304674 doing versions for both universes just really kind of bothers me i dont understand why 142 001304734  001310995 james gunn would give matt reeves that much say over a fairly integral part of the batman 143 001311015  001315837 character his rogues as it were when matt reeves is already doing his own thing like 144 001316077  001322699 does that make sense to you no but nothing dc does ever make sense to me so okay im 145 001322739  001327640 not surprised they just make a lot of weird decisions you know its weird again im 146 001327700  001334286 hoping this is some sort of brilliant manipulation on behalf of james gunn to get maybe i should 147 001334326  001338209 be working in this new universe because its so cool and my batman could be there but then 148 001338229  001343193 you would have to have robert pattinson be a bad dad in the brave and the bold movie which 149 001343433  001348237 im fine with honestly like hes traveling the world hes meeting all these ladies hes 150 001348277  001353320 got lots of money maybe he knocks one of them up you never know but like is he old enough 151 001353441  001358604 to have a kid as old as damien wayne as long as he and talia were both 18 sure 152 001401762  001406364 sure okay so this seems like its gonna be good news for fans of the upcoming dcu and 153 001406464  001412686 not necessarily great news for fans of reeves take on the batman universe i think its honestly 154 001412726  001417588 a winwin for everybody because you know whether you liked matt reeves version of the batman 155 001417628  001422991 or not youll still get the villains for that version of batman and matt reeves genius in 156 001423011  001427913 the dcu as well because the guy is a genius yeah hes pretty good hes alright you know 157 001427933  001434278 it in your heart to be true but yeah i guess well see what happens with the batman projects 158 001434298  001439867 well keep you guys updated as to any news that we hear for the batman series or anything coming 159 001439927  001441309 from matt reeves and dc 160 001448878  001452942 but i think that does it for all the news for this episode now lets move on to the main 161 001452982  001459589 event where we review the latest dc film to hit theaters aquaman and the lost kingdom 162 001515858  001522964 aquaman and the lost kingdom is the latest and final film of the dc extended universe i think 163 001523525  001528249 you know after the flash things are a little bit grey now but the film of course stars 164 001528289  001534594 jason momoa and was directed by james wan and is the sequel to the billion dollar grossing 165 001534675  001542081 2018 film aquaman which is the highest grossing dc film of all time worldwide and that film 166 001542101  001546903 was good i think its one of the best dc films ever from a filmmaking perspective at the 167 001546943  001552426 very least the film looked gorgeous and the mythic worldbuilding done by james wan was 168 001552486  001558788 phenomenal when we learned that a sequel was planned for a december 2022 release i was 169 001558848  001604231 pretty excited but then we got the amber heard drama and the sudden purchase of warner bros 170 001604251  001610553 by discovery the new ceo said he wanted to reboot dc james gunn took over dc studios 171 001611022  001616765 and suddenly the aquaman sequel lost quite a bit of its luster the film was pushed back 172 001616865  001622929 a year due to covid setbacks and after the flash arrived in theaters essentially allowing 173 001622949  001630653 for a fresh start to dcs new cinematic universe aquaman 2 became my least anticipated dc film 174 001631154  001636797 maybe ever like i would have been perfectly fine if the film was shelved as a tax writeoff 175 001636837  001641587 like batgirl that all changed however when we got the first trailer only three months 176 001641627  001648409 ago and i was reminded of how awesome the visuals and the world that james wan created are i 177 001648429  001655210 got pretty hyped but did the film live up to the hype it unfortunately did not we didnt 178 001655230  001700732 need this film things should have ended with the flash and im kinda just ready to forget 179 001700752  001706790 this film even exists it was mediocre times for superhero movie going you know it reminded 180 001706830  001713114 me a lot of antman and the wasp quantumania in that the film was almost essentially computer 181 001713194  001718296 animated there were so many visual effects shots the humor didnt always stick like quantumania 182 001718917  001725400 and the story was a little lackluster i think 2023s marvel and dc films were bookended by 183 001725521  001731464 some of the more generic offerings that dc marvel have put out which is a huge shame if you 184 001731504  001737548 havent seen aquaman and the lost kingdom yet honestly i wouldnt bother like maybe not 185 001737608  001742172 even when this hits streaming not because the film is terrible because the third act is 186 001742252  001748078 actually pretty good but because its ultimately pointless and has very little redeeming value 187 001748278  001754064 outside of cg spectacle and even that is sometimes amongst the worst ive seen in a long time 188 001754524  001759049 if you still want to see the film definitely skip this review though because there will 189 001759089  001804555 be spoilers now the film picks up a few years after the events of the first film where aquaman 190 001804575  001810417 defeated his brother orm the king of atlantis to prevent him from amassing an army to destroy 191 001810457  001815918 the surface world as aquaman learned about the world of atlantis he also developed a 192 001815978  001821960 romantic relationship with orms former fiance princess mera and between the two films they 193 001822000  001827778 had a baby arthur jr and this is in keeping with the comics aquaman is pretty unique in 194 001827818  001833340 the comics in that he matured a lot faster than other heroes like he was the first superhero 195 001833360  001839441 to have a wedding the first to have a baby the first to suffer the loss of a child and 196 001839461  001845443 the first hero to get separated as a result its pretty heavy stuff and while the loss 197 001845483  001852105 of his family didnt drive him in the same way it did the punisher it still deeply affected 198 001852145  001857627 him and it took decades for him and mara to reunite yeah the comic book version of aquaman 199 001857787  001902251 is pretty deep its interesting that you say that he was one of the first characters to 200 001902271  001908257 kind of mature in his i guess life story and of all the dc superheroes its ironic because 201 001908417  001914722 jason momoas version of the aquaman character is essentially a manchild oh yeah ill definitely 202 001914742  001919507 be getting to that absolutely youre on the nose there it just served to remind me again 203 001919547  001924151 while watching this movie that this doesnt really feel like aquaman that i know its 204 001924491  001930376 very much jason momoas take on the character or just jason momoa like not even a take on 205 001930416  001936901 a character its just jason momoa now it had been rumored that aquaman 2 tested horribly 206 001937222  001943227 at test screenings in part because black manta killed arthur jr just like in the comics 207 001943647  001949732 like people walked out of test screenings which is unheard of but i could kind of see where 208 001949752  001954603 theyre coming from now one of the things i was most interested in going into the film 209 001954943  002000186 was to see if the filmmakers had the balls to put aquaman through such an emotionally heavy 210 002000266  002005929 and dark ordeal like suffering the loss of a child i thought i saw a way they could have 211 002005969  002011312 done it in a similar way to the movie gladiator that could have suited the narrative and the 212 002011352  002017736 film but now its become painfully obvious that jason momoa is no russell crowe like 213 002017776  002023927 tonally id say jason momoa ruined the film i understand its hard to take a character 214 002024327  002032272 like aquaman seriously but damn you have to at least try i think momoa probably assumed 215 002032352  002037895 that the reason the first film made so much money was because people enjoyed seeing jason 216 002037935  002043658 momoa play jason momoa who comes across as somewhat of a jokester but no we just want 217 002043678  002049762 to see aquaman as a badass and its not badass to have your baby piss in your mouth or make 218 002049922  002055965 unfunny jokes every five seconds yeah actually my favorite moments with jason momoa as the 219 002055985  002100308 character of aquaman are his more serious moments where hes acting like the character that i 220 002100328  002103970 know from the comics where hes very straight faced like in the first movie we got some 221 002103990  002109373 great character moments where hes seemingly transitioning from his man child self into 222 002109533  002114356 someone you would believe as a king of this entire kingdom but there was almost like a 223 002114436  002120758 reversion or a lack of follow through in his character arc from the first film where we 224 002120778  002125662 dont really see that noble king but like there are brief spurts here but like hes falling 225 002125723  002130027 asleep during meetings and stuff like that its all really played for gags and its not 226 002130067  002135572 that funny no the only thing he didnt do in this movie is like fart but he may as well 227 002135592  002142154 have now the film was intentionally supposed to be message heavy like showing the power 228 002142194  002148259 of brotherhood and cooperation and warning against the dangers of climate change and global warming 229 002148660  002154765 but because the movie doesnt take itself seriously its really hard to take its messages seriously 230 002155425  002201090 this film was originally supposed to go headtohead against avatar the way of water and when warner 231 002201110  002206006 brothers flinched and pushed the release date i was kind of pissed like ah come on no 232 002206046  002210907 one cares about avatar anymore the first aquaman improved to what the first avatar film did 233 002210947  002216449 visually anyway we could take him on and holy shit was i wrong aquaman 2 was embarrassing 234 002216509  002222070 enough without having to compare it to avatar 2 but whats really heartbreaking was that 235 002222331  002227912 there was this potential there for that to not be the case like i was expecting this film 236 002227972  002233882 to be like avatar meets taken meets lord of the rings but instead i got thor love and 237 002233902  002239324 thunder meets jumanji meets the saturday morning captain planet cartoon and the thing is the 238 002239344  002245646 film is so tonally inconsistent and it comes across as so heavily edited and reworked that 239 002245666  002250287 im guessing theres a better version of the movie out there but i honestly dont care 240 002250307  002255469 enough to hashtag release the wand cut that was a great description of this movie chris 241 002255509  002301462 hemsworth despite the terrible quality of thor 11th thunder he actually has comedic timing 242 002301682  002306104 and comedic instincts i dont think jason momoa has the same thing going for him i would somewhat 243 002306164  002311285 agree i think he has a little bit there but it needs to be under the right circumstances 244 002311705  002317607 which makes me nervous for a potential lobo project oh im not worried about lobo at 245 002317667  002321988 all i think he would nail it because he basically is lobo even when hes aquaman you know 246 002322008  002327269 you see we still see him doing donuts in the dirt with the motorcycle despite the fact 247 002327309  002332343 that ive never seen aquaman ride a motorcycle in the books im trying to think no yeah 248 002332363  002338384 i think thatd be really dumb if i saw him ever do that now im trashing the film but just 249 002338424  002344026 because i was disappointed in it doesnt mean it was all bad the film as the trailers promised 250 002344166  002349988 was gorgeous despite some really embarrassing cg in some spots for the most part it was 251 002350048  002357178 good and you know once arthur and orm meet dr shin the movie starts getting good because 252 002357218  002402701 thats when we finally understand the stakes of the film that the entity controlling black 253 002402741  002409346 manta kordax and the oricalcum are global threats and we circle back to arthur jr who 254 002409386  002413608 gets kidnapped by black manta which i thought was going to happen much earlier in the film 255 002413949  002419732 the problem is that by the time the movie gets good its like twothirds over and ultimately 256 002419772  002423883 its too little too late yeah i actually thought the plot was pretty interesting once it was 257 002423923  002427966 revealed that the oro kalkom and i swear to god if i ever hear that word again itll 258 002427986  002435471 be too soon but basically it was causing global warming to melt the polar ice caps to free 259 002435651  002441095 the lost kingdom and kordax right exactly the visuals while the cgi may not have always 260 002441115  002447859 been spot on the design of everything is exceptional like seeing kordax with his sauron like get 261 002447900  002452375 up use his black magic on his citadel and stuff like that just the fact that the seventh kingdom 262 002452415  002456998 was even based in antarctica and had like this entirely different world feel to the other 263 002457038  002501581 seven kingdoms which weve seen in the previous movie its all fantastic oh yeah its so 264 002501661  002506485 well imagined its kind of a shame that its not going to continue honestly thats like 265 002506505  002511148 whats heartbreaking in regards to aquaman with the dcu ending is that are we ever going to 266 002511208  002515811 see this world again i like the sunken city with all the pirates like how thats like 267 002515851  002520955 the underground in the oceanic world that was cool i did love how this film traversed the 268 002520975  002525557 globe in the way that the first film was a globe trotting adventure like we got to see the 269 002525637  002531320 desert we got to see the jungle we got to see you know the sunken city and antarctica 270 002531720  002536583 it was pretty cool the desert characters were really cool in that they learned how to survive 271 002536663  002541806 away from water by hydrating with blood like thats pretty hardcore thats super hardcore 272 002541846  002547649 and those creatures that they were riding were super freaking disgusting but like in the 273 002547689  002553631 best way possible ultimately i think these visuals and these designs are like 90 of why 274 002553872  002559454 i enjoyed this film oh you enjoyed it i mean it wasnt great it definitely wasnt terrible 275 002559494  002604957 though it was really hard for me to enjoy it i invited my fatherinlaw to see it with me 276 002605437  002611239 hes former military and i thought itd be like a cool like bro film to go see and i was super 277 002611259  002617094 embarrassed it was two saturday morning cartoons for him right absolutely yeah but lets 278 002617134  002622619 move on to the character breakdown starting with arthur curry slash aquaman played by jason 279 002622639  002627643 momoa as i mentioned earlier i feel like he ruined the movie in the same way that i feel 280 002627663  002633588 like chris hemsworth ruined thor love and thunder by trying to be a comedian thor is not supposed 281 002633608  002638612 to be a funny character neither is aquaman im really tired of actors playing roles that 282 002638632  002644457 they dont understand and yeah im going to make the case that jason momoa doesnt understand 283 002644597  002649847 aquaman because like we mentioned earlier he plays him like lobo so maybe ultimately 284 002649987  002655348 its best hes rumored to be playing that role in james gunns new dcu in the first film 285 002655688  002701110 aquamans arc was that he was worthy to be king because he was able to make tough decisions 286 002701370  002706811 but it turned out that upon being king he really wasnt able to make decisions to improve the 287 002706851  002712973 kingdom due to the bureaucracy of atlantis high council who antagonized him for not understanding 288 002713093  002719333 atlantean ways and culture when sickness spreads among his people however and black mantis 289 002719373  002725678 steals or a calcum from atlantis polluting the planet arthur realizes that he needs his 290 002725718  002732063 brothers help to stop him even though arthur proved to be less kingly and less mature than 291 002732243  002739148 orm he proved to be the bigger and better man by surmounting and helping orm overcome kordaxs 292 002739188  002744684 temptations of power arthurs ultimate destiny has always been to unite the underwater and 293 002744724  002750228 surface worlds and at the very end of the film he was finally able to start that process by 294 002750288  002756052 revealing atlantiss existence to the world though again how anyone is supposed to take 295 002756072  002802076 him seriously with that weird mic drop at the end is beyond me the whole iron man callback 296 002802256  002808360 was literally the worst fucking joke in any dc film ever i hated it when he was like 297 002808620  002814817 im the king of atlantis and im aquaman i was like what the fuck what is this my reaction 298 002814877  002818480 exactly i bet you world leaders were like oh no 299 002821562  002826426 right thats what im saying the coolest thing for aquaman i would say in this film was 300 002826487  002831531 his stealth suit i actually really liked the way they did that and i loved that toppo also 301 002831551  002838116 had essentially the same ability we did not get enough toppo and storm in this movie yeah 302 002838136  002842571 when you saw his fish speak power at the end of the first film he almost seems like unstoppable 303 002842691  002847054 in the water right so i was kind of hoping that he would use it more within the course 304 002847074  002852397 of this film but he only really used it a few times although i did like how he got all the 305 002852617  002858000 undersea mammals to use their echolocation to destroy black mantas ship oh yeah like the 306 002858080  002903943 sonar waves that was a really cool way to use his power for sure moving on to ocean master 307 002904084  002911755 aka orm he was played by patrick wilson watching this made me wish patrick wilson was originally 308 002911795  002916116 cast as aquaman because he not only looks the part of the character from the comics to a 309 002916216  002922017 t but also because he took his role seriously i mean he took part in quite a bit of the 310 002922077  002926259 jokes but even when hes running with his arms behind his back because you know he doesnt 311 002926279  002932660 know how to run on land or hes eating a cockroach like he still played it as if it was orm not 312 002932740  002938274 patrick wilson i think jason mowas presence actually brought down patrick wilsons performance 313 002938574  002943117 because whenever they were on screen together it became apparent that patrick wilson was 314 002943297  002949520 acting because jason momoa wasnt if that makes sense the two just had like zero bromance 315 002949540  002954003 chemistry which is a problem for the film because that was sort of supposed to be the core of 316 002954083  002959346 it their relationship and the entire second act was supposed to be a buddy comedy yeah 317 002959366  003003228 that was my big takeaway from the film as well they were honestly acting in different films 318 003004248  003008720 it felt that way yeah absolutely and some of that awkwardness i feel like was actually 319 003008760  003014004 reflected in the score because when they tried to be silly with that relationship the score 320 003014024  003019129 did like a cartoonish thing such as when aquaman knocked over that big statue to create a bridge 321 003019149  003023753 that scene played out way worse than i thought it would from the trailers and i dont know 322 003023774  003029339 why it was just so cringeworthy the whole fucking jungle island thing was so cringeinducing 323 003030059  003034823 i didnt get the joke regarding the cockroaches actually i did find that funny because you 324 003034843  003039828 could just see me doing that to my younger brothers but he told him that it was like the shrimp 325 003039848  003045633 of the land right right but the joke is that surface dwellers dont actually eat cockroaches 326 003046154  003050538 and so he like tricked him into doing it but he never told him that it was a joke like 327 003050778  003056604 he never followed through with the gag so it was just strange honestly if i got you to 328 003056644  003100378 eat a cockroach i wouldnt tell you that like youre not supposed to eat it id be telling 329 003100438  003106202 everyone else that i got you to eat a cockroach and so we didnt see that either we should 330 003106222  003111805 have seen alcon be like i seriously got oram to eat a cockroach we should have definitely 331 003112265  003117508 now orams arc in the film is really one in which he comes to terms that what he did in 332 003117528  003124852 the first film was wrong and that in the end arthur really is better for atlantis he realizes 333 003124932  003130071 over the course of the film as arthur continues to surprise him that there is an honor and 334 003130171  003136856 nobility in arthurs viewpoint and gracious actions and orm is moved essentially part 335 003136877  003141881 of me wanted to take issue with the fact that orm became a good guy and i kept waiting for 336 003141901  003145264 him to turn bad but that ended up not happening i thought that would have been a great turn 337 003145684  003151569 but given the fact that you have stated that ocean master actually has done good things 338 003151589  003155733 in the books like relinquish the throne when he realized that it rightfully belonged to 339 003155813  003201247 arthur curry that kind of helped sell the idea of oram being a good guy to me no for me 340 003201327  003207709 as well yeah in the comics in the new 52 version of oram hes not necessarily a bad 341 003207749  003213690 guy there is sort of like a rivalry but theres also like a respect between the characters 342 003213730  003218572 of aquaman and ocean master as well and so yeah i thought it worked in the movie also 343 003219012  003225293 moving on to david kane aka black manta he was played by yaya abdulmateen the second 344 003225974  003231716 black manta is a fantastic character and i thought yaya did a fantastic job in the role because 345 003231736  003237379 hes really able to capture the rage of the character like very few villains are as dedicated 346 003237499  003243122 as black manta in the comics to so completely destroying a hero and his family and that 347 003243142  003248064 also helps that he looks really badass i do have to say though its kind of unfortunate 348 003248104  003254440 that black manta loses some agency doing cordaxs bidding in this film rather than going full 349 003254480  003300563 force against aquaman i say kind of because i did actually like the dead king cordax in 350 003300603  003306306 this film and giving black manta a reason to kill arthur jr other than he just really hates 351 003306406  003312590 aquaman was a more stomachable decision at the very least i did think it was somewhat baller 352 003312630  003317433 of him at the end however to essentially kill himself maybe rather than accept aquamans 353 003317453  003322500 help because that felt very in character for black manta yeah that was his best character 354 003322540  003326784 moment unfortunately it was probably his last character moment yeah yeah i think it was 355 003326824  003332528 youre right we talked about the design of this film i thought his new gear was incredibly 356 003332568  003338413 well designed you know everything from the suit to the octopods it was fantastic i liked 357 003338453  003343117 seeing his beams in action that first seen when hes going up against mira and he like blasts 358 003343137  003347320 her and like everything around him those are some deadly lasers oh yeah like you could 359 003347340  003352246 see how they were burning people definitely deadly so aquaman ocean master and black 360 003352286  003356788 manta are really the three central characters of the film i do want to touch briefly on 361 003356868  003402429 dr shin and mara though starting with dr shin he was played by randall park whos 362 003402469  003407731 a great comedic actor he was the only truly funny character in the film and at times when 363 003407771  003412192 i dont think he was even trying to be i mean i only see him as jimmy woo from the marvel 364 003412212  003419778 movies nah this was just jimmy woo pretending to be a scientist or something i was happy 365 003419798  003424019 with the amount of screen time that they gave randall park here yeah absolutely absolutely 366 003424499  003428880 you know the first film dr shin was a minor character simply trying to prove atlantis 367 003428940  003433802 existence to the world and allied himself with black manta to do so like you said he got 368 003433902  003438443 much more screen time here and he got more than he bargained for with the emergence of cortex 369 003439123  003444305 but he has a crisis of conscience warning aquaman of black mantas new power and even saving 370 003444385  003449481 arthur jr from being killed so it was nice to see him sort of have that heroic streak 371 003449501  003455447 to him moving on to mera she was played by amber heard she had a slightly bigger role 372 003455467  003500192 in the film than i thought she would you know based on her own words in court that she was 373 003500232  003505057 essentially erased from the movie which wasnt the case though there may be quite a bit left 374 003505097  003510431 on the cuttinggroom floor i didnt think her performance was terrible her involvement in 375 003510451  003515955 the films story was a big question to many due to some reports that her relationship with 376 003516015  003521460 jason momoa and james wan wasnt great but im glad she got the screen time that she did 377 003521520  003527185 because mera should be a big part of arthurs world especially when it comes to arthur jr 378 003527585  003532069 its always cool to see her use her powers too she has a musical power set i mean in this 379 003532089  003538274 film it was used as deus ex machina on multiple occasions which was kind of unfortunate i 380 003538314  003543216 actually would have preferred to see toppo get just one surprise deo 6 machina if youre going 381 003543236  003547237 to do deo 6 machina because you know you could be invisible and just kind of like spring into 382 003547317  003551579 action and be like tada im here that would have been awesome i did like the call out 383 003551699  003555241 that nicole kidmans atlanta gave the character in reference to the previous film where we 384 003555281  003558842 saw toppo playing the drums yeah she was like running down his credentials and shes like 385 003559022  003604905 hes also really good at multiple instruments nicole kidman looked so weird in this movie 386 003605285  003610307 she had a cgi face did she not did she i dont think she did thats how it looked to 387 003610347  003614810 me on the screen that i saw it looked like maybe she had gotten too much botox and couldnt 388 003614850  003620213 really move her face enough and so they had to move it using special effects it very much 389 003620253  003626376 looked like how henry cavill did in the jostas league movie oh geez i did not see that 390 003626656  003631999 at all she had a very small role in the movie she only had like a few lines so maybe i just 391 003632099  003637858 wasnt paying too much attention to her but i mean i believe it lets move on to the 392 003637878  003638587 story highlights 393 003645770  003650491 several years after defeating and imprisoning his halfbrother orm arthur has become the 394 003650551  003656112 new king of atlantis and struggles with the bureaucracy preferring to spend time on land 395 003656132  003702234 with his family including his infant son junior who displays the ability to communicate with 396 003702294  003708056 fish aquamans nemesis black manta meanwhile searches the world for atlantean technology 397 003708096  003713457 to repair his power suit and get revenge on the hero for killing his father with the help 398 003713497  003719485 of dr steven shin black manta finds the lost atlantean kingdom of necrus in the antarctic 399 003719845  003724850 where theyre attacked by an underwater monster and black manta becomes possessed by a broken 400 003724910  003731015 black trident now im not sure why they gave junior fish speaking powers because it never 401 003731035  003736419 came up in the film again like they should have used it again at least once yeah that 402 003736519  003740182 actually would have been cool to have him save the day by calling in a fleet of whales or 403 003740222  003744918 something right yeah absolutely they could have totally done that and i actually thought 404 003744938  003749180 they were going to once they sort of set that up at the beginning of the movie i actually 405 003749240  003754043 really liked these opening antarctica scenes because they were a good showcase for james 406 003754083  003759767 bonds horror background yeah that tentacle monster was pretty frightening yeah and the 407 003759787  003804710 way it just like dragged people into the darkness it was pretty cool within the next five months 408 003804810  003811013 global warming has increased rapidly diluting the ocean saltwater and resulting in algae 409 003811033  003816077 blooms thats causing sickness to spread in the underwater kingdoms although arthur wants 410 003816117  003821242 to reveal atlantis to the surface world so that their scientists can work together to solve 411 003821262  003826906 the climate crisis the citys high council refuses to let him meanwhile black manta 412 003827127  003832731 now equipped with new atlantean technology is caught trying to steal a highly toxic fuel 413 003832791  003839897 source known as or a calcum from atlantis mera and many other atlanteans are badly injured 414 003840158  003845682 in black mantas escape do you know if orocalcum is from the comics it is actually but its 415 003845762  003851646 also from ancient myths about atlantis as well its supposed to be a medal though i believe 416 003852066  003857610 interesting upon realizing that black manta is using the orocalcum to pollute the earths 417 003857710  003903975 atmosphere and raise temperatures arthur decides his brother orm can help him find black manta 418 003904315  003909990 to his mother atlantis and miras father nerus objections with the help of a stealth suit 419 003910150  003915873 and a cephalopod named toppo arthur successfully breaks orm out of his desert prison which 420 003915913  003920975 was a pretty cool scene it was a convincing special effect that they used on patrick wilson 421 003921175  003926317 going from his skinny mode into his ripped mode see i didnt really like that i mean i thought 422 003926337  003931159 the special effect was fine but i dont understand how just upon touching water all of a sudden 423 003931199  003937018 he gets ripped well he was like super dehydrated right yeah i guess i dont know i just 424 003937038  003941120 thought it was a convincing special effect yeah definitely convincing as was toppo 425 003941360  003947043 i want a toppo in real life how was toppo surviving on land because hes fucking toppo dude 426 003947424  003952947 you can do whatever he wants all right ok how dare you question him we need to do a 427 003953007  003958130 christmas duel episode with toppo thats all im saying its a great idea yeah orb suggests 428 003958150  004003072 that they visit the sunken citadel a seedy underwater pirate colony ruled by kingfish 429 004003372  004009392 who may know black mantas whereabouts after a tussle with kingfishs shark soldiers arthur 430 004009412  004015075 learns that black manta may be on a volcanic island in the south pacific after swimming 431 004015155  004021038 to the island arthur sends toppo back to atlantis for help while he and orm navigate the mutated 432 004021118  004027322 jungle dodging carnivorous plants and giant insects to get to black mantas volcano base 433 004027902  004032365 i was super surprised when i saw that kingfish was voiced by martin short yeah i didnt 434 004032385  004037279 see that until the credits either i have no idea who kingfish is apparently hes a character 435 004037319  004041881 in the comics i initially thought that the character was a stand in for king shark which 436 004041921  004046282 i thought would have been actually really cool if they had done that but upon doing further 437 004046322  004052125 research i guess that wasnt the case i always liked the jules verneesque journey to the 438 004052165  004056687 center of the earth aspect that the aquaman films have we saw that in the first movie 439 004056707  004059928 where they actually did go to the center of the earth and then we saw it with this island 440 004059968  004105294 in this film where you have like these giant insect creatures and dangerous flora and stuff 441 004105314  004110577 like that it is a pretty neat aspect of these films yeah it kind of feels like james wan 442 004110597  004114680 can do whatever he wants in these movies he just comes up with these brilliant ways of 443 004114740  004120743 doing them like oric alcom mutating the environment thats a pretty cool idea to create some conflict 444 004121243  004126947 and it also creates greater stakes for the film and the danger that oric alcom presents there 445 004126967  004131189 was another joke during this part of the film that i really did not appreciate and that was 446 004131269  004139140 when aquaman referred to orm as loki and im like shut the hell up what are you doing hes 447 004139161  004143682 trying to be like tony stark giving everybody nicknames like how iron man did in the avengers 448 004143722  004150225 movie the first one but like do marvel movies exist in the dceu they must and thats stupid 449 004150685  004155287 well i mean apparently dc heroes exist in the marvel cinematic universe because there have 450 004155307  004200429 been a number of references to batman and superman oh thats right okay unless angry about 451 004200469  004206170 it now now uneasy with black mantas actions and using the volcano to spew orakelkem into 452 004206190  004212295 the atmosphere dr shin begs aquaman and orm to rescue him from manta just before black 453 004212335  004218140 manta attacks them during the battle orm takes hold of black mantas trident which gives 454 004218160  004224265 him visions of the past after atlantis comes to the brothers rescue and bombs the island 455 004224385  004230458 destroying the volcano orm reveals that the trident is possessed by kordax the ancient 456 004230558  004236681 atlantean king of necros who used orichalcum and black magic to pollute the earth and corrupt 457 004236741  004242704 and mutate his people into monsters cordax was defeated by his brother atlin the king 458 004242764  004249148 of atlantis who used blood magic to seal his brother and the kingdom of necros in ice forever 459 004249608  004255571 black manta they learn is being used by cordax to melt the ice caps and free the lost kingdom 460 004259838  004305042 into the villain cordax who they also made atlans brother i thought that was genius 461 004305643  004311388 i got to give a big shout out to listener corey wooten who years ago when we learned that 462 004311428  004316653 pelo aspect was going to be in the aquaman sequel we asked listeners as a question of the week 463 004316773  004321698 who they thought he was playing and corey wooten if you listen to our falcon and the winter 464 004321738  004326590 soldier review episode stated that he thought he was playing cordax and he was right yeah 465 004326630  004332694 cory bro you gotta hook me up with the next powerball numbers please realizing cordex 466 004332714  004338458 can only be freed from the blood magic ice prison with the blood of atlantean royalty aquaman 467 004338498  004343982 and his family rush to his fathers lighthouse only to find his father tom dying and junior 468 004344042  004349826 kidnapped while tom recovers arthur rallies his kingdom to rescue his son chasing black 469 004349846  004355409 manta to antarctica where cordexs forces have been unleashed and do battle with the atlanteans 470 004355998  004401362 meanwhile dr shin hides junior from black manta but both are caught i thought the movie 471 004401402  004406506 really wussed out by not killing aquamans dad i mean they didnt kill aqua baby and we 472 004406847  004410470 probably figured that was gonna happen but if they werent gonna kill aqua baby they 473 004410490  004414874 should have at least killed aqua dad they should have because theres precedent for that in 474 004414894  004420218 the comic as well both aquaman and black manta essentially killed each others fathers so 475 004420719  004426310 why the hell not kill tom they really wussed out i agree aquaman stops black manta before 476 004426350  004431512 juniors blood can be spilled on the altar in front of the frozen cordax the two battle 477 004431833  004436735 and arthur disarms black manta of the trident only for orm to get ahold of it and become 478 004436775  004443577 possessed by cordax successfully drawing arthurs blood on the altar as cordax becomes free 479 004443757  004448900 arthur and orm struggle for control of the black trident with their bond as brothers helping 480 004448940  004455090 them overcome cordaxs influence and arthur manages to kill cordax with atlans trident 481 004455370  004501674 it makes you wonder why if orm had the trident why didnt he just prick his finger over the 482 004501734  004506617 altar he has royal blood too he could have easily undone the curse being possessed by 483 004506677  004510639 kordax he didnt really need arthurs blood well i think arthur would have tried to stop 484 004510679  004516502 him so there was a tussle that was going to result regardless fair enough after black 485 004516582  004524154 mantis seemingly falls to his death rather than be saved by arthur join their allies on a 486 004524194  004529656 glacier where arthur gives orm his freedom rather than imprisoning him once again to 487 004529696  004535399 help deal with the damaged atmosphere arthur reveals the existence of atlantis to the un 488 004535539  004542141 and the public in the midcredits scene orm enjoys a cheeseburger and a cockroach which 489 004542201  004549664 is a hell of a way to end the dceu i mean it was funny i laughed but also like i was 490 004549744  004553994 kind of hoping there would be a little bit more after the credits yeah something more substantial 491 004554514  004559896 right right just to say like hey this is all done but get ready for something new 492 004600036  004605258 i dont know yeah i think the flash actually did a better job at that i believe initially 493 004605358  004610059 the flash was supposed to come out after aquaman according to the original release schedule 494 004610639  004615941 and its a shame that it didnt stay that way its a huge shame these release dates should 495 004615981  004620067 have been flipped i feel i actually think they would have gotten more money out of both 496 004620107  004623728 of them if that had been the case because it really would have felt like the flash was this 497 004623828  004629091 event film that you had to see because it was setting up something new yeah instead we 498 004629131  004634153 got a flash movie that didnt really serve as a transition and an aquaman movie that was 499 004634333  004639395 kind of pointless exactly its hard for me to say that things are pointless just because 500 004639475  004643777 i think films should stand on their own regardless of if theyre part of a cinematic universe 501 004643797  004648608 or not but this film really doesnt do that either in the sense that it has very little 502 004648648  004655652 redeemable value on its own i think despite a worthwhile final act the scenic cgheavy 503 004655692  004702315 films attempts at silly humor and serious themes make for a tonally inconsistent finale to the 504 004702355  004708019 dceu and i think thats the films biggest sin is that its tonally inconsistent i think 505 004708039  004714390 a directors main job is tone and james wan kind of failed on that here im giving the 506 004714450  004720394 film 3 out of 5 stars which is a 60 rating so its borderline between a fresh and rotten 507 004720434  004727498 tomato ive decided to not recommend this film so it is getting a rotten rating from me i 508 004727518  004732501 think its right between thor love and thunder and shazam fury of the gods which at least 509 004732721  004738185 was tonally consistent i agree with the 3 star rating i could also understand why you would 510 004738265  004743681 not recommend the film largely due to its place within the dceu where it came chronologically 511 004743741  004749385 in that release order weve seen a lot of superhero films recently make the mistake of going too 512 004749425  004754729 comedic with things whether its thor 11th under or like modok from the antman movie 513 004754929  004800353 i hope its a trend that does not continue into 2024 because i think it results in a lapse 514 004800473  004806017 of cinematic quality that exacerbates the current issue that were seeing of superhero fatigue 515 004806434  004813236 2023 is the year that fatigue really started to set in and i think films like aquaman 516 004813256  004817798 the lost kingdom are partially to blame this movie is not helping the genre and both marvel 517 004817858  004822520 and dc need to do a course correction for the future absolutely yeah i agree and luckily 518 004822560  004827882 we know that dc is next year were going to be getting joker folly i do but i think 519 004827902  004834025 thats the only live action dc film were getting so yeah we wont be seeing too much dc within 520 004834065  004841159 the next 365 days good finally geez fuck you i wish we were seeing less marvel i freaking 521 004841299  004846100 hate watching

Dec 26 2023,positive,picks up exactly where the first film left off if you didnt like the first film its unlikely this film will win you over i enjoyed the first film and i had a good time with this one the relationship between aquaman and orm was the stand out
Dec 26 2023,neutral, in 2013 when man of steel premiered there was the promise of an exciting future of storytelling to be told for the variety of characters within the dc lore  there was rousing if controversial casting decisions there was no shortage of talented filmmakers on board to forward these narratives and when everything aligned for whichever project wonder woman birds of prey the suicide squad for example the promise of what could be was palpable but much like the franchise as a whole james wans aquaman sequel aquaman and the lost kingdom never lifts off in the manner expected or deserved  jason momoas enthusiasm for the character is evident and the charming actor does his best to keep things afloat but this lost voyage never finds its way despite peppered possibilities set a few years after the events of the original film the lost kingdom places the duelling responsibilities of momoas character at its centre  on land his arthur curry is a fresh father having bore a child with mera amber heard and learning fatherhood comes with slapstick complications cue shots of the young tyke urinating in arthurs mouth  under the sea as aquaman the king of atlantis he struggles with having such a position of power as he doesnt appreciate answering to his councils regulations we all know aqauman is the epitome of impulsion his roles as both both a father and as a king merge in a manner he wasnt expecting though when david kane yahya abdulmateen ii a high seas mercenary whose father was killed by aquaman returns to the fray as black manta  powered by an atlantean armoured suit black manta is bent on avenging his fathers death and in uncovering the mythical black trident he threatens arthurs own bloodline and all he knew about atlantis in arthurs own child being the target and black mantas mo being to continually pollute the planet from the sea upwards the lost kingdom does indeed have the ingredients to be an emotionallycharged adventure  but whether its because the 5year break between this and the first film is too large a gap or it cant help but be tainted with the knowledge its closing out this embodiment of dceu  for those unaware director james gunn is overhauling the entirety of the franchise with a new variation of superman arriving in 2025  the concern for the stakes on hand never land in a manner that earns audience investment on its own accord the lost kingdom is an average at best blockbustercoded actioner that quite bizarrely doesnt conjure enough setpieces to act as a distraction for audiences who equate bigger to meaning better  as a sequel to a knowingly fun comic book adventure piece it drowns in comparison  but as stated momoa truly dives in headfirst to steer his wronged vessel right where he can and when the story  which momoa helped conceive with director wan and writers david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick and thomas paa sibbett  allows the actor and patrick wilson returning as arthurs imprisoned halfbrother orm to bounce off each other and drive the film with their buddycomedy mentality the lost kingdom momentarily finds its groove wilsons orm has a presence here thats similar to what heards mera provided in the first film reluctantly joining the rulebreaking aquaman on whichever quest the atlantean sees fit to risk life and limb for  orm having no real construct of realworld structure means theres some fun to be had in aquaman leading him astray and when it allows wilson to flex his action muscle the film is all the better for it  but sadly theres only so much freedom momoa and wilson are able to run with with the film seemingly unable to decide how much fun it wants to have and how seriously it should take itself on the mention of heard theres a rabbit hole of rumours and offset chatter regarding her position within the hierarchy of the production but as it stands within the lost kingdoms finality shes underused when compared to the original but utilised more than i suspect many will be expecting  there was talk that her role was reduced due to both a perceived lack of chemistry between herself and momoa and the fallout of her public divorce trial with johnny depp but this was continually offset with the word that meras presence in this story was always more limited  whatever the truth heard is sprinkled throughout and whilst she doesnt make much of an impact the presence of herself and nicole kidman alone  the latter returning in glorious heroine mode as arthur and orms mother atlanna  is welcome in a story thats dominated by male energy given the underwhelming response to the majority of the dceus entrants  this year alone shazam fury of the gods the flash and blue beetle have all majorly underperformed at the box office  its unlikely that the lost kingdom will correct any course for audiences seemingly done with the dc leg  the early announcement of the franchise overhaul certainly didnt help with these films all feeling especially useless but even aside from such the quality speaks for itself and aquamans second story lacks overall there are isolated moments of charm and wit throughout and the duo of momoa whose energy and moviestar wattage cant be dimmed and wilson truly speak to what could have been but if the first aquaman was not one you warmed to then the lost kingdom is surely an exploration you wont find worth diving for  and if you were a fan of the original and a billion dollar box office haul says there were many id suggest treading carefully and with tempered expectations film critic with a penchant for dwayne johnson jason momoa michelle pfeiffer and horror movies harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news
Dec 25 2023,neutral,with a forgettable plot and some charisma coming from its main cast aquaman and the lost kingdom fails to live up to its predecessor and the dceu it has the privilege of bringing to a close
Dec 25 2023,negative, by all accounts aquaman and the lost kingdom is not the comic book sequel director and cowriter james wan intended on making when filming commenced back in june of 2021 warner bros and its dc films division went through major upheavals during that time covid caused production delays and at least three reported reshoots forced the original december 2022 release date to move a full year the plot was apparently overhauled major characters saw their screen time reduced to almost nothing and nearly every connection to the larger dc extended universe dceu was completely excised add all of that up and the word trainwreck certainly fits all three definitions even as theres a blinkoryoullmissit set piece in which aquaman jason momoa saves some atlantean public transportation from being destroyed by his archenemy david kane aka black manta yahya abdulmateen ii but its the two slang definitions that are the most appropriate for wan this has to be as heartbreaking a directorial endeavor as anything hes ever experienced as for the film itself well calling it a visually chaotic mess would be considerably underselling the reality of the situation the strange thing i got the feeling that wan his production team and likely momoa himself all kind of said screw it at some point and decided to just let their collective freak flags fly this last hurrah for the dceu before its toptobottom 2025 reboot may be a disaster but its anything but a boring one at barely two hours wan keeps the pace popping and exposition to a minimum characters spout what is happening and why in blasts of unhinged word vomit and there are moments when wan utilizes silent film techniques to visually tell his story so he can excise much of the dialogue or have it spoken entirely offscreen or via narration this makes this second solo aquaman adventure far more watchable than it has any right to be much like he did with fast x momoa puts the entire sequel on his broad shoulders and carries it with comically joyous aplomb wan regular patrick wilson of the conjuring and insidious universes  returning as aquamans duplicitous brother orm  adds able support and abdulmateen makes the most of his limited screen time and actually attempts to give a complex threedimensional performance as for the director he digs into his horror bag of tricks whenever allowed especially early on when a sequence featuring a menacing sea beast in an unexplored ice cave is far more frighteningly intense than it has any right to be the plot it doesnt matter but it has something to do with a lost undersea kingdom that the black manta stumbles into which allows him to take possession of the fabled black trident which could help accelerate climate change unleash a mutated demonic menace and unintentionally lead to the end of the world for creatures both above and below the sea aquaman and orm join forces to stop him and every now and then characters from the previous film including amber heards queen mera nicole kidmans atlanna and dolph lundrgrens king nereus randomly show up to lend a helping hand the production values are high and there are passages of eyepopping visual effects wizardry that are undeniably impressive most notably a stretch in which aquaman breaks orm out of his underground desert prison past a cadre of monstrous skeletal guards straight out of a ray harryhausen stopmotion fantasyadventure from the 1960s composer rupert gregsonwilliams hacksaw ridge returns and delivers a suitably adrenalinefilled mostly electronic score and production designer bill brzeski iron man 3 conjures up a handful of gorgeously gonzo sets not the least of which is black mantas secret volcanic lair which is like a combination of a james bond spectre hideout and something straight out of nazi bunker from raiders of the lost ark none of this makes aquaman and the lost kingdom any less of a trainwreck however there are several instances where much of this sequel comes off like a hot shots or top secretstyle parody of superhero flicks and others where its nothing more than a frenetically edited monstrosity that barely holds together this final dive into the undersea world of the dceu implodes under the pressure likely generated by all the behindthescenes tinkering as last hurrahs go this ones lost at sea we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content with solid execution our reviews aim for critical analysis of films many aesthetics while talent interviews offer insight into the filmmaking process  1999  2024 moviefreakcom  all rights reserved  no content may be copied without permission  all film titles and photo materials are the property of their respective owners  design and implementation by sokumediacom 
Dec 24 2023,negative, yet more evidence that the superhero movie industry is foundering comes from this shoddy scrapedfromthebottomofanoceantrench sequel jason momoa looking a bit like a beefedup cartoon carrot in his wildly unflattering orange supersuit returns as arthur the humanborn heir to the kingdom of atlantis he divides his time between family life in a converted lighthouse with his wife mera amber heard their infant son arthur jr and his royal duties  largely crushingly dull council meetings with hostile merpeople but an enemy from his past is back and threatens not just arthur asnd his people but the entire world with the use of a longabandoned atlantean fuel that rapidly accelerates global heating the lazily generic plot devices yet again an ancient evil artefact offers unlimited powers to its holder performances so thuddingly clunky that much of the dialogue sinks like a boulder in the sea the lack of any humour whatsoever these are all minor irritations compared with the pictures glib trivialisation of the climate crisis time to put a barnacle in it fish boy
Dec 24 2023,positive,aquaman and the lost kingdom is straight up cartoonish the team up with jason momoa aquaman and patrick wilson king orm is what really works
Dec 24 2023,negative, writerdirectorproducer james wan does it all making the invention of new film franchises appear as easy as breathing like this past summers movie the flash however the franchise informally dubbed the dc murderverse has been drawing to a close with reboots on the horizon under new leadership aquaman and the last kingdom is the final final remnant of zack snyders darker vision for dc superheroes now entirely disconnected from the whole without explanation into a standalone world where supermen batmen and wonder women cant arrive to save the day duplicating the cast from the 2018 aquaman film with mcu alumni randall park getting a bigger part the marketing synopsis is playing it as safe as possible with phrasing like this time instead of in a world the first jason momoa film raked in 11 billion to become the highest dc film to date so counting the motorcycleriding cheeseburgereating guinnessswigging superhero out would be a mistake with nothing guarantied for his character going forward and little competition coming soon to a theater near you will the sequel sink or swim at the holiday box office all the fun from the first film feels forced this go around making it hard to ignore the infinite cycle of pretty new location talks go sour fight repeat kudos to the production crew for creating hammerhead subs squidithopters and mounted rockburrowing assassin bugs as original visuals from middlemanagement studio notes can this be like that star wars cantina thing but made out of shipwrecks like in the little mermaid or what if we stole every cool james bond villain lair idea and crammed it into the second act and finally lets do a big lord of the ringstype battle for a finale if lotr was a trilogy about walking from place to place aquaman 2 is a sequel about swimming from place to place covering presumably thousands of miles of ocean at the speed of plot from one dangerprone digital set piece to another the only weight given to this sequel is willem defoes character dying offscreen due to scheduling issues a story that sounds far better than this borrowed and outright stolen mishmash of a film the stakes like the characters themselves are generic at best nicole kidmans atlanna and wilsons orm are more serious than ever momoas arthur is still never serious enough manta is even angrier all the time amber heards mera looks as if all of her shots were edited into scenes filmed separately for being a new wife and mother shes unrealistically absent for most of the familyathome stuff winkwink nudgenudge randall parks character appears to have an actual revelation about what was going on at the dcmv young fool only now at the end do you understand fans of momoa being himself read not aquaman per se will probably enjoy hearing random bursts of joy from the actor following choreographed stunt work so expect a supercut of all the ones they had to remove from the film just waiting for the home disc release extras  big showy expensive films released in the late december holiday frame have time to do well especially in 2023 with more than the usual classic films and niche awards contenders as alternatives the lost kingdom is competing solely with the alreadypopular godzilla minus one still expanding onto more screens with nothing left in the old dc pipeline now is as good a time as any to also suggest james gunn offer jason momoa the superhero role he was born to play  interstellar bounty hunter lobo 
Dec 24 2023,positive, aquaman and the lost kingdom could hit 45 million for this fourday holiday weekend or might have less staying power through christmas day on monday and finish closer to 40 million every little bit helps and will give us better indications of precisely how well or how weakly the film will play going forward but regardless of the box office outcome aquaman and the lost kingdom is a good final chapter in the dceu saga not great but certainly enough eye candy to justify a bigscreen viewing even a highend outcome suggests hard times ahead unless the sequel can leg out even better than its predecessor and top 250 million domestic which would guarantee a final cume north of 500 million assuming matching international support at minimum more likely in that scenario would be a 750 million global total avoiding a disaster and at least ending the dceu on a blockbuster note rather than a nonevent but even this would be a massive comedown from the 2017s aquaman which banked 115 billion and point to the holiday scenario i expected for wbd at years end thats just enough to let wbd generate positive headlines for a solid yearend finish and combined with barbie and a couple of wellperforming moderate successes it provides cover for the bigger truth about how hard 2023 hit the studios particularly wbd and disney premium theaters should overperform for aquaman and the lost kingdom so if those figures come in where they could and should based on potential then it will be a good sign for lost kingdoms longterm prospects of hitting the high end of potential box office outcomes not that it matters for the dceus future since there isnt one but it helps with the messaging as noted the problem is nothing really suggests we should expect a highend outcome for aquaman and the lost kingdom the weak domestic box office opening is bad enough but worse is the audience reaction  viewers gave it a b grade via cinemascore and while b means good it also means word of mouth is too weak to expect strong holds or much repeat business b is where a film can tip either way with audiences and a is where better holds and longer legs are expected my guess is aquaman and the lost kingdom still enjoys a yearend holiday boost through the first week of january enough to give it perhaps a 3x or even 4x final domestic multiplier repping about onethird of the final global tally of 550620 million higher end it could hit 700 million if it surprises overseas but sadly lower end at 400450 million is probably more likely of the potential outlier results within the 16film theatrically released dceu including zack snyders justice league as a separate film from the theatrical version lost kingdom needs only about 202 million to be in the shared superhero universes top10 box office grossers to make the top half ie top eight highest grossers it needs only about 365 million but aquaman and the lost kingdom will need north of 655 million to break into the real topgrossing tier of dceu films from the 2013 through 2017 fiveyear era when the films were generating far better box office than the subsequent fiveyears when not a single dceu so far managed to reach even 400 million the threshold for topfive ranking in the dceu will be close to 750 million to beat suicide squads 2016 cume of 745 million a figure i dont think aquaman and the lost kingdom has much chance of attaining aquaman in 2017 was the last film from the original plans for the dceu and everything that came after was produced during a period of shifting studio leadership with everchanging and rarely fully formed priorities continued studio executive interference in creative decisions and in dcs leadership in general such as undermining walter hamada by approving things he rejected in dceu projects under his supervision and a directly resulting brutal downturn in audience opinion and box office for the dceu probably contributing to broader audience distaste for superhero movies along with sony spiderman spinoffs venom venom let there be carnage and morbius during the same post2017 period that may sound mean but i dont intend it to be i personally still liked most of even the weakerperforming dceu movies even while recognizing they didnt offer what audiences want and expect to earn their ticket dollars when they have to choose just a small handful of films from hundreds every year but at this point its easy enough to see how a poisonous combo of reactionary studio choices and artistic uncertainty led to those films mostly underwhelming in storytelling and thus flopping theatrically whether its too late or not for the aquaman sequel to recover and add at least a final moment of collective enjoyment of the dceu as it rides off into the sunset we will find out soon enough when we have the full worldwide box office data for the weekend it all hinges on whether aquaman and the lost kingdom suffers the same lack of oomph to motivate audiences and earn those dollars as the previous eight dceu releases to which audiences have thus far replied with a b grade probably a kiss of death if overseas viewers concur for myself i think b is probably the correct grade but i also think a b grade isnt  or rather shouldnt be  as bad as it apparently is for most audiences its contextual sure but a blevel actionpacked visual spectacle on par with the best summer popcorn releases in liveaction familyfriendly superhero cartoon storytelling delivered at christmas on the biggest screen possible is the sort of eye candy escapism i can get behind plus if you need some messaging it reminds you that melting the planet with unrestrained global warming is bad and probably going to get us all killed if we dont stop being lazy and seeking cheap feelgood solutions that require little or no actual change in behavior or consumption and we do get a bit of fun parenting moments early on plus the emotional stakes of threatening the heros family plus a villain driven by revenge over the loss of his own family plus a brother teamup that reverses everything about the first films relationship and characterizations in exchange for some fun sibling squabbling but all of that gets surfacelevel attention enough to satisfy that it exists within the film so the story can get to what its meant for and that is running around the world from one action setpiece to another full of strange creatures and inevitable brightly colored cgi fights your mileage may vary but its worth noting that i loved the first aquaman which i will never tire of pointing out is basically exactly the film i described wanting several years earlier right down to suggesting momoas casting and so i was happy to revisit that world and those characters even in a lighter and less aweinspiring story and with far less emotionally effective arcs in a more crowded marketplace of other good or great films then aquaman and the lost kingdom might be a tougher sell even to me but director james wan is one of the best at what he does and he gets every ounce of entertainment value and excitement out of it theres a ton of cgi and action and it always looks pretty terrific its always brightly colored and easy to see and you dont lose track of where things are happening from the fastedits and busy elements lost kingdom plays all of the greatest hits from the first film if the selections were made based on whats loudest and easiest for the audience to sing along at barely over two hours runtime its around 20 minutes shorter than the first aquaman it does this by speeding up the pacing simplifying the plot and replacing character moments and emotional arcs with additional faster action scenes its focused on delivering primarily the action spectacle of the first film as well as a heavier dose of humor and yahoo moments from momoa in those ways then if youre going to pay to see movies at premium theaters then it should probably be a film like aquaman and the lost kingdom which delivers what those formats are made to do best  i saw it in dolby cinema my personal favored choice for viewing so i got to see lost kingdom with amazing 3e sound eyepopping visuals gorgeous colors the cast are all returning in fine form albeit with less to do involving less interesting things momoa leans more into the surferdude mixed with biker dude vibe laughs considerably more often and reminds us why this superhero business is all so easy for him patrick wilson is buffer this time around but his personality is toned down to slightly crabby no pun intended and just a bit misunderstood in his i should be ruler and destroy all who challenge me perspective its what happened with loki and follows a frustrating trend in superhero movies lately to try to redeem every villain as quickly as possible  lokis changes took place across many films to slowly changing degrees in the face of increasing personal loss amid increased exposure to and understand of other worlds and peoples perspectives and in the face of a great deal of introspection and challenges loki earned his redemption arc in other words and films seeking to mimic it need to put in the work first otherwise it feels like a cheap alsoran luckily wilson is good enough and the teamup fun enough that we usually dont mind overlooking these problems long enough to enjoy the experience but the film is a b grade precisely because it misses so many great opportunities in its efforts to strip away characterization and deeper arcs in favor of faster pacing and action sequences this is a perpetually recurring but entirely false impression in hollywood thinking audiences want is more of the spectacle and vfx and that it should come at the expense of character and earned emotional stakes but the action is rarely enough to sustain without enough audience investment in the characters and their journey more of what the first aquaman film got so right in the character storytelling is whats missing in the sequel and what wouldve elevated it into agrade range the best part of the entire film is yahya abdulmateen iis black manta he is a bond villain with higher aspirations and every time hes on screen i was reminded of why i love the aquaman world so much the secondary villain kordax is honestly no match for abdulmateens sneering anger and selfcertainty that hell kick every butt that gets in his way whats missing is a better examination of black manta being pulled in different directions by kordax with competing voices in his head vying for control and power that wouldve been a perfect additional element and even seems to be set up without the payoff but abdulmateens manta deserved more to his story even as he wrings every drip of sinister presence and villainy from his time on screen amber heard and nicole kidman get some supporting screen time and show up in a few key moments to participate in the action spectacle and save the day but heard is definitely relegated to a smaller role this time around wilsons turn as aquamans sidekick inherently displaced heard but i hope meras much more limited role wasnt a studio reaction to the antiheard toxicity among segments of obsessively hostile hateful and mostly sexist fans unfortunately im not in the mood to give benefit of the doubt to studio leadership at this point as this film wasnt under gunns and safrans supervision and was more affected by wbd oversight randall park makes the most of his screen time as doctor shin and gets more of an arc with supporting subtext to walk him through his evolving perspective than anyone else in the film its an odd choice to place the burden of earned redemption on parks shin while mostly relying on a few overt moments and brief dialogue exchanges to redeem wilsons orm aka ocean master but thats indicative of why lost kingdom somehow is essentially a redo of the first film with just enough to feel fun but too little to care much about it all after it ends if you enjoyed the first aquaman you will probably like aquaman and the lost kingdom even though it will feel like a slimmed down continuation of that film to settle a couple of lingering arcs and questions tying things up and giving you one last trip around atlantis to admire the cool visuals it wont bring as much emotional satisfaction and everything shines just a bit less but its the last chapter of the dceu so it tries to at least remind us one last time what it was like when we still cared and could still have a good time in this world of superheroes
Dec 23 2023,negative, warner brothers and dc finish the job of wasting the great casting coup of their justice league era comic book film adaptations in a dead fish of an aquaman sequel aquaman and the lost city its a lifeless patchwork of comic book movie world building and tropes pieced together by four credited story authors shot and reshot surrounded by rumors that amber heard has been edited out of it she isnt but haters gonhate and almost zero buzz earnest efforts to make it jokier probably at the behest of humorous heman star jason momoa come to naught trying to turn aquamans somewhat evil brother patrick wilson into a sort of loki figurefoil and object of aquamans fun fail  and the story is just a payback tale from the first aquaman outing the one where manta yahya abdulmateen ii  was a villain foiled and now hes back to find ancient undersea tech that will end life on earth and while hes at it take from him what he took from you randall park plays the scientist no one believes in as he looks high and low for proof of atlantisat some point theres a scene in which he must have been given a bloody nose blood turns up in his beard in insert shots later in this edit  but the people you kind of feel sorry for are heard given enough scenes to justify a paycheck and nicole kidman its been years and years since our favorite redheaded aussie oscar winner has been in a movie this bad there is some environmental messaging in here which will annoy the same folks whore made whenever amber heard gets work aquaman notes the state of the seas and the environment at large and mutters im tired of nothing ever getting done but momoa flexes hops on a bike his first best destiny is anything with motorcycles in it and does his damnedest to carry or will this picture into something worth watching  big laughs macho joking around  im gonna go start a fight  all of it looks like hes trying too hard and almost none of it works  at this point with marvel oversaturating the content marketplace and out of ideas and dc almost never getting it right make it stop make it go away or maybe take a break and a breather on this overexposed genre seem like the best options the technology to make these movies eye candy of the first order is here but the people making them are at a loss for a decent story to put these superheroes in much less a movie that matters

Dec 23 2023,negative, aquaman and the lost kingdom is a tired pastiche of the superheroscifi genre most notable for being a perfect distillation of the phenomenon known as superhero fatigue smothered by its beenthere seenthat vibe it presents little to recommend it beyond randall park as both the embodiment of egregious exposition and the voice of reason he is the only one who can balance the essential absurdity of the goingson with a nimble ahem undercurrent of emotional angst the rest despite the breezy brawny brocharm of jason momoa returning in the title role and patrick wilson as his halfbrother and nemesis orm discovering the down side of being a ruleabiding prig is a tedious disjointed exercise in overkill aquaman aka arthur is tiring of his role as the new king of atlantis after discovering that the boredom of committee meetings and the bureaucracy that boasts wasting time as its principle accomplishment is less rewarding than the heroic battles that seized the throne from orm it may have suited orm before but arthur prefers the simple life in his fathers seaside cabin with wife mera amber heard and baby son arthur jr alas orm may be safely tucked away imprisoned by the oxymoronic desertdwelling fishermen but his other nemesis black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is still plotting revenge against arthur for killing his father in the last film his solution send dr shin park to search for the a lost city of atlantis and use that antique but still advanced technology to end aquaman and all that he loves that includes the earth which allows for a timely subplot about industrial pollution and climate change one can only speculate on what this flick was intended to be before ms heard garnered such negative press in her court fight with exhusband johnny depp the producers felt that they had no choice but to reimagine the nearly completed film excising her as much as possible and engaging in what turns out to be extensive reshoots of distinctly kludgy rewrites hence theres the voiceover montage of the idyllic life in the cabin and of the dull life in the splendors of atlantis to establish arthurs new life mera is there silently holding the baby and sitting by arthurs side on the thrones under the sea and then shes not anywhere once the montage is over arthur commiserates with his father temuera morrison about the struggles of being a single parent without any explanation of why he has become one the she pops up again later when black manta attacks atlantis then still later she and arthurs mother atlanna nicole kidman send him off with orm to defeat blank manta once and for all it is understandable that sunk costs may have precluded starting this flick over from scratch and from scrapping it altogether but its hard to ahem fathom why releasing such hash will keep the franchise going make no mistake films have succeeded when the plot goes off the rails the big sleep for example but that had the chemistry of bogart and bacall going for it and an absorbing story about the decadence that lurks beneath the veneer of high society plus an ironic wisecracking gumshoe with a sense of chivalry worthy of the round table here we have martin short voicing a knockoff of jabba the hut from the star wars universe and arthur and orm as a bickering odd couple after the former saves the latter from those cimentioned oxymorons in order to of course save the planet both actors are good playing to their strengths but the dialogue and situations are obvious and uninspired then the ultimate villains lair in an extinct volcano feels like another knockoff this time from the james bond franchise it all feels like a knockoff sets that were probably very expensive look like so much foam and shiny acrylic paint while fight scenes that have all the hallmarks of careful choreography are directed with the urgency of chilled lox without the schmear wan does to be fair do much better in the small moments such as parks greek chorus of commentary or when orm responds to a plea for help from a fellowatlantean with an enigmatic coldness suddenly its interesting for a few moments for the rest  not even the manly form of jason momoa can sell a giant seahorse as a dashing aquasteed the ennui is crushing aquaman and the lost city is simultaneously too jokey and too preachy kidman is so solemn shes practically a marble statue for its own good when the next film inevitably ahem splashes across screens in a few years lets hope theyve settled on one idiom or the other
Dec 23 2023,neutral, welcome to the content report a newsletter by vince mancini ive been writing about movies culture and food since the aughts now im delivering it straight to you with none of the autoplay videos takeover ads or chumboxes of the adruined internet support my work and help me bring back the cool internet by subscribing sharing commenting and keeping it real this is the first line of aquaman the lost kingdom delivered by star jason momoa via voiceover as he rides a giant iridescent seahorse on his way to pound a few pirates attempting to take over a container ship in the middle of a rainy sea its sort of emblamatic of director james wans entire approach to the material this is really stupid why not have some fun with it the content report by vince mancini is a readersupported publication to receive new posts and support my work consider becoming a free or paid subscriber wans first aquaman released in 2018 stood out as a goofy absurdist beacon in what was then an otherwise hopelessly overearnest and continuitydriven genre back when the marvel cinematic universe was still the undisputed cultural juggernaut every other studio was forced to mimic the last few years have seen marvels money machine sputter and die a victim of the narrative bloat that naturally goes along with trying to reconcile 33 different films and however many tv serieses into a single fictional universe and now at last it seems people have really truly finally gotten sick of this shit if anything represents a triumph of the human spirit its that  fastforward to 2023 and it still feels like james wan is the only one having fun yet not even the guy who gave us furious 7 the best fast movie do not dispute me and malignant can enjoy himself quite enough to transcend the entire format aquaman the lost kingdom is good for the occasional laugh but it cant reverse the decay in an obviously dying genre if aquaman 2 were just a movie about jason momoa traversing the seas on fantastical sea creatures and bashing up pirates with an occasional interlude to drink guiness with his dad itd probably be pretty good momoa isnt the worlds greatest actor and still has a tendency to rush through his lines in extended mumbles on occasion but hes still the best in the world at being jason momoa and a lot of times a movie needs jason momoa more than it needs a great actor  but you know gotta have a whole universe in these things and that requires a big bad with an evil plan and whole backstory and blah blah blah and the next thing you know youre knee deep in alternate universes  okay so aquaman 2 doesnt exactly have a multiverse but after part one introduced us to the previouslyhidden undersea world of atlantis of which aquaman is now king we now find that there is an entire other evil version of atlantis also hidden underwater but like under icecaps and volcanos and shit bizarro atlantis sure why not randall park playing a wisecracking scientist goes looking for atlantis under the north sea ice cap one day only to find a big scary octopus thingy that kills his friend instead then this guy the black manta yahya abdulmateen shows up along with his whole militia to help randall park further explore this undersea world the scary octopus one anyway which i guess is different from the undersea world where aquaman is you know what not important this black manta guy who is very serious wants to kill aquaman because aquaman killed black mantas father in the last movie dont really remember that part mostly i remember a giant octopus who played drums and i guess exploring under this ice cap helps black manta further that goal somehow unclear not a lot of coherent motivations in this movie to be honest  anyway black manta discovers a magical trident that immediately possesses him like the ring in lord of the rings giving him a psychological connection to an ancient evil king who promises to give manta aquamankilling powers soon manta has a whole fleet of ancient evil boats powered by orichalcum an energy source infinitely more powerful and damaging to the environment than even fossil fuels manta with the help of poor randall park has to steal the orichalcum from the atlanteans who stopped using it long ago but keep it in ancient vaults for some reason soon manta is trying to terra form the entire planet with a massive orichalcum furnace that he keeps burning 247 which again furthers his goal of killing aquaman somehow  aquaman has to stop this guy and in order to do that best he concludes that he should go free his brother orm orm played by patrick wilson who is being held in a desert prison guarded by vampire creatures where he was put after aquaman vanquished him in the previous movie this leads to a whole scene of aquaman infiltrating the vampire prison in the desert with his superintelligent octopus sidekick kicking the asses of various giant scorpion horses and vampire ghouls along the way its hard not to respect how few blackclad commandos there are in aquaman 2 james wan simply refuses to do something that easy he is to cgi bad guy monsters what homer was with the star wipe  so it seems that black manta controls an orecchiette mine im never going to remember orichalcum im sorry on an island in the south pacific only all the orecchiette hes burning in his giant furnace is mutating all the flora and fauna so when aquaman and orm orm get there to stop black mantas evil plans they first have to fight off all manner of giant bugs rats and maneating flowers godzillastyle  aquaman 2 isnt much for coherence but boy does it have a lot of stuff it might be one of the most stufffilled movies ive ever seen breezing effortlessly from desert vampires and giant scorpions to evil submarines and giant fauna ultimately culminating in an ungodly orgy of atlantean sea beasts doing barely comprehensible battle with an entire army of zombie demon people  these last being the civilization of necris led by the ancient evil king who gave black manta the vision and once the rival of the king of atlantis before his greed and orecchietteburning turned his entire civilization into ghouls who were encased in the ice caps until mantis thawed them out again hopefully aquaman and orm orm can vanquish them back to a different realm whence they can stay until required by a plot device in a future movie its exhausting just recounting it all and you cant help but be a little impressed with the sheer volume of inventiveness even if it mostly kind of looks like halfassed cgi wingdings crammed together most of the time even when its mostly bad theres a vibe to it missing from a lot of other movies like this its ludicrous but never lazy wan is a maximalist for maximalisms sake and the glee he seems to take in all this is occasionally contagious in spite of the material its just a shame that he has to try to cram in all these kingdoms  its the old portal problem once youve already had a superhero save the world pretty soon he has to save the universe then the spacetime continuum then the fabric of reality and matter itself if you never kill off any characters they have to keep existing somewhere and so you inevitably end up with a kind of mormon afterlife superhero universe where everyone just sort of gets their own planet and wheres the drama in that do we need this much continuity in movies it is hostile to basic reason no one cares just start the story over again wherever you feel like it wan does what he has to do but eventually the story all comes down to a pro wrestlingesque fist fight albeit with magical tridents and lots of cgi windowdressing i think jason momoa mightve yelled nobody messes with my woman at one point or something to that effect i dont really remember the memory began to degrade basically the second it was formed probably for the best i think my favorite part of the trailer was black manta saying he was going to burn aquamans

Dec 23 2023,positive, someday now that its all over someones going to write a big fat tellall about just what exactly happened to the dceu a project with certainly as much potential as the marvel stuff but one so grossly mismanaged that the studio and filmmakers destroyed multiple massive tentpole films with secondguessing and endless rewrites and reshoots and eventually just tossed the whole thing right in the trash aquaman and the lost kingdom is the final entry in this iteration thankfully despite years of tinkering its not as much of a coffin nail as it could be in fact its actually sort of fun we rejoin arthur curry the king of atlantis jason momoa now a father of a baby son conceived with queen mera amber heard his kingdom is mired in bureaucracy but other than that things seem to be going smoothly that is until black manta yahya abdulmateen ii the big bad from the first movie turns up somehow hes got hold of ancient atlantean tech and a massive crew of mercenaries and hes still hellbent on avenging the death of his father at aquamans hands he gets possessed by the spirit of a big black trident called the black trident and then sets about using some weird green stuff called oricalchum to accelerate global warming for reasons its honestly too silly to reveal here the finest quality that the original film possessed  in fact maybe the engine that made it work at all  was its unabashed dorkiness everyone thankfully got together and collectively realized that there was absolutely no way to make aquaman seem cool and that taking any of it seriously was a terrible idea that lesson has blessedly been followed for this installment the lost kingdom spends most of its time as a buddy road movie with arthur bonding with his former enemy halfbrother orm an alwaysgame patrick wilson and cracking silly jokes while riding glowing seahorses or goofing off with his octopus sidekick topo yes you read that right and no theres not enough topo in this movie its all deeply silly stuff the film hurtling through its nonsensical plot and caring not one iota for realism or logic even its climatechange warnings seem like a bit of a goof its giving the kind of energy you might have found in one of stephen sommers 90sera mummy flicks director james wan simply has a knack for a level of ludicrousness which he augments with a pleasingly colorful visual design and when the action starts happening its at least relatively fluid on the other hand this is obviously a salvage job of epic proportions shifting release dates and tales of endless reshoots and script drafts have dogged this one for years its first reported screenings were in 2021 clearly its been heavily tinkered with whole entire scenes take place in mostly digital wide shots packed with cg doubles for the actors endless gobs of expository dialogue are delivered by the back of someones head or during shots establishing locations most of amber heards shots in the climactic action sequences look uncannily like a digital double lets not speculate on why they might have cut her from most of the movie but even for a film created largely from people standing in front of a green screen the lost kingdom feels haphazardly cobbled together theres an undeniable mishmash of tones at play as well as plenty of hiccups in momentum still given that production nightmare things could have been a lot worse nobody was exactly clamoring for a second aquaman movie anyway but the first one made a billion bucks or two so here we are under the circumstances its fair to consider that it might even be the best version of itself that was ever possible weirdly this movie ends with arthur doing an i am aquaman mic drop referencing the marvel movie that jumpstarted all this superhero stuff in the first place to mark the end of the dc universe seems oddly fitting perhaps weve at last reached a real tipping point at the very least this version of the franchise is over and we dont have to care or think about it anymore ever again director james wan  cast jason momoa patrick wilson amber heard yahya abdulmateen ii nicole kidman  distributor warner bros pictures  in theaters december 22  runtime 2 hr 4 min
Dec 23 2023,positive,im not going to pretend this movie is anything new or great but it does occasionally manage to be fun and subversive enough to act as a solid sequel and a fitting sendoff to an extended superhero universe that never really found its footing 
Dec 23 2023,negative, now in theaters james wans aquaman and the last kingdom is the stupidest superhero film ive ever seen that list includes superman iv the quest for peace all the fantastic fours and yes howard the duck each of these films despite their evident failures had at least sparks of redeeming value be it unintentional camp unrealized ambition a goforbroke attitude a good performance or whatever the latest aquaman has no redeeming value judging by the audiences reactions on the way out of the theater it will have a hell of a time recouping its bloated 205m price tag who wants to be subjected to water torture for 2 hours oh fk it does anyone really care about the plot in films like this anymore the lost kingdom is a big middle finger to the audience with no character development no emotional arc special effects that would have seemed blurry ten years ago and amber heard clearly the producers couldnt replace or edit her character out postthatdebacle so instead they opted for reducing her character to the bare minimum requirements heards mera shows up sporadically to serve the plot and then disappears possessing the motivation of a sea anemone but then the same applies to the entire narrative slapdash would be a compliment when it comes to describing the editingpacingheadacheinducing assault on the senses that is this sordid excuse for entertainment youd think scenes of characters piercing waves on translucent seahorses or aquaman battling giant insects or armies clashing would at least inspire an inkling of a sense of awe or wonder but youd be wrong like being stuck in a turbulent spinning submarine it just provokes seasickness and seems to go on and on momoa hams it way up  as in the dials turned to 100 its like hes got nothing to lose a pompous selfaware nearly humorless showcase of underserved star power i liked him well enough in the first one but his onenote shtick wears thin very quickly kidman phones it in big time in perhaps one of the most embarrassing performances of her career was someone feeding her lines on set because i swear she hasnt the soggiest clue what the eff is going on add a dose of agendapushing in this case the big poorlyaddressed issue being global warming and ill go even further than simply stating aquaman and the last kingdom is one of the worst superhero films  its one of the worst films ever period but then i thought wonka was catslevel atrocious and behold critics seem to like it audiences are lapping it up perhaps with age i am becoming an old curmudgeon or maybe i just expect more from our filmmakers and from the audiences that lap up whatever is served to them i implore you to go see the holdovers this christmas season and not waste your hardearned cash on dreck like this one thing that i can confidently say about aquaman is that it tries really hard not to disappoint i mean this movie really goes for it in los angeles asian pacific film festival 2022 review most people associate hawaii with resorts and surfing but the land is rich in history and culture film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Dec 23 2023,positive, superheroes are so busy doing amazing things its easy to forget many of them also live normal lives in which they have friends families and interests that dont involve interrupting crimes or stopping villains of course there are challenges to keeping these worlds separate and it has the potential to be catastrophic if or when they collide watching these heroes evolve can be very engaging and relatable since viewers are less likely to connect with the characters more daring antics in aquaman and the lost kingdom the underwater champion is now a devoted father juggling his commitments as king of atlantis after defeating his powerhungry brother orm patrick wilson arthur curry jason momoa assumed the throne while he enjoys using his abilities to defend the surface and water worlds alike he finds many of his other kingly duties boring on the other hand caring for his infant son with mera amber heard and bonding with his dad temuera morrison over fatherhood is the highlight of each day but black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is still seething after his previous defeat vowing to finally avenge his father by combining ancient and modern technology to create unstoppable weaponry with the aid of a wellmeaning scientist randall park except mantas revenge could come at the cost of the entire planet as hes convinced he must sacrifice the world to achieve his goals since his first appearance in 2016s batman v superman dawn of justice aquaman has been one of the current dcus most appealing heroes hes selfassured funny and determined drawing viewers in with his charming personality its always felt like the character had a lot in common with momoa but the partition separating the actor from the superhero seems to be even thinner now arthurs wardrobe looks like it was lifted directly from momoas closet he also presented writerdirector james wan with a treatment for the film that rested on aquaman being a father and environmentalist mimicking his own life all the rest of the original cast also reprises their roles maintaining the familiarity of their earlier appearances though seeing park appear on screen is a bit of a surprise since hes one of a short list of actors to appear in both the marvel and dc universes particularly this close together as arthur must call on orm for help theres opportunity for some amusing banter between the brothers the teasing continues for much of the narrative generating a fair amount of laughter throughout conversely black mantas story is very hostile with no room for humour creating a stark contrast between the two and forcing aquaman to shift gears when they share the screen while this picture is still better than many of dcs other offerings the studio continues to struggle with balancing light and dark however as its now under new management with james gunn and peter safran becoming coceos theres no telling where the future lies to that end where most credit sequences provide a sneak peek for upcoming stories this one stays grounded in the present the film is available in 3d but dont expect any gimmicks like exploding debris flying towards the audience instead its used to provide depth to many of the scenes  the value of that will be based on individual preferences that said the action sequences are expectedly big with giant land and sea creatures new mechanized enemies and an army of mutated monsters one of the most intriguing machines is an octopusshaped vehicle that can travel via land air and sea while also quickly overpowering its opponents parts of the twohour film feel a little bogged down but it does well to keep a lively pace and wrap everything up the best way possible even if its a tad abrupt copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Dec 23 2023,negative,the dcu sets up jason momoas aquaman to be rowdy and drunk and then makes him a daddygo figure momoa is the highlight along with the lobster who keeps losing limps but the film cant overcome the same old same old superhero storyline and battles
Dec 23 2023,positive, aquaman aka arthur curry jason momoa battles black manta yahya abdulmateen ii in director james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom photo courtesy of warner bros pictures and dc comics ten years and 15 movies later 16 if you count zack snyders reedit of justice league the dc extended universe arrives at its apparent endpoint with aquaman and the lost kingdom  and at least were going out with a laugh director james wan who helmed 2018s aquaman creates a fairly rousing spectacle full of big action moments and serviceable special effects but the biggest most watchable effect of them all is jason momoa a fratboy comedian in the body of an undersea god in the five years since the last movie aquaman aka arthur curry has had some changes in his life one is that hes now the king of atlantis and finding the job is pretty boring  all greeting royal visitors and attending endless sessions with the council of atlantis which wont let him do any of the kingly things he wants to do such as establish diplomatic relations with the surface dwellers who dont know of atlantis existence even more important though is that aquaman is a dad he and his queen mera amber heard have a baby boy arthur jr whos living on land  in part so arthurs landlocked dad temuera morrison can be called upon as a livein babysitter while aquaman is beating up pirates and being king arthur learns that an old enemy has returned david kane aka black manta again played by yahya abdulmateen ii kane is in search of an ancient atlantean power that will restore his energy suit hes enlisted dr stephen shin randall park the hapless marine biologist whos been searching for atlantis to help find this power source in antarctica kanes plan is to power up so he can take revenge on aquaman who allowed kanes father to die in the first movie shin helps kane find that power source the black trident a weapon of atlantean myth when kane touches the trident he becomes possessed by an ancient monster bent on reclaiming global power  using a longbanned atlantean fuel that produces enough greenhouse gases to make global warming happen even faster yes momoa  who shares story credit on the movie  is a notsosecret ecowarrior so thats another reason to like him after kanes first attack on atlantis using some stolen ancient atlantean tech shin found in antarctica aquaman realizes the only way to beat kane is to team up with the last person on earth he wants to see again his halfbrother orm marius patrick wilson with whom aquaman battled for the throne in the first movie aquaman must bust orm out of a desert prison  the first of many set pieces on the way to the big allthemarbles battle at the movies conclusion the we aint brothers and we aint friends banter between aquaman and orm is pretty good as action movies go and momoa and wilson have some good buddycomedy rapport and its fun to see the gang back together including dolph lundgren as king nereus nicole kidman as the retired queen atlanna and even heard whose role feels truncated here possibly focusgrouped out of some big scenes the weak spot here is the villain  kanes revenge motivation is dull and the backstory to explain the ancient baddie who takes kane over comes too late and is too sketchy to be interesting  watching aquaman and the lost kingdom nearly made me wish director james gunn and producer peter safran who are now tasked with rebuilding dcs movie fortunes from the ground up would consider keeping momoa around for future installments hes got the looks the muscles and the charm of a happygolucky superhero  it would be cool if somebody would just let him keep doing that
Dec 22 2023,negative,just like toxic seaweed its a tangled and rotten mess of a superhero film with uneven visual effects cringeworthy dialogue and a sloppy plot the filmmakers mistakenly think that aquamans charisma is defined by surf dude whooping and hollering 
Dec 22 2023,negative, the dceu comes to an ignominious end with aquaman and the lost kingdom a sequel to the 2019 blockbuster dcs cinematic output has been wildly uneven from highs like wonder woman to lows like shazam fury of the gods that kind of allovertheplace track record is reflected in this new outing its a hot mess the story is simultaneously overly complicated and overly simplistic villian black manta yahya abdulmateen ii has vowed to destroy aquaman jason momoa for killing his father in the first film to do this he harnesses a special element called orichalcum that contains great power along with a link to a fabled lost kingdom using the orichalcum has the negative side effect of speeding up global warming thats the basic gist of the story  a standard lowstakes you killed my whatever so now im going to kill you tale aquaman turns to his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson for assistance in foiling black manta at the same time the movie tries to build a mythology theres complex talk about the creation of a unique trident and the history of the kingdom of necrus which was inhabited by demons and became frozen in time none of this is particularly satisfying because aquaman and the lost kingdom only utilizes those concepts as exposition when something needs explained theres a boring information dump after which the plot moves on to whatevers next without providing much bigpicture context this approach leads to a disjointed feel various sections dont seem to go together a sequence where aquaman and orm venture to a land where the climate has mutated rats and grasshoppers to thousands of times their normal size is the only genuinely entertaining part but it comes out of nowhere and is promptly forgotten same goes for an encounter with a crime lord kingfish voiced by martin short whose sole purpose is to point the brothers in the right direction what a long way to go for such a minimal outcome important characters from the original are weirdly sidelined nicole kidman is back as aquamans mother atlanna she gets little screen time and when she does the oscarwinning actress is reduced to spewing platitudes at the aquatic superhero as opposed to having a function as she did in the first film amber heard who plays aquamans wife mera is likewise shoved into the background the movie keeps emphasizing what a family man aquaman has become yet there are few scenes in which he interacts with his spouse what aquaman and the lost kingdom does offer is an overload of cgi action scenes that become virtually identical by the end to be fair several of the images in these scenes look cool in 3d however the underwater fights are too cluttered and chaotic to generate tension excessive mayhem is not the same as true excitement characterization gets tossed aside in the process basically anything the original did well the sequel botches dc films is set to have a different vision going forward courtesy of new ceos james gunn and peter safran their stated aim is to bring more consistency to the dc label onscreen aquaman and the lost kingdom is a prime example of why an overhaul is desperately needed
Dec 22 2023,neutral, bakersfield calif kget  maybe it has been the long string of bad movies made that were based on dc comics characters  shazam fury of the gods black adam the flash  that have made aquaman and the lost kingdom less of a disaster than expected the new offering in the endless stream of superhero films is rife with problems from juvenile jokes to an incoherent script but there have been plenty of worse offerings jason momoa returns to the role of the king of the sea his old enemy black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is back and he is stronger than ever because of some ancient atlantean technology  including a powerful black trident  he found buried under the ice in antarctica the villains plan is to speed up global warming to thaw an evil being who has been a popsicle for centuries aquaman realizes he cant stop the plot on his own and recruits his brother orm patrick wilson to help him end the threat and that is where the script begins to unravel the first aquaman film had orm trying to wipe out those who live on land all is forgiven with a couple of lines of dialogue simply to help move along the plot of the sequel there isnt much time to worry about how the brotherly love  makes no sense because writer david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick cutsandpastes every idea from the writers handbook fatherhood royal uprisings environmental disasters greed and brotherly bonds they are bobbled together in a manner so loosely stitched there are gaping holes big enough for a whale to pass from one plotline to the next even a big moment where aquaman declares himself to the world is a problem as the fish man has been saving the planet for years the biggest reason the writing problems arent as prominent is that by its nature aquaman requires more computergenerated imagery than any of the other comic book inspired movies from the endless flowing of hair to an unlimited army of demons there are only a few scenes where characters can be quietly developed the film shows all the signs of the reshoots that director james wan  who is better known for horror films  had to do in an effort to try and give the film a better story structure the film never finds a smooth flow but starts and stops as each new idea arises any good plot moments are tarnished by jokes aimed at the playground crowd the fatherhood angle anchors aquaman but having his infant son urinate on his fathers face  not once but twice  is as cheap a joke that can be made please note that even when months pass in the story baby arthur doesnt age maybe it is an atlantean way even the casting has problems randall park plays the scientist who helps black manta find the lost kingdom his appearance in the dc world despite being in the initial aquaman is jarring as park has been in more marvel productions from wandavision to antman it is like looking at the starting lineup for the los angeles dodgers and there is one san francisco giant on their bench despite all the story mistakes bad writing and disjointed script there is a spark of fun at the heart of aquaman and the lost kingdom and it comes from momoa he gives his best shot at making the film entertainment but it is like trying to make jokes at a funeral and the funeral might be for the end of the current wave of dc comics movies should this be the end then at least momoa went down swinging and provided more entertaining moments than the previous three or four dc comics inspired movies combined that is not high praise because that total remains very low to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 22 2023,negative, i will say this for aquaman and the lost kingdom the longintheworks sequel to 2018s aquaman starring jason momoa in the title role i laughed quite a bit does it matter that the funniest parts werent supposed to be humorous not really its the essential conundrum with this piece of intellectual property from dc comics the very concept is absurd occasionally with a tongueincheek wink and its difficult not to snicker when oscarwinner nicole kidman is forced to spout nonsensical dialogue ill be sending a cephalopod with you and repeat the word orichalcumthe legendary metal of atlantis which emits greenhouse gaseswith deadly seriousness
Dec 22 2023,negative, the omens were never good for the last superhero movie of 2023 a changing release date a growing indifference towards the genre which treated marvel and dc with equal contempt and jason momoas widely quoted comments about aquamans future didnt bode well for the return of the king of atlantis the only positive seemed to be the new release date chosen to capitalise on the holiday market the sad truth is that aquaman and the lost kingdom needs all the luck it can get five years since arthur curryaquaman momoa had his own film he now has his hands full as king of atlantis as well as being part of the justice league and planning a wedding manta yahya abdulmateen ii on the other hand is determined to avenge his fathers death and take down aquaman once and for all armed with the evil powers of the black trident he sets out on a path of destruction so aquaman turns to his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson for help its an unlikely alliance but its his best  and only  option just like shazam fury of the gods the irreverent rock god of superheroes has undergone a personality change and the film follows suit this time around his throwaway lines land with a thud and theres a general sense of desperation even before the opening catchup has left the screen yet again theres a smattering of sixties rock classics   although spirit in the sky is a strange choice of theme tune for an aquatic hero  and dc has released the film in various formats including that old chestnut 3d it doesnt add anything except the observation that the only thing not thrown at the film was the kitchen sink if only some of the budget had been devoted to improving the cgi we might have stood a chance of recognising dolph lundgren and understanding what on earth was going on during the many fight scenes aquaman and the lost kingdom is a soggy mess  unfunny overlong and a damp squib when compared to the original and that lets face it was no classic but at least it has some energy and a sense of fun its not just the kingdom thats been lost aquaman and the lost kingdom is out now on premium digital ownership and rental and will be available on 4k uhd bluray and dvd on 18 march
Dec 22 2023,positive,  its not easy being king and it looks like aquaman is learning this the hard way although being a new parent is no walk in the park its much better than dealing with the roadblocks and obstructive politics of the atlantis council and grappling with the rapidly growing threat of climate change atlantis is at a crossroads they must choose whether they wish to stay hidden or reveal themselves to an equally volatile surface world and arthur a product of both worlds is stuck in the middle   but politics will have to wait david kane aka black manta has returned still hellbent on taking revenge on the man who killed his father and hes willing to take the entire world down with him with the help of scientists he has found the black trident  a weapon of immense power forged in the dark eldritch trenches of atlantiss history with this weapon black manta has found a volatile energy source that will spell doom for all the earth above and below water in order to stop manta aquaman will have to join forces with the man who knows him best  his halfbrother orm with the future of his family kingdom and all of earth at stake aquaman will have to defy tradition play nice with his worst enemy and build a few bridges if possible   the longawaited followup to 2018s aquaman has been thwarted on all sidesfrom bad publicity scandal and poor marketing from warner bros despite its tempestuous start aquaman and the lost kingdom directed by james wan with a screenplay by david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick is a solid film that stays afloat on its own merits this is as bombastic and grandiose an offering as is typical for thedc cinematic universe and the deluge of drama is a lot to take in even for the most seasoned of viewers there is a lot going on in this film both technically and in the subtext   aquaman and the lost kingdom brings up a lot of ideas in its formidable twohour runtime some of these get addressed fully while others are lost at sea only touched upon or resolved in passing family ecology and forgiveness are the main sticking points here there are thinly veiled allegories for the current political zeitgeist in the united states such as hostile bureaucratic government councils xenophobia and a hint of the ongoing culture war while it would have been interesting to dig into these deeper wan casts these more prickly and predictable politics aside in favor of the more immediate characterdriven plot as it is the global warming theme is handled with surprising sensitivity while the atlanteans are clearly struggling with the rapidly changing climate  partially black mantas doing as well as the surface dwellers  aquaman and the lost kingdom does not cast them as helpless victims dredging up a past and moral ambiguity that feels human and believable   jason momoas performance as aquaman works best when he is allowed to express tender humanity and humor  best achieved when he has an equally tender and human partner to spar with highstakes action and explosions aside its a real treat seeing aquaman being a parent cracking a beer confiding in his father and struggling in unglamorous and relatable ways even when hes pummeling some unlucky monster or dropping some vulgar witticism momoas aquaman is deeply emotional and eloquent elevating this sequel into some genuinely deep and affecting territory his chemistry with watchmen and the conjuring alum patrick wilson  once again giving a nuanced performance as the disgraced former king orm  is natural intimate and at times genuinely hilarious having been brought down to the lowest possible level after the events of aquaman orms character progression is compelling stoic and reserved wilson explores the characters depth and plays the straight man to momoas wise guy   yahya abdulmateen iis black manta is more intense this time around brought to the brink of madness he provides a more simmering sort of vindictiveness that can be felt through the screen making for some truly unsettling sequences while the entire cast delivers solid performances the standout performance is the least advertised and most surprising that of randall park as the antivillainous marine biologist dr shin an atlantis fanboy turned unwilling accessory to war and ecological damage his subtle character progression adds to this films drama and urgency shin is a consistent source of nervous comic relief contrasting with arthurs fratboy humor and orms deadpan delivery   while johnsonmcgoldricks screenplay evokes plenty of gasps and laughs the dialogue is inconsistent its stilted in places while smooth witty and heartfelt in others some attempts at humor dont always land making for some particularly awkward exchanges that said this isnt a huge surprise given the dcus track record for bombastic and declarative dialogue   from a technical standpoint aquaman and the lost kingdom has a lot going on sometimes it tries to cover too much even for its generous runtime while wan has a good sense of space characterization and direction he seems beholden to the current dceu formula cramming too much action and movement into one sequence this can make some pivotal action scenes near incomprehensible and even dizzying especially those taking place in the urban enclaves of atlantis this is less obvious in the more open cavernous spaces of the climactic final battle much to the films benefit the action sequences vary in pacing quality and scale with some being more effective than others while none of the fight scenes are bad the action is instantly improved once orm is back in the picture adding dynamism to the brothers backtoback fighting style   being a dcu film aquaman and the lost kingdom is filled to the brim with special effects at times its pretty seamless the subterranean and subaquatic tech ships architecture and weaponry are stunning but the effects can be distracting environments that rely more heavily on cgi especially in certain areas of atlantis are less immersive and break the flow of the narrative and the visuals the sea creature designs that make up the less humanlike population of atlantis are the worst offenders except for a couple of characters these beings almost feel as though they belong in a separate film obeying different laws of physics than the human cast they spar with   aquaman and the lost king is welllit just skirting the current curse hdr has placed on the majority of the cinematic landscape while the color correction does leave a lot to be desired  some scenes in atlantis look washed out as opposed to watercolored  it does work in some instances such as the muted and grounded tones of arthur and his fathers rocky seaside lighthouse home it also works for grounded and tender moments like arthurs hearttoheart conversations with his father   along with its overthe top usage of visual effects and crowded storyline aquaman and the lost king suffers from its overwrought sound design this film features an overdesigned and nondescript soundtrack with swelling scare chords and hans zimmerstyle horns the composition is loud bombastic and typical of the dceu  a missed opportunity given the lush watery setting of atlantis however there are flashes of good composition and music in spaces there is a lovely recurring synth pad progression in some pivotal moments that creates a foreboding mood of atmosphere and urgency unfortunately aquaman and the lost kingdom is practically drowned under the sound design adding to the sensory overload of the movie   aquaman and the lost kingdom has strong sea legs in terms of storytelling but it feels weighed down by its overstuffed elements and flooded sound design although marketing may not have given this film the proper gear to paddle with its solid narrative helps it stay afloat providing a satisfying and fitting end to this characters arc   for all its grand visions action and explosive panoramic adventures aquaman and the lost kingdom is strongest when it explores arthurs quieter and more intimate side there is a tender humanity to this tale with the central characters at their most vulnerable mera spends the majority of the film gravely injured or fearing for her sons life alongside arthur atlanna must grapple with her feelings for both her sons especially orm in spite of his criminal actions arthur struggles with parenthood and selfdoubt as a reluctant political leader and his father tom allows himself to be vulnerable around his son and infant grandson david kanes vengefulness and grief consume him and dr shin feels powerless to stop the carnage that he unwillingly becomes an accessory to not least of all is the tension between the brothers in some instances the great action reads almost as a sideshow to these smallerscale characterdriven scenes  aquaman balances his duties as king and as a member of the justice league all while planning a wedding black manta is on the hunt for atlantean tech to help rebuild his armor orm plots to escape his atlantean prison a pop culture enthusiast writer and artist with a love of scifi fantasy horror and aliens she actually went to school to talk about comics with aquaman and the lost kingdom looming arthur curry will need help to battle the sadistic black manta here is everything fans need to know
Dec 22 2023,positive, acting as if it was necessary to rush to the finish line james wans breathlessly paced followup to the billiondollar hit that was aquaman may signal the end of the line for this iteration of the dc universe but its not without a gonzo amount of spectacle aquaman and the lost kingdom once again packs every frame with a ridiculous amount of visual splendor as we follow jason momoas browithpathos take on the superhero who talks to fish is it fun sure does it have much to offer outside of an elaborate undersea adventure not really how much does that matter well as i said the dcu is getting a reset after this so take what you want out of this last hurrah for arthur curry and co in its current form set several years after arthur momoa took the throne of atlantis from his scheming halfbrother orm patrick wilson hes now a bored king who balances unengaging bureaucratic affairs with being a husband and father and having the occasional skirmish with pirates meanwhile david kane aka black manta yahya abdulmateen ii is still seeking revenge against aquaman for leaving his father to die with help from atlantisobsessed marine biologist stephen shin randall park kane finds a black trident that imbues him with the powers of a lost enemy of the other ocean kingdoms with kane now being much more powerful arthurs only solution is to break orm out of prison and team up with him to stop the possessed manta from doing something drastic while ive seen a superhero sequel rely on an uneasy alliance between halfsiblings before this film is less thor the dark world and more the mummy returns there seems to be such a reliance on the familiarity of the aquaman universe that theres barely any time to take stock of how wild it all is so rather than taking any time to get our feet wet this film dives right in repeating some beats of the original but keeping the action constantly moving opening up the movie to exploring more reasons for sequences full of special effects none of that is necessarily a complaint i cant say theres a movie that looks nearly as visually remarkable in this way this side of avatar the way of water that said the confines of a superhero movie do hold wan back from equaling james camerons unquestionable abilities as the champion blockbuster filmmaker many of these dc films tend to be overflowing with characters as there are so many potential directions i understandably see the need to fill out all the side roles with notable actors depending on what happens next while theres still an extended cast list in this movie there seems to be perfunctory reasoning for each of them being around with little done to add those extra bits of detail to establish further personality momoa and wilson get the lions share of screen time and dont suffer as a result however its easy to see the strings when mera amber heard only shows up to save her husband in critical moments dolph lundgrens nereus is there to agree or oppose big decisions temuera morrisons tom curry only has fatherly advice to offer and nicole kidmans atlanna is primarily an exposition machine the previous film introduced us to arthurs parents by having kidman eat fish from a bowl atlantis had more of a sense of wonder to it oh and julie andrews showed up to play a giant crab monster im not saying this movie doesnt have a sense of weirdness torpo the drumplaying octopus from the first film apparently moonlights as a tactical operative allowing him to tag along for the films second act still it does feel a bit more on rails to pair this film down as much as possible to be only a little more than two hours 2018s aquaman felt like a challenge met as far as delivering an epic sea adventure about a man coming into his own into the role he had always denied but was destined for here arthur is on more of a monsteroftheweektype journey its not the worst way to handle things but i did feel a bit antsy about not getting enough movie in this movie sadly better time could have been spent with abdulmateen the actor does all he can with the role but given how much time we spend watching his side of things one would hope for more than a fairly onenote character who is reduced even further given his possessed state oddly randall park gets more time to shine in these sections of the film as he becomes conflicted by the heinous actions taken by his mercenary partner note to self dont trust mercenaries ultimately it becomes notable that for an aquaman sequel with so many undersea kingdoms to explore we dont actually meet many new characters leaving things in a state thats not all that evolved from where we last saw everyone sure theres one notable moment featuring a variety of sea creatures that feels the most like a side adventure from star wars as possible still for the most part this film seems fine settling in with the folks we already know and adjusting some of those relationships mild spoiler brothers learn to bond does the film aim to go anywhere else with its ideas well it expands on the environmentalist concerns of the first by having a plotline literally involving manufactured greenhouse gas emissions that are heavily affecting global warming concerns but its not as if this is a nuanced approach or has much to say beyond yeah thats bad meanwhile arthur doesnt have much of a chance to grow either however im still all for the fun momoa is clearly having which plays nicely against wilsons pessimistic uptight handling of orm with all of that said the action is firstrate and executed in a manner that will impress those who know theres more physical work involved in so much of the cgenhanced spectacle than they may realize wans knack for visualizing elaborate set pieces once again pays off here with cinematographer don burgess and the rest of the crew doing whats needed to keep up with all the craziness on display whether or not the stakes of this film are meaningful enough to the viewer i still have an appreciation for these richly conceived moments that convince me im watching superheroes on screen while warner bros may have left aquaman and the lost kingdom out to dry in terms of various rumors regarding the production the delays that took place and now having to sit as the final statement on this version of the dc universe wan didnt throw in the towel while less of an accomplishment compared to the first this still feels like a film full of effort from all involved to deliver a rousing enough adventure the areas where it comes up lacking notwithstanding i had fun with this brotherbuddy actioncomedy i was even given a giant sea horse a cocky octopus and an evil volcano lair to appreciate in the process the tide may have turned but arthur is still my man
Dec 22 2023,positive, theres no getting around how nonsensical aquaman and the lost kingdom is the multipostponed sequel to james wans 2018 original starring jason momoa as the titular fishman combines the intelligence of fast  furious with lord of the ringswannabe aesthetics in the name of stupidity youll witness momoa and friends riding on giant seahorses a hammerhead submarine and a baby peeing in aquamans mouth  its wild but admittedly entertaining while bad guys do typical bad things and say standard badguy dialogue a goofy smile will be slapped on your face when momoa and the scenestealing patrick wilson run amok and attempt to be serious in a movie that you cannot take as such  here we pick up with momoas arthur curry aka aquaman who is now sitting on the throne of atlantis he worked hard to reach and earn that status in the previous film however its much more tedious than anticipated a lot of creatures are arguing with each other and aquamans demands for change are getting shot down by an underwater council hmm this sounds familiar black manta yahya abdulmateen ii pictured right will stop at nothing to take aquaman jason momoa down once and for all this time black manta is more formidable than ever before wielding the power of the mythic black trident which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force  fortunately he has his newborn son sometimesthere wife amber heard and poppop temuera morrison to escape the oceanbottom boredom and keep his compass pointed north but in classic superhero fashion when you do a lot of good in the previous movie you can anticipate a baddie to cook up some madness  everyone welcome back yahya abdulmateen iis black manta hes still thirsty for aquamans blood and driven by the need to avenge his fathers death but now hes got some smart tech people and the strength of ancient evil on his side in the form of a blackandgreen trident  hey we can all bang our heads on keyboards and package it as art right its all good fun dont worry yes expect eye rolls aplenty especially in the films opening but then after maybe 20 minutes or so this underwater heist involving this special green ooze or something supercharges the amusement meter director james wan throws his signature wide pan shots and kinetic energy into the mix during a catandmouse game elevating the material to a realm better worth your time to defeat black manta aquama jason momoa right will turn to his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson the former king of atlantis to forge an unlikely alliance together they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save aquamans family and the world from irreversible destruction actually there are quite a few solid action sequences look out for momoa and wilsons prison escape sequence that rolls out into a pirates of the caribbean style of looney wilson and wan clearly understand each other and wilson knows how to dial into some otherworldly awesome do you remember where he took insidious 2 insidious 2 is a good example of this movies tone its just straightup bonkers and laundryfolding entertainment at its finest so yeah youll laugh at parts the movie probably didnt want you to laugh at especially one babysnatching sequence that involves all the heroes letting out the most dramatic nooooos youve ever heard in your life and this is coming from a guy who sat through all of george lucas tweaked versions of star wars plus this aquaman has a cute and funny octopus character and a turtlecrab creature voiced by john rhysdavies of lord of the rings fame preston barta is a member of the critics choice association and the dallasfort worth film critics association read his work here on freshfictiontv and rottentomatoescom follow him on instagram at bluraydad
Dec 22 2023,negative,feels like everyone just stopped trying a while ago and left this last whimper from the dceu to float into theatres 
Dec 22 2023,positive, given their fairly simple story bases their easytounderstand characters that are already defined and previously presented from their source medium  comic films are falling into the rut of blending together in a fourcolour melange of expected plots and character outcomes  aquaman and the lost kingdom is warner brothers dc comics latest sacrificial offering to the altar of comic properties and while the film isnt bad in itself its pretty clear that theres a bit of a schism in deciding how to present this film and its hero  the story building on the foundations of the previous film which established aquamanarthur curry jason momoa as the lost heir to the throne of the underwater mythical kingdom of atlantis this sequel sees arthur as a married man to mera amber heard daughter to king nereus of xebel  dolph lundgren hes a father and oh yeah the king its a tough job but somebody has to do it  hes a working man living a good life on land and in the sea leading his xenophobic atlanteans and struggling to get some sleep while learning to change the diapers of his infant son the audience is supposed to accept arthur as this workingclass hero who also has noble blood lineage and able to withstand the enormous pressures of the depths and benchpress russian akulaclass attack submarines second banana villain black manta yahya abdulmateen ii shows up out of revenge for the death of his father in the first film assisted by atlantisobsessed scientist dr stephen shin randall park they discover a forgotten lost kingdom that has a power source capable of giving black manta the power he needs to avenge his fathers death but at the cost of the worlds climate when does arthur curry sleep this illustrates the conflict in presenting our hero hes a superhero a king of an underwater kingdom yet he loves his moments living with his father lighthouse keeper tom curry temuera morrison on land with his family there are lighthearted family moments that are meant to make him more human and relatable despite his superpowers and access to technology and a culture lightyears ahead of anything on land  humour is meant to be the glue in which director james wan cements the character to the storyline its similar to the way we were introduced to marvels the guardians of the galaxy in which the hero starlord a teenager abducted by alien scavengers grows up to be a wisecracking 80s musiclovin irreverent spacerogue humour brings down the lofty and elevated tones that our fourcolour heroes represent in comic pages and theres a lot of that sort of humour in this film  its old hat though not to say that the comedic moments of arthur getting peed on by his infant son or trashtalking his younger halfbrother orm patrick wilson arent funny but by now its a formulaic mechanism used to curry favour with the audience it added an element of predictability to the film that was patently apparent to the audience who at the screening i attended laughed as if at dad jokes  its a comicfantasy that gets a passing grade but not a high one whats weird is that is actually a high score for the warner brothers brand of comic movies jason momoas reliance on lowbrow jokes and simple family values as the primary motivations for the character of aquaman is a bit hard to accept with his chosen superhero role isnt being a king enough of a job why would he bother to protect the seas while at the same time live in an abandoned lighthouse on a rocky shore hes the king of atlantis  surely he could find a better home in the depths for his family but part of accepting the schtick of comic stories is that we accept these character choices and go along with them in the spirit of a willing suspension of disbelief still its a lot to swallow  the family moments of reconciliation do manage to elicit a level of feelgood spirit with the audience that and the cameo moments of character voices by the likes of martin short and one of my particular favourites john rhysdavies are genuine comedic surprises that add a level of unexpected endearment  aquaman and the lost kingdom isnt an unentertaining film but the missing scenes  like ben affleck and michael keatons rumoured batman appearances  definitely do make one wonder if there will be an extended version of the film however when you consider that these might not work well with the schlock it does manage to provide an extra significance for the what was really lost in this film  aquaman and the lost kingdom directed by james wan starring jason momoa patrick wilson amber heard nicole kidman temeura morrison dolph lundgren yahya abdulmateen ii martin short john rhysdavies opens in theatres friday december 22
Dec 22 2023,negative, a critical assessment of the merits of a subject such as art film music television food and literature reviews are based on the writers informedexpert opinion  who could have guessed aquaman and the lost kingdom would be this bad it isnt so much being released as being allowed to wash up on shore who could have guessed aquaman and the lost kingdom would be this bad it isnt so much being released as being allowed to wash up on shore in aquaman and the lost kingdom the title character jason momoa right enlists his halfbrother orm patrick wilson to battle the villain black manta figuring two fish heads are better than one in the battle against aquatic evil the first how bad could it be answer extremely bad the cgidrenched movie isnt so much being released as it is being allowed to wash up on shore there wasnt even a redcarpet premiere in la for it the second how much of amber heard has been cut out of it answer a lot shes been reduced from jason momoas costar to cameo status nobody was expecting this aquaman sequel to be a winner not with all the reports of delays and reshoots the changes included trimming heards scenes to placate johnny depp fanboys following her courtroom defeat in a defamation suit sparked by depp her former husband this is also the final film in the dc extended universe which is wheezing to a close after 10 years of highs wonder woman the first aquaman and more recent lows black adam the suicide squad it will be replaced by a new film franchise of dc comics characters cleverly titled dc universe the abandonment of the dceu could have been a creative boost for returning aquaman director james wan freed from having to connect the dots of an ongoing franchise he could have created a standalone film with fresh ideas and a new villain to quote the dudebro dialogue of screenwriter david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick momoas buff scruffy and smirking aquaman is now the king of frickin atlantis hes also the delighted father of a newborn son with wife mera heard who is absent so much that aquaman almost seems like a single dad aquaman will be obliged to save the worlds ass from an environmental threat posed by a bilious green substance called orichalcum which is like climate change on steroids to do so hell have to wade through a couple of leftover grudges from the previous film the first involves black manta yahya abdulmateen ii the humourless pirate turned bughelmeted supervillain who is still grieving his fathers death and still determined to make aquaman and all of atlantis pay for it hes assisted by a reluctant dr stephen shin randall park another returning character who just wanted to see atlantis and instead finds himself forced to be black mantas tech guy the second grudge involves aquamans estranged halfbrother orm patrick wilson the former king of frickin atlantis who is wasting away in jail on account of his badassery in the previous film when black manta acquires a magical black trident and along with it the airpolluting and glaciermelting powers of orichalcum aquaman turns to orm for assistance figuring two fish heads are better than one in the battle against aquatic evil orm isnt interested natch and has to be dragged into the fray the potential for buddycomedy hijinks is there and some of it is realized the film earns a slight chuckle when the duo end up on an island and aquaman cons orm into eating a giant live cockroach which orm actually finds delicious but the potential for laughs is mostly squandered as the banal banter follows along predictable lines that could be summarized as you suck no you suck other returning characters are similarly illused including nicole kidman as warrior mom atlanna dolph lundgren as politically minded king nereus and a musical cgi octopus named topo speaking of cgi its the worst aspect of the lost kingdom grossly overblown and palpably fake all the more so in the 3d version i saw it makes the underwater scenes look like a crowded fish tank abandoned by its owner its as if he went to the studios digital vault and just grabbed any creepy thing he could find possibly in the vain hope of distracting viewers from noticing hes created what might just be the worst movie of 2023 anyone can read conversations but to contribute you should be a registered torstar account holder if you do not yet have a torstar account you can create one now it is free
Dec 22 2023,positive, its last swim for the troubled dc extended universe planned for an overall rethink as jason momoa returns as the king of atlantis in aquaman and the lost kingdom in some important ways the sequel laps the original in others it  and its megafranchise  seem destined to sink without a ripple when last we saw arthur curry momoa he was lying facedown drunk in a puddle in the jokey postcredits scene of the flash  but storywise we left him in triumph at the end of 2018s aquaman  having defeated his halfbrother orm patrick wilson who was driven by  semihilarious delusions of grandeur ocean master orm wants them to call him arthur has  become  king of atlantis  leaving aside the outmoded notions of the first film why isnt arthurs mom queen atlanna allowed to rule she is played by nicole kidman the whole setup smacks of too much too soon  arthur essentially a biker dude from the surface world who can swim fast and talk to fish but does not know atlantean history or how the nations political system works  is apparently fit to be king cool  james gunn and peter safran have shared the beginnings of their eight to 10year plan for a more coherent series of superman batman and other superhero movies and shows and it wont be marvel 20 gunn promised anyhoo the end of the last film left the door open to  ocean master rejoining the fold as they clapped him in chains arthur said when youre ready lets talk and thats just what happens when the ineffectual  villain of the first one black manta yahya abdulmateen ii finds an ancient atlantean weapon  and suddenly becomes  much more powerful bringing big one true ring energy manta finds himself guided by a malevolent force  to destroy the world by burning fuel that releases greenhouse gases so nice brother arthur has to recruit mean brother orm to stop that because they agree it would be bad and were off  lost kingdom rings alarm bells over the climate crisis in earnest if clumsy fashion its always jarring to hear members of an ancient undersea civilization speaking in american surface idioms perhaps never more so than when the queen decries greenhouse gases  do they even have greenhouses in atlantis in real life momoa is a dedicated environmental activist and cowrote the story so his sincerity isnt in question one just wishes they could have made that pill go down easier by the way 1987s disastrous superman iv the quest for peace   was from a story cowritten by its star the late christopher reeve the experience of watching lost kingdom directed by james wan as was aquaman is often a fun one though where the first movie felt like a superhero version of raiders of the lost ark this sequel is a buddy cop movie arthur the freewheeling fightfirstsortitoutlater one and orm  the  bythebook stickler  wilson is a skilled actor who doesnt play a onenote foil for momoas antics along with some good work by returning screenwriter and longtime wan collaborator david leslie johnsonmcgoldrick wilson fleshes out orms motivations and worldview enough to make his redemption arc believable  the  underwater worlds are just fine though theres a lack of physics in the cgi action that rob the fights of dramatic weight as a sequel lost kingdom feels lighter which is an improvement despite  reducing the chemistryfree interactions between arthur and his lady love mera amber heard it leans into the idea of superhero as family man to humanizing effect this leads to some newparenting jokes  most viewers wont expect to see momoa peed on as much as he is here  the first aquaman was by far the biggest grosser in the dc extended universe and  momoa has expressed doubt over the likelihood of his return as the character in the new plans losing him would be a shame he balances the mellow bikerdude vibe with something hidden inside thats ready to be roused these movies allowed arthur not to be the smartest guy in the room a refreshing reversal all of it resulted in  one of the dceus most alivefeeling characters  and for a franchise with  arguably more failures than successes thats not something to throw away easily one of the strengths of incoming rebooter james gunn is reconceiving lightly regarded characters as he did with  guardians of the galaxy aquaman and the lost kingdom may not be consequential in the long run but its a mostly diverting upbeat closer one that could hint at the tone of things to come
Dec 22 2023,negative, lets get this over with so we can pretend it never happened aquaman and the lost kingdom 2023 is not good for a warner bros feature presentation the same studio that gave us barbie 2023 and closed 2022 with babylon what we have is 124 minutes of fish vomit fish vomiting is rare so when it happens its an indication of a fatal condition and time for little chips to visit sea world by way of the nearest commode who cares what its about the backstory you get in the first ten minutes is a mishmosh of a backstory that was part aquaman 2018 and part transcribed fever dream from a film that wasnt actually produced everything else that unfolds over the next 104 minutes is arthur complaining about responsibility while splitting time between dry land where his baby son lives with grandpa tom temuera morrison and under the sea where he has to be king of atlantis apparently being king is boring because he never shuts up about it other returning good guys are atlanna nicole kidman orm patrick wilson and king nereus dolph lundgren antagonists are manta yahya abdulmateen ii whos still salty from the actions of the original and his rescuerhostage dr david shin randall park theres a convoluted plan to accelerate global warming so manta can get at the gooey center of a glacier in the antarctic obtain a mantle of power destroy aquaman and rule the world shin regrets most of his choices and whining comprises the bulk of his onscreen time the whole of the story has a very loose sophomoric feel jason momoa is listed as one of the writers and yes it contains the dialogue of a man who likes acting cool but only learned how to act cool from 1960s rebellion movies if he had sleeves thered be a pack of smokes rolled up in them right off the bat everything about aquaman and the lost kingdom looks artificial like a fresh wig right out of the bag fourdayold lip filler and red velvet cake box mixartificial every scene has a greenscreen shimmer to it and the scenes that were greenscreened werent digitally smoothed the casual viewer may find themselves thinking is this an actor or has everyone been replaced with cgi i thought that a lot as if scenes not needing dialog were inserted and cgi scans used to speed up postproduction hailey baileys the little mermaid 2023 has a more polished look and she spent most of the movie chilling with an animated crab i dont like trashing hard work especially for an industry thats been so maligned over the last eight months but aquaman and the lost kingdom looks awful it looks rushed and incomplete and the story is sloppy jason momoa for all of the irreverence of arthurs previous appearances feels the most adlibbed and not in a good way hes very strong and hes very pretty but unless theres a director willing to work with him on his delivery he will never not look like all of his roles were better suited for silent films theres a certain actress whom i wont name because i refuse to give her ink who probably looks the most artificial outside of the seahorse that actually neighs or the genetically enhanced octopus who acts rings around wilson and mamoa every time she was on screen screentime that audiences were assured would be diminished because no one likes her  the screening i attended went dead silent whatever diminished role she may have had there was still plenty of screen time its like seeing your high school bully accept an award for saving kittens she pretends she didnt strap to branches in trees there are better movies to close out 2023 like blue beetle or john wick 4 maybe even nimona on netflix aquaman and the lost kingdom should be way down on your list of things to see before 2024 right alongside necrotic big toe and overfull fast food dumpster aquaman and the lost kingdom 2023 is rated pg13 for swears people getting punched in the face people getting shot people getting run through and underwater zombies i just wanted to say that i tremendously liked this review ive been going over the various critics reviews to decide if i should watch the movie and the moment i started this review i couldnt help but keep reading taken by your creativity and imagination the review stood out so much from the rest of articles by its fresh sharp and witty language and the amount of visible care that was put into the writing the only unpleasant thing i was expecting to see was praise of a certain actress which i still  to my surprise and disdain see in 9 out of 10 reviews i was so pleased to find the opposite  appreciate honesty and integrity of this article
Dec 22 2023,negative, aquaman and the lost kingdom provides not so much a coda to the dceu as it does a pathetic epitaph this ship is good and sunk one of the most amusing bits of the 2000s hbo sitcom entourage was the fake movies that existed within the tv show while protagonist vincent chase was fictional the hollywood he moved through was not real actors playing versions of themselves cameoed as they helped build chases fictional movie star career with each faux film working as a parody of some trend or fad at the time the most infamously pointed of these was aquaman a phony superhero flick designed to poke fun at the recent sam raimi spiderman movie i thought about that gag for the first time in years while watching aquaman and the lost kingdom this holiday weekend and not just because it also revolved around dcs most waterlogged superhero arthur curry rather the uncanny gnawing sensation that stalks aquaman 2 like some bloodthirsty tuna is that youre not watching a real movie something this soulless this devoid of personality ambition or creative spark cannot be real right someone in the projector rooms gotta be putting our leg or were going to discover that we are really watching a moviewithinamovie like how last action hero begins with arnold schwarzenegger starring in a satire of one of his gunsandbiceps joints jack slater iv unfortunately aquaman and the lost kingdom is very real and its sheer ineptness as a narrative as a followup to 2018s passable spectacle aquaman or even as some kind of final word on the dc extended universe is breathtaking this denouement of the dceu is less a wake or celebration than it is an example of hasty studio obligation they say a few platitudes hoist up the body while its still warm and toss it into the drink but then the audience has to sit there and watch the carcass slowly float around the boat for 124 minutes before it finally succumbs to the inky and merciful black the storytelling of the piece has clearly been hacked to pieces from the start reports and rumors suggest aquaman 2 was largely reshot twice and reedited three times in lieu of increasingly bleak audience test scores i cannot attest to if all of that went down but from the jump theres clearly been some craven tinkering and skullduggery behind the scenes the film limply begins by stitching together a generic action sequence where jason momoas aquaman fights pirates i think puts up with domestic annoyances as an infant son shoots urine at his beard and awkwardly remembers flashbacks to how the kid was born between films that were released five years apart its all held together by momoas voiceover narration popsicle sticks chewing gum and a prayer for a deliverance that never comes the absolute hollowness of the film is most explicit in the realization that mera aquamans mermaid queen and a colead of the last film as played by amber heard is barely in this montage of alleged marital bliss in fact shes barely in the movie despite being the mother of this child who figures prominently to the films plot when mera does appear any bits of dialogue she appears about to say have been removed leaving heard about 10 lines of exposition in the whole moviewhich is barely above the number of bodily fluid jokes david leslie johnsonmcgoldricks screenplay desperately employs in a doomed attempt at levity in an effort to appease the ugliest corners of the internet aquaman 2 throws heard under the jet ski but doesnt even have the courage of its convictions to succumb to online thuggery so she just sits there in the background an emblem of a film so afraid of rocking the boat that it starts poking holes in its own hull the real story such as it is involves the first films superfluous side villain who at last has become relevant black manta yahya abdulmateen ii the groovy looking fiend has discovered the one ring of power a black trident with the ability to psychically link him with an ancient sentient evil who wishes black manta to bring the magical accessory to his seat of dark sorcery power in return for the service theyll rule the world together but only after kind of destroying it because the trident is also causing superaccelerated climate change uh huh to stop him aquaman and his mother atlanna oscarwinner nicole kidman visibly regretting the paycheck and current industry trends that led her to such a fate devise a plan to rescue aquamans halfbrother and mortal enemy from the last movie orm patrick wilson it turns out that orm knows how to find black manta buddy comedy hijinks ensue as wilson and momoa hit the watery trail to be clear certain elements of aquaman and the lost kingdom work just fine and the chemistry between momoa and wilson is at the top of that list in the previous film these two actors got relatively little screen time to bounce off one another and when they did it was usually laden with blankets of exposition in the lost kingdom the exposition dumps are mostly left to other characters so instead momoa and wilson get to just vibe in what are easily the best portions of the movie wilson plays the straight man to momoas cowabunga broiness similarly director james wan remains an impressive visual stylist and at the risk of damning with faint praise he creates perhaps the second best looking liveaction superhero movie in 2023 behind only guardians of the galaxy vol 3 wans embrace of translucent and psychedelic colors pop especially in contrast to the tsunami of gray sludge comprising most marvel studios pictures wan and production designers bill brzeski and sahby mehalla also have a ball building real sets to represent the ancient evil of the trench culture that gave the world the black trident its a shameless ripoff of the mordor and isengard aesthetic from peter jacksons lord of the rings movies of course but at least it wont cause your eyes to glaze over like the quantum realm or whatever the hell the flashs cg climax was supposed to be yet despite wans visual flourishes its hard to believe this was the movie he set out to makeor that it was ultimately crafted by anyone outside a boardrooms worth of suits who crowded sweatily around an editing bay to offer their latest batch of notes aquaman and the lost kingdom is an empty cynical movie that sandwiches nearly every superhero movie cliché inside of two hours and then stuffs in plenty more from early 2000s sequels that likewise wanted to crowbar in feelgood family sitcomery think the mummy returns or the legend of zorro except those movies didnt write out the wifemother character its a parody of itself that never feels real the fact aquaman 2 must stand as the final word on the dceu is as dispiriting as it is appropriate the dceu began full of ambition and pretension imagining itself to be the american mythology of our times but was in such a hurry to get to those mythos that it disastrously threw batman wonder woman and even aquaman for half a second into its death of superman flick now living in the ruins of extinguished audience interest and a total absence of hype the lost kingdom attempts to be the most milquetoast middle of the road superhero film you might ever ever seen with absolutely no connection to the other parts of the dceu rumors suggest both michael keaton and ben affleck filmed cameos as batman for various incarnations of this thing and you can pretty easily figure out where they would have been slotted in at the end yet right down to its pitiful midcredits sequence gag aquaman 2 goes out of its way to live and die aloneto not tease one more second being spent in these toxic and corrosive waters its probably for the best because the dceu ship has sunk and despite his super powers aquaman simply gets to be the last one to gasp for breath before going under afterward all that is left is still and quiet
Dec 22 2023,positive,regardless of its merits or shortcomings there are some references to star wars and lord of the rings even with its messiness wans full imagination is at its finest when unleashed and his capacity to bring aquamans world to life can be spectacular 
Dec 22 2023,neutral,despite being reasonably entertaining it doesnt negate that aquaman and the lost kingdom is such a significant nothing burger of a blockbuster
Dec 22 2023,neutral, its christmas weekend and there are some new movies that you can check out hope madden and george wolf of maddwolf give us their takes on the newest releases 
Dec 22 2023,neutral, james wans aquaman and the lost kingdom is a minimum viable product plopped into the theater with an apathy as pervasive and allencompassing as the ocean itself despite being the successor to a film that got over with fans on the strengths of some big creative swings aquaman 2s job is to simply existthe last cynical hope of squeezing a few nickels out of the unsalvageable mess that is warner bross last decade of superhero movies theres some logic to the approach disconnected from having to exist as part of a larger universe the film keeps things nice and tidy demanding nothing of viewers despite some wild gesticulating toward the idea of arthur curry jason momoa as a broey husband and father to an adorable newborn aquaman and the lost kingdoms central concern is that black manta yahya abdulmateen ii still wants revenge for aquaman killing his father in the first film  in searching for some atlantean technology to give him an edge black manta comes across a black trident and a deposed sea king named kordax who grants black manta his power and technology in order to take his own revenge on atlantis after a botched theft leaves the underwater kingdom in ruins aquaman decides to take the fight to black manta but hell need help from his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson becausewell its not really clear why beyond giving momoa someone to play his bro shtick off of who isnt amber heard  just like the first film wilson acquits himself with a regal stoicism that feels like an act of defiance and he has good straightman chemistry with momoa that carries the stretch of aquaman and the lost kingdom where it turns into a buddy comedy adventure also of note is randall park who as a scientist who just wanted to find atlantis plays his characters complicity in black mantas crimes like hes auditioning for oppenheimer  for his part wan finds momentary pockets to crank the unhinged ocean weirdness of the first film up a notch particularly with a smart cephalopod sidekick and the gothic design of kordaxs city which suggests a waterlogged recreation of return of the kings minas morgul  but the game efforts of the cast including martin shorts brief stint as what can only be described as pansexual jabba the hutt are ultimately futile the hurried horseblinder construction of the filmhitting plot milestone after plot milestone as fast as humanly possible cohesion or depth be damnedmakes it come across like even wan cant wait for the whole thing to be over anything resembling substance or depth feels utterly vestigial as a result  while aquaman and the lost kingdoms underwater sections channel some of the first aquamans sense of weirdo spectacle the moments set on land that focus on arthur as a family man feel utterly disconnected from the feel look and plot of the rest of the film its a separation made more egregious by the fact that the visibility of heards meraarthurs wife and the mother of his child lest we forgetis virtually nonexistent until the plot absolutely cant function without her given that exploring arthurs relationship to his family above and below sea level is one of the things that made the first film unique if not engaging the meager lip service paid to everyone else in arthurs family unit aside from orm feels like willful neglect
Dec 22 2023,positive, for some of us theres a pinch of sadness baked into the new aquaman movie this marks the final film in what was once called the dc extended universe the dceu started incredibly strong and offered moviegoers with a healthy alternative to the lighter marvel formula sadly some poor studio decisions combined with dismissive reactions from many cut from the mcu cloth led to the superhero universes demise before it ever had the chance to fulfill its original vision james gunn has been hired to reboot the dc universe but who knows how thats going to turn out as it is aquaman and the lost kingdom clears the way for gunn in terms of expectations this is a movie that felt doomed from the start as critical pitchforks were already sharpened and torches prelit thats a shame because aquaman 2 is a hoot  a proudly wacky and over the top romp full of wild worldbuilding and cool action color me surprised james wan returns to direct following the massive box office success over 11 billion of the 2018 first film and of course jason momoa reprises his role as the rambunctious and reluctant king of atlantis arthur curry as the movie begins arthur has married mera amber heard and the two have a healthy baby boy arthur jr all is well in the world right well of course not first off being king of atlantis has proven to be a lot harder and more demanding than arthur expected in addition to his underwater peacekeeping and diplomatic duties theres also political turmoil between him and the atlantean council of bureaucrats he believes its past time they reveal themselves and form an alliance with the surface dwellers the cynical council is determined to keep their existence a secret but a bigger and far more deadlier challenge arises with the return of david kane yahya abdulmateen ii a ruthless highseas mercenary whose burning drive to avenge his fathers death has pushed him over the edge david has recruited dr stephen shin randall park a marine biologist obsessed with proving the existence of atlantis together they search for atlantean artifacts which david needs to repair and upgrade his black manta armor before he can take on aquaman while searching in the arctic david discovers the mysterious black trident a weapon of immense power that connects its wielder with its creator kordax pilou asbæk the ruler of the lost atlantean kingdom of necrus kordax pledges to provide david with the means to defeat aquaman in exchange for freeing him from his icy prison david and arthur inevitably clash fighting to a draw realizing david is more powerful than when they first met see the first film arthur seeks help from the last person he wants to ask his imprisoned halfbrother orm patrick wilson as the movie progresses we see wan dabbling in numerous genres nodding to several of his inspirations and just doing his own wild and crazy thing its a bit like what youd get if you rolled together a buddy comedy a creature feature and scifi fantasy certain moments will have you thinking its underwater star wars while later scenes give off distinct lord of the rings vibes and then theres wans own inventive worldbuilding from deepsea cities to a mutated volcanic island to a decayed kingdom buried under ice wan and his digital effects team have a field day creating fantastical places and populating them with a gonzo variety of life bouncing from one visually stunning location to the next turns out to be an absolute blast wans vision for aquaman 2 is often aweinspiring sometimes thrilling routinely funny and consistently entertaining the great comic chemistry between momoa and wilson provides some big laughs temuera morrisons return as arthurs father brings some heart the films selfawareness adds to the fun providing us with such patent silliness as loyal octopus sidekicks and dolph lundgren riding a seahorse its such a bonkers mix and i get that mileage may vary depending on your tastes but wan has mostly delivered beyond what i expected and even with some noticeable flaws aquaman 2 is a satisfying swan song for the late and sometimes great dceu i left that movie film with a feeling of sadness and an empty feeling that picture reminded me of what im missing so went straight to red lobster and got the fisherman platter got full its funny well over a month ago i told a friend of mine that it would get negative reviews it never had a chance as i wrote many had their pitchforks sharpened and their torches lit well before it came out  i just came from seeing it keith heck i like the character so i was gonna say i was glad to see it no matter what the good for me  the visuals the bad for me  the story the rippingoff of other movies and the tons of mythology casually tossed out to advance the action i have to believe if you i or any other movie lovers locked ourselves in a room for a couple of weeks we could have come up with a better more cohesive notsolazy storyline its a mess thats interesting i got a kick out of the story and while it certainly borrows from other movies i felt it had enough of its own wacky ideas and flavor to keep me onboard and i love its selfawareness  ill watch it eventually when i decide to complete the dceu though im dreading black adam though i did hear patrick wilson kind of steals the film a bit and allows his character to be funny and relaxed  more of him and less amber turd it seems that most people are skipping it i really enjoyed it especially on the big screen like you i enjoyed the first one this is a fun compliment to it
Dec 22 2023,negative, theres something oddly poetic about how the plot of aquaman and the lost kingdom revolves around a fallen empire gasping for its last shot at relevance its emblematic of the dc cinematic universe which lets be honest never really found its stride as the lost kingdom marks the final nail in the coffin before the new brass reboot it in 2025 you can sense the lack of urgency throughout aquaman 2 as its evident nobody really seemed interested in this project except for lead star jason momoa who is trying to inject some life into whats presumably his last time wielding the golden trident  on some level the lost kingdom is exactly what youd expect the script is pure nonsense theres several unfunny gags and it possesses the visual effect prowess of something youd play on the playstation 2 in 2004 so id suspect the dc completionists out there will more than likely get their fill which makes writing a review somewhat counterintuitive youre either going to see this movie or youre not i really doubt theres an inbetween still if you must know how i endured this twohour snooze fest please read on at your leisure  its crazy to think a year ago we were blessed with one of the most visceral and immersive moviegoing experiences of a generation with avatar the way of water a film that set the bar for how to film digital underwater sequences which it turns out involves filming scenes underwater what a concept you wont be shocked to know the lost kingdom didnt film its sequences underwater in fact im not sure they even shot them on land as half of the sludge could very well have been ai generated  perhaps the screenplay by david leslie johnsonmcgoldnicks also solicited some chatgpt for aid in the plotting considering the lost kingdom is a very busy movie its almost like director james wan knew this was the last straw and if he wanted to explore any untapped worlds or villains now was the time the vast expansive plot introduces a wide range of characters creatures political factions and even aquamans adorable offspring and then completely forgets about them in lieu of an eventual showdown with the films big baddie david kane yaya abdulmateen ii aka blank manta oh did you forget about him no worries the movie begins with one of those halfassed narrations that catches audiences up to speed because obviously were not going to remember what happened in the 2018 predecessor which may as well have been a halfcentury ago  mantra is out for vengeance after witnessing the newly anointed king of atlantis leave his father for dead and hell do whatever he can to achieve it including unearthing remnants of a hidden kingdom namely something called orichalcum a magical goo that more or less causes global warming mantra also discovers a black trident that causes him to be possessed by another baddie named necrus who was the leader of the fallen kingdom and needs someone to do their evil bidding you know bad guy stuff  this forces aquaman to team up with his imprisoned brother orm patrick wilson who is giving tom hanks in cast away when hes busted out but dont worry he gains muscles once reconnected with the water because thats just how it works in this universe you really feel for wilson throughout the movie as hes reduced to unspooling mountains of exposition and eating cockroaches for a laugh  all he does is grumble moan and then complain about being ousted for the throne by his halfbrother elsewhere amber heard despite having third billing says approximately three words during the whole thing and nicole kidman tries keeping a straight face while delivering lines like this could lead to total global annihilation shoutout to martin short for being the only watchable element in this trash heap voicing a fish pirate who crosses paths with aquaman midway through the movie  this all leads to lame superhero mashups with some of the worst needle drops in recent memory clearly they watched guardians of the galaxy a few too many times the lost kingdom is dull dark and tonally all over the place and even goes as far as to knock off iron man in the final moments sure theres statements involving climate change and it tries fostering a message of unity not to mention wans last minute desperation of throwing horror nods into the movie can be inspired but the lost kingdom ends this era of the dc universe where it was always destined to land rock bottom 
Dec 22 2023,negative,a superhero sequel without a soul or any kind of selfbelief aquaman 2 gives into the worst instincts of the dceu just as it bows out for good
Dec 22 2023,positive, after ten long years the dceu has finally come to a close with the premiere of aquaman and the lost kingdom but the longawaited sequel to the billiondollar blockbuster aquaman isnt interested in tying up the loose ends left behind by the flashs midcredit scenes or wonder woman 1984s unfinished trilogy instead james wans film is solely focused on bringing arthur currys jason momoa story to a heartfelt end  aquaman and the lost kingdom opens with a clever recap of the events preceding it as told by a beleaguered arthur who is balancing superhero duties kingly duties and fatherhood like a champ after dethroning his quarrelsome halfbrother orm patrick wilson in aquaman arthur and mera amber heard got married and had a baby named arthur jr or junior as they affectionately call him they seem to split their time between the ocean and the surface with arthur and his father tom temuera morrison providing a significant amount of care to the landlubber baby however the film does establish that the baby shares some of his fathers attributeseven if hes too young to make it beneath the sea  in addition to getting caught up with arthur and meras almost pictureperfect life aquaman and the lost kingdom quickly establishes that it fully intends to pay off the postcredit scene from aquaman dr shin randall park who seems perpetually stuck as the overeager sidekick in superhero franchises has been aiding and abetting david kanes yahya abdulmateen ii obsessive pursuit to find ancient technology that will help him kill aquaman once and for all in the first film arthur made an enemy out of kane when he killed his father prompting the younger mercenary to take up arms and become the vengeful black manta  the first act of aquaman and the lost kingdom can be a bit of a slog as it lays out all of the information that audiences need to know about the past and present world state part of this is due to the fact the filmwhich was originally slated to premiere last decemberis arriving five years after aquaman swam into theaters audiences have probably forgotten a lot of the finer details about arthurs story it also doesnt help that theres a sort of nihilistic emotion swirling around the film its the final film in the dceu and for a lot of people it doesnt really matter in a larger sense its not building to anything and thats what makes it great rather than getting bogged down in the big picture of the dceu this film is solely focused on its main character and those directly involved in his personal story this is why the second act where things really pick up for the film takes it from an okay film to a swimmingly good time  the growing situation with black manta finds arthur out of his depth as a leader and it pushes him to track down where orm is being held in prison orm might have bad blood with his halfbrother but arthur holds no ill will towards the man who was raised to hate his very existence through the forced proximity of their situation and orms time in isolation the brothers slowly begin to mend their fractured relationship which the film uses as a neat parallel to the actual big bad puppetting black mantas actions  when kane found the black trident buried within the melting ice caps he became possessed by the king of necrus pilou asbæk who quarreled with his brother king atlan vincent regan forged the black trident and drove his entire kingdom to ruin with his corrupted powers its a neat little parallel that arrives in the films second act and it ultimately pushes arthur and orms plot lines forward in a lot of compelling ways even in the first aquaman patrick wilsons performance was leagues beyond the performances of his peers but with the lost kingdom his skill as an actor is even more obvious by design orm is a man of few words where arthur is unrestrained loudmouthed and very brashorm is reserved thoughtful with his responses and very quiet while their dynamic works quite well with the buddycop styling of the sequel it also forces wilson to do a lot of subtle things with his performance  aquaman and the lost kingdom may be momoas final outing as arthur curry and thus the final chapter in the characters story but he undergoes the least amount of development from act 1 to act 3 whereas orm goes on an entire journey of understanding with a throughline running all the way back to the first film the plot forces him to reassess his preconceived notions about his halfbrother reconsider his feelings about the surface and humans and actively choose to be a better person whats remarkable is that so much of the development isnt necessarily there in the dialogue or even in the showy action sequences but it is all there in wilsons physical performance the best moments in fact are reserved for the little looks subtle smirks and understanding that wilson shows through his facial expressions  thats not to say that momoa isnt consistently great with arthur he has been one of the more enjoyable characters in the dceu despite his scattershot appearances but arthur curry is the lovable overly friendly dog that is just bound and determined to win over orms disinterested cat you can always count on momoa for bawdy laughs physical humor and the sweet bond he shares with morrisons tom  aquaman and the lost kingdom feels like the good old days of comic book movies david leslie johnsonmcgoldricks script consistently doles out corny jokes welltimed quips and humorous snark while delivering believable stakes heartfelt emotion and interpersonal conflict coupled with the thrilling action sequences and impressive vfx visualsthe film doesnt leave much to be desired the only thing that couldve made it better wouldve been a critics screening that wasnt in headacheinducing 3d  the dceu filmslike their mcu peershave struggled to find a consistent tone within the shared universe but both aquaman films have delivered the same level of quality in their storytelling and styling jason momoas arthur curry has always been largerthanlife using his bravado and drunken carousing to mask his insecurities with his dual identities as a human and atlantean arthur may not go on a profound or transformative journey in either movie but at least hes been consistently the same character when situations get difficult or tensions flare hes ready with a disarming grin a toss of his hair or a wellplaced pop culture reference that flies right over poor orms head 
Dec 22 2023,negative, thats the opening joke of aquaman and the lost kingdom which  depending on your level of loyalty to jason momoas title character  will either tickle your funny bone or fall flat as a flounder somewhere between the earnestly entertaining first film 2018 and this winkingandmugging sequel director james wan seems to have decided that an amphibious superhero with soundgardenlength hair wasnt funny enough on his own he has to crack wise too the film begins with a quick catchup aquaman has become king of atlantis  married queen mera a barely seen amber heard and had a baby named arthur jr cue the superheroinsuburbia jokes aquaman padding around in a bathrobe changing diapers at midnight and falling asleep on the throne its a proud moment for papa when the infant arthur communicates telepathically with a tankful of goldfish meanwhile melting ice caps have revealed a hidden trove of orichalcum  here envisioned as an ancient energysource with environmentally destructive possibilities  which falls into the hands of david kane yahya abdulmateen ii thank god for global warming says kane who blames aquaman for his fathers death and plans to exact revenge on all of humanity he has another weapon too a black trident that can awaken the zombie warriors of the kingdom of necrus what follows is a meandering story that reunites aquaman with the half brother he once imprisoned orm patrick wilson theres a jailbreak sequence in a desert a trek through a perilous jungle and a meeting with the corpulent crime boss kingfish the voice of martin short all of which feel pretty lifeless thanks to the stiff computer animation at least we get some passable buddycomedy moments between the brothers while momoas aquaman swaggers and joshes wilsons orm plays the uptight straight man  the charles grodin of the sea  and winds up providing the films few funny moments  the sidelining of heard  following if not directly related to a sordid court battle with exhusband johnny depp and a cruel fan petition against her  robs this film of romance and turns it into a bromance wan has said that was always the intention aquaman and the lost kingdom might have worked better though if it didnt work so hard to win us over
Dec 22 2023,negative, yikes it feels like theres a couple of missing words at the end of that title the lost kingdom ofsomething or other atlantis heaven spiders the crystal skull the planet of the apes fife but audience enthusiasm for comicbook future worldbuilding has been drained to an alltime low and whats left over quivering like a beached jellyfish is this unasked for and unwanted aquaman sequel delayed several times and finally hitting screens for xmas 2023 with the splatter of a seaweed pancake in time to slam the door firmly shut on the dceu the tide is turning says the pofaced poster for james wans aquaman 2 and its right after decades of inanity the tide is turning against these vapid tentpole comicbook movies and not a moment too soon we starts with one of these glib recaps which always do a great job of alienating casual viewers before the usual cgi slopfest begins arthur curry jason momoa has married mara a barelyinit amber heard and had a baby which pisses in his face several times in the light comedy segment of the opening being king all day isnt all its cracked up to be its all board meetings and politics  complains aquaman making you wonder why he bothers getting out of his watery scratcher to rule atlantis in the first place a few hackneyed needle drops from the 60s born to be wild spirit in the sky twice announce our main narrative which is something about randall park an orichalcum furnace which is causing climate change and black manta yahya abdulmateen ii who was seen off quickly in the first movie but like the reduced percentage of the audience is unwisely back for more lowenergy camp shenanigans free me from my prison and i will grant you the strength to avenge those who murdered your father is a good example of the cringehambone dialogue we get here you really dont want to hear dolph lundgren in a fishman wig talking about ultrasonic energy that disrupts the neurosystem and probably you dont need me to tell you why what is going on temuera morrison asks and im genuinely fked if i know this is worse than i could have possibly imagined says someone else my notes become less than clear after a certain amount of this subaquatic bilge aquaman eventually stops gabbing to his mom nicole kidman and shifts into gear hooking up with his brother orm patrick wilson to uncork an overflowing toilet of dumped exposition i will burn his kingdom to ass can arthur curry ever forget topo the drumplaying geneticallyengineered cephlopod and find true happiness who knows or cares barbenheimer condemned what remains of this genre to the binjuice of history and the sooner aquaman and his tiresome fishman pals drink up their productplaced pints of guinness and vacate the premises the better i need an extraction now someone says and thats how i felt after twenty minutes of this muck with the mcu and dcu firmly on the rocks its clear that audiences just liked batman spiderman and iron man and not much else really sticks momoa and wilson just about generate some marginal christmas panto charm together but aquaman 2 feels like the last gasp of something that died out with thanoss fancy glove its 2023 and it feels like weve all finally grown out of comic books and maybe thats all for the better just came from seeing it the visuals were great the actors really tried with what they were given and thats all the good for me the bad heaping piles of mythology tossed out to advance the storya story which was superlazy a ripoff of other movies at times and an overall mess i really believe if you i or any other movie lovers locked ourselves in a room for a couple of weeks we could have come up with a more compelling plot now i do not think it is the death of the cinema comic book superheroesbut were trending in a very bad direction to be sure i thought iron man 3 would be the significant downturn of the comic book movie but it breathed in new life showed that any film could be the best in a franchise but aquaman 2 was like an old sequel rehash the elements but no compelling reason to do so no real stamp of any kind of authorship no real vision i thought once marvel and dc cycled through their popular characters theyd run out of ideas but it took about a decade longer than i expected with multiverses as connected universes i cant see how any storyline in mcu or dcu can matter to anyone but fanboys anymore it really is time they stopped making these they must have made enough money by now i dont suppose youre allowed to dnf if you have to review the movie so i salute you for getting through it a crope from me thanks crope is the only appropriate response and this is close to a cgs and i liked the first one may have to knock a star off the original but this is 205 million dollars of bilge well that was a fun review no chance ill be watching this as the first one was more than enough seems like the comic book wave has truly peaked and these movies are just guttering out makes you wonder what the next big thing is going to be i do try and keep thing light and lively around here itll be two or three years before we get whatever product gets greenlighted post barbenheimer but its notable how quickly audience and press energy has turned the momentum around on the big franchise beasts i thought the first aquaman was passable but this stinks from the head down this demo site is only for

Dec 22 2023,negative,words i would use to describe aquaman and the lost kingdom random scattered busy pointless corny loquacious and tedious
Dec 22 2023,negative,an overproduced asinine anemic and underwhelming spectacle thats just disappointing as rebel moon part one  a child of fire perhaps it would work better as a video game rather than a movie
Dec 22 2023,positive, raise the curtains hit the lights strike up the band for the final night so sings the title character amid the action finale of anna and the apocalypse arguing that  even as humanity nears extinction amid a zombie outbreak  fighting the good fight is still worth it even in the face of inevitable defeat james wan would probably agree clearly unwilling to go quietly into that dark knight as he raises the curtain and lights the lights theres no raging at the dying of the light to be found in this cheerfully spectacular visually astonishing geewhiz pulpy action fantasy but if this is dc films time to go aquaman and the lost kingdom gives us one hell of a show  the lost kingdom is set four years after halfhumanhalfatlantean arthur curry jason momoa took the throne of atlantis by force to stop his halfbrother patrick wilson from destroying the surface world leadership has become a drag on the novice king with those who sympathized with the kill the land animals to save the sea sentiment refusing to accept currys idea to reveal themselves to the world being king isnt so fun when youre not really a dictator is it  that it flirts with the notion of superheroes helping to solve realworld macroproblems as opposed to just the latest worldending supervillain threat makes it an ironic series finale to both the dc films franchise and the notion of dcmarvel movies as uncontested pop culture titans aquaman and the lost kingdom wont save dc films the superhero genre or warner bros discovery from their latest issues but its a relentlessly endearing and eyepopping imaxworthy spectacle once upon a time that was enough for wellearned fortune and glory  its really frustrating how the press and internet in general is going about this movie yeah theres quite a lot to say about everything around it but its gotten to a point where most people just cant talk aquaman 2 without bringing up either the amber heard controversy warner bros and dcs past box office flops or comparing the movie to the marvels in terms of how itll do at the box office also are we just gonna start comparing every bigbudget movie to the marvels now yes that film was a massive flop but not every comicbook movie or just movie that comes out afterwards is going to suffer the same fate 
Dec 22 2023,positive, jason mamoa returns for possibly the last time as the aquatic dc superhero in aquaman and the lost kingdom theres over 200 million worth of eye candy in the story of our heros attempt to save the world from black manta and global warmingand about 5 worth of originality in the screenplay its a merely adequate aquatic adventure emma stone gives an oscar caliber performance in the bizarre horror comedy poor things a feminist rethinking of the themes from frankenstein its bold original visually spectacular and very disturbing with irreverent adult content that barely misses an nc17 rating for openminded audiences its a playfully nutty experience the iron claw is one unique bird an arthouse pro wrestling drama zac efron leads the cast in the true story of the von erich clan a family of grapplers who experienced more than their share of triumphs and tragedies its edgy tone may be grating to some viewers but its surprisingly empathetic file the animated comedy migration under the pleasant surprises category the makers of the minions movies offer a tale about a family of ducks that encounters many dangers when they decide to fly off to jamaica its a witty imaginative and fastmoving family feature take a star wars movie remove the sense of humor and adventurous fun and you might have something that looks like the netflix space opus rebel moon zack snyders dreary and derivative scifi flick is sad to say the first in a trilogy it delivers the action and visuals but its a bloated and humdrum drama
Dec 22 2023,negative, about halfway through aquaman and the lost kingdom i realized reviewing this movie would be a chore not because the movie is bad it is or because it was complicated it isnt it simply dawned on me that i wasnt retaining a single goddamn thing about it gibberish fantasy words dissipated in my temporal lobe profound character moments fell lifeless and limp onto the floor of the imax theatre failing the jump from screen to my heart the closest thing to arousal was the constant invocation by characters about an ancient substance called orichalcum emphasis constantly on the cum nothing mattered nothing stuck this doesnt put it far off from the first aquaman except for the fact that lost kingdom also has all the hallmarks of this late stage in the superhero era of cinema culture  shittier special effects horrifically spliced reshoots and a story no one seemed all that committed to telling james wan returned to the directors chair a decision that shackled him to the prolapsed production for almost three years and constant reshoots it will always be a mystery what story inspired him to take the job in the first place because its pretty clear any artistic intention at the outset was diluted and destroyed by the finished product the movie picks up a couple years after the first film arthur curry aka aquaman jason momoa is now the king of atlantis and extremely bad at his job he still lives on the surface with his dad tom temuera morrison and his son lil baby arthur jr arthurs wife mera amber heard hangs out with them sometimes depending on whether they could cut around the actress in the editing room arthur likes to spend his days drinking guinness with his dad and avoiding work whenever hes forced to swim down to atlantis its clear he has zero aptitude for leadership trouble starts brewing when his nemesis black manta yahya abdulmateen ii becomes empowered by the long lost black trident and sets out to ruin our heros life aquaman is forced to rescue his previously villainous brother orm patrick wilson to take down their now mutual foe most of the beats are just traditional sequel stuff the former villain is redeemed the classic villain is given a power up the hero reverts a little bit to struggle with responsibilities he won in the first film lost kingdoms main problem is that none of these characters were ones anyone left the first movie particularly attached to and nothing they do here gives them further dimension or weight wan once again spends a vast amount of creative effort building his undersea kingdoms of which there are still a halfdozen for some convoluted reason but all the visualeffects and concept artists in the world are meaningless when the humans grounding the story are this bland and unremarkable reshoots are a major part of a films production cycle and the explosion of their use in franchise films  as well as the reporting on such reshoots  has made the practice noteworthy to the audience at large when it was previously just part and parcel marvel has usually merged its extra footage with new material fairly seamlessly in some films better than in others warner brothers and dc have always had more trouble with theirs  take a gander at ben affleck in the joss whedon cut of justice league for instance  but lost kingdom takes the cake entire sequences are clearly shot in front of very very poor greenscreen a decent amount of the dialogue has clearly been added in later over wide shots of characters whose mouths you cant see and even arthur jr is recast halfway through the film with a child who looks nothing like the one we meet at the start of the film that last one is truly the most bizarre to me frankly even referring to lost kingdom as finished is generous someone once said a book is never finished only abandoned that rather adequately describes this one except instead of putting it in the safe haven box warner brothers shouldve just tossed it in the ocean
