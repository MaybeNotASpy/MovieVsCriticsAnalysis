Jul 26 2023,positive,at its core caros mulan is quietly revolutionary as it revels in the exhilarating sight of a young woman fighting for and earning her place in the world
Jul 24 2023,neutral, synopsis when the emperor of china issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the imperial army to defend the country from northern invaders hua mulan liu yifei the eldest daughter of an honored warrior steps in to take the place of her ailing father masquerading as a man hua jun she is tested every step of the way and must harness her innerstrength and embrace her true potential it is an epic journey that will transform her into an honored warrior and earn her the respect of a grateful nation and a proud father as you might now this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 list here ive at least liked almost every remake disney has delivered so far so i was incredibly excited that 1998s mulan was getting the same treatment niki caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love a more realistic take on the chinese tale one that removes all songs and fanfavorite characters like mushu which instantly impacted expectations varying tremendously from person to person people who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged however to everyone who complained about disney copying their original ip mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio i cant deny it i feel extremely disappointed in my review of the original movie i mention how epic and cinematic it feels it was one of the aspects i looked forward to the most in this new version despite the beautiful set design and some paintinglike shots this is the first time a disneys liveaction remake loses to its original regarding its visuals the 2d animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect theres only one shot in the entire remake that i would put in the original and i bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant the action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed except for a few great war moments most action scenes are packed with excessive cgi a badly employed hfr high frame rate and overediting  in fact the editing david coulson is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative from characterdefining moments to simple connections between scenes it feels like the film is hiding something i constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straightup removes these moments without replacing them with something else even in chronological terms its clumsily put together jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another finally as my last remark on the technical aspects harry gregsonwilliams score is partially also a letdown like the rest of the movie there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes especially reflection i had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because i believed harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that i would definitely enjoy however mulans score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that i was looking forward to so much i didnt get chills during the entire film it didnt transform any big character moments maybe watching it on imax instead of at home might improve my opinion but i doubt that storywise its a mixed bag for me niki caro promised a more realistic take totally different from the original and she undoubtedly accomplished that this is the furthest from the original any disney remake has been by far from the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative mulan is more faithful to the original chinese tale than the 1998s flick but that doesnt mean its better much on the contrary the essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective which some people will find hard to accept especially hardcore fans of the original movie however i do believe that hua mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death her love and devotion to her family who she wants to honor hua mulan doesnt want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes this is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation this is the main difference characterwise but one that doesnt affect the nature of the original however it impacts the remake itself while all of this sounds amazing mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else distancing her more from people than actually embracing her like i already mentioned above this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows i do welcome every change made including the removal of mushu crikee and all of the singing however if somethings removed something else has to replace it in some shape or form once again i have mixed feelings some additions like the introduction of chi and the witch xian lang gong li are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime the vital energy force is connected to my issue with the be yourself message while the character not only follows a predictable arc but it diminishes bori khans jason scott lee menacing presence the ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well not only the climactic fight between hua mulan and bori khan fails to live up to expectations but its executed in a visually disheartening fashion i expected this remake to feel grand magnificent epic and cinematic just like its original or even better its far from that the acting could also be better liu yifei is fantastic as hua mulan yoson an offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of chen honghui and the actors who portray yao chen tang ling jimmy wong and chienpo doua moua are also amusing however donnie yeng as commander tung and jet li as the emperor are embarrassingly bland while jason scott lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain but hes not able to shine
Jul 20 2023,negative, the new mulans predecessor is one of the most beloved animated movies during the disney renaissance era the musical numbers and the fun and charming characters are just two of the many reasons why mulan 1998 is a fan favorite while disneys new liveaction remake directed by niki caro follows the same basic plot there are a few changes made to the plot and the character arcs namely the titular character herself disneys mulan 2020 follows the story of a young chinese woman who disguises herself as a man to join the war and become a warrior she is outspoken and wants to challenge the traditional roles set for women from an early age in this remake the writers introduce a concept for a lifeforce chi that makes mulan special and extraordinary compared to the other girls in her village her father advises her that it is best to hide her powers so that it would be easier for the matchmaker to find a suitable husband and bear children the new liveaction remake takes a big risk in eliminating some of the incredible elements of the original animated feature the remake does not have any of the memorable musical numbers but instead uses instrumental scores to bring nostalgic feelings instead of the beloved mushu we are introduced to a phoenix that shows mulan the way throughout the entire film that character seems very unnecessary and serves no purpose to the plot instead of shan yu the main villain in mulan 1998 the liveaction remake has two villains bori khan and xianniang a massive difference in the animated feature and the liveaction remake is the character arc of mulan this is not the first time that disney has made a few changes to the plot and character in the previous disney liveaction remakes but what makes this a massive mistake is that mulan is written as a character that displays her strength through her braveness cleverness and determination this version of mulan tends to stray away from the core values of the predecessor introducing the concept of a lifeforce does not enable her to learn with the other characters her main conflict is not her hidden identity but not using her powers she is a natural fighter a woman with godgiven gifts these gifts make her more capable than the other men in her training camp in the animated feature mulans journey is what makes her character unique her inability to accept femininity nor masculinity is an aspect that is explored in her arc mulans quickthinking and bravery show that she stands out from the rest of the group she does not need to engage in hypermasculinity to solve her problems she finds solutions to them by using her cleverness not violence this is where her core value and strength lies in the training camp mulan does not engage with hypermasculinity she does not engage with masculinity and femininity she knows that through using her strength which is her determination and cleverness she can achieve her goals and she does mulan learns that there is a higher value outside of the hypermasculine way of thinking mulans core values are what drives her character arc while learning to accept her true strength empower femininity and reject hypermasculinity she teaches her friends to engage in her good characteristics as well unlike her liveaction version mulan does not use a lifeforce to harness power and strength those values are traditionally considered by men but mulan accomplishes it regardless of her gender expression for the plot to move forward the character must learn new lessons from the supporting characters without that element the characters journey has no purpose in the animated feature mulan meets three friends who engage in hypermasculinity they are not problemsolvers like mulan but use their brute strength to try and achieve their goals when mulan and her friends reach the imperial city to save the emperor her male friends who at the beginning of the film engaged in hypermasculinity later demonstrate femininity by dressing up as concubines to save the emperor they learn that there is value in femininity the characters are learning from each other the statement here is that by embracing both femininity and masculinity it works in their favor the characters learn that there are no limitations to gender expression the disney remake does not follow any of the core values that are set in the animated feature one of them is mulans internal conflict of whether or not embracing her lifeforce would bring dishonour to her family her true identity is not challenged in this movie her power makes her as capable as and perhaps even stronger than the others in the training camp what makes her strong is her lifeforce and not her gender expression this is where the movie gets it wrong mulan does not learn to reject hypermasculinity or learn from her friends her lifeforce is what stands in the way of the characters growth introducing the character as someone who is naturally gifted and knows everything makes mulan bland and uninteresting in the animated feature mulan is not naturally gifted with a lifeforce mulan is clumsy tomboyish and funny using her cleverness and determination as a character she learns to improvise when she is in front of dangerous situations she does not use hypermasculine traits to win a fight the new mulan has a very different personality and character traits the liveaction version of mulan starts as a superhero her journey is not about empowering femininity or rejecting hypermasculinity because her internal conflict is about her lifeforce her struggle to accept her new identity overpowers everything else about mulans core values it holds her back from reaching out to her other characters disneys remake of mulan misses on a lot of the traits from the animated feature introducing a lifeforce completely avoids character growth and does not discuss the value of gender expression when her real identity is revealed she is expelled from the army and returns home again the problem here is that mulan was more focused on her powers and not her true identity it fails to recapture mulans essential character traits and instead diverges away from them entirely there is no emotional growth between mulan and her father or between any of the characters in the film it tries to follow a more conventional story of mulan while rejecting the core values from the animated feature it is safe to say that disney made a huge risk by making this movie the critical differences in the movie change a lot of mulans character traits and it is evident that the writers missed the opportunity to make her special
May 27 2023,negative, as disney brings back the little mermaid for a new audience via a liveaction remake its worth going back and looking at the films that came before it in 2010 disney kicked off a new era of regular liveaction adaptations films that either reimagine or completely trace over the timeless animated classics from where they come from while we only deal with films that have come out postalice in wonderland all apologies to the 1990s 101 dalmatians and dont include sequels or spinoffs 2021s cruella wont count we do have 13 films to take a look at that hem pretty close to the films that theyre adapted from there are a lot of things you can say about the 2019 lion king but its just not worth much analysis past the point of saying that its one of the worst studio films of the 2010s its the film on this list most guilty for pointlessness it does just about everything wrong from its lifeless character renderings to its absolute refusal to do anything even remotely different from its predecessor its a twohour shrug created purely to pad disneys bank account a film that has absolutely no respect for the audience because they knew folks would just show up to watch this no matter how bad it was the lion king 2019 is disney at its worst a soulless carbon copy of a vastly superior film that exists only to pander to nostalgia and reap financial benefit jon favreau is just a much better filmmaker than however this turned out this ghastly adaptation of the 1990s landmark original feels like it deflates anything grand or witty out of some of the most impressive animated filmmaking of all time its not to say emma watson does anything wrong as belle but shes trapped in a movie that feels more like cheap imitation than it ever should the remake completely renders itself useless with its shotty visual effects and its complete lack of thematic style the be our guest sequence zaps all the goosebumps you get from the original and the films complete and utter lack of understanding about how the gaston character functions undercuts the originals most stunning music number the aptly named gaston this film is a careless exercise in capital gain it mines a true cinema classic for commercial value and leaves nothing artistic in its wake its an overwrought hodgepodge of tonal inconsistency and weighed down by whatever in the world burton is having johnny depp do as the mad hatter its not the worst film on this list by any stretch but it does feel like a product of its time its a disney film so obsessed with the 3d boom that it forgot to make anything meaningful out of its exaggerated visuals disney had to send this mulan adaptation home during the pandemic and it certainly was not worth the outrageous price it wouldve cost folks to watch it the film zaps the fun out of the 1990s smash hit including those catchy songs making this the rare liveaction remake that actually couldve benefitted from leaning heavier on the nostalgia while there is commendable production design within the film feels joyless for much of its runtime and concludes with an incredibly weak third act that lacks the visual splendor of the 90s films fireworksdriven finale its not bad enough to make you want to head for the aisles but its not good enough to not have robin williams voice in your ears for the entire runtime telling you to just go home and watch the original will smith tries his best for his genie to be its own thing but the williams performance is towering for a reason this film packs in far too many extraneous details but its not quite as aimless as it couldve been with a lessor filmmaker than guy ritchie it plays like the most expensive disney channel original movie of all time its not as cinematic as it is ready to stream some of the films higher up on this list deserved a theater slot much more than this one angelina jolies impressively spiteful performance as maleficent keeps this film from veering into pointless territory as disney respun sleeping beauty into a more sympathetic telling for its villain while the film can fall victim to an overuse of cgi and isnt nearly as strong when jolie isnt on the screen it is a film on this list that aggressively tries to stand apart from what came before it the film cant replicate the original films gorgeous animation and crushing baby mine sequence but it does add to the story and still capture the same yearning that the titular elephant feels as an outcast removed from his mother burton finds plenty to work with in the circus themes even if the film can stretch itself a bit too thin with the expanded plot however a talented director like burton can find bring some real theatrics that some of these other films sorely lack while this dumbo only flies so high it never feels like it lacks for imagination its not to say this film eclipses the 1955 classic but its far more tolerable in its reimagining than most of the titles on this list its a simpler story to adapt and movies about dogs are scientifically designed to make dog people get all in their feelings and such tessa thompson does some endearing voice work as lady and the talking animal sections are thankfully a step above your average air buddies movie even if theyre still a bit silly and awkward to watch its hard for these films to justify their existences but this one is perfectly fine for what it is its sweet enough to work and dogs are great so thats always a plus while no pinocchio film will ever top the original disney classic this one has some genuinely inspired bits that diverge from the 1940s film in some visually inventive ways it also has a cuckoo clock inspired by who framed roger rabbit you cant say that about the lion king the problem with some of the movies on this list is that they feel like boring carbon copies of what came before them for what you can critique about zemeckis wacky vision you cant accuse him of laziness this film has a weird streak to it and its heightened by tom hanks being very willing to just do whatever with his geppetto its not a bad time the voice cast carries this one and child actor neel sethi makes for a great mowgli like most of the films on this list this one is always held back by a movie thats much better than it existing in the ether however its hard to find a disney liveaction remake thats this agreeable to watch favreau finds enough of a buffer between the original and his film to provide some new sparks of adventure and impressive visuals the flying to neverland sequence the lowery signature touch of visual inventiveness its just a major step in the right direction if these films start to feel like theyre actively made by filmmakers instead of crafted in a lab designed for audience comfort and nostalgia even if this film cant fully escape its streaming budget lowery still manages to make a story thats been told plenty of times feel fresh cinderella is the rare film on this list that might improve some aspects of the original film if only because cate blanchetts wicked stepmother is such a scene stealer lily james is also fantastic as cinderella and this film has much less mice antics the original film is a stunner but some of the tom and jerry aspects of it havent quite aged as well branagh sticks a bit more with the regality of it all and hes just too competent behind the camera to ever make this feel perfunctory nobody is going to say that this film tops the original but you can at least feel like youre getting as fresh of an experience as you can with a wellworn tale david lowery taking on a remake of petes dragon at the height of his creative achievement was always a curious choice but he just nailed this delightful adaptation that transcends the 1970s original lowery has two films ranked high on this list and its fascinating that hes chosen two disney projects such as this while also making prolific a24 art films like a ghost story and the green knight it also helps to have an alltime presence like robert redford floating in and out of frame to melt your heart and the cg on the titular dragon is more impressive than any of the animals in the lion king petes dragon is the standard for any liveaction disney remake because its one of the only films on this list that actually feels like it absolutely should exist
Nov 8 2022,negative,navigates through different terrains and attempts to cross a few borders sometimes it does so successfully and sometimes it doesnt full review in spanish
Aug 24 2022,positive, if youre wondering how the new mulan stacks up against its animated predecessor or even the more recent disney liveaction remakes this might not be the review youre looking for full disclosure ive never seen the original 1998 animated feature and i havent watched any of the latest notsowarmly received liveaction reheats but i have seen disneys new 200 million mulan you know the 30 stream at home version and guess what  its not bad is it worth the high price tag to watch right now ill let you decide mulan comes from director niki caro and the writing team of rick jaffa amanda silver elizabeth martin and lauren hynek their retelling of this inspirational tale aims at capturing the spirit of the original animated film while also making meaningful choices that set their version apart the way it sounds the more recent liveaction remakes went to great lengths to follow their originals mulan 2020 attempts to carve its own identity with a more realistic vision no songs and no celebrityvoiced comic sidekick the results arent perfect but theyre pretty darned impressive liu yifei plays mulan the spirited eldest daughter of honored war veteran hua zhou tzi ma the two have a loving bond with the father aware that there is something special about his daughter but his deep devotion to archaic traditions leaves mulan bound by the expectations of her family village and culture a daughter brings honor through marriage hua zhou lectures your job is to bring honor to the family yet in this world of honor through marriage she cant even choose her own husband meanwhile on the outskirts of the empire a warlord with a grudge named böri khan jason scott lee begins attacking imperial garrisons lee is a striking presence with the look and the snarl of a menacing villain unfortunately hes the victim of an alltoofamiliar problem in modern blockbusters  bad guys with hardly any depth and the barest motivations basically böri khan sets out to quench his thirst for revenge by killing the emperor and becoming the new ruler of the kingdom not the most original crusade but he and his soldiers sure look cool carrying it out with the attacks intensifying the emperor played with stoic distinction by jet li calls for one male member of every family to join the fight to quell the enemy invasion hua zhou the lone male in their family prepares to join the war effort despite his failing health knowing her fathers chances of survival are slim mulan takes his sword and armor and sneaks away posing as his son and joining the fifth battalion led by esteemed commander tung played by chinese screen legend donnie yen its her first venture into the maledominated world and if her ruse is discovered shell have more to worry about than shame and dishonor the bulk of the films second act concentrates on the training of the young soldiers mulan is easily the most skilled warrior in her regiment but showing her abilities would draw too much attention and risk exposing her secret therefore much of this segment is spent with mulan concealing her identity from the other recruits especially the curious and charismatic chen yoson an whats missing is the emotional toil there is certainly an interesting thematic conflict between loyalty to duty and embracing ones true self but we rarely see mulan wrestling with it on an emotional level we get a few of those scenes and they work really well we just get too few of them from there the film moves to an actionfilled final third surprisingly mulan never quite reaches the scale i was expecting this could be due to misguided expectations on my part but the film isnt a huge sprawling epic it has all the dressings but when it comes to the action the films snappy pace never keeps it in one place for too long for that reason some of the action scenes are unexpectedly short and tame perhaps the result of being a disney property but that doesnt mean there arent stunning images throughout mulan caro and her dp mandy walker shoot some exquisite shots both when filming the diverse landscapes or capturing the gravitydefying fight sequences one showdown set inside a tight hallway is shot with incredible style and energy another fight through some bamboo scaffolding features several ingenious camera tricks and wonderful framing at the same time oscar winner grant majors production design and bina daigelers costumes add something interesting to every composition castwise liu yifei shows nice range moving from a rambunctious rebel by nature to a battleready warrior exemplifying courage and leadership she does good with what emotional material shes given and her physicality is unquestioned donnie yen and jet li are great presences but get little opportunity to show the martial arts prowess what made them such stars perhaps the most compelling character is an exiled sorceress named xianniang li gong shes a servant and weapon of böri khan who doesnt take kindly to being called a witch there are hints of a rich and thoughtful backstory but sadly all we get are crumbs  fleeting references to a pained past that i would love to have known more about i can see mulan pulling people in a variety of directions lovers of the animated original may take issue with some of its creative choices those looking forward to its more realistic spin may find it too restrained and safe for me the films strengths definitely outweigh its shortcomings mulan pulls us into a vibrant and fascinating world while telling a story full of inspiration and relevance at the same time i found myself constantly wanting it to go further did being a disney property hold it back were my expectations out of whack im not sure so i end up still unable to tell you if the movie is worth the 30 price tag once again ill let you decide mulan is now available exclusively on disney one of the biggest complaints about this film ive been hearing is about mulans magical chi powers which apparently give her far less obstacles to conquer in the story particularly when shes first starting out in the warrior camp therefore stripping her of any relatability or real character progression any thoughts on that i didnt really have an issue with that mainly because the chi powers were so vaguely discussed i felt hers was deeply tied to her character who was energetic outgoing even rebellious so she nurtured her chi powers where someone more reserved or traditional wouldnt not sure if that makes sense but thats kinda how i perceived it whoops i meant one of the biggest complaints ive been hearing about this film not one of the biggest complaints about this film ive been hearing lol sorry about that by the way when are you going to see im thinking of ending things the new charlie kaufman movie and a muchdiscussed one too and feels good man an excellent documentary about of all things pepe the frog theyre both pretty fresh on peoples minds at the moment and i think theyre wellworth checking out actually i never got the notification about your question actually been working on my review for ending things tough movie to talk about without spoiling still havent seen feels good man hope to before the end of the week i would really like to see this havent seen the cartoon version but not subscribing to disney nor paying on top too one day it will be on bluray so that will have to do  im not comfortable recommending to anyone that they absolutely should pay 30 to watch it now i liked it but its not without its flaws while i cant say that i flat out hated the movie i felt that it was a missed opportunity  dont get me wrong the cinematography is fantastic and some of the action is okay but this new mulan felt like much weaker version of crouching tiger hidden dragon  to me a lot of the characters felt flat and i dont think that yifei liu was the right person for the role  donnie yen was great but i hated what they did with jet li  for 30 bucks this movies not worth it  it really isnt especially since youre not getting the full theatrical experience which is one of the reasons why i didnt care for it  i would recommend 2009s mulan rise of a warrior instead  i think that film is a much better interpretation of the original 6th century poem i can see where youre coming from many of our issues come from the same places more attention could have been given to several characters and their storylines i actually liked liu but wish they would have given her more to emotionally wrestle with my only interest in seeing this film is gong li  i just love watching her in films and to see in a big project like this is cool though im aware that shes not given much to do  id probably check it out when it is available for disney members who already pay the monthly fee  besides i was watching moana as its my nephews favorite film nope no eddie murphy voiced dragons in this one but i would be really interested to hear your take on it as a big fan of the animated film i thought that this was a fine adaptation they do a nice job making it more serious than the animated one  the cinematography is amazing but the characters just arent developed well enough and things feel too glossed over
Aug 17 2022,positive, it wasnt by choice  my day job finally pulled the plug on my weekly indulgence and it wasnt unexpected but it did happen quickly  i received word literally as i was writing my review of birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one harley quinn my last review it turns out the move didnt put me out of work and i had a bunch of travel planned so rather than immediately put out feelers to editors and outlets id freelanced for before i decided to take a break and think about what i wanted to write about and how i wanted to contribute to the larger film conversation no one wants or needs to read my take on bad boys iii for example then the coronavirus happened and the economic recession that came with it and i wasnt the only film critic out of a gig plus all those trips got canceled in the meantime inspired by the 52filmsbywomen and femalefilmmakerfriday pledgeshashtags i came up with a concept for a monthly column focused on films directed by women the idea is to anchor a roundup of reviews with a major new release such this months mulan directed by niki caro plus additional titles both recent and classic documentary and international feature and short with an eye toward diversity  one for each friday so four or five per month then a year from now therell be a list of sorts of fiftytwo films directed by women  im a sucker for a good list but also whos counting this is the structure im going to play with for now  im not sure how well it will work with movie release dates and embargos with no deadlines or editors im going to give myself permission to experiment i also didnt plan on writing this intro  i didnt want to make any promises i may not end up keeping  but then i thought itd help to explain what the heck im trying to do here still the ambition and scale of mulan sing through in this nonmusical adaptation that adheres to the animated movies version of the chinese folklore the ballad of mulan in both broad plot and fine detail  with a couple of key changes to the aesthetic and spirit of the story hua mulan liu yifei is a lively child with strong chi theres just one problem shes a girl and in the patriarchal society of ancient china girls bring honor to their families by marrying like frozens elsa shes advised to hide her gift but when the emperor orders one male from each family to join the imperial army to defend against northern invaders mulan ties up her hair and binds her breasts and slips away with her injured fathers armor and sword to enroll so he doesnt have to along the way shes guided not by mushu the beloved diminutive dragon of the cartoon but a technicolor kitelike phoenix that may or may not be visible only to her but the most significant diversion of this mulan is with this chi business  our warrioress proves her mettle on the battlefield not only by being clever but by wielding magic too which undermines the everywoman quality of the animated mulan she cant unleash her full power however until she fulfills all three qualities inscribed on her blade loyal brave and true another woman with chi the witch xian lang gong li in fabulous makeup and regalia on the other side of the fight teaches her this and its not until mulans mane is freed like hair in a shampoo commercial that she realizes her full potential if it werent for mulans chi however we wouldnt get the preternatural stunts that recall though dont match crouching tiger hidden dragon captured with dynamic choreography and camerawork meanwhile all of this unspools against stunning backdrops of otherworldly landscapes and richly ornate production design from mulans villageintheround to the grand imperial palace the very first note i scribbled while watching mulan was about whale rider the similarities to director niki caros first film are immediately evident and persistent and not just because mulan wields a fighting stick in that films opening scene a girl in a patriarchal society demonstrates a proclivity for her societys warrior culture but is prohibited from expressing it because of her gender she secretly pursues it anyway ultimately emerging the hero in the case of whale rider that heroine is paikea keisha castlehughes at the time the youngestever nominee for a best actress oscar the firstborn child of the firstborn son of a māori village leader with no male heirs in sight pais grandfather koro rawiri paratene opens a school to find a candidate among the local boys  a motley bunch who pale in comparison to pais innate talent dedication and reverence for their culture a sweet sensitive girl still pai cannot help herself and seeks to train on the sly with her slacker uncle rawiri grant roa with the support of her grandmother vicky haughton when koro fails to find a suitable successor he wallows in his failure echoed by his discovery of a pod of beached whales its only pai who can coax them back to sea earning her place at the head of the tribe caro had about 157th the budget for whale rider as for her latest film so logistics such as how for example pai gets a leviathan turned around in the sand get glossed over a white new zealander caro does not share a culture with the characters in either film but with whale rider she did build the framework as the goto director for feminist comingofagers google best films by women and youll find a couple of lists with claire deniss beau travail near the top yet the film has been unavailable on physical media or online  at least as far as i could find  until this month janus films has released a stunning 4k digital restoration of the tone poem loosely based on herman melvilles billy budd featuring music from benjamin brittens opera also based on the novella denis has set her examination of masculinity among a small troop of french legionnaires stationed in djibouti our narrator is galoup denis lavant a sergeant with a napoleon complex who is reflecting on the events that it turns out ended his career what there is of a story unfolds in a haze of memory and boredom as the men perform domestic chores like laundry and miserable labor such as roadbuilding and repetitive ritualistic training thats reminiscent of leni riefenstahls olympia in its celebration of the human form though definitely not its politics into this hotbed of male bonding and repressed desire arrives gilles sentain grégoire colin a handsome popular legionnaire whom galoup vows to destroy out of irrational jealousy and perhaps attraction tapping also into the theme of african colonialism that is characteristic of her oeuvre denis has crafted a psychological portrait as exquisite and harsh as the east african landscape so gorgeously captured by cinematographer agnès godard dawn porter is having a busy year the documentarian behind trapped and gideons army has two new films coming out this year john lewis good trouble which premiered in july just a couple of weeks before the civil rights icons death and the way i see it about obama white house photographer pete souza later this month i cant talk about the latter film yet embargos  gah but good trouble hits digitaldvd as well as cnn this month with an intimate portrait of the politician and activist rip the documentary covers a lot of the same territory as lewiss graphic novels march though the story about how he developed his oratory skills by preaching to his chickens always plays and the film struggles with pacing  spending too much time on a freedom singers performance and too little on lewiss wife but its arresting to watch some of the rare archival footage  even more so to watch lewis watch it for the first time himself  of how he and his fellow protestors prepared for the lunchcounter sitins and then how they unfolded as well as his triumphant though censored appearance at the march on washington and the awful events that took place on the edmund pettus bridge in selma alabama its even more affecting to

Feb 18 2022,positive, the disney liveaction adaptations have been a mixed back since the initial streak of releases began in 2010 despite three releases in the 90s including the jungle book 101 dalmatians and 102 dalmatians it was not until the 2010s that disneys adaptations of their animated classics became a focal point of the studios annual releases  after the soulless shotforshot liveaction adaptation of the 2019s the lion king it was hard to imagine the studio attempting an original look at their animated film library mulan is a fresh take on prior beloved releases growing up while disney purists will likely scream and complain on social media about the 1998 animated film changes i enjoyed this new take of the story  rather than doing a carbon copy similar to the lion king which failed miserably mulan is a fresh reimagining that retains the essence of mulans character from the animated film while making sure that the liveaction adaptation adds a layer of originality missing from other adaptations mulans premise follows most of the animated films main plot with hua mulan yifei liu someone who doesnt quite fit in the expectations of women at the time and of her village leading to her mother hua li rosalind chao becoming embarrassed continuously by her daughters behavior simultaneously her decorated war veteran father hua zhou tzi ma seems to take pride in mulans lively spirit as war is imminent and chinas fate is on the line the emperor decrees one man from every family must join the imperial army and defend the empire from the northern invaders despite his ailing health zhou steps forward to offer to fight for the emperor ultimately leading to mulan secretly taking her fathers sword and armor and disguising herself as a man named jun to take zhous place in the imperial army for fans of the muchloved 1998 animated film disappointment will be on full display as the original elements have been removed this concept is one of my favorite aspects of the film rather than a carbon copy of the animated film director niki caro created a war epic where there was little room for mushu voiced by eddie murphy mulans love interest li shang and musical numbers this allowed caro and the company to focus on mulans character development rather than being tied down to a homage to its animated predecessor mulan strived to be more than a ripoff but present a narrative more rooted in the mythology of both its titular star and imperial china while striving and succeeding in creating a new take on the story caro does sprinkle references to connect this remake to its animated counterpart including harry gregsonwilliams musical ques in his score paying homage to the classic matthew wilder and david zippel song reflection outside of removing certain characters and music caros most significant change is mulans connection to qi or chi this force has been linked to the strongest warriors by chinese philosophers the inclusion of this connection adds another layer of authenticity to chinese culture that caro and disney were looking for with this release mulans production design is breathtaking and had me longing for a theatrical experience to watch the film as every cent of the 200 million budget was used the film offers some bigtime war action set pieces that are a marvel with dazzling effects that are sure to be in cinephiles favorite set pieces of the year while there is a lot to rave about regarding the film there is one aspect of mulan that did not work for me the film strives to be an authentic tribute to chinese culture yet every person speaks perfect english and there is no chinese dialogue while i am well aware that this film is set to be a kids film it would have been nice to see some subtitles on the screen in a year where parasite won best picture a more authentic representation regarding language would have been welcomed in its attempt to be different and original mulan cements its place as one of the finest disney liveadaptions released thus far while it does not remove 2016s the jungle book as the best of the bunch it certainly should be in the discussion as the formula for upcoming liveaction adaptations
Feb 16 2022,positive,as remake of a beloved animated film from disney there are things that are both admirable and disappointing from it
Jan 7 2022,positive, fans of the 1998 animated film mulan know the story of the young woman who masquerades as a man to take her ailing fathers place in the chinese imperial army ultimately saving china and bringing honor to her family in  the new liveaction version mulan follows the same guidelines but takes some creative turns by adding some fantasy elements as well as some new characters unfortunately it all doesnt seem necessary there are several remnants of the beloved animated classic from the hilarious matchmaker scene to mulans yifei liu strong bond with her father to her rigorous camp training yet it fails to deliver on the relationship between mulan and her fellow soldiers including hunky love interest honghui yoson an although we do get a rather sexy bath scene with honghui joining mulan who is  disguised as jun in the lake their relationship seems a bit awkward the film really focuses on mulans qi the chinese philosophy surrounding life force energy and her strange connection with gong lis xianniang a witch who works for the villain böri khan jason scott lee these new additions present more character development for mulan especially her relationships with women xiu xana tang is mulans sister and confidante but really serves no purpose in the plot xianniang acts as a warning for mulan if she cant harness her qi the right way she could end up alone treated like a witch but the entire situation makes no sense the original story of mulan was important to many because it was about a regular girl who became a legend but adding a qi element giving mulan a sort of superpower takes away the idea that a nobody could become somebody now there is this added element that one has to harness appropriately in order to truly become a warrior it is hard to gauge who the target audience is for this film the movie tries both to cater to westernized audiences as well as chinese audiences the latter with the added elements especially with the addition of gong li donnie yen and jet li all obviously dubbed knowing this allows you to understand the films choices regarding the one dimensionality of the darkskinned villains the rourans the added martial arts presentation by yens character and the lack of the memorable crossdressing scene from the animated film with the focus on the new and unnecessary characters the film fails to highlight the other important characters in mulans story these include her colleagues yao ling chienpo and cricket which is really a loss for the audience throughout the film mulan has moments interacting with her fellow soldiers but never more than exchanging occasional vocal jabs the camaraderie never feels earned the film does try to introduce eastern philosophy and virtues to the western audience but it feels a little too forced this is especially true with the idea of qi and the symbolism behind the phoenix the film depicts the phoenix as a symbol of rebirth which would make sense if they were following greek mythology but for the chinese the phoenix symbolizes harmony the yin to the chinese dragons yang this may cause some confusion between the two philosophies and audiences still the film is entertaining and visually stunning the fight choreography and cinematography are absolutely beautiful and it is remarkable to see an allasian cast on the big screen in a disney feature film liu is perfectly cast as mulan there were many scenes that felt empowering watching her in battle as both hua jun and hua mulan she nails the tormented soldier with a secret and still maintains her femininity while also kicking ass another standout performance from the film came from mulans father played by tzi ma the relationship between mulan and her father is key in every interpretation of the ballad of mulan liu and ma did not disappoint their fatherdaughter chemistry was so strong and emotional i began thinking of my own dear father mulan is important for many chinese and westernized asians although the film may have its faults it does introduce the story of mulan to new audiences that would like to see an asian woman hero while liu may not be my mulan she will definitely be another asian kids mulan and  thats what really matters
Oct 5 2021,positive, lets get down to business this isnt one of disneys shotforshot songforsong liveaction remakes rather niki caros mulan is a serious oftenintense reimagining of the ancient chinese ballad that also inspired the studios 1998 animated hit more crouching tiger hidden dragon than disney princess story its a beautifully filmed epic that gives hua mulan increased agency and confidence gone are the songs catchy as they were most of the romantic subplot and the motormouthed dragon sidekick in their place is the tale of a girl with a powerful chi whose spirit defies tradition mulans lovingbuttraditional father tzi ma advises his daughter to hide her abilities in the interests of keeping the peace and presenting herself as a good matchmaking prospect but mulan played by crystal rao as a child and yifei liu as a young woman isnt destined to be a meek obedient wife when the imperial army comes knocking conscripting one ablebodied man from each family to fight invaders led by bori khan jason scott lee mulan sneaks out in the middle of the night with her longagowounded fathers armor and sword determined to take his place and bring her family honor these plot elements  and several others from the big avalanche scene to mulans foiled attempt at a solo dip in the lake  will be familiar to fans of the animated version but caro tweaks certain aspects of mulans story and introduces new ones too in the interests of giving her heroine an even more firmly feminist trajectory for example here her potential love interest is a peer rather than her commanding officer which removes the iffy power dynamic of the earlier film and a new character shapeshifting witch xianniang gong li is a strong tragic woman whose experiences help mulan understand why its so important for her to embrace who she really is that moment of revelation may be the most important difference of all between the two films here she decides when and how to tell the world her secret rather than having it discovered as the result of a battlefield injury she owns her story sandie angulo chen director niki caro has spent her career telling womens stories so its not a surprise that she does justice to the ancient ballad of mulan in disneys liveaction retelling of the epic woman warrior tale with an international cast of acclaimed chinese actors the new mulan focuses on the protagonists personal growth her acceptance of her power her chi which is usually thought of as a male trait and her devotion and loyalty to family friends and homeland liu yifei is terrific as the innocent hopeful but incredibly fierce mulan who feels compelled to save her sonless disabled father the excellent tzi ma by pretending to be a young man ready to enlist in the imperial army while there arent a lot of laughs and naturally no cartoonish dragon sidekick fans of the original will recognize several callbacks to the animated adventure li gong deserves a shoutout as the huns secret weapon a powerful sorceress fighter who finds more recognition than animosity in mulans abilities this is a grown up dramatic version of mulan that elevates the empowering feminist and familyoriented overtones of the original pam grady a young woman in ancient china risks her life as well as her familys honor when she takes to the battlefield in disneys opulent actionpacked epic mulans liu yifei future was written when she was born a girl a good marriage is supposed to be her fate but she takes after her warrior father zhou tzi ma and when her country faces a new threat she rewrites her destiny whale

brings a more serious persona to the screen donnie yen jason scott lee and tzi ma are also excellent the cinematography by mandy walker is stunning and the costuming by bina daigeler equally strong all the above make this film a winner this version of mulan gives young girls the most important lesson that they are good enough and strong enough embracing oneself is the ultimate victory that is a message that will last much longer than a song leslie combemale new zealand director niki caro has been making gorgeous meaningful films with messages of female empowerment for her entire career and has the accolades and awards to prove it now she has brought mulan to the screen and its as powerful and moving as it is a wonder to the eye girls kicking ass while dressed appropriately to do so is my goto action subgenres and mulan starring the dynamic and compelling yifei liu in the title role will be added as essential viewing to a film category that at long last has started to expand it is a disappointment that the pandemic means caro wont have the worldwide blockbuster she could have had folks looking for fun and girl power at the movies however can spend 30 for their whole family to see it in their home theaters and do so in their jammies loren king director niki caros liveaction remake of disneys beloved 1998 animated mulan is by far the most ambitious and rewarding of the studios

Sep 13 2021,positive, in a sign of early onset curmudgeonry i missed the bus on that film which has meant so much to so many in the years since it came out i was too old too male and too steeped in the legacy of the feudal hong kong and chinese action classics disney was drawing on to recognize disneys savvy reframing of the wuxia martial warfare genre for what it was a flawed but watershed moment in disney animations evolving commitment to inclusion not only through providing tween girls with their own version of joseph campbells heros journey but also via all the oddball transgendery the film contains  the new mulan is a straight up wuxia  no songs next to no love stuff and just enough sorcery and magic to keep the action sequences a bit unpredictable  its more star wars than little mermaid with zhang yimous muse the tempestuous gong li as as a witchy character without precedent in the animated source material  the female darth vader who tries to seduce mulan a likable liu yifei into darkness chi  the chinese word for the life force or what an american drunkard might call mojo stands in for the force and theres a lot of aphoristic nonsense about being true to oneself and learning not to live a lie which really is a legacy of mouse factory script doctoring  i think director nikki caro ought to be commended for making a brisk and thoroughly watchable piece of corporate art that has to be the unluckiest movie that isnt called tenet in recent memory disney clearly saw this film as an international tentpole that could draw in the nostalgia trade sell itself to a combined male and female audience skew on the basis of action and the princessadjacent original and wow them in the all important chinese market  the starstudded premiere was held on march 9 2020 the belated us covid lockdowns began a week later theatrically speaking the film was never released its six months one plague and a desperate general election ploy by the bullhorninchief later and were now supposed to believe that suspending disbelief for a movie celebrating a chinese legend is an act of antimaga treachery lead actress liu yifeis twitter support for the brutal police crackdown in hong kong is a repellant water muddier too expect a late night tweet declaring this movie part of a bidenled anti incumbent plot because its coming oh god is it coming  but beyond the commendable feminism it inherited from disneys original mulan doesnt have enough of a point of view to be a blunt instrument in the culture wars its vaporous but with its sweeping vistas and epic battlefields it would have played a lot better in a theatre if there were still theatres instead mulan has shuffled off to that graveyard of aspiration known as disney where it will meet with the usual muted applause we used to see a lot of gong li back in the 1990s when she starred in what for me is still the greatest chinese film ever made zhangs bergmanesque chamber piece raise the red lantern it was one of their five followups to the almost as great red sorghum  a watershed of asian cinema gong was an instant icon the way only a few actors before her have been  loren brooks  daindridge karina gongs contemporary penelope cruz like each of them she was possessed equally by fire and ice  someone at disney perhaps nikki caro has a love of that great and bygone era of asian cinema where masterworks were weekly occurrences if you knew where to look for them art house cinemas chinatown minimalls bootleg dvd kiosks in grimy downtowns gong has made almost no films in the past decade yet she isnt just sympathetically cast here shes showcased allowed to run away with every scene shes in with her beauty and her acting gifts softened but intact a shockingly aged jet li is on hand too  so far removed from his hong kong action heyday as the chinese emperor mulan defends that i literally did a double take when i realized from the credits that was him and jason scott lee who once played bruce lee in a movie and was disneys live action mowgli chews scenery rather delectably as a heavy who is even more broadly played than he was by a cartoon all of these actors gave me great pleasure in a time when movies were a rare and unruly gateway to the complex pop cultural hall of mirrors that is asian culture each filled their american devotees to the brim with visions of what heroism empathy and sorrow look like to a hong kong cop or a chinese laundress ive come to believe that international movies serve a critical function in this era of rising ethnonationalism in that they make it harder to hate blindly when blind hate is called forth by the bitter politics of the now having loved gong li through zhangs camera the way zhang surely did having leapt from buildings wearing jet lis raffish smile i know something about the chinese people that donald trump never will which is that they cry and cheer for the same things i do and that if you cut them they dont just bleed they bleed acrobats and opera as cold war the sequel beckons mulan the remake takes the form for me of an unintended requiem for a time where hope and amity werent a platitude but a kind of background hum in theatres showing scratchy prints of cantonese language masterpieces to the metronomic tick of two audio tracks made of optical sound i dont yearn for that time exactly but i do salute the cortege as it rumbles past i can see nothing in the clouded future but my memory of gong lis face
Aug 31 2021,negative,the stakes are lower its just not as strong a story
Aug 10 2021,positive, ive long avoided disneys liveaction remakes they strike me as some of the most creatively bankrupt content of the last decade but ever since the first trailer for mulan appeared more than a year ago i thought this might be the one to bring some originality to the table and be worthy on its own merits i was mostly right yifei liu shines in the title role shes already a star in china but this should make her one in america as well the loyal oldest daughter mulan rebels against the system that forces her to be only a wife and maiden when her skills and drive show shes meant for much more yet she remains committed to honoring her family even at the risk of her own happiness and eventually her own life when the emperor jet li institutes a military draft her aging father tzi ma is forced to heed the call this is basically a death sentence as hes already feeble and almost certainly would be killed in battle so mulan flees under cover of nightfall with her fathers armor and sword joining the ranks with the other untrained boys and while there are training montages galore the songs are gone that fits this more seriousminded war film but its only noticeable because the original had such great numbers as reflection and ill make a man out of you and while theres also no eddie murphyvoiced dragon the film still has its moments of comic relief deploying them as needed but the film is mostly dark thanks to the ruthlessness of its villains bori khan jason scott lee and xianning li gong both actors have experience in martial arts films that serve them well and director niki caro  the first woman to helm one of these liveaction remakes  shows considerable skill with the action shes already proven she can deliver emotional dramas including oscar nominees whale rider and north country but she rises to the occasion here which should open doors to bigger projects director of photography mandy walker hidden figures and the stunts team also excel theres no doubt this movie  with its impressive costume design and epic scope  would have played better in a movie theater on a giant screen with perfect sound but since thats not exactly safe right now disney made the right call giving everyone a chance to see it early whether you want to pay 30 to access it is entirely up to you but whenever you see it youre finally seeing a liveaction remake thats not a mere nostalgia play visual effects showoff or pointless exercise in profitmaking mulan stands on its own and it stands tall
Jul 27 2021,neutral, loyal brave true these are the words repeated over and over again in mulan disneys liveaction adaptation of the chinese legend of hua mulan a girl who takes her fathers place in the emperors imperial army  for many the 1998 cartoon also by disney was our first introduction to this tale of a young woman who would defy tradition and break all the rules to protect her father we were excited to finally see the amazing fight sequences come to life hear the amazing soundtrack once more and see li shang in the flesh out of those three we got one and a halfsorta directed by niki caro mulan is a mix of the reallife folk tale and the animated interpretation from the animation we have references to characters like crickey the cute cricket that brought mulan good luck in the funniest ways the matchmaker mulans clumsy faux pas with the tea set and shan yus hawk i say references because what we have in the liveaction arent exactly the same as the characters and scenes we know cricket is now a man played by jun yu one of mulans yifei liu comrades in the army as for shan yus hawk she is also a human a  witch named xianniang li gong these changes are acceptable to a degree because caro and the writers want to ground the film in realism but one change that doesnt work is the use of qi in chinese philosophy qi is a circulating life force contained within the human body but here its the explanation for everything that makes mulan the person we were inspired by in the animation and the legend mulans bravery and gumption come from her strength of character it was her will to risk her life in joining the army and her tenacity to excel in training going against shan yu that made fans fall in love with her she was an example that young girls and women could do anything we set out minds to as long as we believed in ourselves but this isnt the case in caros film here its qi thats responsible for mulans  or hua jun as her alias has been changed from ping  abilities as a fighter and ability to kick sharp objects with precise aim mulan isnt the strongwilled girl because she was raised by loving parents a father who encouraged her to be herself and believed that she would come into her own when the time was right shes amazing because shes been blessed with a special gift that only boys are supposed to have which as a premise is actually contradicted by commander tung donnie yen because she possesses this qi mulan is told she must hide it lest she brings dishonor on her family which would lead to exile herein lie the crux and failure of the entire film since qi has been set up as this mystical energy that women arent supposed to have any woman who does is automatically set up as an enemy of the male characters as has been done with xianniang banished by her people for her abilities xianniang is a woman filled with bitterness and the thirst for revenge she sees men as weaklings whose narrow mindedness makes her view them as being beneath her and to be honest i dont blame her but rather than have xiannang use her power to create the world she envisions where women can be who they want to be she uses them in service of bori kahn jason scott lee the leader of the rourans the mortal enemies of the emperor jet li which is another contradiction within the film if xianniang is so powerful and despises men and everything they stand for why is she helping them apart from the misconception of what qi is the wasting of li gong and her talents on a character that wasnt even necessary to the story and the implication that without her qi the liveaction mulan would be incapable of doing what legend and animated mulan did ironic right the film is dry in a story where time is of the essence mulan feels like a slow slog over rough terrain rather than a tensionfilled action epic in comparison the animation is more gripping and entertaining even though its a liveaction there was no need to remove the humorous and lighthearted moments the animation is known for  and i hate to say it but this score doesnt compare to jerry goldsmiths original gone are the bold 80s synth sounds and brass instruments that got us excited over what was taking place on the screen there isnt even a musical reference to make a man out of you one of the most popular songs in the disney pantheon or true to your heart sung by 98 and stevie wonder in the end credits the disrespect instead there are brief refrains of reflection and lyrics from the songs incorporated into the dialogue which sound forced and unnatural that said the best part of mulan is the actors li does a fine job of playing a character struggling to hold back and conceal what comes most naturally to her lee has the right amount of intensity as bori khan which prevents the character from feeling likewella cartoon villain while theres no li shang we do have hong hui yoson an a fellow soldier who sees and trusts hua jun but like the others he isnt given much to work with storywise and of course ming na wen makes an all too brief appearance to the delight of everyone though the film is pretty to look at the scenery colorful costumes and famous actors arent enough to hold ones attention for the entire twohour runtime with the caliber of actors gathered i just wish their characters had been given more depth for a film thats pretty lengthy it feels as though nothing much happens overall the writing fails them the fans and ultimately mulan herself because it is neither loyal to the story feels brave nor true to who she is though the film is pretty to look at the scenery colorful costumes and famous actors arent enough to hold ones attention for the entire twohour runtime but while the actors were all good i just wish they had been given more depth for a film thats pretty lengthy it feels as though nothing much happens overall the writing fails them the fans and ultimately mulan herself because it is neither loyal to the story feels brave

Jul 13 2021,positive, directed by niki caro mulan was initially scheduled to premiere in theaters this year bringing its story of a young woman destined to be a legendary warrior to the biggest screens possible ideally audiences would have been able to soak in its vibrant colors stunning natural vistas and spectacular choreography while star liu yifei delivers a performance as compelling as it is exciting but alas thats not the world we live in right now and disney wisely chose to prioritize the health and safety of audiences by sending mulan straight to streaming service disney as the first big test of its premier access service which lets subscribers see firstrun films for an additional fee its a commendable decision  particularly for a film that cost more than 200 million to make  and will hopefully be a sign of things to come as hollywood continues to deal with the industryrattling effects of the covid19 coronavirus pandemic and yet even after watching mulan in a wellequipped home theater i cant help wishing there was the opportunity to see the film on a massive stateoftheart screen despite my strong feelings about the danger posed by indoor cinemas right now fortunately mulan offers a rewarding experience no matter what type of screen you see it on a liveaction remake of the 1998 animated feature of the same name mulan delivers more than just spectacle thanks to its immensely talented star liu yifei liu handles the storys quiet moments as comfortably as its most elaborate scenes adding just the right amount of nuance and emotion to mulans struggle to weigh her boundless enthusiasm against the restrictive expectations her family and community place on young women mulans life is a balancing act that has her abiding by traditional chinese culture and exploring the tremendous potential of her chi the energy she harnesses to perform amazing feats of acrobatic skill its those amazing feats that lead her father portrayed by the farewell actor tzi ma to a moral quandary as he tries to reconcile his daughters gifts with the traditional expectation of quiet subservience placed on women her age to abandon the latter would lead to dishonor for the family and tzi delivers a strong performance as his character struggles with the idea of sacrificing his daughters potential to protect their family mulans decision to pose as a man and join the emperors war against the invading rouran legions follows the basic premise of the films animated source material but the story incorporates more modern themes in ways that help in making lius performance feel fresh and contemporary despite being set during the han dynasty this willingness to take an old story in new timely directions makes mulan feel like the least disneyesque of the studios liveaction adaptations of its animated films so far and elevates it above the typical rehash of wellworn tales although caros film does a nice job of setting itself apart from its animated predecessor both thematically and tonally its in the action sequences and choreography where liu and mulan shine the brightest the films cast features quite a few veterans of martial arts cinema including jet li as the emperor of china and rogue one a star wars story actor donnie yen as the leader of the imperial army and mulans mentor although theyre each given a brief scene or two to showcase their skills its liu who steals every action scene shes given with a sense of calm control that makes her extraordinary action scenes seem even more wonderful to behold in fact its when shes showing the least regard for the laws of physics that liu seems the most comfortable as mulan  making her performance and the choreography that makes it possible that much more impressive as the films primary villain jason scott lee is given some opportunity to show off his own action skills and the actor who once portrayed martial arts legend bruce lee in dragon the bruce lee story makes good use of the limited time hes given theres a widely held belief that hollywoods best heroes tend to come from films with memorable villains but mulan defies that old adage by making lees savage character bori khan almost an afterthought in mulans ascension if theres anyone who does manage to steal a scene or two from liu its gong li as the shapeshifting witch xian lang whose own struggle for recognition in a world ruled by men offers a dark reflection of mulans journey gong is at the center of several fantastic effectsdriven sequences in mulan that add to the films visual splendor and her performance is both subtle in all the right ways and gloriously over the top when the moment calls for it from its wonderfully filmed action sequences to its supremely talented star mulan checks off all the boxes for a hollywood hit and another win for disney in its mission to recycle every animated feature made by the studio simply calling it a remake of the 1998 movie does it a disservice though as mulan accomplishes something beauty and the beast aladdin and many of disneys other liveaction remakes werent willing or able to do it makes its story feel fresh and timely thats no small feat given the films historical setting and wellworn story but what liu brings to the role and the way it makes mulans experiences relatable give it a presence outside typical remake territory thats why its such a shame that mulan isnt likely to have the same opportunity to impress audiences that other films  disney and nondisney alike  have received in recent years it boasts some of the most gorgeous sequences sets and scenery youll find in a film these days and yet somehow the power of its story and its lead actress performance still manage to feel bigger than all of that eye candy disney may have developed a reputation for being the mothership for all things mcu and star wars but the streamer is home to so much more most notably its filled with classic disney movies and tv shows as well as hit films throughout the years that were released by disney and 20th century fox which disney now owns its library has also amassed a good amount of holiday content so on top of being filled with superheroes and spaceships disney is also a goto for anyone who loves the christmas season the vast majority of american comic book fans may have very little familiarity with judge dredd a character who has headlined the weekly comics serial 2000 ad for 46 years however dredd is considered to be an iconic character in british comics and fans in the uk cant seem to get enough of his scifi adventures in the far future of megacity one which spans most of the east coast of the former united states of america in this world there are no police there are only those who serve as judge jury and executioner and among the judges judge joseph dredd is considered to be the very best judge dredds popularity was so great that sylvester stallone headlined the first judge dredd movie in 1995 but that movie toned down the edges that made judge dredd so compelling and the film even gave dredd a wacky sidekick played by rob schneider so perhaps it shouldnt be a surprise that judge dredd isnt currently on any streaming service conversely the 2012 reboot dredd is currently enjoying a massive surge in popularity after it joined the top 10 most popular movies on netflix when you think of disney the first thing you think of probably isnt

Jun 5 2021,negative, after such massive financial successes as beauty and the beast and especially last years the lion king it was of course highly unlikely that disney would stop mining their history of beloved animated classics for liveaction remakes and given that they rather shamelessly marketed the former as a feminist reinvention it wasnt and reconfigured the latter as a celebration of blackness it isnt how surprised should we be that now mulan has been positioned as both another feminist reinvention and a hallmark of diversity also unsurprising is the fact that its neither of those things but instead just another instance of a studio paying some very playitsafe lipservice to representation in a pretty transparent attempt to secure more market share based of course on the fondlyremembered 1998 mouse house cartoon musical this new mulan strips out all of the songs not to mention the wisecracking dragon and the vaguely queer subtext in favor of a western audiencefriendly wuxia redesign owing a lot more to something like crouching tiger hidden dragon than anything else young hua mulan yiu lifei disguises herself as a man to fight in her warhero fathers place for the emperor against the northern invaders whereas the original was a chatty largely comic affair about a young womans selfactualization this mulan embraces a more earnest story of using innate power in this case her qi to serve the countrys destiny a rather ooky  and deliberate  concession to nationalism that probably assured disneys ability to get this past chinese censors it also probably helped that so many famous chinese and chineseamerican performers are present here li gong one of the most beloved actresses in asia and a staple of director of hero and the 2008 olympics opening ceremonies yimou zhangs cinema appears as an enigmatic sorceress tzi ma whos had a long supporting career in american films from rush hour to the farewell is mulans father the legendary donnie yen is mulans commanding officer and the equally amazing jet li is completely wasted as the emperor with all that representation in front of the camera its disheartening to find such a lack behind it niki caro seems to have been chosen as an acceptable compromise  at least this isnt helmed by another white dude director  but some chinese or asian production crew director or at least writers might have gone a long way to inject some meaningful cultural insight here instead of the banal chinese stereotypes of honor and family whats more this wuxiainfluenced tale of a female knight almost completely disregards the very rich history of chinese martial arts films about virtuous swordswomen not to mention concubines or female students or soldiers  watch 1964s beyond the great wall a truly tragic nationalistic and feminist work of chinese cinema even chang peipei star of the seminal martial arts film come drink with me gets dragged into this mess with a wasted cameo as a grumpy matchmaker a big comedown from her incredible turn as the villainess of the far more reverent crouching tiger and while accounting for the films disappointments it must be said that the action here  easily the source of its greatest conceptual promise  is adequate at best there is no reasonable explanation other than token representation from hollywoodfamiliar faces to hire athleteperformers like li or yen if the visual strategy is to simply indulge in greenscreen spectacle and medium shots of characters battling dozens of enemies that are just out of frame theres no way a proper stunt team wasnt available for real wirework or martial arts training cycling through alternating slowmotion and speedramped shots of people walking on walls does not a wuxia make mulan merely cribs from its vast cinematic legacy dilutes it with marketable windowdressing and then expects to be congratulated for all that halfassed representation
Apr 29 2021,positive, some of the recent disney lifeaction remakes  and aladdin i am definitely looking at you  are little more than pale imitations of the original animations losing their charm in translation but this reimagining of mulan thankfully is up there with david lowerys petes dragon in finding something fresh to say with the material by jettisoning the songs and the emphasis on comedy in favour of bringing its more emotional and adventurous themes to the fore whale rider director niki caro working from a script by rick jaffa amanda silver laurent hynek and elizabeth martin draws on the fine martial arts tradition of chinese wuxia to give this tale of a young woman who disguises herself as a man to save her father from battle an epic sweep where the 1998 animation played the gender differences down purely stereotypical lines and already feels dated in its outlook this version finds much more nuance with the choices of mulan played with verve by yifei liu being as much to do with family honour as they are with the fact that shes female when a man from each household is called to serve in the army by the emperor jet li mulan  who we see feels the force chi in this case although star wars fans will feel right at home takes up her elderly fathers tzi ma sword in the night to spare him from the fight this freshfaced army must train to take on böri khan jason scott lee who is bent on vengeance and has the handy help of a shapeshifting witch  xianniang gong li who is embittered after years of being ostracised for her powers of course mulan faces the threat of being caught out in her lie particularly at shower time which provides a few lighter moments but the action largely centres on how resilient and selfassured she is in even in the face of this theres a warm sense of pulling together in this film  where the animation constantly highlighted malefemale differences for cheap laughs this one instead shows the unifying force of camaraderie and highlights the fact that many of the perceived differences matter little in the heat of battle xianniang is a great addition offering a sort of tempting dark side to mulans light with lis nuanced performance making her a lot more complex than simply an evil stepmother type as we see how years of being an outcast have brought her to this the scriptwriters also subtly beef up the womens roles in other ways so that we see the perceptions of what is expected of her as a young woman are more societal than the fault of her father the story however  is really here to serve the action  which sweeps in on waves of impressive familyfriendly setpiece battles that favour balletic intensity over bloodshed where live action has fallen short of the versatility of the animation in other remakes here there are no such problems with wire work and aerial and horse trick shots flowing freely in ways that make you wish that covid hadnt stopped the film getting the big screen treatment it truly deserves the graceful addition of a phoenix symbolising the spirit of mulans ancestors also adds a mystical touch without being oversentimental and counterpoints well with xianniangs eagle transformation this has been made firmly with family audiences in mind  but while it may mean it treats some of its weightier themes lightly it proves no barrier to spectacle

Mar 16 2021,negative,i can only describe mulan as a visually spectacular disappointment void of any emotional resonance the film eschews coherent storytelling for what amounts to an orientalist war epic masquerading as a feminist win for asians everywhere
Feb 10 2021,positive, weve got yet another offering from disney that we thought wed see at a theater but hey 30 bucks later and here we are talking the mulan remake you did it walt congrats how was the movie though listen and find out 
Feb 5 2021,positive,  for the most part disneys grand experiment of making live action versions of their classic animated films has not been a success sure its made them oodles of money but creatively the movies have been less than fulfilling either being little more than shotforshot remakes or uninspired retellings of stories we know and love  when the trailer for the new mulan came out it was immediately clear that it would be something different in fact it bore little resemblance to the animated musical with no hint of lowbrow shtick or even songs for all intents and purposes it looked as if director niki caro and writers rick jaffa amanda silver elizabeth martin and lauren hynek would treat the story with gravity and purpose  im happy to say that is exactly what they delivered the base story remains the same when the chinese army conscripts one man from every family to fight against invaders hua mulan yifei liu secretly steps in for her ailing father hua zhou tzi ma properly disguised as a man mulan joins the army and quickly impresses with her level of dedication and skill especially when she goes up against fellow soldier honghui yoson an  the invaders have some truly intimidating people leading them including the fearsome bori khan jason scott lee and xianniang gong li a witch who can transform into a bird as mulan rises in the ranks of the army the invaders get ever closer to accomplishing their goal of overthrowing the emperor jet li  caro and her team taking inspiration from any number of fantastical chinese action movies go allin with fight scenes that are both exciting and beautiful the fluidity of the movements the creativity of the staging and more make the sequences a wonder to behold for many it will their first exposure to the type of scenes seen in films like crouching tiger hidden dragon and the accessibility of mulans story makes it a great entry point  while the film is kidfriendly its not aimed strictly at children as evidenced by its pg13 rating there is no blood but the violence in the film is definitely stepped up over your typical disney outing it also stays true to the goal of building up a strong woman while still maintaining her femininity mulan is fierce determined devoted to her family and alluring with all of those elements combining to paint a full picture of a woman at a time when women were usually subjugated  the film pays homage to the cutesy elements of the first film without actually going down that road itself gone is the dragon mushu both because he doesnt mesh with the story at large and because he was considered culturally insensitive the sidekick crikee an actual cricket in the original film is reimagined as a slightly goofy fellow soldier named cricket jun yu who brings humor to the film without undercutting the drama  what many fans of the original may miss the most are the songs but their absence makes complete sense having these particular characters break into song would break the spell that the rest of the film casts still caro and composer harry gregsonwilliams know they cant get rid of the familiar music completely which is why snippets of music from the popular song reflection are woven in throughout and actual reflections of mulan pop up at key moments in clever ways there are also full versions of the song sung by christina aguilera in english an updated one from her 1998 version and liu in mandarin during the end credits aguilera also sings a new song loyal brave true  the film features familiar faces like tzi ma jason scott lee jet li donnie yen and rosalind chao but liu is the star throughandthrough she brings everything you could want to the role and more exhibiting the spirit of mulan in multiple ways yoson an offers great support as a rivalslight love interest and its easy to see him gaining more work in english should he desire it mulan is easily the best live action remake disney has put out both because the story lent itself well to taking out cartoonish elements and because the filmmakers put in the work toward making it stand out seeing it on the big screen would have been great but streaming it through disney is still

Jan 29 2021,positive,  the last time we saw the story of mulan a young woman who disguised herself as a man to enlist herself in the imperial army in place of her ailing father it was in the form of an action musical that was disneys first animated film to feature an asian heroine  twentytwo years later disney has dropped the songs and upped the body count in mulan a live action remake featuring an allasian cast and crouching tiger hidden dragon producer bill kong behind the scenes the movie premieres this week on the disney streaming service  based on a sixth century legend called ballad of mulan the new film lets go of many of the stereotypes that marred the animated version hewing more closely to the traditional tale set in china during the han dynasty in a quiet village the story follows hua mulan liu yifei the martial artstrained eldest daughter of famed warrior hua zhou tzi ma  when the emperor of china jet li fearing a threat from the invading rouran army led by bori khan jason scott lee a skilled warrior fuelled by anger over his fathers death and shapeshifting witch xian lang gong li he orders the conscription of one man from every household in the land to form a mighty militia  as the father of all daughters fa zhou volunteers but is in no shape to go to war unbeknownst to him mulan disguises herself as a man and enrols risking her life and the dishonour of her family if she is discovered  mulan doesnt feel like the other recent disney live action doovers it is different enough in style emotional content and tone from the animated movie to be a standalone with only a tenuous connection to the past  director niki caro drags the story into the 21st century emphasizing themes of female empowerment allowing mulan find her own inner strength and potential and not rely on a disney prince the sparks that flew between li shang and mulan in the original are mostly absent  as her commanding officer the power imbalance was deemed inappropriate for 2020  and have been replaced by platonic love interest chen honghui yoson an  the reported budget of us200 million is very much evident on the screen the gorgeously shot wuxiastyle action scenes are epic and for the family audience relatively bloodless considering how many people are dispatched by mulans deadly blade occasionally they fall prey to a heavy hand from editor david coulson but the sheer size and scope of them even on the scaled down disney television presentation are eyepopping a more intimate climax with lifeordeath consequences for bori khan mulan or the emperor is a nicely rendered showdown that effectively delivers a good exciting mix of action and character dynamics  mulan is a welcome addition to the disney remake roster it plays like a grownup version of the animated film bringing the story into the modern age while keeping the family appeal intact  academy award winner charlie kaufman scripted being john malkovich adaptation and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind mindbending movies that essay themes of identity crisis mortality and the meaning of life through a metaphysical or parapsychological filter his latest project im thinking of ending things an adaptation of iain reids bestselling novel and now streaming on netflix fits on the shelf next to his bestknown work its a fascinating road tripand head tripthat is equal parts unsettling atmosphere and tension  jessie buckley and jesse plemons play a new couple on a road to trip to visit his parents at their rural farm although she has misgivings about the relationship and is thinking about calling it quits they seem well suited playfully singing show tunes and talking as they stay just ahead of threatening snow squalls  the storm intensifies after they reach the farm and the couple are snowed in with his welcoming but eccentric parents mother toni collette and father david thewlis as the group gets to know one another over an awkward dinner the young woman  who is never identified by name  has feelings of unease that intensify as questions arise about her boyfriends mental health  im thinking of ending things is a cerebral slowburn story of suspense and menace anchored by four terrific performances collette and thewlis are wonderfully weird bringing these strange somewhat inappropriate characters to vivid life without giving away spoilers as to whats to come plemons is well cast as the allamerican boy with a secret but it is buckley who dominates the role is written internal and much of the interesting stuff happens in her head but her work is never cold or clinical she brings warmth to the character as the very fabric of her psyche is being challenged its a long strange trip but buckleys exploration of the frailty of the human spirit is compelling  as director and screenwriter kaufman takes his time allowing the characters to mix and mingle physically and perhaps mentally and the suspense to build its a tricky dance he dispenses just enough information to move the story forward while creating an atmosphere that grows until the films final 20 trippy minutes kaufman artfully brings the movies themes of regret and longing into focus with a bizarre and beautiful climax  based on bill keenans bestselling hockey memoir of the same name odd man rush available digitally and on demand stars jack mulhern as a hockey player with nhl dreams who ends up in swedens minor pro league  mulhern is bobby sanders a hockeyobsessed young man whose dreams of bigtime sports stardom are dashed by injury despite surgeries and being banged up he plays in europe on the periphery of pro hockey and is eventually traded to a team in sweden hes living his dream but then he starts a relationship with elin elektra jannson kilbey a woman he meets at the local market his love of the game never subsides but elin and problems with an old injury make him reevaluate his priorities and just who he would be without a hockey stick in his hands  odd man rush is an ode to everyone who has ever put on pads with dreams of nhl glory dancing about in their heads which is pretty much everyone who has ever played hockey sanders is the guy we dont hear about very often the grinder who wasnt destined for greatness that point of view differentiates odd man rush from most other sports stories  its a movie that loves the underdog and the game hockey kids like trevor gretzky and alexa lemieux daughter of mario lemieux make appearances alongside cameos by former nhl player and referee paul stewart and edmonton oilers associate coach jim playfair which add authenticity to the storytelling  filmed in some of the same locations as 70s sweary hockeyfilm slap shot odd man rush spends a great deal of time on the ice but like so many sports films its not actually about the game it explores universal questions of dreamfulfilment and how much of oneself you give to that dream thoughts most of us have had whether weve ever played shinny or not  the story of feels good man a new documentary now on vod begins with boys club a comic series about four characters including pepe the frog in what artist matt furie called the post college zone he based the quartet on the personalities of he and his friends they dont have a plan for their lives but they do know they enjoy drinking and hanging out  after publishing on myspace for a time pepes catchphrase feels good man caught on memes started to pop up on other sites and one fan even wrote a song about pepes habit of pulling his pants all the way to the ground when he stood to pee  pepe was discovered by the users at 4chan a website described as a darwinian competition for attention where the most popular posts float to the top of the page earning the most replies others sink to the bottom and fade away like a video game but unlike other social sites it is a winning and losing system that fostered a culture of anonymous but nonetheless attentionhungry users one 4chan user says it is a place to express things you dont feel comfortable saying in real life memes help the posts stand out and pepe the slacker frog was coopted by people who liked his expressive face  sad frog smug frog angry pepe feels frog and you will never frog  but didnt know anything about boys club or furies work  nonetheless pepes popularity grew and soon he had a clothing line and pop stars like nicki minaj and katy perry were paying tribute pepe had escaped and he was roaming around and it was fun for a while until it wasnt anymore furie says  the 4chan community upset that pepe was no longer theirs and theirs alone began making the memes as distasteful as possible its so offensive it cant be coopted images of pepe with swastikas and highly racialized language began to appear the characters simplicity and malleability made him a perfectly adaptable figure for memes and videos  what began as an innocent icon of harmless hedonism was then adopted by white supremacist and incel groups by the time donald trump retweeted a meme of himself as pepe furie had lost control of his own creation i think that president trump is a reallife version of pepe says look ahead america executive director and photo data expert matt braynard in his ability to illicit a reaction get attention and express peoples hopes and fears  feels good man details how pepe the frog went from benign entertainment to an ultimate representation of internet troll culture as a writer for the atlantic says pepe allows the altright to pretend they are kidding but they are not kidding they want you to be both scared by the threat and be mocked for being scared in the first place to cause psychic anguish  furie was horrified as an artist who wanted to write childrens books pepe was an albatross around his neck both for his reputation and his finances a huge order of merchandise destined for mainstream stores had to be destroyed lest it wind up in the hands of white supremacist groups furie worked to reclaim pepe reframing him as an avatar of love and happiness not hate but as an internet security expert tells him thats a tough genie to put back in the bottle  pepes reputation rehabilitation eventually takes the form of lawsuits against alex jones and his ilk but the interesting stuff here isnt about the copyright infringement or intellectual property fights its about pepe as an omen  an unexpected sign that things are changing in ways many cant quite understand it was a warning that something was shifting in society that something had gone wrong says scholar john michael greer we need to listen because its not going to go away  feels good man is part cautionary tale part culture war study and part story of the reclamation of art its brisk pace aided by interesting talking heads and loads of animation entertainingly breezes through the details of the various subcultures that aligned to subvert furies creation on the world stage  set in the near future the action begins during an important presentation for red eye a new device capable of accessing memories a contact lens announces inventor conrad stallman neil napier at the product launch that records not what the eye can see but what the mind can remember  we are made up of our experiences and the memories of those experiences now your memories are no longer a thing of the past be where you remember being see old friends family  stallmans sales pitch is compelling but backstage there are problems its not ready says red eyes head programmer elise perrott michelle thrush as she scurries away returning to her lab there she gives her best friend metis researcher margo elson tommieamber pirie the secret password for her work computer consider yourself my back up plan she says ominously  the next morning after a tormented sleep margo awakens to the news that elise has been found dead in her lab of an apparent suicide  investigating the case is thomas elliot greg bryk a troubled police officer who when asked if he is the detective on the case snarls til someone tells me otherwise hes a tough guy who drinks expired milk and has a habit doing things like inexplicably kicking open the already open door to elises apartment you know you could have just asked me for the key to the door says margot arriving a second later or perhaps he could have just used the doorknob but either way hes a walking cliché the two agree to work together hell do the police work shell help him navigate the hightech aspects of elises work  secrets abound and theres suspicion and skullduggery around every corner the brandnew

margo is a scientist but it is her connection to and belief in indigenous traditions that gives her the inner strength to get to the bottom of the mystery of parallel minds  cliched and melodramatic dialogue mars the film which is a shame because the female characters have great promise margo jade and elise are interesting people and the engines that keep parallel minds moving forward  parallel minds shows promise there are many cool ideas here but they are hampered by a modest budget unable to realize the set pieces hayden offers up theres stylish photography and some good location work but the films ambition outstrips its execution
Jan 28 2021,negative, there is a lot of pressure riding on mulan disneys latest liveaction adaption for one its 200 million price tag even with a traditional release would have required a lot of millennials to rush to the theater factor in a global pandemic a sliding economy and no tangible end in sight and disneys best hope in recouping their money is by charging 2999 to those who already pay for a disney subscription mulan tells the story of the titular character hua mulan yifei liu a young girl living in rural china she has a very particular skillset an inner power that translates to grace agility and strength as a child she flies down shingled roofs gliding from one end to another like a wireless trapeze artist however a womans place in traditional chinese culture is to be neither seen nor heard and as such mulan must dim her shine to accommodate everyones expectation of her particularly her fathers in such a repressive society the only way she can bring honor to her family is to impress the matchmaker and nab a husband a seemingly innocuous task that proves impossible from the smart freespirited mulan  meanwhile the rourans a fearsome tribe of barbarians led by hulking scarfaced bori khan jason scott lee alongside the witch xianniang li gong whom he has enslaved to do his bidding have overtaken a northern outpost and are a threat to the rest of china the emperor decrees that one man from every family must join his imperial army to defend the nation and its people mulans father tzi ma though an honored warrior is old weak and incapable of surviving another fight though he willingly registers lest his absence brings dishonor to his family mulan makes the courageous decision to dress in her fathers armor steal his sword and sneak out in the dead of night with her chest strapped down tight and her voice lowered to an unconvincing growl she joins the imperial army in her fathers place there she learns archery and is pushed to her limits that is until she allows her true potential to rear its gorgeous kickass head when she can fly past swords and shoots arrows with the kick of her foot only then has mulan found her true self once more she is the only hope the emperor has in facing off with another powerful female force and the evil brute behind the vengeful plan i say this with pure irony mulan needs to give us a smile the film is humorless and heavy it ditches the musical numbers and ample comic relief of the animated version from cricket to mushu to nearly every male character save the villain and  love interest this iteration takes itself very seriously its hard to enjoy even a wellknown wellloved story when the film focuses too much on aesthetics and hardly at all on character development and relationships it moves quickly through plot development that it frequently feels like we are skimming through the story in this way mulan herself is like a stranger by the time the credits roll and her comrades in the army are bumbling fools whose true underbellies are never revealed it is refreshing to see the studio at least try to make this one different from their 1998 hit turning our heroine into a martial arts master an aspect of the film that really works and gives ample credit to wuxia films that came before it think the wired acrobats of crouching tiger hidden dragon director niki caro alongside cinematographer mandy walker bring a female perspective that is necessary and often overlooked in a film with a strong female lead particularly one who moves and acts like a moral swordwielding super hero but mulan is ultimately a disappointment unrecognizable for fans of the original and offering very little for those looking for a film that stands upright on its own merit
Jan 27 2021,positive, cleveland ohio  mulan might not have had the commercial or critical success of other animated movies from disneys 1990s glory days but from a cultural standpoint the film was just as perhaps more significant as the little mermaid or beauty and the beast because it gave young asian american girls a disney princess all their own that made it easier to overlook concerns about the movies racist caricatures appropriation of chinese culture and gender norms which were outdated even for 1998 not to mention it failed to meet the true measure of a good disney movie all of the songs save for one reflection are completely forgettable so the studio was wise to ditch the source material and start over for the liveaction mulan streaming on disney starting friday for 2999 representation indeed matters but so does entertainment value especially at this price point the new version like the original is based on the chinese legend of hua mulan which dates back all the way to the fifth century if youre expecting a wisecracking dragon named mushu voiced by eddie murphy to show up this isnt that movie when we meet her mulan played by yifei liu is an independent freespirited girl living in a close tightknitted village she is one with her qi portrayed here as sort of the chinese version of the force and which gives her a particular set of skills that would make her a great warrior but because she is a girl she is told to repress her qi and instead agree to an arranged marriage and bring honor to her family fans of the original will get a kick out of the matchmaker scene while completely reimagined its still one of just a few instances of fan service keep your ears on the music playing in the background of the scene and dont miss a surprise cameo at the end of the film too shotforshot callbacks bogged down liveaction versions of beauty and the beast  aladdin and the lion king so its a good thing mulan gets it out of its system early on from there war breaks out in the country forcing each family to send one man to join the fight mulan loyal brave but not exactly true disguises herself as a boy and runs off to take her ailing fathers place in the imperial army the film wanders into familiar territory in the base camp scenes from the awkward situations typical of gender disguise movies to the standard rockystyle training montage from every underdog movie the story finally finds its groove when the battalion is sent to fight and mulan is forced to reveal her true identity director niki caro whale rider deserves credit for bringing mulan not only into the realish world but giving it a modern sensibility and level of authenticity her heroine is already strong gifted and empowered at the jump and doesnt need a man as the song goes to make a man out of her instead the script gives mulan an unlikely ally a witch played by gong li for a more feminist bent the new version also disposes of li shang mulans shirtless and somewhat problematic supervisorlove interest with donny osmonds singing voice from the cartoon yoson an as honghu takes his place in a relationship thats more platonic the original mulan is one of the few disney animated films with a body count still this version is darker and more violent than youd expect even in 2020 given the target audience and unlikely as it sounds the film is much more of an action movie than it is a fairy tale caro brings the highenergy of a jason bourne movie and the gravitydefying flair of crouching tiger hidden dragon to the fight sequences disney clearly wanted to broaden the films appeal and the presence of martial arts stars donnie yen jet li and jason scott lee certainly add gravitas to the proceedings for hodophiles the film is gorgeously shot and does justice to the beauty of china and new zealand where the movie was also shot its a shame the film isnt playing on the big screen but the movie is far from perfect the message while admirable is surfacelevel deep and the film is fraught with cliches and onedimensional characters theres a noticeable lack of emotion that christina aguilera belting a few bars of reflection couldve easily fixed the release of mulan has been delayed several times yet its arrival this weekend comes at just the right moment this is an aspirational film for asian americans and young women that makes it relevant particularly in these divided times but more than that the movie with its heroic story intense action and sweeping scenery is an unexpected epic the kind of escapism all of us could use right now in those ways consider mulan priceless mulan is available to disney subscribers who unlock premier access for 2999 starting sept 4 the film will be available to all subscribers at no extra charge

Dec 31 2020,neutral, oz perkins take on the classic brothers grimm fairytale albeit with a switcheroo in the title delivers a darker take on a familiar story what perkins brings to this table are beautiful visuals  at times haunting in their execution  a gloomy atmosphere and a story told through gretel which ends up being an interesting and mostly successful choice its a24lite however gretel and hansel plods along without any real moments of tension horror or fear to accompany the locations that almost demand them everything is set up for this to be a real chiller but its sadly lacking in chills and thrills lillis is more than able in the lead role and alice krige is deliciously macabre as holda aka the witch the cuisineobsessed woodlanddwelling oddball with sinister intentions for our protagonists however sam leakey as hansel fails to reach the standards of his costars and ends up coming across as rather flat the same can be said of gretel and hansel as a whole its all a bit flat beautiful to look at but lacking in many other aspects required to elevate it to aboveaverage levels the ambiguous trailer for antebellum was great to me at least and it did what any trailer should do  it raised my interest in the movie and i became quite excited to see just what the movie was actually about then i watched antebellum oh boy the marketing screams from the producers of get out jordan peeles movie that delivers a stark timely and effective message on racism and attitudes alongside being a damn good horror flick which is everything antebellum is attempting yet manages to fail to be on pretty much all counts of course the idea of slavery is abhorrent and the onscreen treatment is unpleasant to watch but antebellum feels like a shallow attempt at shouting for peoples attention and then not really having what it takes to back up the cries it seems opportunistic playing on shock and exploitation tactics in place of gravitas and drama when the latter really would have made for a better story given the horrific subject matter allowing for the grislier aspects to carry greater emotional heft when the movies big twist comes i wanted to gouge my eyeballs out at the sheer absurdity of it  theres suspension of disbelief and then theres being treated like an idiot antebellum succeeds mainly at looking pretty good wasting its ubertalented cast monáe is solid as she firefights through and well thats about it really it finally happened the new mutants received a theatrical release of course having suffered years of production issues and delays scrutiny and interest were always going to be high in this movie which almost handicapped it before the projector ran on the first showing the new mutants for all of its troubles isnt a bad movie in fact its quite good quite being the operative word here if youre expecting a car crash mess of a flick youll likely be disappointed but it really isnt excellent either  its simply adequate pinned as a superherohorror movie it certainly felt a bit different from the norm but boone holds back on the horror overall whether by his judgement or by the studios which is a shame as the new mutants had a chance to provide something substantially distinct but merely ends up as being slightly quirkier than its peers maybe this is simply down to anya taylorjoys odd russian accent its a strange one for sure but the cast as a whole is fine  noone really stands out in a movie that has plenty of forced moments designed to give the audience exactly that the big moments however these dont really pop in the way they were intended at times its cliche and at other times fun the new mutants serves as a peculiar superhero offering compared to its biggerbudget contemporaries one of the original cinematic casualties caused by covid19 mulan found its home on disney amidst a storm of production controversy and the pressure of living up to the muchloved 1998 animated offering yifei liu took the sword in this version and as mulan is very good in the lead alongside a terrific supporting cast including the likes of donnie yen tzi ma gong li and jet li liu imbues the character with steel and affability that makes her easy to root for visually the movie is also very strong  its colourful grand and a joy for the eyes thats just it though mulan has strong performances and visuals but not a lot else gone are the songs and verve of the 1998 version instead replaced by drama adventure and wellchoreographed and moreviolentthanexpected action the lack of songs isnt an issue its the nagging feeling that mulan is too bynumbers and at times surfacelevel  the inescapable feeling that this is very much style over substance the additions to this iteration provide different dimensions than before but it feels too polished to really accentuate the statement that mulan and disney were desperately trying to hit home beautiful visuals great performances and some solid action cant fully mask the rather empty centre that mulan carries having delivered the surprisingly good aladdin in 2019 guy ritchie has gone back to his wheelhouse with the gentlemen  a british gangster flick full of wit punch humour and great performances nearly allround its a movie very much playing to the ritchie incrowd if you arent a fan of his previous efforts this probably wont make you change your mind however fans of his will likely lap this up theres less action here than one might expect instead replaced by more of the trademarkritchie backandforths between characters mainly the wonderful hugh grant and charlie hunnam but this trade allows the gentlemen to feel less frenetic than say lock stock or snatch  and in this case thats a positive what it also ensures is a slightly messy narrative that whilst not derailing can at times be a challenge to keep up with thankfully strong performances from mcconaughey farrell grant hunnam and dockery help soothe this burn though henry golding feels underutilized in the cookiecutter role of dry eyes its cool its snappy its fun and stupidly entertaining the gentlemen is evidence of a director flexing his established genre muscles and allowing himself to have a bit of fun once more borat subsequent moviefilm arrives fourteen years after the first borat affair lit up cinemas worldwide and created a wonderfully bizarre kazakh comic icon stuffed full of shocking comedy moments and sharp social commentary it felt like it dropped at the perfect time its sequel sadly doesnt possess that same timing luck or either of the aforementioned qualities instead it feels like a misguided attempt to recreate what came before in an alreadygreatly changed landscape nothing within borat 2 feels as shocking as cohen intends it just feels forced  in particular a dance between borat and his onscreen daughter tutar the impressive bakalova stood out as cringeworthy the satire isnt anywhere near as cutting as before  possibly due to realworld politicians and political events feeling more satirical than anything else  and during my viewing i couldnt help but wonder what the point of this really was thats not to say there arent good qualities  the opening act is strong there are a few great gags as there usually is with cohen and many of the original boratisms retain their humour  but sadly borat 2 doesnt hit with the same fire the original did all those years ago from the stage to the big screen ma raineys black bottom tells the story of art racial attitudes and exploitation in 1920s chicago focusing on ma rainey davis and her working band in the

Dec 17 2020,negative, lets get down to business to destroy a classic in the last few years disney has been rebooting many of its 90s animation movies  beauty and the beast the lion king aladdinand now mulan while i quite enjoyed the previous reboots mulan falls well short of their success in my eyes although this incarnation follows some of the plot from the animation version 2020 mulan does not have mushu li shang or singing disney have quite literally stripped its own film of many of its best parts  like its animated counterpart the film shows hua mulan liu yifei take her fathers place in the imperial army  to do so mulan must appear and act like a man the 1998 version worked because it was funny the songs were catchy the characters were vibrant and full of personality and it had a strong female character who was normal  2020 mulan on the other hand is not funny is not a musical though it did integrate some of the original songs into the films score most of the characters such as the new love interest chen honghui yoson an and known characters yao chen tang and chienpo doua moua dont have the same verve and mulan herself was far from normal everything about this movie was completely unbelievable from the power of the supposedtobenormal mulan to the ridiculous dialogue sadly disney have succeeded in ruining what was an amazing film some reboots should never be made and this 2020 mulan was definitely one for me 1998 mulan will always remain one of the best disney films ever made with a female character who was strong in her normality 
Dec 13 2020,negative, since 2002 eclectic new zealander writerdirector niki caro has been struggling to reach the same level of accomplishment of whale rider her sophomore feature film after the passable dramas north country 2005 and mcfarland usa 2015 and the expendable the zookeepers wife 2017 she returns with mulan a liveaction adaptation of the 1998 animation feature of the same name by tony bancroft and barry cook for this disneyproduction caro engages in a simplistic tale a sweet candy confection filled with a feminist prowess that despite wellintended favors style over substance mulan yifei liu is a fearless girl who disguised as a male warrior undertakes an incredible journey as she joins the imperial army to save her aging father veteran tzi ma from the burden of war and potential death the film also welcomes acclaimed chineseborn singaporean actress gong li as the witch xianniang and action star jet li as the emperor of china the dazzling physical battles captured under the supervision of cinematographer mandy walker tracks hidden figures are insufficient to overcome the petty humor the stinky smell joke about the heroine is repetitive and faint romance what should have been edgy and thrilling turned into a disappointing routine if nothing else mulan looks gorgeous
Dec 10 2020,neutral, months after disney made its liveaction remake of mulan available to rent for an eyewatering 30 its now finally free to stream for folks with disney subscriptions cue stragglers like myself coming in to see what all the hullabaloo was about shop talk surrounding the films controversy has largely come and gone so ill keep this review brief id set my expectations low and therefore i had a perfectly nice time taking in all the glitz and glamour that comes with a starstudded cast and 200 million production budget however the films brilliant parade of color and hong kongstyle action feels oddly soulless some dissonance stems from the 4th6th century source material a chinese folktale titled the ballad of mulan that sees its heroine sacrificing everything to defend an autocratic emperor such an obedient soldier makes for a dull hero by american norms where wariness of government is built into our dna and idolized through such patriotic bangers as give me liberty or give me death and let freedom ring a cowboymaverickantimasker mulan is not on top of that director niki caro and her team of screenwriters make it doubly hard to root for mulan yifei liu by giving her naturalborn abilities that eradicate the much more satisfying emotional journeys of hard work cunning and a good old fashioned underdog story in 1998 disneys animated mulan used no such superhero theatrics and its character development felt all the stronger for it finally whiplash tiktokstyle editingwith none of the fun irreverenceleaves no time for moments to resonate the beautiful artifice of mulan remains yes but dont pull back the curtain because youll find nothing behind it mulan might star a woman who infiltrates the army to prove that women can be warriors but her end game still relies on gaining the approval of men her father tzi ma fellow soldiers and the emperor jet li all stoke anxiety in mulan who seeks to win them over rather than smash the patriarchy mulan validates these very same men who couldnt see her value until she waved her magical abilities in their faces sure theres an argument to be made for change coming from within a broken system but when mulan rejects a much more interesting offer to be mentored by the witch xianniang gong li i couldnt help but feel disappointed at seeing her dismiss an opportunity to grow and flourish outside of the confines of mens expectations altogether i suppose i should just be glad were following a female protagonist at all and dont get me wrong that definitely goes in the pro column especially given how mulan isnt the sole woman in a sea of mensomething we still see in movies like the tomb raider series or standalone features arrival 2016 and gravity 2013 instead mulan easily passes the bechdel test as she holds relationships with several women throughout the film something screenwriters elizabeth martin and lauren hynek explicitly made a priority from the getgo in minor roles we see her sister mother and the village matchmaker and while her emotional story arc mostly centers her relationship with her father the films most interesting pairing occurs between mulan and the antagonistic shapeshifting xianniang who doesnt exist in the original poema welcome case of taking creative license with old material to suit modern needs mulan and xianniangs similarities as powerful and ostracized women combined with their opposing philosophies on morality provide tension not unlike what you see between rey and kylo ren in star wars unfortunately that potential is quickly squandered caros mulan displays no appetite for ambiguity and instead punishes xianniang as the flat villain she so clearly isnt meanwhile mulans relationships with other women feel equally flat appearing solely to prove that shes not like other girls her silly sister screams at spiders her mother forces mulan into gender norms and the matchmaker herself epitomizes outdated ideals of subservient femininity in fact nowhere do we see traditional presentations of femininity appreciated in the film at all adornments like makeup and womens clothing become the butt of visual jokes whereas mulans martial arts expertise and efficiency in killing a bunch of nomads become the traits that launch her into heroism in short the representation of women onscreen feels mixed but behind the scenes its unequivocally great that a female director and three female screenwriters were placed at the helm of such a highprofile movie while they hardly execute a perfect ten the broader goal is for women to be allowed to produce something mediocre and not get punished for it during their careers i genuinely hope this proves to be the case for caro and team first the papercuts a white director working from a script written by four white screenwriters was already worthy of a passive aggressive is this really such a good idea but not a dealbreaker on its own  then came the wallops in august 2019 mulans star yifei liu tweeted her support of the hong kong police at the height of their brutalities against prodemocracy protesters by the time that firestorm had subsided mulan stepped in it again as audiences noticed in september 2020 that the films credits thanked propaganda departments in chinas western province of xinjiang where parts of the movie were filmedand where horrific atrocities against uighur muslims such as forced internment and sterilizations by the chinese communist party ccp continue to this day knowing all this i had hoped that a disneyfied sheen of an american blockbuster could keep the grossness of chinese authoritarianism at bay but when faced with stunning desertscapes and dramatic cliffs i couldnt help but wonder if i was observing the land of forcibly displaced communities other jolts like seeing actors who have publicly supported the ccp and by extent the partys aggressions in hong kong and xinjiang kept taking me out of the scene watching donnie yen as commander tung twirl a sword recalled his starring role as a martial artist in ip man 4 2019 a movie whose chestthumping nationalism and dog whistles like we are all chinese took me by surprise even the incomparable gong li as xianniang the films best character by far felt tainted given lis similar loyalties thankfully such lightning rods were tempered by the purer enjoyment of seeing asian american stars like hong kongborn tzi ma or southern california natives jason scott lee as the villain böri khan and rosalind chao as mulans mother and when i glimpsed the films cameo of mingna wen i gave a silent internal whoop the actress born in macau and raised in new york city had voiced mulan in 1998 id like to pause for a moment however to make it crystal clear that a my critiques of the ccp hardly excuse the united states own dismal record on human rights and b i dont think actors need to be quiet any more than i would wish for colin kaepernick to keep politics out of sports on the contrary i think its exciting when actors stand up for what they believe in but as paying consumers were well within our rights to avoid movies whose actors harbor political leanings we find repugnant in my case as a taiwanese american who worries about the increasing number of ccp fighter jets soaring over the heads of her family members in taipei and kaohsiung the shadow of chinese influence on disneys 2020 remake of mulan distracts from the escapism i seek in a feelgood movie even from this vantage point however i can still appreciate the opportunities a huge project like mulan has opened up for asian american talent its not the fault of individuals that disney fumbled its appeals to the global theatrical market or that studio heads missed the chance to hire muchneeded authenticity in mulans core creative team this thread by chinese historian xiran jay zhao hilariously recounts the many many ways that mulan makes no sense to people versed in actual chinese culture more work and visibility for asian american talent will always be great and mulan certainly accomplishes that goal with one hand grasping for chinas moviegoing audience as the other refuses to let go of its american roots mulan collapses into confusion and it still underwhelmed at chinas box office so between this remake and netflixs over the moon from a few months back can we stop trying to lump together chinese nationals and chinese diaspora and instead stick with movies that can actually appeal to both everyone loves a brainless action romp for example id gladly take the meg 2018 over misguided pandering any day
Dec 6 2020,positive, walt disneys ongoing run of liveaction adaptations of their past animated hits reaches a fresh height in creative futility with niki caros mulan a nonmusical riff on the companys 1998 hit it would be deeply unfair to claim this remake is actively bad the performances are solid the production design is attractive and the camera is always pointing in the right direction at the same time it is genuinely difficult to justify its existence one can usually fall back on a minimum justifications of brand recognition and commercial opportunity i am not sure that it is the case here both films tell versions of the chinese folk story of hua mulan a young woman who runs away from home to take her fathers place in the imperial army the story originated in the southern and northern dynasties period 4th6th century ce and through the 20th and 21st centuries has remained a popular subject for chinese films and television serials disneys first attempt to mount mulan in 1998 has been widely seen as an attempt by the company to capitalise on the chinese film market for the second attempt the film seems even more aggressive in capturing that audience the new film removes all elements that were seen as a barrier to mainstream chinese success  the songs the comedy dragon sidekick and so on  and casts key roles with three of the most popular chinese actors in the world donnie yen gong li and jet li for jet li who plays the emperor it is his first major role in seven years the film also assiduously casts a chinese actor in the title role liu yifei who previously costarred with jet li in rob minkoffs 2008 film the forbidden kingdom it is worth pausing briefly to remember the forbidden kingdom a flawed but admirable attempt to produce a chinesestyle wuxia picture through a hollywood lens it does this by not only sticking to broadly iconic story and character elements but by presenting them all from the perspective of a white american teenager it openly admits to being a hollywood film albeit with the trimmings and iconography of chinese cinema the animated mulan did much the same thing the storys origins were from china but the film itself was disney through and through this is where the 2020 attempt diverges and ultimately fails it tries valiantly to be an authentic wuxia picture it casts major stars of the genre and shoots inside china for authenticity including controversially the human rights nightmare that is xinjiang province harry gregsonwilliams score is rich with traditional chinese instrumentation and melody the costumes are absolutely beautiful as is much of the photography  but is not shot or edited like chinese wuxia the tone of its characters and conflicts cannot help but feel americanised its fight scenes lack the lyrical aesthetic of the films it impersonates superficially it is entertaining enough but the moment it invites comparison to its genre it reveals itself as exactly that something superficial certainly caros film is more accessible to children but it is paced like a work for adults it seems bizarre that disney would spend so much time and expense making this film it was never going to capture a chinese audience to the degree they wanted  and why would it it apes a style it fundamentally does not understand and gets actively cringeworthy when it starts to misunderstand the concept of chi it offers a story for chinese audiences that has been repeatedly filmed in recent years  the 2008 jingle ma adaptation is rather enjoyable  and tells it to them in a foreign language while it is always pleasurable to watch donnie gong and jet  although here the latter sounds painfully dubbed  there are better films in which to view each of them it is nice to see tzi ma the farewell in a largerthanusual role and its refreshing to see rosalind chao playing her own ethnicity for once her two most famous roles to date are as a korean in mash and as a japanese botanist in star trek deep space nine liu yifei does an excellent job of mulan as well and even resembles her animated counterpart more than i had expected the bottom line for english language viewers is that unless subtitles are a major obstacle there are literally dozens of films easily accessible via home video and streaming services that offer a better experience in retrospect the very things that disney eliminated  songs humour a dancing cricket and an upbeat tiny dragon  are the things that enabled the earlier version to stand out 
Dec 5 2020,positive, continental divide 1981 although continental divide was the first film released under steven spielbergs amblin banner its best known as that movie where john belushi plays a totally normal guy and hes quite good at it delivering an easygoing turn as a chicago newspaper columnist who hightails it to the rockies to interview an ornithologist but when ernie souchak and nell porter blair brown first meet its clear they have nothing in common he prefers city life cigarettes and booze she prefers nature animals and tranquility naturally they fall in love it may be true that opposites attract but there is so little common ground between these characters  none in fact  that their romance is never believable the film is at its best when it ignores their relationship and concentrates on other matters ernie tackling bigcity corruption nell studying american bald eagles regardless of whats happening in lawrence kasdans schematic screenplay belushi and brown save the movie with their warmth and charm dc cab 1983 why are women so uptight theyve got half the money and all the pussy and so it goes with dc cab the sort of disreputable comedy that could only have been made during the 1980s like many faves of the period its lewd crude and rude but it deserves a salute for featuring as eclectic a cast as can be found this side of otto premingers skidoo its plot is nothing more than the usual nonsense various misfits  in this case taxi drivers  earn no respect until a crisis forces them to band together and save the day harold max gail wojo on barney miller runs the place albert adam baldwin is the new kid on the job and the excitable tyrone charlie barnett has a crush on irene cara who appears as herself in a brief cameo theres also mr t as a conscientious cabbie gary busey as a foulmouthed joker bill maher yes that bill maher as a sensitive sort paul rodriguez as a ladies man the barbarian brothers using up 5 of their 15 minutes of fame as rowdy drivers whitman mayo grady on sanford and son as mr rhythm and timothy carey as the angel of death whew despite that roster the movies not particularly funny but a few sixpacks could help mulan 2020 while 2019s photorealistic remake of 1994s the lion king felt like disney staging its own invasion of the body snatchers  everything looks the same only stiff and emotionless  this liveaction mulan thankfully avoids frigid fealty to its animated 1998 predecessor instead it jettisons all of the songs most of the knockabout humor and even mushu the scenestealing dragon eddie murphy in basically a test drive for shrek leaving behind a durable drama told with sweep and style as before mulan yifei liu is a headstrong young woman who learning that her frail father tzi ma must join the imperial army in a time of war disguises herself as a man and takes his place on the battlefield the silly scenes eg mulan the matchmaker and a tea set are played too broadly and should have been removed and the pictures view of the chinese notion of chi leans so heavily on hollywood ideals that its surprising no one ever says may the chi be with you but the story is inspiring the action scenes are rousing and cinematographer mandy walkers shot selections are dazzling all this plus the great gong li as a sympathetic villainess the new mutants 2020 despite all the production upheavals all the conflicting visions and all the false starts when it comes to release dates the films been bounced more than a ping pong ball this middling xmen entry is still superior to dark phoenix reviewed here the depressing dud that managed to kill off a onceproud franchise setting up a new series of xrated adventures  but mangling the assignment so thoroughly that followups are unlikely to materialize  this centers on five troubled teens confined to a remote hospital the newcomer is the native american dani moonstar blu hunt who becomes the instant bff of the scottish rahne maisie williams gets along with the hickish sam charlie heaton and the brazilian bobby henry zaga and runs afoul of the russian illyana anya taylorjoy all are mutants with unique powers but it isnt until they pool their resources that theyre able to conquer their inner and some outer demons even with most of the film devoted to exposition this feels unformed and unfinished with halfbaked ya interludes illdefined villains and ungainly action sequences popeye 1980 its easy to see why many critics viewed popeye as an abomination upon its initial release its also easy to understand why select reviewers declared it an unqualified winner those who can get on its wavelength will appreciate its eccentricities those who cannot will find its whimsy the equivalent of waterboarding those who detest it will insist that the choice of robert altman as director was a horrific one those who love it will insist his hiring was a stroke of genius the overacting by all involved might be suitable for the project but its uncured ham nevertheless robin williams popeye mumbles shelley duvall olive oyl frets paul l smith bluto roars and i have no idea what ray walston poopdeck pappy is doing the suitably dilapidated sets are certainly more impressive than the winceinducing tunes by harry nilsson i much prefer his charming tunes for 1971s the point reviewed here bluray extras include archival interviews with altman and williams photos from the movies 1980 premiere and the option to cut to all the songs featured in the film possessor uncut 2020 david cronenbergs first films were intriguing but also messy muddled and

beverly hills with the help of bythebook la detectives rosewood judge reinhold and taggart john ashton and the hindrance of stern police captain bogomil ronny cox this highoctane actioncomedy was originally conceived as a vehicle for sylvester stallone who thankfully dropped out after many cast and crew members were already in place daniel petrie jr and danilo bach earned an oscar nomination for best original screenplay although so much of the dialogue was adlibbed by murphy that he probably deserved credit as well this was followed by a pair of lamentable sequels with the golden child murphy unfortunately if unsurprisingly morphs from explosive comic talent to narcissistic action star no one else could have played axel foley billy ray valentine or 48 hrss reggie hammond quite like murphy whereas a dozen other actors could have tackled the golden childs chandler jarrell in exactly the same preening paycheckcashing manner after a tibetan boy jl reate with mystical powers is

Dec 4 2020,negative, in some ways mulan represents a major departure from disneys approach to liveaction remakes of its beloved traditionallyanimated movies unlike the emma watsonled beauty and the beast the will smithstarring aladdin or jon favreaus the lion king technically not liveaction the new mulan is not a musical yes its not the first one disney allowed favreau to do the same for the jungle book more or less it had a couple of songs but mulan has also excised characters and introduced new ones out goes the small pet dragon mushu  voiced by eddie murphy who served as a comic relief  because it wasnt received well in china and in comes a shapeshifting witch called xianniang played by gong li considered the best actress in china today at the same time mulan is not bold enough the axing of mushu is just one way disney is catering to chinese interests for instance the villains in mulan have been changed from the huns as they were in the animated version to the rourans to make the film more historically accurate but mulan herself is still shown to be a citizen of imperial han china even though the original tale  the ballad of mulan  states that she was part of the northern wei dynasty why maybe because the han make up of 92 percent of chinas population today the emperor in mulan instructs his people to defend the silk road which makes no sense because the region wasnt part of china then the problem is mulan isnt a good movie and what makes it all the more annoying is that it had potential to be a good movie mulan sets out its world quite plainly in the opening minute itself hua zhou tzi ma also infrequent narrator mulans father and a war veteran tells us that her daughter is capable of something only men are allowed to wield its called qi pronounced chi and its described as an energy that pervades all living things but only some individuals can harness its power qi is a central principle in chinese martial arts and its been virtually used everywhere by hollywood from iron fist to the upcoming shangchi mulans definition of qi makes it sound like the force and its not the only parallel to star wars here zhou adds that qi is only for warriors and thats not something daughters can become still hes happy to indulge her even though those around them do not approve hua li rosalind chao mulans mother agrees shes concerned because daughters need to conform in society to find a good husband pressured from all sides zhou asks the young mulan crystal rao to hide her gift away and silence its voice  this makes the film open to interpretation as even a lgbtq story  and do what is expected of her bring honour to the family through marriage mulan is crushed and though she generally does what shes told she doesnt entirely give up as she matures into a young woman yifei liu so when the emperor jet li decrees that one man from every family should serve on the imperial army to fight off the invading rourans mulan believes it ought to be her her father is in no state he walks with a cane and is forced to enlist only because he has no sons powerless to stop her dad from leaving and knowing that he would most likely not return mulan does the unthinkable she takes her fathers place in the imperial army with women not allowed to serve this means mulan must disguise herself as a man its easier said than done being in the army involves being around other men at all times in the showers and at night of course what they are really there to do is to train and mulan proves herself to be more than an equal at everything and they better train for they are up against no ordinary enemy the rourans are led by böri khan jason scott lee a capable and smart warrior leader who has united 12 nomadic tribes and whos looking to avenge his fathers death at the hands of the emperor but they have an ace up their sleeve in the aforementioned shapeshifting witch xianniang gong li  shes credited as such but never named during the film  is extremely powerful she can take over her enemies bodies or turn herself into a bird a solitary eagle or a murder of crows xianniang has allied herself with böri khan because she wants to live in a world where shes not vilified and called a witch mulans world which doesnt afford any power to women has never accepted her xianniang is a fascinating introduction to the world of mulan in not only what she represents but how she challenges the foundation of the narrative deep into the film when mulan reveals herself to be a woman shes expelled from the army even though shes singlehandedly delivered a victory against the rourans and shown herself to be better than all the men in her battalion later she has to risk her neck and needs the support of her fellow officers to convince commander tung donnie yen that theres a credible threat to the emperors life and mulan is only accepted back home by society after she saves the emperors life and in turn the kingdom itself thats a lot you shouldnt have to prove youre so exceptional just to be granted the most basic right equality women get a raw deal in mulans world ours too and xianniang has understood that the world has no place for people like them and that she must remake it in her image and thats what she proposes when she confronts mulan that she come over to her side join me we will take our place together shes the kylo ren to mulans rey if i were to draw another parallel to star wars which makes xianniang much more of an antihero than a villain their dynamic ought to be the heart of the film and for a brief moment it is but mulan ultimately wastes all that potential as it cuts short xianniangs arc for the most meaningless of plot points and lays bare how clueless the films writing team is its a shame because mulan had the opportunity to improve upon the original disney is intent on turning its beloved animated movies into liveaction franchises the lion king 2 already has a director prequels to aladdin and cinderella are in the works weve already had two alice and maleficent movies and a dozen more remakes are in various stages of development disney tried being safe with mulan and its china pandering failed being safe has worked elsewhere both aladdin and the lion king made over a billion each despite being terrible movies if its going to give us these movies disney may as well start being bolder because as it stands mulan is a bland feminist fable that dispels some gender stereotypes but fails to do much more mulan is out december 4 on disney hotstar its also now available outside disney premier access without the need to pay a 30 additional fee
Dec 3 2020,negative, mulan finds a way to offend just about everyone are you a feminist prepare to be disappointed by the films simplistic idea of empowerment do you consider yourself to be a champion of human rights then you will no doubt be incensed at disneys wilful ignorance of mass atrocities or maybe youre simply a fan of the movies good luck with director niki caros impersonal take on the material  while the artistic merit of disneys liveaction remakes has always been questionable  their existence can be attributed more to hollywoods condescension towards chinese audiences than any creative reasons  these movies also appear to be getting consistently blander in what should be seen as a slap on disneys face mulan was roundly rejected by china when it released theatrically over there hopefully putting an end to the wests incursions into that market  both hollywood and bollywood have for far too long thought of china as an easy paycheque theyre shoved subpar products down the countrys throat convinced of its lessdemanding tastes but chinese audiences have caught on and this time its personal unlike thugs of hindostan which was simply a bad movie that no one in china wanted to pay to watch mulan attempts to honour chinese culture by putting millions of american dollars on what has to be the most glaringly misguided hollywood film of its kind since the keanu reevesstarrer 47 ronin its cultural appropriation on a massive scale  in a classic attempt at misdirection disney put together a largely asian cast but neglected to retain this sensitivity while hiring the crew which is predominantly white at the helm the studio stationed inhouse talent niki caro her presence might appease those who prefer stories about women to be told by women but you see what im getting at by having a woman at the helm theyve solved one problem but what cultural insights could a new zealand filmmaker possibly bring to a chinese story its like handing zoya akhtar the reins to a rosa parks biopic  and in this crossfire of cynical decisionmaking the audience suffers not only is the new mulan a dreary slog its wilfully ignorant of the spirit of the animated original caro has as you might have heard discarded the songs and affected a more serious tone similar to the epic films of jhang yimou and ang lee the latter of whom passed on directing mulan she has also perhaps at disneys encouragement changed the ethnicity of the main villain mulan cannot be divorced from the cultural context that surrounds it simply because these are decisions made by the filmmakers and by making these decisions theyve invited discussions about them  it would have helped had it been a better film with an engaging story and empowering message but it feels overwhelmingly uninspired  just an excuse to make more money this is unforgivable considering the sheer number of resources at caros disposal  why for instance do the elaborate sets look like they were constructed three days before filming when they should have looked more livedin why does the cgi look so artificial when multiple reports have pegged the films budget to be in the vicinity of 200 million if you thought henry cavills computergenerated mouth in justice league looked odd wait till you see what theyve done with jet lis face in mulan convince me that it is not poorly done deepfake the legendary li is just one of the many casting coups that the filmmakers have pulled off the ensemble also includes gong li who plays a shapeshifting witch tzi ma who plays mulans father and the great donnie yen whose skills as a martial artist are completely wasted in a film that would rather cut combat scenes haphazardly than let yen get down to business  of all the liveaction disney remakes mulan is the one that deviates the most from its animated original while most of these movies  aladdin beauty and the beast the lion king  have been rather respectful of the source material mulan constantly trips over itself by trying to reinvent the wheel it is also too preoccupied with being politically correct which as far as preoccupations go is noble but also something that demands sincerity theres very little of that here 
Nov 27 2020,negative,still liu is engaging and sympathetic which helps us stick it through to the end though who the intended audience for this film is remains a mystery
Nov 18 2020,positive, culture is a reflection of your community and popular culture tells the story of many communities in real time we talk about the best and sometimes the worst it has to offer while providing keen insight and analysis about the things that you care most about
Nov 13 2020,neutral, much like its strongwilled protagonist disneys liveaction remake of 1998s mulan has had to overcome its fair share of adversity one of the years most anticipated films mulans release plans were thrown for a loop when the pandemic hit while the film was eventually given a premiere access release on disney the onetime fee on top of the regular subscription price did not sit well with many subscribers fortunately with mulan arriving on bluray this week a wider audience will now be able to experience the film set in 630 ad when honour was the most important form of currency for families niki caros film tells the story of a fiercely independent 18yearold named mulan liu yifei who is magnetic in the role the daughter of a famed warrior zhou tzi ma mulan would rather spend her free time mastering her fathers fighting techniques than preparing to find a suitable husband as fate would have it mulans martial arts abilities prove beneficial when a warlord böri khan jason scott lee attempts to dethrone the emperor jet li building an army to stop khan the emperor decrees that every household is to send a man to build an army to stop khan fearing for her aging fathers life as he volunteers to fight since he is the lone male in the household mulan disguises herself as a man named hua jun and secretly enlists in her fathers place keeping the framework of the animated film caros adaptation never strays too far from the source material however it leaves its own unique mark thanks in part to its visual splendor the cinematography and costume design are both vibrant and breathtaking to behold the rich colour palette really pops off the screen even in the chaotic and thrilling action sequences caro draws heavily on inspiration from both the wire fu techniques employed in films like hero crouching tiger hidden dragon and the works of the shaw brothers when constructing her fight sequences creating an action film that is both graceful and energetic at the same time although its technical flourishes make for an invigorating experience at times mulan never quite finds its footing from a narrative perspective the film clearly wants to make a statement about patriarchy and the ways girls are unfairly pushed into societal boxes from a young age however it never feels as inspirational as it aspires to be furthermore the changes that caro brings to the story most notably the subplot involving the witch xianniang li gong does little to elevate the overall story which is why some moments such as xianniangs key decision late in the film play more like plot conveniences rather than true female empowerment showing flashes of brilliance throughout caros film never reaches the heights it aims for as a result mulan is a film that entertains but does not completely satisfy
Nov 13 2020,negative, they have had a couple of minor misfires but on the whole disneys recycling scheme has been a big success liveaction remakes of animated classics cinderella beauty and the beast and aladdin have all been the big box office hits of their years  but the mulan  redo marks something of a departure for one thing its avoiding us and uk cinemas to go straighttodigital  an unprecedented move for a 200 million movie  but as this violent action film isnt suitable for young children it will have to do remarkably well with teenagers and grownups and its the tone of the film that really sets it apart from its fellow remakes there are no song and dance routines no cutesy sidekicks and no jokes this handsomely shot but unusually dour film takes its chinese mythology and tang dynasty setting extremely seriously it is wellcast and its bloodless violence is slickly orchestrated but something felt a bit off with its message and it took me a while to twig what it was it wasnt mulan liu yifei by todays standards shes pretty much a bog standard heroine  a young jedilike warrior from a rural backwater as girls arent supposed to fight her father hua zhou tzi ma has told her to hide her chi until the local matchmaker finds her a husband then soldiers arrive in her walled town a rebellion has broken out on the frontier and the emperor jet li has ordered a man from each family to join his army before mulans frail father hua zhou tzi ma can limp off to die in battle she steals his armour hides her flowing locks and takes his place at a boot camp run by the fearsome commander tung donnie yen the crossdressing mulan now going by the name hua jun impresses tung with her unsmiling dedication to at least two of the three noble virtues  loyalty bravery and honesty and it looks like the emperor will need her gravitydefying fighting skills the rebel army of bori khan jason scott lee is laying waste to one of his garrisons with the help of shapeshifting witch xianniang gong li it was when khan began to rally his troops that i realised what was amiss deep down i wanted to be on the side of the villain when khans generals threaten to abandon him he reminds them of lands lost in a recent war and of his father whom the emperor murdered by his own hand from here every move jet lis emperor made added fuel to the fire he sends limping old duffers to die in battle assassinates rivals and barks orders while perched on a garish golden throne i know my place says the feminist icon when the witch invites her to team up with her and bring down the womanhating empire it is my duty to fight for the kingdom to protect the emperor tellingly the film is still getting a very wide theatrical release in china a privilege not afforded to the original mulan this new version with its villainous rebels and its message of virtuous loyalty sailed through the office of the communist censors
Oct 23 2020,neutral, disneys longawaited liveaction remake of mulan is full of legends theres the historic warrior hua mulan herself of course the hero of chinese folklore immortalized in the 6thcentury poem the ballad of mulan who disguised herself as a man to go into battle in her fathers stead her story was given renewed life in chu renhuos 17thcentury novel romance of sui and tang and tributed from then on ad nauseum with historical accounts movies not only by disney plays poems a crater on venus  but the legends i have in mind are still living theyre the names on the marquee theres the wushu master fight choreographer and action icon donnie yen star of among other things the deservingly popular ip man franchise theres jet li nearunrecognizable in his role as the emperor of china and gong li one of chinas greatest and most celebrated living actresses who  fabulously and appropriately  adds a bit of sorcery to the mix theres wuxia legend cheng peipei too recognizable to an american audience as jade fox from crouching tiger hidden dragon but more notable for starring in the gangbusters wuxia classic come drink with me 1966 and theres added finesse by way of tzi ma as mulans father hua zhou and rosalind chao as her mother hua li both of whom like many of their costars have long since made headways into the american mainstream with films like rush hour and the joy luck club to their names this murderers row of actors  stars who have all to varying degrees led successful crossover careers on which disney is cannily trying to capitalize  is perhaps the most impressive thing about the new mulan as directed by new zealander niki caro and manifest onscreen by star liu yifei who could herself become a crossover as of this movie mulan is an altogether justfine affair it is soggy with bland action and an oversimple script selfundermined by all the juicy imperial conflict and menacing wizardry that more or less get marginalized in favor of the movies topical but unengaging big themes mulans story in its many folkloric variations is a pandoras box of potential theres war and filial piety honorable deception upturned codes of masculinity and obviously a heroic feat of crossdressing theres the fact that as legend has it mulan apparently passed as a man among hemen for over a decade can you imagine the daytoday drama of that the terror but also the bravery but also the utter shenanigans of that now theres a movie  the movie we get instead is decidedly less exciting less engaged with the finegrained particulars of mulan the person and instead overly smitten with the markets its trying to navigate and mulans status as legend shes an icon pure and simple  literally in this case as the script imagines little for her beyond the broadest possible strokes mulan opens with a young mulan in hot pursuit of a chicken run amok making a mess of her village and souring her familys reputation in the process its because shes got a power which were told women arent meant to have an overabundance of chi and when her father reminds her that sons bring honor through battle and daughters  meaning mulan herself  bring honor through marriage he sets us up for a story that by and large writes itself mulan will meet with a matchmaker shell mess that up while still to our sympathetic eyes showing that shes made of the right stuff and when an invasion from roving tribe of rouran warriors threatens to overtake the silk road and with it the empire an imperial decree will force mulans warhero father to consider stepping back into battle with no hope of return  its no spoiler to say that mulan goes to war for her father and really as a readaptation of a story disney has told before spoilable material doesnt exactly abound here but there are key differences from the 1998 movie disneys priority this time around is not to repeat past mistakes  financially that is that animated mulan with its boisterous catchy heroanthems and altogether playful attitude didnt play so well in china where viewers complained that their storied heroine had been overly americanized she was too individual the new mulan instead tries to have it both ways admirably independent but with eastern values kept tightly in mind steadfast in her commitment to family and community theres even a metoofriendly update gone is the animated movies somewhat homoerotic flirtation between the disguised mulan and one of her male superiors captain li shang instead she gets to flirt very cautiously with a guy of her own rank chen honghui yoson an whose butt she entertainingly kicks the new film is all about navigating compromises like these pivoting from crisis to crisis in broad heightened and often fairly vague strokes  in part for kids sake someone will argue which doesnt give kids enough credit the most satisfying but still underexplored addition is gong lis xian lang a villain of a sort only not really she like disneys new take on maleficent plays more like a complicated antiheroine whose fate as a powerful woman shares more than a little in common with what awaits mulan should her chi be revealed to men  but because that revelation never feels like a true threat because the movie is vague and broad in so many ways something about even this arc proves unsatisfying no one expects the disney version of mulans story to be rigorous  even if the most powerful movie studio in the world could afford to take any risks it pleases no one expects it to dig deep  even if digging deep being true to ourselves and unlocking our inner potential are among disney and the selfhelp industrys evergreen themes its no wonder disney acquired the star wars franchise  just as its no wonder that the concept of chi as described in the new mulan feels conspicuously similar to the force which probably tells us where the force came from in the first place  a better movie would make that connection feel like a more genuine act of reclamation itd have a bit more attitude itd take better advantage of its deep bench of action stars it might even  i know i ask too much  pay more thorough tribute to the hong kong bmovie and wuxia classics it very deliberately evokes without really selling us on the point instead mulan emerges as a curious act of market negotiation it is a perfectly fine movie it will no doubt be meaningful for children especially those who could afford to see more of themselves onscreen in heroines like mulan but its cast its attitude its overall eagerness to please  all benefits one would think  dont add up to a good movie they add up to a blueprint of the movie this ought to be
Oct 5 2020,positive, if you were a fan of the 1998 animated film version of mulan this 2020 liveaction feature is the perfect adaptation without being a carbon copy i was curious to know if it would still hold up without the joyful musical selection and charismatic character mushu played by eddie murphy and it did by going far beyond some funfilled adventure for children if youre also into martial arts theres a surplus of handtohand action to satisfy you as well while the fights arent the best choreographed that weve seen on any screen theyre still high enough in standard to get the juices flowing especially with popular actors from asian cinema behind all the punches and blows the titular character for mulan played by yifei liu the forbidden kingdom was perfect in all forms she had the look the physicality and all the necessary acting skills to sell herself as a noble warrior while her character was a handful early on her role was a great example of how some people find it difficult to confine themselves to the everyday standards of a given culture it was clear that mulan is someone whose sole purpose in life was to shine the additions of donnie yen as commander tung and jason scott lee as böri khan also delivered the goods as well both are clashing on opposing sides than the other for good versus evil and the film created a great balance showcasing this conflict with me being a bigger fan of donnie yen one disappointment for the film was the lack of use for the character he had his fair share of screen time but i just wanted more i mean its donnie yen for crying out loud as far as the action is concerned it by far reached my expectations which were admittedly very low for reasons unknown as stated before i have seen better martial arts films but this one still holds weight and i can see myself going back for multiple viewings for not just a great film but to get a high from a few fight scenes that made me feel good inside i thought the battle tactics were well thought out strategic and planned and the use of fantastical abilities was sewn in with great accuracy without appearing too unbelievable for someone not familiar with this form of entertainment such as characters running up walls transforming into animals or possessing unusual levels of strength it was an easy transition for me but maybe somewhat jarring for others  i respect dearly the overall story of mulan a young woman wanting to represent and protect her family based on her own personal beliefs and culture what this film teaches may be simplistic to some but at its core the foundation is to fight for what you believe in no matter the cost this sums up the character mulan in a nutshell and i can get behind any character with that much passion and motivation im not an expert on chinese culture but from the little i know i thought the production team did a fantastic job the costumes appeared accurate from what i know and the set designs were filled with detail which made you feel as if you were there it is very clear that a lot of time was spent to get everything just right and from these lenses they nearly knocked it all out of the park  i enjoyed mulan as much as i enjoyed the original 1998 animated film while there were a few nitpicks here and there its still a film i would recommend to others and would happily see in theaters given the option this film doesnt fall into the best category but more of a personal favorite of mine given the context of action and handtohand fighting i wasnt expecting to be blown away but i cant honestly say there were large or even small portions that turned me off entirely to give a lower score 
Oct 3 2020,negative, it may look like a film and quack like a film but somethings just not right with the new mulan based on the classic chinese tale of a young woman who gets conscripted incognito in her disabled fathers place to fend off northern invaders and gets exposed  yet saves the emperor anyway niki caro directs this liveaction remake of the 1998 disney animated film with a notable lack of vision the placement of mandy walkers camera is off and limiting and we frequently wish for another angle or a wider one this is worsened by david coulsons slightly sluggish editing grant majors production design feels stagey supposedly outdoor locations excluding the battle scene are obvious soundstages and the phoenix that replaces mushu who was beloved even in china looks like a kite and american humane wasnt able to say in the end credits that no animals were harmed  the military tactics are atrocious on both sides the good guys deploy undertrained conscripts against veteran cavalry choose a lowlying field for a staging ground and fall for blatant traps for their part the bad guys led by jason scott lees böri khan depend on the subterfuge shapeshifting and black magic of xianniang gong li delivering the most complex performance of the film and yet they constantly belittle her im sure thatll turn out fine  its just as well that the fight choreography is credited to walker and her team as its pointlessly flashy and  worst of all  graceless unlike actual martial arts patterns the moves on display during military training seem to have little realworld applications actual fight scenes are filled with busywork and few hits and though mulans swordplay is more beautiful her actual signature move is i kid you not a bicycle kick rendered in slow motion she does it thrice  then theres the script by rick jaffa amanda silver elizabeth martin and lauren hynek i have no problem with the elevated language used to convey classical chinese but theres just too much clunky exposition surely you can find a way into mulans head without constantly having people explain things to other people who should already know them  the character motivations make no sense either whereas in the animated original people are exposed or put in danger by mistake or out of neglect here it happens by choice when first reporting for duty mulan actively picks a fight the bad guys start the avalanche themselves mulan reveals her true gender unprompted xianniang tells böri khan of her inevitable betrayal without being forced to emperor jet li gives up the protection of his imperial guards the list just keeps going  even a remake should be judged on its own merits but i think the implausible motivations are a byproduct of trying to preserve the same narrative structure as the original problem is the first version was essentially a collection of songs montage sequences and fight scenes strung together with eddie murphy jokes the only reason it worked so well is because of how much realism animation can discard  the background for about a fourth of the film was just colors  2020s goal of liveaction realism means it has to find a way to navigate jarring scene transitions and behavior bound by physics sometimes it works mulan avoids showering by volunteering for night watch every single night other times not so much she pisses off the matchmaker peipei cheng by misplacing the teapot to hide a very scarylooking spider when using her words would have sufficed  the most perplexing unforced errors have to do with the central message of the film like the other entries in disneys recent string of princess films its about female empowerment central to this is the soldiers oath to be loyal brave and true where true apparently means authentic or something like uncompromisingly honest feminism or any other discourse of this tenor is as a practical matter isolating and unconducive to material progress a better message for this nonchildrens film would have been to be principled yes but also flexible you should stay true to who you are but you need not always flaunt it  especially during a war  xianniang tells mulan as part of a psyop that concealing her gender makes her weak unfortunately shes right mulans father tzi ma instructs her to hide her powerful qi because a girl needs obedience and grace rather than martial prowess but she has to be true to herself and tap into the qi that flows through all things to become the powerful warrior she was always meant to be this isnt the only parallel with the third star wars trilogy just as reys power is chalked up to her being palpatines daughter mulans qi is inherited from her warhero father in both cases this turns an egalitarian tale 1998s mulan was a nobody as was the rey of star wars the last jedi into an aristocratic affair  this brings us to the cultural critique despite some historical inaccuracies at least this mulan doesnt offer the vague orientalism of 1998 so i credit the filmmakers for giving it the ol college try where it comes up short is in focusing too tightly on the heros journey of selfempowerment at the expense of everyone else except xianniang who gets a character arc only because its basically the same arc as mulans to western eyes it might seem like the original was also about the heros journey but it was careful to couch everything in accepted social logic mulan was not a natural warrior crystal rao delivers a portrait of the warrior as a young girl in the remake she was never confused about who she really was under that armor and just wanted to be recognized for who she was she believed in the value of traditional marriage despite her lack of wifely skill she thought it important to get along well with her brothersinarms  2020 tosses all of that when mulan accomplishes the impossible training task we dont see her comrades cheering her on instead we get a shot that echoes the individualist romantic painting wanderer above the sea of fog the training ends not when the unit can fight as one but when mulan accidentally reveals her skill with a javelin honghui expresses doubt that shed come to her fellow soldiers aid and its justified by her behavior up to that point in the story mulan ends up in a duel with xianniang because she leads a small group of anonymous soldiers who charge into a trap she defeats böri khan not with ingenuity and resourcefulness but thanks to a qiunlocking speech by the emperor and she ends up with not a man but a sword its her younger sister xana tang who gets matched the film proffers the opposite of the selfcensorship or chinese jingoism some had feared  rigidity of thought leads to rigidity in style the film feels monotonously gloomy and serious and grace notes such as a shot of mulan emerging from mist come few and far between liu yifei is artful with the sword but its commander tung donnie yen who actually fights with one in closequarter fight scenes that obscure the swordplay canted angles during garrison sieges add flair but little excitement unlike the similar shot in the climactic battle of thor ragnarok  and xianniangs fighting style seems modeled after cate blanchetts hela  the gray overtones are a pity for the confucian social logic that mulan doesnt really uphold in this film is a surprisingly flexible one the analects yes im bringing out the big guns has confucius saying a moral leader is not a specialized utensil 君子不器 212 translated by david r schiller one shouldnt adhere rigidly to a set of rituals but find a style of ritual that best fits the occasion and ones own personality the crossdressing soldiers in 1998 reflected this but though theres selfexpression in confucian social logic theres no confucian social logic in this films selfexpression its a valid yet regrettable artistic choice  and the story of mulan should be social and flexible  to be clear im not faulting the film for being creative with the source material the original ballad of mulan heres a translation is actually the tale of a soldier who like cincinnatus gives up her military rank and privileges as soon as she can only after she returns home and changes clothes do her comrades realize shes a woman the moral in the coda is that when men and women do the same task with equivalent proficiency theres really no difference but youd never know that from seeing either of the film adaptations
Oct 2 2020,positive, mulan and tenet are two major blockbuster films that are in many ways linked together theyre both big hollywood films that were delayed from the coronavirus pandemic tenet chose to be released in theaters this weekend cities and state with open theaters are showing the film this weekend its unclear how well itll do but the film  headed by christopher nolan  is going full blast in its effort to return to normal but mulan chose a different route starting friday sept 4 the film will be available for 30 on disney plus through premier access you can stream it download it and keep it as long as youre a disney plus subscriber in a few months itll be free on disney plus for subscribers too after watching mulan the one major thought that stuck with me is that this really is the perfect family film for the pandemic when your family is stuck at home few films are better films to watch than one that promotes positive messages about honor trust and doing right by your family mulan is a liveaction remake of the animated film which tells the story of a young woman who takes her fathers place in the emperors army looking to fight off a group looking to takeover the imperial city in china its a tale weve seen before many of us know it and despite some slight changes  like the lack of musical numbers and no mushu  the film mostly sticks to the script of the original the film in many ways reminded me of star wars a young hero with extraordinary abilities on a journey to save a group from destruction theres even a tiein with the force  in this film its called the chi  so its hard not to draw that comparison there are sword battles and emperors all around as well theres even a darth vaderlike witch character who represents the dark side version of mulan in many ways mulan is like the star wars movie we never got  a young heroine who must honor her family going through training in order to defend her world  and its a beautiful film the colors dance on screen the contrast of the emperors army wearing red and the invaders wearing black is beautifully shown sunsets an avalanche and journeys through the woods all pop off the screen so its an excellent film to watch from an aesthetic point of view the film does have its flaws it runs a little too long with multiple endings much in the same way that lord of the rings ends some of the themes and messages are a little heavy handed the whole phoenix rising from the ashes motif gets a lot of play in this film and the story moves so quickly that you dont have time to really get a deep dive into the characters and embrace them we dont really learn too much about mulans fellow soldiers which makes their relationships feel a little hollow families may find it difficult to sit through some of the battle scenes this film is rated pg13 for a reason the violence so dont expect a clean film in that way there isnt blood necessarily but the battle scenes do show some harsh blows cracks and snaps that will make you wince if youre not expecting it one or two of the battle scenes definitely dont work well for a childrens film and fit more along the lines of the pg13 rating but the film has more important messages sprinkled throughout and the most important is about honor defend those who need help give aid to the weak always keep your family in mind and do right by them while staying true to who you are dont pretend to be someone else dont hide behind your identity embrace who you are for the sake of yourself and your future mulan as a character is a wonderful role model for young girls and boys too she sticks to who she is and keeps her family values strong she doesnt let the naysayers knock her down she doesnt allow people to bully her or fall victim to the demands of others she stands up for herself and her true values she stands as a strong leader though there is a slight romance angle in this film the romance isnt the entire story its more about power leadership strength and honor  all values that can help young children grow into strong adults its a family film with a message mulan is available for 30 right now and thats a good price if youre a family about to watch the film normally youd pay north of 40 for tickets to see the film in theaters  and thats not counting the popcorn the food and the drinks now you can have a night at home with the family cuddled together under blankets watching a film that will remind you whats important in life family is what we get to take with us and watching a film about family with your family will only hit that home its unclear how mulan would have performed in the box office if the coronavirus pandemic hadnt delayed it we may never know maybe well get numbers from disney about downloads and whatnot but we dont know the true impact of it from that perspective but in a world full of darkness  a world where death tolls rise hate speech polarizes and positive messages seem to be lost  having the option to watch a lighthearted film from the comfort of your own home is a win for anyone
Oct 2 2020,neutral, the story the spirited mulan liu yifei is a girl who grows up doing things boys like to do such as climbing and practising gongfu to the dismay of her parents tzi ma and rosalind chao after raiders led by bori khan jason scott lee and his witch ally xian lang gong li lay waste to several cities the emperor jet li issues a conscription order for the men in the kingdom mulan sneaks away in military garb passing as a man to take her fathers place in the army a liveaction adaptation of the 1998 animated feature which is based on chinese legends when disney pulls a piece from its animation library for a liveaction freshening up it observes a few rules jettison the musical numbers erase the slapstick delete the racism and lastly give the grownups something to chew on what is harder is to fill the void with content both kids and grownups will enjoy especially if steering clear of a cultural faux pas is high on the priority list with this film disney has decided to play it safe the theme of female empowerment similar to the one that drives 2019s aladdin drives this movie as well but while the tale set in the middle east soars the one in ancient china sinks the 2020 mulan adaptation suffers from the problem that also plagued 2019s dumbo based on the 1941 childrens classic an update that felt more like a mummification for starters a choice was made to have everyone speak english in a simplified nonidiomatic manner this is an odd decision because if you want characters in ancient china to speak english you might as well go all in and have them use the language as naturally and freely as aladdins characters do the next sin is oversinicising the exposition it is the verbal equivalent of crowding a set with oriental lanterns and calligraphic scrolls while an extra in a topknot slurps noodles from a bowl here it happens with qi mentioned with dismaying frequency as an explanation for mulans unfeminine ways if a wordcloud were to be made from the dialogue qi and family honour would fight for top place but the worst example of overdoing the gravitas must be the phrase loyal brave true uttered an excruciating number of times and now the title of the official song performed by christina aguilera putting aside how it is whats known as tattoo chinese  the clunky googletranslated text favoured by those seeking ethnic ink on their bodies  it is a mantra that sounds profound at first but meaningless if one takes five minutes to think it over a new character gong lis witch xian lang is an interesting new character who deserves a better story arc than the one given in the film director niki caro to her credit is adept at playing with shades of melancholy  there are a couple of tearjerking moments here  but she was handed a tough job
Sep 29 2020,positive,this mulan is more straightforward than subtle there are battles to be fought an emperor to aid and a girl embracing her power i wanted something more challenging artful disruptive
Sep 28 2020,negative,cold shallow and lackluster despite breathtaking cinematography and costume design
Sep 25 2020,positive, autumn is well and truly here the days are getting colder and the nights are getting darker but if theres one positive to fewer evenings out and more evenings in its catching up on these epic movies under a blanket with a hot cuppa the terminator franchise looked a goner following 2015s botched and baffling reboot terminator genisys but this cracking new entry brings the scifi action thriller series thrillingly back to life ignoring the last three instalments the movie recreates the irresistible kinetic drive of the first two terminator films and also sees the return 28 years on of linda hamilton as kickass heroine sarah connors this time connors is joined by an even more unflinching female hero  an enhanced human soldier named grace played with rangy athleticism and sweaty determination by mackenzie davis graces role is a familiar one echoing the first two terminator movies she has been sent from the future to protect the person who holds the key to humanitys survival from the agent of a homicidal artificial intelligence humanitys big hope is gutsy hispanic factory worker dani ramos natalia reyes whom we encounter in the mexico city of 2020 and the remorseless and unstoppable killing machine that is out to get her played with implacable menace by gabriel luna is a terminator rev9 model sent back from 2042 by now you will of course be experiencing a strong feeling of déja vu but director tim miller deadpool and his team positively revel in their movies repetitions and sprinkle dark fate with plenty of knowing callbacks to the earlier films the biggest of these is arnold schwarzenegger whose role i will leave you to discover james cameron is also back incidentally as a cowriter and producer despite arnies presence dark fate remains a determinedly femaledriven film and its trio of badass heroines are brilliant maxine peake lets rip as a brash and bolshie northerner who gets out from under the heel of her abusive husband to become a standup comedian in 1970s britain the audiences at the gritty working mens clubs she plays dont know whats hit them  and neither does paddy considines smitten book shop owner there are laughs and tears here plus an achingly beautiful soundtrack by richard hawley while peakes defiant heroine has enough brass to keep a doorknob factory going for months washed ashore on a desert island following a nautical disaster kiersey clemmonss jenn shows pluck and resourcefulness as she gets to grips with the exigencies of survival from lighting fires to spearing fish being alone is terrifying enough but she comes to realise chillingly that she is sharing the island with an unseen predator this taut little thriller from genre specialists blumhouse starts off as a castawaytype survival adventure and then turns into a gulpinducing horror movie the film is most effective in its first half before we discover the exact nature of the threat jenn faces but clemenss gutsy largely solo performance keeps us gripped all the way an absolute dead ringer in the role renée zellweger is uncannily good as judy garland in this fascinating biopic of the legendary star like the recent laurel

Sep 22 2020,positive, long ago in china during the time of emperors hua mulan yifei liu is a young woman of marriageable age although her rural village is small a matchmaker peipei cheng is employed to find her a suitable husband the problem is mulan excels in martial arts and doesnt want to be married this stresses her mother hua li rosalind chao but her sister hua xiu xana tang admires her the other females in the village however look down on mulan when the matchmaking efforts fall apart along the silk road trade route the warrior böri khan jason scott lee leads his rouran hoards toward the imperial city to take over china leaving devastation in his path in response the emperor jet li commands that one male from every family must join the imperial army to stop khan but mulans father hua zhou tzi ma a hero who was injured in previous wars only has two daughters so he must join the army mulan cannot accept her fathers sacrifice she steals his sword a gift from the emperor with the words loyal brave and true engraved on the blade to describe zhous character she dresses like a young man and makes the treacherous journey to the training camp where she joins other young men who have been conscripted to fight khan khan has a secret weapon however a witch xianniang li gong who is a shapeshifter and is employed to cause havoc so khan wins his battles xianniang was cast out from her village as a child because of her abilities and khan took her in and gave her a home recognizing her powers as no one else ever had mulan successfully hides her gender but because she will not shower the men in her unit complain about how badly she smells chen honghui yoson an a young man in her unit admires mulan but she does not want to be friends with anyone she does promise her unit however that they will be safe in the battle to come mulan is the best liveaction film to come from disney in a very long time directed by niki caro who gave us the luminous whale rider in 2002 about another young girl called to leadership revisits familiar thematic territory with a much larger budget i first watched mulan on my 18inch computer screen but it deserves a very large screen because there is so much to take in the beauty of the cinematography by mandy walker is incomparable and the soundtrack includes melodies from disneys 1998 animated version of mulan rather than the songs themselves usually too many writers spoil the soup so to say and with four writers disney took a big chance at losing or skewing the plot as they did with its 2012 film brave rick jaffa amanda silver lauren hynek and elizabeth martin wrote the screenplay that some critics feel favored action over character development i was engaged in the story from beginning to end looking to see if the narrative would fall into the disney romance trap or present an authentic heroic character i think the current mulan as played by lui is a young woman her father family and village could be proud of at first glance it might seem like the film fails this test but looking carefully you can see that mulan has a strong and authentic human feminist theme guiding it the answer is yes to the first question yes to question two though the conversation starts out about men and marriage and possible romance but moves soon enough to family community and the greater good as for question three the women all talk about a man because the culture dictated that marriage was how men and women lived their lives though never enthusiastic about possible marriage once her father was conscripted to the army mulan believes her call to take his place transcends whatever good the security of a successful match might give her carrying through the feminist theme the juxtaposition between mulan and xianniang proves to be one of the high points of the film they begin as adversaries with xianniang who morphs into a hawk when needed threatening mulan because women are not allowed to be powerful but mulan calls out xianniang to be her best self letting go of the trauma and bitterness of her childhood and servitude to khan if you look carefully at this masked character and the beautiful tiara she wears it is made out of chains actually both women are hiding their identity mulan with her clothing and hair knotted in a bun and xianniang with her mask their motivations however are very different neither character becomes free or fully a woman until they have the courage to reveal their true identity birds are used as important symbols throughout the story the film opens with a young mulan chasing down a renegade chicken and xianniang turning into a predatory hawk a negative view of womans power and ends with the phoenix a positive feminist symbol of beauty and sacrificial strength in an era when truth is a precious commodity and lying or deception in the public square is becoming more normalized because there are almost no consequences mulans deception offers viewers something important to talk about sure its just a story but cinematic stories tell us who we are and who we ought to be says georgetown university professor and author theresa sanders this film offers us a chance to ask what i might have done in a similar circumstance such as being jewish in germany during world war ii or being a christian who is asked to hide people the government is hunting down films are a moral laboratory after all and a perfect space to talk about things that matter sr rose pacatte a member of the daughters of st paul is the founding director of the pauline center for media studies in los angeles mulan is available for purchase on disney
Sep 22 2020,negative,a live action mulan actually does lend itself to them doing some pretty great things but its so similar to the animation with nothing that made the animation endearing and charming
Sep 22 2020,positive,disney got it right with mulanthis version is respectful borrowing from the chinese auteursno silly songs or talking dragonterrific
Sep 22 2020,positive,unlike some movies in the 100million club mulan puts the money on the screen

Sep 17 2020,negative, from the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes cultured vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming join cultured vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling whether its wwe news or something from across the sea lets talk shop full disclosure i havent seen any of the disney liveaction remakes since the jungle book which i enjoyed because i either felt like they looked bad lion king or i just wasnt interested beauty and the beast i hope the fact that im neither all in on the remakes nor think theyre all garbage gives this negative review credibility because i was genuinely interested in mulan and had pretty high hopes for it i mean how could i not have high hopes the liveaction mulan showed so much promise the cast is filled with martial artists who have made classic martial arts and wuxia films its based on one of the most iconic disney renaissance movies and as weve seen from trailers and posters the costumes and sets are impeccably designed but all of these points of praise turn against the movie as it either fails to capitalize on them properly or pushes them beyond their breaking point the cast boasts donnie yen jet li and gong li all of whom have starred in martial arts and wuxia films these are actors that can do incredible choreography for a camera and this is no exception for mulan it is clear that a lot went into these action sequences but for some reason the oftcited complaint about far too much cutting during action remains a problem for this film that has great choreography and performers who can make it look amazing watching bad or mediocre action be cut to hell is one thing but when you can see that these action scenes could have been great its almost painfully disappointing to be fair there is one great action sequence in the film when mulan liu yifei and a band of other imperial soldiers give chase to the rouran villains who acrobatically flip around on their horses to shoot at their pursuers we get to see some great horseback action choreography in all its glory without the hindrance of constant crosscutting like the other disney classics the original mulan is iconic for its music and i would say that one song in particular has stood the test of time as an important piece of modern movie and internet culture yet the remake has no musical sequences instead only hinting at some of the original songs through the score the most we get is an orchestral version of reflection that plays a few times throughout the film but theres not even a hint of ill make a man out of you and i cannot understand who in the creative process or at the disney offices decided that the most beloved song from the original movie should be entirely erased from this remake this erasure of ill make a man out of you along with the loss of the other musical numbers would be disappointing no matter what but given that we hear hints of honor to us all and that the orchestral reflection plays as a refrain throughout the movie it makes the absence of the most culturally important and beloved song from the original more glaring and frustrating its undeniable that a lot of work went into the costumes and sets for the film and all of them look beautiful but at a number of points the movie magic slips away and things begin to look too artificial this is especially a problem with the films presentation of the sky there are so many scenes in the film where the sky is such an astoundingly bright mix of colors that it really just makes the viewer conscious of the fact that these visuals were created on a soundstage in front of a green screen theres a scene towards the end in particular that takes place on a bridge in front of one such tooglorious sky thats reminiscent of the i gotta go my own way bridge sequence in high school musical 2 its confusing to me that the disney channel original movie with its sparkling reflective water in the background looks better than this us200 million epic sadly these major issues that arise from what could and should have been positives arent the only ones that drag it down throughout the film most often during action scenes the edges of the screen blur into soft focus recreating the worst aspect of netflixs chilling adventures of sabrina instead of updating or even acknowledging mushu the remake has a phoenix that flies around every so often and leads the movie to give us a new version of the memed to death this shot is brilliant shot from game of thrones the romance with the very charming honghui yoson an that is overwhelmingly the best thing about this remake isnt properly resolved and ends up feeling very unsatisfying and theres even a moment of bad dubbing that feels like the creators just gave up and said ah its good enough i really wanted to like this movie mulan is one of my favorite disney animated films and this remake has so many great components but it fails to even be the sum of those parts it left me wondering who this was for the absence of the songs make it not nearly as fun as the original animated film and the undermining of the action with bad editing makes those sequences pale in comparison with the other action films some of the stars have been in mostly this just left me wanting to rewatch the original

Sep 16 2020,positive, drama starring yifei liu and donnie yen with china threatened by invaders the emperor declares that one man from each family must step up to help defend the country but with her warrior father in ill health fearless young woman hua mulan decides to pose as a man take his place and fight for her nation a young woman poses as a man to join the imperial chinese armys fight against fearsome invaders but her subterfuge brings the risk of exposure and shame for her family in disneys engrossing liveaction adventure the approach is more serious than in the studios 1998 animated version of the story theres no wisecracking minidragon sidekick for starters and an equalrights agenda adds to the gravitas kiwi director niki caro whale rider takes her cinematic cues from zhang yimous noted wuxia epics hero and house of flying daggers replicating their intoxicating blend of exquisite historical chinese visuals and inventive cgiassisted action to deliver this within a familyfriendly package is no mean feat and credit should go to yifei liu who gives a vulnerableyetdashing central turn as mulan while gong li adds complexity as an outcast sorceress perhaps a smidgen more humour wouldnt have gone amiss but this is imaginative eyepopping cinema winningly open to the riches of chinese culture and stirring in its feminist engagement
Sep 15 2020,negative, mulan 12 115 minutes pg after much hyping and many delays disneys muchanticipated historical girlpower action drama has finally landed and what a thud it makes mulan is disneys 200 million liveaction remake of its wonderful 1998 animated hit regrettably its chief achievement  as with the studios remakes of aladdin beauty and the beast the jungle book and dumbo  is that it reminds us just how good the original was kiwi director niki caro zookeepers wife whale rider north country fills the film with a lot of brash colour and highflying movement but not a lot of emotion or energy weighing the film down no end is the character of mulan for all her fighting skills and warrior spirit our heroine is difficult to warm to as she slices and slashes her way to the films climactic faceoff she may have an independent spirit but she is given no inner life by the stonyfaced lead performance from yufei liu who twirls through the film with one stern expression possibly two frozen on her face shes a tough cookie we know but does she have to be such a cold fish she is presented as such a stolid ice maiden warrior theres no real vulnerability to her the saga of mulan is set long ago in a semimagical time of war where a young girl with superhuman fighting abilities pretends to be a boy so she can join the imperial army and do battle with her nations enemies the emperor jet li is threatened by a band of ruthless horseriding bad guys who like piling the helmeted heads of their victims into neat stacks to intimidate the populace their leader bori khan jason scott lee is an especially motivated gent determined to avenge the death of his father by penetrating the imperial palace and slicing the emperor into several pieces  bori khans guys are fearsome enough they ride mighty steeds wear imposing black garb and have nifty archery skills wherein they can bullseye a pursuing adversary while riding backwards on their horses on top of this they have a supernatural ally in xianniang gong li an attractive witch arent they all with heavy eye makeup who has the ability to change form her creature of choice being an allseeing eagle yet the witch has a hidden agenda while shes meant to be bad to the bone xianniang has an overpowering personal interest in mulan and her remarkable strength called chi or qi her hunger to partner with mulan leads to a lot of familiarsounding star warslike chatter about this allencompassing forcelike chi energy you halfexpect obi wan to do a walk on in battle mulan acquits herself with exceptional skill but when the inevitable moment comes and her true identity is revealed her fellow soldiers are thrown into a tizz unable to reconcile her heroic feats with the fact that shes not a bloke even given the license we grant a magictinged film such as mulan its a stretch to swallow how the face of a beautiful smoothskinned young woman can go unnoticed amidst all the rough features and facial hair of her fellow soldiers none of whom ever whispers to another hey does that dude look like a lady or what the ruse worked in animation but not here putting a bit of schmutz on her face certainly doesnt do the trick it makes the training sequences look like an elongated blooper and those training sequences are long and largely unnecessary we know from the getgo that mulan possesses seemingly superhuman abilities when it comes to jumping leaping flipping balancing running kicking and swordsmanship or should that be swordspersonship so why does her prowess need to be restated so many times wheres a good training montage when you need it have the rocky films taught us nothing this underscores another major flub in the adaptation from the 1998 film mulan was not a born soldier and so had to work hard to prove herself that made her journey tougher and thus far more interesting so why gift mulan mkii with innate fighting skills it robs her character of growth and challenge its another point of departure from the original that turns mulan into an expensive bland out the most unenviable hurdle faced by mulan is its desire to stage great battle scenes but within the confines of a family film it wants so badly to deliver impressive handtohand clashes yet has to dial down the violence to hang on to its allimportant pg rating its a tough trade off with the sweeping aerial shots of warriors charging across the landscape no problem up close however well there clearly cant be any geysers of blood or brutal dismemberment you cant dwell on all the stabbing and the spearing and the slicing thats obviously going on hence the killing has to be muted and abstracted with fast editing yet it all still looks a tad phony especially when mulan neutralizes her enemies just by whacking them them one kick and down they go there are lots of armoured soldiers on horseback and on foot engaged in a cacophany of clanging  sounding much like somebody rifling through a cutlery drawer  but theres nothing particularly thrilling in the cinematography by mandy walker australia hidden figures lantana which is very mannered and conventional we never get the sense of grandeur we saw in the battle scenes from peter jacksons lord of the rings films nor the tension stanley kubrick generated in that classic skirmish in barry lyndon when it comes to seeing mulan as a girlpower film championing the cause of female action heroes who can hold their own and have minds of their own and thrive on their spirit of independence well  yeah we got that weve had it for decades now these are powerful themes to have driving a narrative but filmmakers need to work much harder to make them play naturally onscreen and to stop making out as though theyre anything new after all crouching tiger hidden dragon and its magnificent kickass women is 20 years old indeed the making of that girlpower classic was inspired by the success of the original mulan which demonstrated the massmarket appeal of strong actionmovie female leads most studios have made the costly decision to wait out the virus before unleashing their big films these include such popcorn sellers as wonder woman 1984 no time to die  fast  furious 9 black widow ghostbusters afterlife candyman and a quiet place 2 in a normal world mulan probably would have made about 800m to a billion in cinemas then once it had soaked up every last cent from its theatrical run it would have been released into the stream where it would have made a comparable amount of dough so by going straight into the stream the film carries the daunting burden of needing to make around twice what it would normally make in its home market release to reclaim the revenue it was denied at the box office thus the expense of seeing it on tv should mulan eventually get the numbers it would normally have done it wont be the game changer many predict the movie business is way too conservative for that it might lower the level of anxiety about releasing big films straight into the stream but one successful case wouldnt be enough to create a new business model never forget studios will not easily surrender the beautiful billions they make at the cinema before sending films to the lounge room they want those crowded houses should mulan tank forget about seeing any of 2020s other big films at home in the near future no studio head would have the stones to declare we shall succeed where mulan failed not with billions at stake almost any film with a global profile draws heat of one sort or another and mulan is no exception eddies of controversy have graced the films release with some souls in the lgbtetc community upset that the romantic fizz between mulan and her superior in the original film has largely vanished in this one but for a passing hint there have even been grumbles that the film wasnt directed by an asian ang lee life of pi brokeback mountain sense  sensibility was apparently approached but couldnt do it due to scheduling conflicts hmm given that he directed crouching tiger hidden dragon one wonders what wonders he would have brought to the table those sold on the hype might justify paying 35 to see mulan at home but is it worth it an idea might be to cram as many people in front of the screen to help make it a viewing event but its probably better to wait until 4 december when you can see mulan on disney at no extra charge thatd be the best call

mary baker eddy put it here youll find awardwinning journalism not driven by commercial influences  a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope after months in limbo the liveaction mulan claims its place as the best disney remake to date with so much riding on its success mulan dared to be different honoring not one but two source materials  the beloved 1998 animated film and the chinese folk song ballad of mulan  and creating an entertaining movie that stands on its own  the story will be familiar to fans when her weakened father hua zhou played by tzi ma is called to serve in a second war mulan liu yifei disguises herself as a man and joins the imperial army in his place if discovered she faces the death penalty she steals his armor and sword which in this telling has three words inscribed on the blade loyal brave and true this becomes the films guiding mantra as mulan tries to embody these values in a society that makes no room for a female warrior the film is a visual masterpiece shot in new zealand it is full of rich colors and textures from start to finish every costume set and even prop is beautifully crafted transporting viewers into a highly saturated version of sixthcentury china in battle cannons and sword fights play second fiddle to beautifully choreographed martial arts characters run sideways along walls flip headoverheals on horseback and dodge arrows à la the matrix with all the dramatic slowmotion shots youd expect from a classic martial arts movie its thrilling to watch and an impressive accomplishment for director niki caro  in 1998 the animated film mulan offered a generation of young girls a new kind of role model one who defied gender norms and expectations disneys liveaction remake stumbles in spots but holds true to that legacy of empowerment the lack of shotforshot fidelity to the animated classic will inevitably disappoint some viewers there is no mushu shang or sassy grandma a training montage scored by an instrumental version of reflection the hit song from the original film is an ultimately underwhelming nod to the 90s movie but thats ok  unlike her animated counterpart this mulan is already a skilled fighter a natural master of chi the energy connecting all living things its a quality that is demonized in women and celebrated in men  the most rewarding change is the villains instead of the onedimensional huns this movie sticks to the original legend by centering on a vengeful nomadic group known as the rourans the rourans are assisted by enslaved witch xian lang played brilliantly by gong li in a parallel to mulans chi xian langs gifts are feared by men like a sheep in wolfs clothing xian lang is an interesting mix of enemy and ally when she and mulan first meet on the battlefield she sees right through mulans disguise your deceit weakens you she tells her which inspires mulan to reveal her identity helping chip away at that question about loyalty bravery and truth  still the film is far from perfect a couple of the fight scenes felt hastily cut attempts at humor rarely land and strangely i dont recall a single drop of blood in the entire movie most distracting for me was the hamhanded bird imagery mulan is followed by a multicolored computergenerated phoenix that acts as a sort of spirit guide frequently swooping in and yanking attention away from the breathtaking cinematography xian lang also transforms herself into a hawk or flock of crows often all together these effects felt a bit overdone the opposite is true for the lead actress while her costars were busy emoting liu kept mulans face too restrained theres nothing wrong with taking a subtle route but with every other element of this film being so over the top it was jarring to have the main character maintain such a neutral facade ultimately the most moving scenes revolve around family particularly those between mulan and her father this movie takes time to develop their relationship offering viewers insight into the pain of raising a child in a world that simply is not built for her as the narrator hua zhou puts these family relationships front and center securing the movies status as a timeless retelling of the female warrior folktale  and his opening words are a good reminder for mulan fans and new viewers alike there have been many tales of the great warrior mulan  this one is mine editors note while reportedly much of mulan was shot in new zealand in its opening weekend filmmakers revealed that some research was done in xinjiang in china and authorities in the region were also thanked in the credits that is controversial because of human rights concerns about the treatment of the uyghur population there claims that the movie was filmed in the region have followed disney had not commented as of sept 9 monitor journalism changes lives because we open that

Sep 13 2020,positive, a new telling of the narrative poem the ballad of mulan which also inspired the 1998 animated film yifei liu stars as hua mulan a young woman who risks her life and her familys honor to save her father from conscription in the imperial army a war hero in his day zhou tzi ma is now an old man living with age and injuries from the battles of his own youth when the emperor orders one man from every family to join the army zhou who only has daughters knows he is dutybound to serve but mulan sneaks away in the night disguises herself as a man and takes her fathers place myths and fairy tales are full of stories about daring young women who dont fit into their prescribed societal roles they fight norms and expectations to forge their own paths mulans motivation doesnt come from her own innate sense of destiny or inner feelings of suppressed greatness but of a simple desire to protect her father not unlike belle from beauty and the beast mulan willingly gives up her own future to save him but where belles sacrifice involved a castle and a giant library and servants mulans sends her into war against a deadly enemy niki caro takes great care to set the scene of mulans quaint life we first meet her as a precocious young girl who is clearly different from her younger sister she is especially close with her father who appreciates all the things that make her so unique even while having to break the news that her lifes duty will be to get married one day it could have been a heavyhanded and cliched conversation but the tender moment between father and daughter rests under the comforting weight that they both know this is an unfair expectation as her older marriageable self the pageantry of tradition receives a lighthearted touch her face is painted shes wrapped in traditional dress her long flowing hair is tied up into a knot on top of her head and she shuffles her way to the matchmakers house for tea the silliness of the scene is not to mock these ancient traditions but to portray mulans lack of attachment to customs that would require her to become a painted doll and judged for her marital worthiness caro finds the delicate balance between the importance of tradition and the need some have to unburden themselves from it yifei liu presents herself as a stoic leading lady rarely revealing her true emotions about anything and certainly never when anyone is around to see it it is trait women rarely get to portray as the strong quiet types are usually reserved for men liu does so with a level of grace and dignity that never leaves us questioning whether mulan has feelings only what they are liu is also surrounded by a talented cast of supporting actors including donnie yen yoson an jun yu and ron yuan as well as jason scott lee and gong li these supporting performances are good even if the characters themselves are virtually indistinguishable standardissue military commanders conscripted soldiers bad guys two scenes between liu and li however are particularly compelling for what they dont say almost as much as for what they do say the performances and wellknown story would be enough to make mulan an enjoyable movie but it isnt merely enjoyable it is a film to be savored mandy walkers stunning cinematography showcases majestic landscapes and mountain ranges the serenity of a small lake the delicate porcelain of a teacup breaking grant majors production design captures scale and scope from a small rural village to the emperors sprawling gilded palace he and costume designer bina daigeler developed a striking color palette perfectly suited to a historical epic tinged with elements of fantasy the use of color also makes this liveaction telling feel more closely related though entirely separate from its animated sister in this age of liveaction remakes of animated favorites mulan stands out from the rest not only for its beauty and grandeur but for its overwhelming sense of necessity and importance like its heroine this is a film that forges its own path and is content to be its own magnificent creation
Sep 13 2020,positive, when disney announced they would be making a live action version of mulan many people were in an uproar  some because characters changed others for fear the film would be whitewashed  walt disney pictures and screenwriters rick jaffa amanda silver lauren hynek and elizabeth martin came through with a film that both honored the spirit of ballad of mulan as well as the 1998 animated feature when we first meet young mulan in live action she chases a chicken onto a roof much to the dismay of her entire village  the only person even remotely proud is her father until he realizes it wasnt honorable for a young lady  crystal rao plays young mulan in a couple scenes but still gives a great performance  tzi ma man in the high castle the farewell plays mulans father hua zhou with another great performance mulans mother hua li is sternly yet lovingly portrayed by rosalind chao who trekkies may know as keiko obrien liu yifei is great as mulanher fighting skills and up close work really convey mulans struggles  instead of li shang from the 1998 animated film we get donnie yen playing commander tung  as always he kicks butt while adding some mentorship without the problematic romantic undertones for those who miss li shangs attraction to mulan enter the adorable yoson as chen honghui a corecruit of mulan who makes the same googly eyes at her the entire movie during training one of the commanders says ill make men out of every single one of you harkening back to the song ill make a man out of you from the cartoon jason scott lee portrays charismatic rouran leader bori khan based on shan yu from the animated film gong li plays xian lang a shapeshifting witch who is an ally to bori khan  we get a cameo from jet li as the emperor of china  he has been noticeably absent from film in recent years thankfully his youngest daughter convinced him to take it  he mostly sits on a golden throne and gives orders but he does get do a bit of fighting while none of director niki caros setups are particularly groundbreaking they are still well done at conveying the story  she mixes beautiful wide sweeping shots with more upclose intimate scenes caro and her team did do an excellent job showing chinese culture with elaborate sets and gorgeous costumes  the presentation of loyal brave true and devotion represent the long time values of chinas people  although it is about war this film is for the most part family friendly  if you allow your children to watch superhero movies mulan is more friendly paying 2999 for this film on top of a disney subscription might not be your cup of tea but if you have a subscription and can wait until it is released watch it when you can mulan on disney is not a musical and characters have been changed from the 1998 film but it still honored the spirit of ballad of mulan as well as the animated feature
Sep 13 2020,negative, its impossible not to be conscious of the politics surrounding the release of disneys flying martial arts picturesque liveaction remake of mulan a noisy campaign to boycott the film has been growing since its star chinese actor liu yifei voiced support for the hong kong police during the citys prodemocracy protests last year culminating with this weeks revelation that it was partly filmed in xinjiang where human rights abuses are alleged against muslim uygurs disneys transparent desire to capitalise on the chinese market  with a faithfully unquestioning stance  explains the watereddown adaptation which appeases more than it excites in this new take on the epic genderflipping chinese tale solemnity takes precedence over lighthearted comedy whats lost from the studios delightfully fun original 1998 animation  encapsulated by eddie murphys vibrant minidragon sidekick mushu  is shimmered over with a grand multimilliondollar treatment mulans story originated as a chinese 5th or 6thcentury poem the ballad of mulan by guo maoqian in which the most likely fictional female warrior hua mulan takes her fathers place when the emperor enlists one man from each family to serve in the imperial army to defend the empire from northern invaders as a popular childrens folk story mulan has been seen as the chinese equivalent of frances joan of arc and for centuries has inspired chinese retellings in films novels plays and operas most recently in the eponymous 2009 film directed by jingle ma its bestknown western version is tony bancroft and barry cooks 1998 englishlanguage animated film an adaptation that also connected particularly with asianamerican and other diasporic audiences new zealandborn niki caro whale rider the zookeepers wife directs the animations liveaction remake as a cinematic largescale event with gravitas and occasional familyfriendly whimsy its a combination that leaves the film unchallengingly palatable although spectacularly goodlooking with characters springing fully fleshed from their twodimensional animation equivalents with some changes to boot rick jaffa amanda silver lauren hynek and elizabeth martins screenplay seizes this opportunity to sketch out the ingrained values that propel mulan to her ultimate humble victory the retelling embeds a reflexive play on its narrator who at the start of the film acknowledges that there are many tales of mulan  this one is mine the identity of this omniscient narrator is mulans father hua zhou but the ambiguity of his statement seems to be less of a selfcritical nod to its allwhite writing and directing team and more of a shield against any potential criticisms of cultural inauthenticity or historical inaccuracy the overall narrative trajectory of the film mirrors its model the film opens with mulan as a child chasing an escaped chicken through her home village when she gleefully catches the bird shes immediately reprimanded for the disorder shes caused while theres some fleeting pride on her fathers face tzi ma in yet another poignant hardfacedbutsoftontheinside dad figure the judgemental titters from the village quickly turn that feeling to shame in the films present time line mulan is now a young woman  her powers squandered her personality concealed her mother hua li played by the joy luck clubs rosalind chao teaches mulan to hide her gift as a form of protection and instead to bring honour to family as a daughter destined for marriage but mulans refusal to bow to the pressure to be a quiet composed woman sees her bolting away on her horse in the dead of night determined to save her ailing father at the risk of her own life its difficult to watch caros film and not nitpick the changes between the animation and the liveaction film as disneys recent string of remakes have often emphasised nostalgia over originality jon favreaus 2019 the lion king included scenes that replicated its animated predecessor shot for shot on the other hand caros take on mulans story goes beyond the purist definition of adaptation opening new facets on mulans gritty journey to respected warrior there are minor adjustments such as the inclusion of mulans younger sister to more significant changes in particular the splitting up of her previous love interest captain li shang into an older commander tung donnie yen and a younger ally chen honghui yoson an it leads to one of the films moreawkwardthanfunny scenes in which honghui catches mulan bathing in a lake he offers her a truce as equals as she desperately turns her back to him attempting to conceal that she is a woman the differing attributes of the two versions are tied less to any creative liberties and more to the tone and spirit that underpin each of them the lively 1998 animation had an amusing tongueincheek flavour with the inclusion of matthew wilder and david zippels melodic ballad reflection and the catchy bootcamp song ill make a man out of you these songs emotionally express respectively mulans cathartic questioning of her identity and the transformative empowerment that comes with overcoming physical adversities caros film fades these tunes into the background of harry gregsonwilliams thrumming orchestral score as mere whispering reminders this furrowedbrow seriousness also leaves the tracking of mulans triumph over her male counterparts to explicit dialogue  commander tung literally says we are going to make men out of all of you  and earnest training montages in skimping the comic antics attached to mulans mistaken identity the film also sacrifices any angsty romantic confusion between mulan and honghui which had a hand in fostering shangs character development in the animated version the films sombre wartime mood is however aesthetically exquisite in an attempt to create a wuxia film  a martial arts storytelling genre with a long tradition in chinese culture  the script sneaks in superficial mentions of the power of chi that spell out the need for mulan to harness chi to truly flourish as a warrior what taps into the genre more successfully are the detailed production design and martial arts choreography with slowmotion lifts into the air with red drapery impressive arrowdodging wallclimbing and rooftopjumping on imperial palaces mandy walkers cinematography slickly turns the camera all degrees and angles to capture its heroines gravitydefying movements perhaps on the big screen the theatricality of its action would have appeared more dazzling  nevertheless on the small screen as its released on disney its still strikingly elegant liu largely plays mulan as staid and unsmiling which works in this version as theres nothing much to laugh about liu and gong li  in the role of xianniang a shapeshifting sorceress who has crossed to the dark side  are chinese stars who bridge the hollywood gap acting in a film where the asian cast members speak in accented english in the light of the two actors local backgrounds it presents an intriguing parallel with their characters duality as women vilified for their special powers as a slave to jason scott lees onedimensional villain böri khan whose vengeance story is relatively pedestrian xianniangs insecurities are given vulnerable depths ironically although screen legend gong is easily the strongest actor in caros ensemble her character ultimately must play second fiddle to khan gong invests xianniang with a yearning to be accepted a feeling that mulan fights under her desire to break free of her disguise caro taps into that sensitivity highlighting how female submissiveness can become conditioned and internalised by anyone however shortlived the blurring between good and evil poses a moral question for mulan allowing her to emerge as a fuller more realistic leader who has considered the complexities of her choices while mulans adventures as she wields her sword across desert battlefields are more for spectacle than to represent any real progressiveness caros film still stands as a welcome refreshment among disneys repertoire of remakes the drama may follow the studio rule book of underscoring the same simple message over and over  this time its loyal brave and true as well as the overused asian principle of family honour  but the overall effect is easy enough to swallow if you overlook

Sep 12 2020,positive, i want to remind everyone that im in my 14th year as a film critic and am a voting member of the critics choice awards im happy also to tell you that ive been accepted as press to cover the toronto international film festival this year stay tuned for updates first up mulan a stunningly gorgeous film about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to fight in the emperors army yifei liu stars as mulan a brave devoted daughter tzi ma stars as her father its the folk tale of hua mulan and disneys stunning liveaction retelling of a woman who disguises herself as a man to fight for her king and country unlike in the 1998 animated version mulan joins the army not only to spare her father but also because she has astonishing fighting moves mulan discovers shell never unleash her chiinner energy she realizes if she wants to lead she must confess to her commander that she is a female her journey is intertwined with that of another woman with unusual abilities disneys recent remakes have fallen short in the script department mulan has the girl empowerment story and the stunning visuals im way in four stars out of four mulan raises the bar in disney sequels this one is outstanding the strong gorgeous storyline for mulan the female character sets a wonderful role model for all girls worldwide
Sep 12 2020,negative, the slick and stylish remake admirably takes a different approach than its predecessors in the recent parade of disney liveaction adaptations of the studios animated classics by straying further from the 1998 original thats a worthwhile endeavor but the transformation of a lighthearted comingofage story into a darker battle epic generally fails to take the material in a compelling new direction while subtly streamlining cultural specifics for mainstream consumption the story takes place in china many centuries ago when the title character yifei liu has the physical gifts of a great warrior yet her gender renders her ineligible to serve on the imperial army even with the country on the brink of war when the emperor jet li decrees that a man from each clan must serve mulans ailing father tzi ma is forced to volunteer wanting to break free from rigid patriarchal customs mulan disguises herself as a man in order to infiltrate the army and save her father this version of mulan deviates from the kidfriendly tone of its source material by jettisoning the musical numbers and the romantic subplot it also replaces the wisecracking dragon sidekick with a soaring phoenix whose presence brings with it some obvious metaphors the thinly sketched if wellintentioned tale of female empowerment spotlights a toughminded character whos resilient and courageousa worthy role model for girls from any cultural background plus lius spirited portrayal generates sympathy for mulans perilous mission and her ethical dilemma still the androgynous scheme is less convincing in liveaction form particularly when compared to the vivid intensity of the battle scenes as directed by kiwi filmmaker niki caro whale rider the film is highlighted by pristine production values including gorgeous cinematography and a dazzling array of visual effects as a war movie its oversimplified and predictable if occasionally chilling however the intimate characterdriven sequences resonate more powerfully in reflecting mulans journey to acceptance and selfdiscovery the film amps up the violent swordplay and combat action  along with the requisite slow motion for gimmicky emphasis  yet lacks the narrative depth and dramatic urgency to match its visual splendor
Sep 11 2020,positive,the stunning natural vistas and jawdropping pg13 action sequences make this a film every member of the family is likely to enjoy
Sep 11 2020,positive, i am very much a nonfan of disneys adventure in mounting liveaction versions of its animated films with the exception of 2016s the jungle book the mouse has not yet found good creative reasons for any of these doovers and these movies have played like unintentional selfparody they are the hollywood equivalent of what weve seen in politics in recent years those whove always had miserable motives for their words and actions no longer feel the need to pretend otherwise and are saying what had previously been the unsaid quiet parts out loud with these mostly tedious reboots disney is not even hiding the fact that its business these days is grabbing cash however it can small wonder then its new version of mulan does not in fact play like an unintentional parody alas it doesnt play as much of anything else even as it diverges from the original cartoon in more substantial ways than its liveactionremake predecessors have and yet this is not the distinguishing mark that it might have been i felt that the silliness of the 1998 cartoon and the insipid songs tacked on to force it into the disneymusical category undermined the serious side of the tale it was telling the limp music and the goofy sidekicks are gone here but they havent been replaced with something else were left with a tale that is so solemn that it avoids almost all humor and it doesnt have much life either we still have young mulan yifei liu the forbidden kingdom chafing at the limitations placed upon her as a girl in imperial china where the only way she can bring honor to her family is by becoming a silent obedient wife to a man she wont even get to choose for her husband an active lively young woman seeking another path to honor that also honors her own desires she disguises herself as a boy and sneaks off to take the place of her disabled father tzi ma arrival the campaign when the emperor jet li the expendables 3 the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor briefly calls up an army to repel invading huns its all fine she said with a sigh of resignation and of low expectations just barely exceeded mulan may be a bit too simple for adults and a bit too violent for kids  this is like a martialarts movie for gradeschoolers  but i guess that isnt the worst thing in the world if it gets western kids excited about asian cinema its all acceptably inoffensive if less than wholly engaging the big thing that mulan does get right is director niko caros mcfarland usa whale rider visual take on the legendary chinese figure it is refreshingly free of the sort of fetishization we often get when male directors take on female action heroes caro eschews too the exoticization of asian women that often afflicts western filmmaking three of the four screenwriters are also women amanda silver in the heart of the sea jurassic world elizabeth martin and lauren hynek rick jaffa rise of the planet of the apes is the fourth its a low bar but one that too many movies cannot seem to get over combined with lius stately central performance in which she exudes pride honor and a strength both physical and psychological it makes this mulan a wonderful role model for girls who arent much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations which is rare in childrens movies i do wish though that the movie was craftier about the spiritual connection between mulan and the witch xianniang an absolutely badass li gong hannibal rising curse of the golden flower who is allied with the huns the movie pops its head above the parapet just a tad for the idea of women having to hide all sorts of gifts if those gifts arent the ones women are supposed to have and then it instantly pulls it back down again but fine if the gender dynamics here arent as problematic as those of some disney movies there are other worrying matters some fans are calling for the film to be boycotted because of star lius public support for hong kong police and their violent crackdowns on prodemocracy protestors that may be a matter of how well a movie lover wants to  or is able to  separate the art from the artist far less ambiguous is disneys own tacit support for beijings genocide of uighur muslims in the xinjiang region of china where some of the film was shot the movies credits thank multiple propaganda departments in xinjiang for their assistance in the production that thing about saying the quiet part out loud it looks as if disney has decided that ensuring access to the newly lucrative chinese moviegoing market no matter what horrors beijing is engaged in is something it can openly court without damaging its business in the west can it mulan is the alliance of women film journalists movie of the week for september 11th read the comments from awfj members  including me  on why the film deserves this honor so none of the filmmakersnot the director nor any of the four screenwriters nor apparently the costume designerwere chinese this feels like a huge missed opportunity to have an asian story told by asian storytellers through an asian lens ive read complaints about how the film mishandles chinese culture this feels particularly inexcusable in an era where were pushing to have stories about poc told by poc and several successful films have already done so black panther crazy rich asians the farewell and many others i wonder how much more authentic and fresh and surprising the film could have been if thered been more asian creatives onboard behind the camera who could have helped to avoid western blind spots challenge tired western tropes and push the story in bold directions looked some more into this and wow they really didnt have a single chinese or east asian person in any significant leadership role behind the scenes the interview below with the costume designeri went to all the european museums with a china department and then went to china and soaked up chinese culture for three weeksis just cringeworthy how is this acceptable in this day and age can you imagine how much flak black panther would have gotten if it were made by an allwhite team how many justified complaints there would have been about ignoring all the black creative talent that was right there waiting to be tapped and more to the point how much shittier the film would have been as a result and considering that disney itself saw fit to have an oceanic story trust to ensure authenticity in moana its really surprising that they made zero effort here particularly when theyre trying to win over yknow audiences in china they didnt stop to consider that chinese people might be offended or at least unimpressed by foreigners trying to sell them their own story thats been in their bones for thousands of years sheesh when i watch things like niki caros mulan i see in it the way white americans see me accented mystical bound some would say hobbled by notions of honour drowned in centuries of arcane history and hipster appropriations of ancient concepts like chi for instance kung fu for another i am seen if i am seen by white americans as this collection of halfformed impressions and the vague notion of ineffable otherness mulan confirms that i am not like you and never will be and the pain of it makes it difficult for me to watch as ma wrote disney is now saying the quiet parts out loud by being open about its mercenary motives here and in china and the problem with these remakes is that the quiet parts and the loud parts have all been smoothed over into a moderate hum  to appeal to as many peoplecountries as possible disney has become unable to say anything important or inspire any intense emotions and when these characters cant speak important truths or be authentically emotional they start feeling like asian puppets with all their strings being pulled by wealthy white people engaged in some light trendy cultural tourism this is really fascinating to me because where i saw an asian protagonist who didnt seem otherized  at least compared to other hollywood depictions  an asianamerican did still see that  adding want to highly recommend this very thorough and nuanced piece by jeannette ng yes representation and lack of authenticity is an issue here but not the only one nor arguably the most pressing this is such a great essay and it really speaks to why it is so important that we get a truly wide diversity of voices talking about film and pop culture and everything because no matter how woke a middleaged white lady like me would like to think i am its not truly possible for me to write from a perspective that isnt my own and not truly possible for me to  appreciate how in this instance an ethnically asian westerner will see a movie like mulan needs to be said too we need multiple western asian and asian asian perspectives on this film and all films because there is no monolithic block of thinking anywhere in any culture or subculture yeah i had heard wrongly that this movie was going to be helmed by a chinese director and that was pretty much the only thing that raised my expectations above ground level not that making a movie with that central theme is a bad but it just seems like a really bizarre and bad choice to do it with this movie  its a story thats originally about a regular woman who just wants to keep her grandfather from being killed and manages to find the courage and gain the strength to succeed beyond anyones expectations even her own and they turned it into yet another chosen one narrative about someone born with superpowers and i think it undermines any feminism if the message is dont underestimate women  if they clearly have superpowers and you couldnt stop them if you tried
Sep 11 2020,positive,when the movie finds its groove and revels in the lush visuals and stirring heroics so widely associated with mulan all misgivings subside

Sep 11 2020,positive, when disney announced its liveaction mulan remake in 2015 some thought theyd set themselves an impossible task to win over new audiences while keeping fans of the original happy is no mean feat but to do it without any songs and no mushu eddie murphys fan favourite sidekick would be even tougher after covid19 put paid to its theatrical release cinemagoers will finally get to watch the new movie on disney this week can it deliver the goods in case you arent familiar mulan is the story of its eponymous heroine liu yifei a young woman living in rural china with her parents and younger sister when we first meet mulan she is a focused young girl whose energy flow  or chi  catches the eye of her concerned parents chi is for warriors not daughters she is told by her father hua zhou the farewells tzi ma before local villagers brand her shameful for displaying athleticism and a fiery independent spirit according to them mulan is destined to dishonour her family  and the only way to redemption lies through marriage in this society there is no place for a woman outside of the household the sad truth is that mulan knows she can bring honour to them all but is unable to do so in the way she feels natural through combat eventually she takes her handicapped fathers place in the imperial chinese army to spare him the stress and danger of battle disguised as a man she struggles with their unfamiliar world and the hardships of intense physical training while contending with her fellow recruits by the time she is ready for war a terrifying new threat has emerged in the form of vengeful rouran warrior bori khan jason scott lee in the original 1998 animation li shang mulans commander and love interest was tasked with getting chinas defending force in shape but here to much scepticism from fans shang has been omitted luckily splitting the role into two characters in the remake facilitates mulans character development commander tung donnie yen and friendly rival chen yoson an give her confidence and a level of respect she never receives from her family elsewhere new character xian lang gong li plays an integral part in shaping mulans actions a witch with shapeshifting powers she like mulan is a woman that struggled to suppress her chi however she chooses to embrace it and subsequently becomes an outcast to society eventually she is left with no other option than to ally with bori khan and use her powers for evil while she presents herself as another female fighter she shows mulan what could happen if she goes down the wrong path although xian provides the story with complexity bori khan unfortunately comes across as underdeveloped and onedimensional which makes the film less gripping for the most part though mulan is dominated by liu whose strong performance balances emotion with physical prowess visually director niki caro incorporates elements of martial arts films  or wuxia  to highlight her protagonists athletic ability elsewhere the story focuses on her character and spiritual development without being overly referential to the disney film director niki caros modern update may take things in a different direction but it makes mulan a more empowering character thanks to her creative eye and liu yifeis star turn mulan is the best liveaction disney adaptation to date
Sep 11 2020,negative,far from the most aesthetically bankrupt disney movie of the last few years
Sep 11 2020,positive, niki caros liveaction remake of the 1998 disney animated classic has arrived on disney as a premium title available to view for an additional 3999 aaron yap found enjoyment in watching mulan even if it could do with harnessing more of the daring exhibited by its titular genderswitching heroine disneys 300 million liveaction adaptation of their 1998 animated hit mulan has landedin my bedroom and thats okay understandably itll be difficult for some viewers to extricate the final product from the swirling cloud of politicallycharged controversy and circumstance thats plagued it for months thats okay too if the reservation is around the decision to dump a blockbuster of this scale onto a streaming platform on day onewell from this viewers standpoint it quickly dissipated its possible that the finer details of grant majors intricately layered production design cannot fully be appreciated on telly but theres also the realisation that were now all so accustomed to experiencing costly hbo spectacle like games of thrones at homeor on the busthat it feels just normal the film itself is an eminently watchable meticulously mounted period adventure thats good enough for you to wish that it was a little better it could do with harnessing more of the daring exhibited by its titular genderswitching heroine for better or worse mulan is a disney movie onbrand with broadly universal themes thatll slot in comfortably with any of their classic fairy tales or star wars instalments despite its chinese folklore origins its exactly what youd imagine a mouse house wu xia pic might be turning up to the party as handsomely crafted as money can buy but lacking the innate poetic grace and artistry of a king hu or zhang yimou epic and like most of their recent liveaction adaptations the film flattens out the imaginative quirkiness of their animated counterparts in pursuit of grittier realism you wont find characters suddenly bursting into song nor a cute cricket sidekick with a knack for inking chinese calligraphy here occasionally when it does veer into cartoonish slapsticksuch as the recreation of the originals matchmaking scenethe effect can be slightly jarring given the overridingly serious tone fortunately it remains a visually arresting entertainment with mandy walkers cinematography soaking the costumes sets and locations in an almostpsychedelic vibrancy that would pop off any screen regardless of size the fight choreography is serviceable not shredded to bits but also apparent theres room for refinement and innovation a pivotal setpiece like the climactic showdown between antagonist bori khan jason scott lee and mulan on top of wooden scaffolding could have used a touch of tsui harks resourceful creativity to make it really hum the cast is phenomenally stacked with veteran chinese talentincluding shaw brothers icon chen peipei in a small part and a rather unrecognisable jet libut only a few manage to leave an impression in such a crowded space the films fleet pacing doesnt afford sufficient screen time either tzi ma is heartbreaking as mulans disabled father while gong lis shapeshifting witch xian lang a new character addition provides a nuanced presence missing elsewhere in the film reminiscent of zhang ziyi liu yifeis steely dutybound magnetism carries her through the action capablydodging and shooting arrows backflipping on horses riding into battlealthough one cant help but wish for a more compelling personality as it stands her mulan succeeds insofar as being an exquisitely constructed porcelain vessel for the storys themes of courage honor loyalty and female empowerment
Sep 11 2020,positive,a movie of impressive scale and clear visual command an effort that for my money far surpasses its animated predecessor
Sep 11 2020,negative, kiwi director niki caros liveaction remake of disneys 1998 animated epic mulan itself drawn from a centuriesold chinese legend has spectacular moments but proves too long and a touch it must be said smug the most expensive movie ever helmed by a woman its one of those epics that couldnt not be controversial for a bunch of reasons not least of which is the annoyance that after many cinematic delays due to covid19 its now finally available to stream on disney instead but only for subscribers willing to shell out an additional 3499 for premier access politically too theres much here thats problematic including stars with prohong kong views unease at disney conspicuously getting its claws into china and some heavy metoo rethinking  all of which makes this a tricky title to critique auckland mainly stands in for china as we meet the young hua mulan here played by crystal rao in a deathdefying if awkwardlooking opening scene that demonstrates that shes never played by the rules and therefore has always been an outsider later as an adult shes played by yifei liu chosen from a casting call of 1000 hopefuls and shes still resisting tradition something which concerns her loving dad zhou the prolific tzi ma recently seen in tigertail but upsets her mother li rosalind chao greatly li states that a daughter brings honor through marriage and sends mulan and her sister xiu xana tang as a character deliberately added to the story off to the local matchmaker peipei cheng another veteran for a contrived comedy sequence that demonstrates that mulan isnt exactly the marrying type when rouran invaders headed by the villainous bori khan an overacting jason scott lee attack and threaten the emperor action star jet li the imperial army put out an order that one man from each family must fight and as zhou is old and knackered and doesnt have any sons mulan naturally ties her hair back strikes out and joins up under the name hua jun looking decidedly unmanly in the spirit of other genderbendering pics like yentl she must endure all the tropes of having to wash when the men arent looking and struggling with the appropriate sexist banter all the while knowing full well that stern commander tung donnie yen could execute her if he knew the truth junmulan also goes up against shapeshifting witch xian lang gong li an ally of khans who knows her secret and with whom she shares some common ground as he uses her magic to his advantage but treats her disrespectfully and speaking of magic theres some semicrouching tiger hidden dragon wallrunning and roofleaping as well much of which looks a tad clunky mandy walkers cinematography is strong enough to make you regret that this couldnt viably be released in cinemas and the name chinese cast is pretty good too and yet somehow it doesnt quite work in much the same way that disneys rehashing of its own the lion king faltered
Sep 10 2020,negative,while glorious to look at the movie still feels slightly hollow all the right pieces are there but an emotional connection to the characters is lacking
Sep 10 2020,positive,director niki caro expertly balances the drama humour adventure and action creating a thrilling bigscreen epic with potent emotional resonance and lots of female power
Sep 10 2020,positive, mulan a ravishing transformation of a wellregarded yet minor disney title is one of the very few liveaction remakes from the studio which improves on the source material its not a slavish reproduction like beauty and the beast or the lion king safebet pantomimes that dared not stray from their crownjewel source material nor is it a bloated grotesquerie like tim burtons dumbo which nearly doubled the running time of the original with mismanaged themes showcased in an unnecessary and illconceived second act unlike those other corporate iterations this sinophilic delight actually feels like a fresh start the new and improved mulan still tells the han dynasty story of a young woman who runs away from home to take her fathers place in a conscripted imperial army and fight off a horde of marauders but it jettisons many of the cartoonish conceits like animal sidekicks and ancestral ghosts and upgrades the fighting styles from lumbering wwe smackdown to whirlingdervish wuxia elegance the whole film has a muscular visual flair with sweeping camera movements and castofthousands set pieces that make this chinese legend feel truly epic the script nicely balances the womanwarrior imperative with organic questions of honor respect and candor two new set pieces one on a sulfuric frozen lake and another on scaffolding over smelting basins add dazzling displays of derringdo best of all theres an entrancing new tragic villain in the form of hawkish xian lang gong li a shapeshifting witch who sports avian talonfingers and a mournful longing to find her place in the world your deceit is my shame says commander tung donnie yen to a genderrevealed mulan but he could be talking about the original 1998 film that animated hit wellreceived by critics and audiences alike had the mouse houses impeccable art direction and visual panache along with decent action comic relief a bit of romance and a few catchy musical numbers but the whole exercise felt like middle kingdom mimicry it was deeply western in its execution right down to the broadway showtunes not helping were the culturally tonedeaf voiceover talent most of the principal actors aside from mingna wens mulan werent even chinese puerto rican american miguel ferrer japanese americans pat morita and george takei plus jewish crossdresser harvey fierstein as one of the soldiers who eventually crossdresses near the end as well as eddie fucking murphy as a diminutive jivetalking dragon called mushu seriously not to mention a superfluous cricket with the name crikee jeezus this time around disney wised up and enlisted a slew of chinese thespians some of whom are longtime international stars jet li donnie yen gong li bob igers no fool he and his beancounters know that the real money isnt in new york and la but overseas in beijing and shanghai mulan represents their most brazen attempt yet to serve that billionperson market and the casting proves it liu yifei is great as the titular heroine but my mind kept wandering back to spunky spiky zhang ziyi in crouching tiger hidden dragon and if theres any fault in mulan its that ang lees seismic actionromance looms large over it so too do a myriad of jawdropping spectacles from protean auteur zhang yimou whose asskicking epics like hero and house of flying daggers are stonecold dazzlers chinese moviegoers may enjoy mulan but it isnt anything they havent seen already and thats the films real fault its a handsome sumptuous intelligent dignified production that doesnt really feel inventive let alone revelatory then again maybe it will awaken some wideeyed disney viewers to a whole new world of international movies to paraphrase the film that will bring much honor to us all stephen garrett is the former film editor of time out new york and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years a rotten tomatoes certified reviewer garrett is also the founder of jump cut a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent foreignlanguage and documentary films
Sep 10 2020,positive,this mulan may have been made for the big screen but it is impressive anywhere
Sep 10 2020,positive, but it wouldnt be anything without a leading lady who is both a crouching tiger and a hidden dragon when it comes to martial artistry and saber swinging as she subtlety emotes her pentup feelings beyond her crossdressing masquerade with liu yifei a star is truly born  she is gifted enough to hold her own during the few humorous interludes such as her avoidance of showering with the fellows who take note her odiferous state as well physically adept enough to make us believe she can fly through the air with the greatest of ease on horseback high in the sky or in the midst of battle on rooftops yes we see the pg13 deadly consequence of war with piles of bodies and arrows piercing flesh but the tone of sacrifice and honor requires it if there is a downside the baddies in charge of the villainous invaders of the imperial city dont quite make the cut jason scott lee is a scarfaced sneering baddie bent on avenging his fathers death we have seen this before meanwhile his female meanie counterpart is xian lang gong li a shapeshifting witchy woman who believes she never given her equal due in causing chaos and mayhem the best scenes as they should be are between mulan and her fellow war hero father played by tzi ma of the farewell their relationship provides the beating heart of this gritty fairy tale one that any child in her nearly 30 years at usa today susan wloszczyna interviewed everyone from vincent price and shirley temple to julia roberts and will smith her coverage specialties include animation musicals comedies and any film starring hayley mills sandy dennis or hobbits her crowning career achievements so far besides having terence stamp place his bare feet in her lap during an interview for the limey is convincing the paper to send her to new zealand twice for set visits once for the return of the king and the other for the chronicles of narnia and king kong and getting to be a zombie extra and interview george romero in makeup on the set for land of the dead though not impressive enough for pulitzer consideration she also can be blamed for coining the moniker frat pack often used to describe the comedy clique that includes ben stiller vince vaughn and will ferrell her positions have included life section copy desk chief for four years and a film reviewer for 12 years she is currently a contributor for the online awards site gold derby and is an oscar expert for rogerebertcom  previously she has been a freelance film reporter and critic contributing regularly to rogerebertcom mpaas the credits the washington post aarp the magazine online and indiewire as well as being a book reviewer for the buffalo news she previously worked as a feature editor at the niagara gazette in niagara falls ny a buffalo native she earned her bachelors degree in english at canisius college and a masters degree in journalism from syracuse university
Sep 10 2020,negative, sometimes movies like people have baggage these unavoidable aspects dont necessarily unfold onscreen but they color the viewers perception regardless production issues expectations historical context disneys remake of mulan unfortunately has more than most  as the latest liveaction remake of a beloved animated film it has to live up to what fans love about the 1998 original while also battling the lessthanremarkable reception preceding remakes have garnered that alone would be plenty but mulan is also a milestone for asian representation in american blockbuster cinema a bigbudget film without a single white actor although plenty of white creatives are behind the camera and a cast stacked with asian american and east asian talent then came a pandemic and now mulan is the guinea pig for a new kind of release a 30 premiere access stream in addition to a disney plus subscription a onetime fee for the chance to catch a wouldbe theatrical release three months before it would stream as a regular disney plus offering in december that mulan is the trial balloon for this release as opposed to say black widow  to name another derailed disney release  is suspect and another weight on the back of an already overburdened film mulan feels extraordinarily compromised something only bolstered by calls for a boycott over star liu yifeis support of the hong kong police departments violent crackdown on prodemocracy protests the movie itself feels like an anticlimax mulan is merely a serviceable film thats rather easy to forget it does not live up to the expectations placed on it nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics its a movie mostly noticeable for what isnt there if you can shut that out whats onscreen is often gorgeous to look at  unlike a lot of disneys liveaction remakes mulan is not a shotforshot remake it takes liberties but theyre all relatively small and the plot of the 2020 film is nearly identical to that of the 1998 original hua mulan liu yifei is the daughter of a noble warrior and disinterested in the business of being a proper lady whose only ambition is marrying well instead she aspires to be a fighter like her father hua zhou tzi ma  and when the emperor decrees that every family send a man to serve in the fight against northern invaders she decides to disguise herself as a man hua jun to serve in place of her ailing father  with a plot so similar to the original the new mulan struggles to define itself beyond what it removes from the mulan of the 90s some absences are not missed  like eddie murphys talking dragon mushu  but others like the musical numbers leave an emotional void that the film doesnt really try to fill it makes mulan a strangely passive character which is reinforced by the movies biggest change portraying mulan as uniquely connected to her chi  according to the film mulans uncanny ability to tap into her chi is what makes her a superhuman spearkicking warrior essentially from birth a genetic compulsion to hop on rooftops and play with swords from childhood it is frankly a ridiculous addition there is little mulan does that feels like she decides for herself  despite feeling fundamentally hollow mulan is a pleasure to watch on a screen its the kind of beautiful that makes you mourn for the loss of theaters in 2020 fights are wonderfully composed and consistently staged in interesting places despite battles that mostly unfold in mountainous deserts mulan finds ways to spill color across the screen in another diversion from the original the film introduces magic mostly in the form of the sorceress xian lang gong li a shapeshifter in the service of the rouran invader bori khan jason scott lee whose power adds even more visual flair to a movie brimming with it  mulan is popcorn cinema without the popcorn choosing severity over fun it prefers its characters to appear strong instead of real while it does a lot of work to look like it comes from a place it does little to feel like it does there are few jokes few memorable exchanges and surprisingly little camaraderie for a movie featuring a bunch of soldiers the result is something that plays like a very good band performing a forgettable cover one thats more about imitating a sound than giving it theirs for a movie about a woman learning to own her identity mulan cannot seem to form one of its own 
Sep 10 2020,positive,mulan certainly enriches disneys cultural canon

Sep 10 2020,positive, the disney business plan of remaking their classic animated films continue with mulan last week i reviewed the original animated classic and while it has some issues i enjoyed it  despite not liking a lot of the liveaction remakes mulan was one that i was excited for especially since disney were aiming to tell the original story instead of doing a direct remake of the 1998 classic and after seeing mulan i can express my opinions  mulan once again tells the story of the titular character who takes her fathers place in the imperial army disguising herself as a male soldier and ultimately becoming a heroine the liveaction remake of mulan was ultimately fine the film could be split into two parts in terms of quality the first 30 minutes and the last 90 minutes the first 30 minutes of the film explores mulans childhood up until she runs away from home to join the army this first act was filled with blatant exposition dialogue wooden acting and uneven pacing however once mulan joins the imperial army the film feels like it was directed by a different person as the pacing acting and action is tighter and more evenly paced the last 90 minutes were definitely more exciting and enjoyable  the main cast all do a good job as the characters that they play yifei liu who plays the titular character fits comfortably into the role and carries the film well her interaction with the rest of the main cast also works as she grows into a confident woman the general look of the film ie locations and costumes are gorgeous and are my favourite aspect of the film its mostly a colourful and vibrant film until the army goes to war where bright colours are swapped with the murky greys and browns symbolising the grisly nature of war  there are a few references to the original animated film for example some lyrics from a girl worth fighting for is used as dialogue from one soldier as he explains his perfect woman i dont care what she looks likei just care what she cooks like and the score uses the song reflection when mulan succeeds in training none of these references felt forced and it was a joy to hear them being used naturally in the film  however this film does have its problems too when disney first announced this remake they said that mushu the dragon would not appear in the film a decision that i agreed with however its been replaced by a phoenix who supposedly watches over and protects mulan i say supposedly because it only appears once in the film making it a pointless character i understand the symbolism of the character being a protective guardian but if thats the case then its appearances should be more regular the main enemy has also been replaced instead of the war being against the huns its against the rorian army and a witch this was a huge disappointment to see as like previously mentioned disney were supposedly aiming to tell the original story of mulan however this is not necessarily the case and that is a shame to see another issue was the cinematography for the most part its fantastic and cinematic making each scene stand out however the film does have a lot of slowmotion shots which dont work and make the pacing uneven they will also appear at random moments usually without reason if these were taken out they would make no difference to the film whatsoever as well as this some shots during the opening battle scenes are strange the camera will at times follow the perspective of the one being attacked meaning the shot will flip round appear upside down or sideways its an interesting technique but it isnt consistent making those scenes a horrible experience if you want to see a film that does this camera technique perfectly i recommend seeing 2018s upgrade overall mulan is fine the last 90 minutes is better than the first 30 minutes however it couldve done with another edit and script rewrite if youve never seen the original animated film youd probably enjoy this more than someone who has seen the original while its not a bad film disney shouldve stuck to their word and done a telling of the original story which this was not  we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese megans taste in films are interesting her favourite films are space jam studio ghiblis the cat returns as well as horror films saw drag me to hell and juon the grudge when shes not watching films shell be spending precious hours playing crash bandicoot
Sep 9 2020,positive,i think yifei liu did a really great job as mulan
Sep 9 2020,positive,overall it was a lot of fun
Sep 9 2020,negative,draws a lot from chinas culture without respecting and honoring it properly full review in spanish
Sep 9 2020,negative,by now weve seen too many authentic dynamic chinese action movies especially zhang yimous recent shadow and the great wall to accept this dross
Sep 9 2020,positive, disney has an identity problem when it comes to their liveaction slate efforts like the lion king and aladdin are too tethered to their source material to craft their own voices others such as dumbo fall apart in the absence of any clear sense of purpose mulan removes the talking animals and musical numbers from the equation plotting its own course through the ancient chinese folklore armed with a 200 million budget a recordsetting sum for a female director niki caro crafts a visually breathtaking experience the new zealand landscape is beautiful if not a bit distracting for a film set in china cgi can bring practically any concept to life but other disney efforts have suffered from an overreliance on green screens mulan is competently acted though its hard to say that any particular talent steals the show yifei liu brings grace and a sense of determination to the title role but shes a bit too reserved the absence of a confidant figure such as mushu who is in on the ruse puts some strain on lius ability to express the struggle at the core of the narrative unlike its animated predecessor mulan puts its supernatural elements at the heart of the conflict mulan is basically turned into a superhero exhibiting chosen onetype powers that diminish the feminist message that the film is trying to convey here women can do anything if one has special powers to dodge arrows and transform into animals the screenplay is pretty lackluster while following the same basic trajectory of the source material swapping out the huns for rouran warriors the film never quite finds its heart mulan never really clicks with her fellow warriors a fairly forgettable bunch who never receive much attention caro largely keeps romance out of the equation a refreshing dynamic for a disney film mulans journey is one of the self determined by her own actions rather than gauged in relation to the feelings of a man it might have been interesting to see how the film addressed plotlines from the original in a world with larger lgbtq equality but disney has demonstrated no grace in this area anyway mulan is a flawed movie the action sequences help buoy the film through its less compelling sequences the brief attempts at humor do little than serve as reminders of how much heart eddie murphy brought to the original with that in mind its easier to forgive the lack of comedy it seems absurd to think that a liveaction effort could have ever surpassed its predecessor in this regard with mulan disney shoots for more than a shotforshot remake of the past the result is a little clunky at times but compelling enough to justify its existence skeptics of disneys liveaction genre may not be completely convinced but caro brings something fresh to the conversation it is an entertaining film that might not feel like high praise but its a step in the right direction five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Sep 8 2020,negative,instead of a normal girl this mulan is an infallible human weapon at the service of the chinese empire full review in spanish
Sep 8 2020,positive,so instead of doing a play by play remake of the animated film they tossed out the songs and the eddie murphy type comedy good for them for sticking with an epic adventure movie that promotes girl power
Sep 8 2020,negative, well admit it when we first heard that mulan would be the next disney animated film getting the liveaction remake treatment we were skeptical no li shang no mushu no singing it seemed like the film was glutton for punishment  but then the first trailer dropped and our faith was slowly restored maybe we thought to ourselves taking mulan in a new more serious direction would lead to more creative freedom and the end result could be a beautiful disney take on a classic war story steeped in legend sadly though the film we got was decidedly not what wed hoped for it was devoid of all charm from the original but also overreliant on the audiences familiarity with the story to get us to keep watching with new concepts like chi and a shapeshifting witch padding the runtime an extra half hour mulan is a sluggish messy film that somehow manages to be less feminist than the original starring yifei liu as the titular fa mulan mulan follows a spirited young woman gifted with immense power called chi who is living in imperial china and disguises herself as a man to join the army and save her injured father from having to sacrifice his life in addition to struggling to conceal her identity from her superiors donnie yen ron yuan and her cohorts yoson an doua moua jun yu mulan also finds herself grappling with invading warlord bori khan jason scott lee and the shapeshifting witch who fights alongside him xianniang gong li if the latter half of that sounds unfamiliar to you its because this reimagining of mulan adds quite a bit of new material and changes even more  but with very little success the biggest cosmetic change is obviously the lack of singing which we dont terribly miss because it admittedly wouldve felt a little odd given the more historicalwarcentric tone the film seems to be aiming for on a similar note although the film is a little stale without mushu as a source of comedic relief thats also one aspect of the original that makes sense to cut if the filmmakers were looking to take mulan in a new direction beyond those two things however virtually every other change from the original is for the worse we dont quite understand why shan yu whose terrifying voice was provided by the late miguel ferrer had to be changed to bori khan a character who for all intents and purposes is the exact same as shan yu just less intimidating jason scott lee is unremarkable in the role which seems to be by design because the film is very transparently pushing xianniang as the films true antagonist on paper her story really works shes a direct foil for mulan a sort of reflection for the path she could have taken had she not stayed loyal brave and true however the film is so intent on making them two sides of the same coin that it feels forced and artificial as opposed to natural especially because xianniang and mulan dont meet until halfway through the film and have no connection that would link them  symbolically or otherwise its a shame because gong li gives the films best performance as the shapeshifting witch and shes a genuinely sympathetic figure as well as a very visually striking one however every time she clashes with bori khan we cant help but wonder why she doesnt just deal with him then and there shes an incredibly powerful witch and hes just a regular man albeit an intimidating one it makes no sense that she continues to just sit by and take his insults and do his dirty work when at any time she could kill him and be on her way her obvious power but unwillingness to take control of her situation not only makes her difficult to root for but also makes the film as a whole frustrating to watch and so her sacrifice to save mulan at the end of the film feels meaningless because she spends the entirety of the film doing nothing but taking insults and abuse from bori khan despite the frustrations we had with xianniang she was just one of many changesnew additions to the film that drove us up the wall far and away the worst addition was the introduction of chi a magical sort of life force that mulan apparently has the ability to harness the movie spends its first ten minutes introducing this concept but we cant for the life of us figure out why this had to be added to the film the presence of chi utterly decimates what makes mulan great it takes her from a simple woman willing to do an extraordinary deed to protect someone she loves to a luke skywalkerstyle hero who already has amazing powers and doesnt need to struggle or work to develop her gifts she already has them the addition of chi isnt the only way mulan decimates what was once a strong character on the whole mulan has little to no personality and instead of making active decisions for herself she spends the runtime being told what to do pushed around and saved by men instead of forging her own path and acting in defiance mulan only gets to win when men in the narrative allow her to the film has a half dozen unremarkable male characters all of whom blend together due to their lack of a discernable personality where mulan was once known for its quippy fastpaced dialogue this mulan feels sluggish and uninspired the worst part is that even though theres an ensemble filled to the brim with male characters the film cut out the most memorable man from the original li shang instead the role is split in two  donnie yen as the commanding officer and yoson an as the friendpotential but unfulfilled love interest  and neither really make a lasting impression on us despite all of the attempts to differentiate it from the original though mulan is still reliant on the audiences knowledge of and affection for the original to make the story work the story barely scrapes along and never really raises stakes or emphasizes key moments seemingly because it assumes the audience already knows whats going to happen whether on purpose or not it falls back on the original to move the story along which is especially frustrating because of how much that contradicts with the filmmakers narrative of making this version of mulan a new refreshing take on the original mulan wants to have it both ways but its painfully obvious that if the original didnt exist this film just wouldnt work despite its beautiful colorful costumes and sweeping cinematography mulan is also lackluster in terms of filmmaking the fight scenes have a hokiness to them that takes us immediately out of the seriousness of this remake and has us scratching our heads as to whether or not the filmmakers intended for us to take it seriously the sudden zooms frequent cutting and erratic camera movement all give the fight choreography a cartoonish for lack of a better word feel to them and we dont mean that in a good way although it does boast some decadent visuals and a standout performance from gong li mulans unnecessary changes and additions both pad the runtime and weaken its protagonist resulting in an overworked and underbaked slog of a film that does the original a true injustice dishonor on you dishonor on your liveaction remake  2024 minute media  all rights reserved the content

Sep 8 2020,positive, loyal brave true 忠勇真 are the three words engraved on the hua family sword comprising mulans central motif that in turn reflects this live action remakes reexamination of what constitutes chinese feminism mulan turns out to be a pleasant surprisethat disneys creative capacity for thematic and visual reimagination is being consistently expanded by its feminist projects as in beauty and the beast and also that the film is a potent antithesis to its predecessors that are unimaginative cgi clones of their originals such as the lion king though it is a pity that chinese female talents are absent in the writers room of mulan director niki caro and the films writing team have demonstrated their decent understanding of chinese feminisms essence our womens loyalty bravery and truth rising above patriarchal confinements like a phoenixthe divine symbolisation of chinese femininity this understanding rings true to the original ballad of mulan which dates back to the 6th century and has been carried on by generations ever since however in its second half mulans impressive capture of such essence is eclipsed by repetitive bombardment of actions that will appear unoriginalespecially for chinese audiences who are way too familiar with such standardised choreography of martial arts despite mandy walkers kinetically grandiose cinematography the filmfor the mere sake of spectaclealso mismatches several chinese landscapes and architectures with geographical and historical inaccuracies every chinese girl will still end up having a soft spot for mulan thanks to its brilliant final touch the emperor gifting mulan a new sword on which devotion to family 孝 is added alongside loyal brave true mulans solemn eyes reflected on this sword mirror the core of the films chinese feminism her unwavering strength in protecting her loved ones that raise her up to become who she is an honourable warrior synopsis set in ancient china a fearless young woman out of love for her family and country joins the imperial army by disguising as a man she embarks on an epic journey battling the invaders and brings great honour upon her family and herself as a true warrior
Sep 8 2020,neutral, after numerous delays due to the covid pandemic disneys live action mulan 2020 has finally rolled out through their streaming platform disney the troubled release schedule along with the companys pricing decision currently you can only watch it by dropping 30 on top of a monthly subscription rate created a significant buzz now that it is out we come to realize that all the talk was for naught this is a bland retelling of the chinese folktale wavering between wanting to set its own identity and capturing the nostalgia for the 1998 animated version say what you will about disney animated features  the watering down of realworld problems the emphasis on idealized fantasy etc  what they do so well is take straight forward concepts and present them so that it adheres to both young and adult sentimentalities this is especially true for the disney renaissance period of the late 80s and early 90s where they basically perfected the formula the music colorful characters and highend animation made the stories easy to digest and themes simple to understand there was a lot of charm that went into them and that includes the 1998 mulan the story hua mulan yifei lui is a precocious young woman living in ancient china her free spirit puts her in conflict with the strictly held traditions of her society especially when it comes to gender roles an early scene with the matchmaker peipei cheng is meant to assign mulan with a prosperous husband but that interaction goes sour immediately mulans independent persona calls her to act when the invading rourans  led by bori khan jason scott lee  attack the country determined to overthrow the emperor jet li one man from every family is ordered to fight for the army the only man in mulans family is her father zhou tzi ma an aging warrior who can barely manage to hold his sword upright to save her father mulan steals his sword and armor and takes his place impersonating a man under the name hua jun the setup has a problem that was barely covered in the animated version but is amplified here both emphasize a progressive feminist view of the central character however where the animated version focused on a female choosing her own path despite the rules of law the live action version jumbles that theme by juxtaposing it with ideas of honor and loyalty this mulan is meant to push against conventional traditions but she fights for an emperor and for a country that maintain those rules she breaks the law by being a woman and enlisting in the army and yet she sides with the very establishment that oppresses her for being a woman sure her being there likely saves her fathers life but not once does she question the edict that prevents her from being her true self seen in a different light the clunkiness of the writing rick jaffa amanda silver elizabeth martin lauren hynek and direction niki caro make it so that the villain has more of a sympathetic journey than anyone else bori khan is supposed to be the evildoer but we learn that his mission is based out of revenge the emperor stole his peoples land and killed his loved ones bori khan turns to a powerful shapeshifting witch a shamefully underused li gong to help clear his path to the imperial city there is enough backstory to bori khan for us to at least understand his perspective we learn nothing of the emperor other than he lives in a lavish palace and wears decorative clothes made of gold jet lis performance is directed to be stoic almost passive  there is no personality to the emperor that allow us to connect with him in terms of action the choreography and special effects heavily borrow from chinese martial artswuxia films but the cinematography and editing construct the action scenes like a modern american blockbuster needlessly shooting people from waist up from multiple different angles and cutting between every punch and kick the action is indecipherable it has energy but lacks visual coherency action and fight scenes are often handled in the same way as a dance number so why on earth is it only partially shown one of the most impressive things to watch is people performing difficult feats and making it look effortless when the filmmaking gets in the way it pulls the rug out of all the hard work that goes into the set pieces as an actionmartial arts film with a female protagonist mulan pales in comparison to the hundreds maybe even thousands of chinese produced counterparts as a disney movie it severely lacks the charisma and magic associated with the company it is pretty to look at but thats all it has to offer once we dig beneath the façade do we realize how shallow it actually is
Sep 8 2020,negative, perhaps the biggest disappointment is the fact that the film was so clearly designed for the big screen drenched in spectacle and just begging to be experienced in a crowd unlike the majority of disneys lackluster remakes mulan is prepared to step away from simply copying the 1998 original and actually try something new in fact this version is essentially a wuxia film itll remind viewers more of crouching tiger hidden dragon than of the disney classic more of a modern interpretation of the chinese legend than just another remake and the spectacle of that vision feels completely wasted on a television screen  gone are all the elements that we know and love there are no songs love stories or talking animals all of which are pushed aside as the story instead leans into themes of family honor and trust its almost admirable that the film strays so far from the original text on which its based in favor of new ideas and it certainly shouldnt rub people up the wrong way quite like previous remakes have done as it doesnt fall into the same traps in fact mulan has all the elements to become something brilliant so why doesnt it the answer to that is simple its disney the studios model thrives on creating movies for mass appeal ones that can rarely be called bad since there almost always competently made and wellacted but that are hardly ever bold enough to become something great with very few exceptions theyre usually what one might call pretty good or even just fine and thats because thats precisely what theyre designed to be movies that neither offend nor blow anyone away the reason mulan never becomes more than fine is because its unwilling to fully embrace the ideas at the heart of it a fully chinese wuxia movie that focused more on the mental strain of mulans actions and on her interactions with those around her wouldve been far more interesting than what we got essentially a marvel movie it follows the same basic structure and is every bit as formulaic as any mcu release in fact hua mulan herself is now a superhero this new interpretation of the character has the power of chi and once again that couldve been interesting had it been handled creatively but mulan is introduced as the perfect fighter from the very beginning she attempts to conceal her skills from fellow soldiers but never from the audience so its pretty difficult for the combat sequences however pretty they might be to have any real tension  in the end while mulan isnt as problematic as many other disney remakes the principle remains the same thinking these films will be equal in quality is ignorant of what made the classics so special in the first place the animation itself much like most others mulan worked better as an animated film because it was purposefully created that way its how the story was supposed to be told and although this remake has a more respectful approach than most its still devoid of any of the charm that made the original so beloved its visually stunning the action sequences are terrific and liu yifei is fantastic in the lead role but it lacks the magic heart character or life of its animated counterpart in short its just fine and youll likely feel just as you did after aladdin beauty and the beast or the lion king wishing you were watching the original  we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese dan is a freelance film critic who hopes to inspire people to step out of their comfort zones and try new things he hopes to soon publish his first book and is a proud supporter of independent cinema
