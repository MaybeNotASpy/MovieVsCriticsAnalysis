"Apr 8, 2023",positive," Welcome back to the scariest, and at times goriest, column here at Film Inquiry: Horrific Inquiry. Twice a month, I will be tackling all things horror, bringing two films back into the spotlight to terrify and frighten once more. And occasionally looking at those that could have pushed the envelope further. Join us as we dive deep into the heart of horror, but warning, there will be spoilers. “It’s all for you Damien. It’s all for you.” – The Omen (2006)Religion is a primary element within a plethora of horror films, their deeply rooted theologies creating the perfect stage for terror, retribution and even at times redemption. Where many horror films harness the horror of religious belief in the form of possession, not all lean into the occupation of the devil. Some are far worse. Some speak to the dawn of Armageddon.What makes these religious based horrors so terrifying is their grounding in a true belief of the power of the devil and hell. There is a constant belief of unknown forces working to deceive and undermine, whether it be through a host or the birth of the anti-Christ. And with the stories throughout the Catholic faith of exorcisms and the Book of Revelation mapping out the end of times, it is hard to deny to deny the belief of its truthfulness. Horror films have been able to tap into this terror, shifting and molding it, bringing our fears to life. For some, these films succeed in the terror they are charged to create, for others, it is pure entertainment. When it comes to The Omen, it feels as though more entertainment is to be had, rather than horror, yet finds its own layer of terror that extends beyond religion.Delivering the Anti-ChristA remake of the 1976 classic, John Moore‘s The Omen was released on June 06, 2006. I remember going to the film not because I had an interest in The Omen itself, but because it was an Anti-Christ film showing on the dreaded day of 666. It was a brilliant marketing campaign, as I remember the theater being packed, an air of defiance filling the room as the audience collectively embraced the idea of what the release day symbolized. Honestly, no matter the quality of the film, I have found that those films that have a collective audience experience are the films that stick with the viewer the most. And I have not forgotten The Omen since.source: 20th Century FoxAs the film opens, it does not hesitate to get itself moving, the opening credits immediately presenting the 666 before transitioning to the Vatican Observatory in Rome, its telescope displaying the arrival of a comet similar to the one spoken of the night Jesus was born. Yet the look on the priest’s face does not match one of exultation, but rather terror. A convention called, the Book of Revelation read allowed the angel’s trumpets of Armageddon paired with real-life disasters signifying the completion of each stage. The Challenger explosion, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 tsunami, and the fall of the Twin Towers are each cited, the comet’s arrival is the latest sign the world is on the eve of Armageddon.The Omen holds for a moment on this information before transitioning to Robert Thorne (Liev Schreiber) who is on his way to meet his wife Kate (Julia Stiles), currently in labor and experiencing complications. As he arrives at the hospital, the low lighting within the halls speaks to deals made in the shadows. And while Robert does not know the deal he is making, he makes it all the same. Informed that his child has died in birth, he accepts the words of Father Spiletto (Gionanni Lombardo Radice) without question, even when he is guided away from the idea of seeing his child. He momentarily grieves for the loss of his son and for the now barren state of his wife. “This meant so much to her,” he says.There is a sweetness in the Father before him as he asks Robert to accept the Lord’s plan, to welcome a new chance to give love to another. He shows Robert another boy that was born in the same hour of his son, his mother dying in childbirth. Robert, reluctant at first, agrees to take the boy and raise it as his own, allowing his wife to believe he is the child she birthed. This entire opening sequence sets the stage for the rise of the Anti-Christ, these initial deceptions, some in love, will follow many of the film’s characters until its closing moments, proving that the power of the devil is always lurking and ready to strike.The Anti-Christ RisesKate works as the constant representation of a state of uncertainty. From the moment she awakens and is presented the child, her first question to her husband is “who is this”. She speaks to the deeply ingrained nature of a mother’s innate knowledge of her child. While brief, this moment speaks to Kate’s knowing this is not her child. As the first three years of Damien’s life are shown through a montage of memories, there is no doubt about the love and acceptance he experiences from his two parents. Yet, a rise of an Anti-Christ is not immediate, but rather slow and meticulous. It starts with a lie that grows and becomes empowered by the happenings around that life. For the Thornes, an announcement that they are to move to London with the newly promoted United States ambassador sets the next action in motion for Damien to rise.source: 20th Century FoxAs the current ambassador finds himself stuck in traffic, The Omen leans into a Final Destination sequence of an all-knowing death coming for its latest victim. As a truck pins the ambassador in his limo, a cigarette explodes the vehicle,  and Robert Throne is promoted to Ambassador of the US Embassy in London, placing him in a political position of power. And as the film moves ahead two more years, another element of the prophecy of the Anti-Christ is fulfilled.Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and Kate are the first to be reintroduced following the time jump. At the park, Kate takes a call with no one on the other line, Damien disappearing in the moments it took for her to end the call. As she franticly searches for her son, he leaps out from behind her in an attempt to scare her. There is a deeply felt concern for her son her, establishing the deep bond between them – and her deeply rooted concern in losing him. In retrospect, the film is clever in including this moment, rather than moving straight to the death of the nanny. It speaks to the connection of mother and son, even as an audience we know this is one crafted out of love rather than biological connection. But it also speaks to a possible underlining belief within Kate that Damien is not hers – that at any moment she could lose him.As we move from Kate to Damien’s fifth birthday party, the film begins to change its pace, moving from slow meticulous preparation to an ever-increasing pace of success. The pieces have been moved into place over the years, and the final moves come swiftly. As Kate takes her son, the nanny becomes overcome by an unspoken request from a dog in the courtyard. The score swells with a haunting whispering feel, culminating in the nanny killing herself in front of the guests. The is a capture of shock and disbelief in the party guests, almost as time has slowed down. And while the camera franticly tries to capture the explosion of trauma and horror, it finally settles on Damien. It holds on Damien waving at the dog, his emotions absent of feeling for the loss of the young women.And while the Anti-Christ may rise, there are always those who are tasked to prevent it.Prevention is FutileThis comes in the form of Robert, photographer Keith (David Thewlis), and Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite). For Father Brennan, this is a chance for redemption. He was a part of the deception to swap the child from the beginning, putting Damien in Robert and Kate’s care. Yet, as we discover, cancer that riddles his body has him at death’s door. He makes a plea for Robert to accept Christ into his heart and to kill the boy. He warns Robert of the prophecy, of the grave danger to his wife and to himself. Yet, try as he might, the devil is always one step ahead.source: 20th Century FoxFor Keith, it is the chance to literally save his neck. As his photographs have proven, the devil leaves a mark on those it has targeted to kill. For the nanny, the rope shows up as a blurry line around her neck. For Father Brennan, a spike draws closer to his body each time his photo is taken. And for Keith, a slice across the neck. It once again speaks to Final Destination, specifically the third film, the devil and Death giving a hopeless attempt to be stopped. For Keith, he is given the foresight, but not the purest of intentions for success.And finally, there is Robert. He pushes back against the truth, refusing to believe his son is the Anti-Christ and the task he must carry out to end him. As Father Brennan states, once the child has taken everything from him, he will kill Robert as well. For Robert, it is the truth that becomes his undoing. As he learns of Kate’s death, he does not accept the truth of Christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge. He does not make the decision to kill Damien because he is the Anti-Christ, but rather because he killed Kate. This is further driven home as Robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery, his skull bashed in. He wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost. And the moment he gives into revenge, he accepts that Damien has taken everything from him, and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mind.Yet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled, the Anti-Christ would have still risen but they may have lived to see it. As they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of Damien, death befalls them. Father Brennan is impaled after revealing the prophecy to Robert, Keith after turning back to get the knives Robert refused to stab his son with and Robert at the moment just before placing the knife in Damien’s chest.The End Heralded by MenIt was early in the film that I concluded that the end of the world would be heralded by men. Now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded. Rather, with a combination kindness, pride and malice. This is seen early as Robert arrives at the hospital, Father Spiletto offering the swapping of the children. We know the malicious intent of Father Spiletto, even if not as deep as it truly runs. Yet, it is Robert who makes the decision to take the child – without the inclusion of his wife. This is a decision he makes on his own, for both the kindness of his wife and for the child. Yet, as antique as it is, he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family – alone.source: 20th Century FoxRobert fails to listen to Father Brennan as well, even though he knows that what the Father speaks of the child to some degree is true. And there are only a handful of people who know the truth about Damien’s paternity. There is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of Robert. And even as he is about to tell his wife, he holds back, eventually taking the secret of Damien’s paternity to his grave.His pride in his dismissal of Father Brennan extends to Kate as well. Following the death of the nanny and the attack by Damien in the car, Kate expresses a desire to have Damien checked by a doctor. As Robert scoffs at Kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life, Kate expresses how weird that is, especially in comparison to other children. This is compounded by the search for a new nanny, Robert proposing that Kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with Damien. His quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of Damien’s paternity, but also Kate’s growing suspicion that something is wrong with Damien. As she speaks of always being there to raise her child, there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning, “Who is this”, was not a passing comment. Rather the start of Kate’s struggle with an unknown truth.As Kate struggles with her feelings regarding Damien, especially following an incident at the zoo, she decides to seek help. Robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat Kate as though she were crazy. As the shrink discloses to Robert, Kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isn’t hers. As Robert sits there listening, he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth. Rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy. He even goes as far as to state to the doctor that Kate’s wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled. Once again, he makes the decision, not Kate. It is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted – the killing of the unborn child in the womb. And even after Damien’s attempt to kill Kate, and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her, as she pleads with Robert to not “let him kill her”, he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over them.And finally, it is Robert’s thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse. If he had put his pride aside and listened to what Father Brennan had said, he might have stood a chance. But instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruition.Conclusion:While a smaller part of the film, it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devil’s ability to prey on empathy. The entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on Robert’s empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his. Kate’s death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her, as Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room. And in the final moments, as Robert is about to plunge the knife into Damien’s chest, Damien cries out “Please Daddy, don’t”. The words cut deep and stop Robert just for a moment. But a moment too long, the police, here shown as faceless individuals, arrive and shoot Robert dead.The Omen may be a film about the Anti-Christ, but it is also a film that looks at the ills of man, the ability of evil to conquer good, and the role of the power we all process to play in the rise of evil. It is a film that can lend itself to different perspectives of examination and various interpretations of meaning. Where many horror films find terror of the devil trying to get inside, The Omen forces us to consider the possibility of it already being here.Watch The OmenPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

It once again speaks to Final Destination, specifically the third film, the devil and Death giving a hopeless attempt to be stopped. For Keith, he is given the foresight, but not the purest of intentions for success.And finally, there is Robert. He pushes back against the truth, refusing to believe his son is the Anti-Christ and the task he must carry out to end him. As Father Brennan states, once the child has taken everything from him, he will kill Robert as well. For Robert, it is the truth that becomes his undoing. As he learns of Kate’s death, he does not accept the truth of Christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge. He does not make the decision to kill Damien because he is the Anti-Christ, but rather because he killed Kate. This is further driven home as Robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery, his skull bashed in. He wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost. And the moment he gives into revenge, he accepts that Damien has taken everything from him, and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mind.Yet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled, the Anti-Christ would have still risen but they may have lived to see it. As they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of Damien, death befalls them. Father Brennan is impaled after revealing the prophecy to Robert, Keith after turning back to get the knives Robert refused to stab his son with and Robert at the moment just before placing the knife in Damien’s chest.The End Heralded by MenIt was early in the film that I concluded that the end of the world would be heralded by men. Now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded. Rather, with a combination kindness, pride and malice. This is seen early as Robert arrives at the hospital, Father Spiletto offering the swapping of the children. We know the malicious intent of Father Spiletto, even if not as deep as it truly runs. Yet, it is Robert who makes the decision to take the child – without the inclusion of his wife. This is a decision he makes on his own, for both the kindness of his wife and for the child. Yet, as antique as it is, he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family – alone.source: 20th Century FoxRobert fails to listen to Father Brennan as well, even though he knows that what the Father speaks of the child to some degree is true. And there are only a handful of people who know the truth about Damien’s paternity. There is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of Robert. And even as he is about to tell his wife, he holds back, eventually taking the secret of Damien’s paternity to his grave.His pride in his dismissal of Father Brennan extends to Kate as well. Following the death of the nanny and the attack by Damien in the car, Kate expresses a desire to have Damien checked by a doctor. As Robert scoffs at Kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life, Kate expresses how weird that is, especially in comparison to other children. This is compounded by the search for a new nanny, Robert proposing that Kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with Damien. His quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of Damien’s paternity, but also Kate’s growing suspicion that something is wrong with Damien. As she speaks of always being there to raise her child, there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning, “Who is this”, was not a passing comment. Rather the start of Kate’s struggle with an unknown truth.As Kate struggles with her feelings regarding Damien, especially following an incident at the zoo, she decides to seek help. Robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat Kate as though she were crazy. As the shrink discloses to Robert, Kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isn’t hers. As Robert sits there listening, he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth. Rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy. He even goes as far as to state to the doctor that Kate’s wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled. Once again, he makes the decision, not Kate. It is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted – the killing of the unborn child in the womb. And even after Damien’s attempt to kill Kate, and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her, as she pleads with Robert to not “let him kill her”, he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over them.And finally, it is Robert’s thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse. If he had put his pride aside and listened to what Father Brennan had said, he might have stood a chance. But instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruition.Conclusion:While a smaller part of the film, it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devil’s ability to prey on empathy. The entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on Robert’s empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his. Kate’s death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her, as Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room. And in the final moments, as Robert is about to plunge the knife into Damien’s chest, Damien cries out “Please Daddy, don’t”. The words cut deep and stop Robert just for a moment. But a moment too long, the police, here shown as faceless individuals, arrive and shoot Robert dead.The Omen may be a film about the Anti-Christ, but it is also a film that looks at the ills of man, the ability of evil to conquer good, and the role of the power we all process to play in the rise of evil. It is a film that can lend itself to different perspectives of examination and various interpretations of meaning. Where many horror films find terror of the devil trying to get inside, The Omen forces us to consider the possibility of it already being here.Watch The OmenPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

As the film opens, it does not hesitate to get itself moving, the opening credits immediately presenting the 666 before transitioning to the Vatican Observatory in Rome, its telescope displaying the arrival of a comet similar to the one spoken of the night Jesus was born. Yet the look on the priest’s face does not match one of exultation, but rather terror. A convention called, the Book of Revelation read allowed the angel’s trumpets of Armageddon paired with real-life disasters signifying the completion of each stage. The Challenger explosion, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 tsunami, and the fall of the Twin Towers are each cited, the comet’s arrival is the latest sign the world is on the eve of Armageddon. The Omen holds for a moment on this information before transitioning to Robert Thorne (Liev Schreiber) who is on his way to meet his wife Kate (Julia Stiles), currently in labor and experiencing complications. As he arrives at the hospital, the low lighting within the halls speaks to deals made in the shadows. And while Robert does not know the deal he is making, he makes it all the same. Informed that his child has died in birth, he accepts the words of Father Spiletto (Gionanni Lombardo Radice) without question, even when he is guided away from the idea of seeing his child. He momentarily grieves for the loss of his son and for the now barren state of his wife. “This meant so much to her,” he says.There is a sweetness in the Father before him as he asks Robert to accept the Lord’s plan, to welcome a new chance to give love to another. He shows Robert another boy that was born in the same hour of his son, his mother dying in childbirth. Robert, reluctant at first, agrees to take the boy and raise it as his own, allowing his wife to believe he is the child she birthed. This entire opening sequence sets the stage for the rise of the Anti-Christ, these initial deceptions, some in love, will follow many of the film’s characters until its closing moments, proving that the power of the devil is always lurking and ready to strike.The Anti-Christ RisesKate works as the constant representation of a state of uncertainty. From the moment she awakens and is presented the child, her first question to her husband is “who is this”. She speaks to the deeply ingrained nature of a mother’s innate knowledge of her child. While brief, this moment speaks to Kate’s knowing this is not her child. As the first three years of Damien’s life are shown through a montage of memories, there is no doubt about the love and acceptance he experiences from his two parents. Yet, a rise of an Anti-Christ is not immediate, but rather slow and meticulous. It starts with a lie that grows and becomes empowered by the happenings around that life. For the Thornes, an announcement that they are to move to London with the newly promoted United States ambassador sets the next action in motion for Damien to rise.source: 20th Century FoxAs the current ambassador finds himself stuck in traffic, The Omen leans into a Final Destination sequence of an all-knowing death coming for its latest victim. As a truck pins the ambassador in his limo, a cigarette explodes the vehicle,  and Robert Throne is promoted to Ambassador of the US Embassy in London, placing him in a political position of power. And as the film moves ahead two more years, another element of the prophecy of the Anti-Christ is fulfilled.Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and Kate are the first to be reintroduced following the time jump. At the park, Kate takes a call with no one on the other line, Damien disappearing in the moments it took for her to end the call. As she franticly searches for her son, he leaps out from behind her in an attempt to scare her. There is a deeply felt concern for her son her, establishing the deep bond between them – and her deeply rooted concern in losing him. In retrospect, the film is clever in including this moment, rather than moving straight to the death of the nanny. It speaks to the connection of mother and son, even as an audience we know this is one crafted out of love rather than biological connection. But it also speaks to a possible underlining belief within Kate that Damien is not hers – that at any moment she could lose him.As we move from Kate to Damien’s fifth birthday party, the film begins to change its pace, moving from slow meticulous preparation to an ever-increasing pace of success. The pieces have been moved into place over the years, and the final moves come swiftly. As Kate takes her son, the nanny becomes overcome by an unspoken request from a dog in the courtyard. The score swells with a haunting whispering feel, culminating in the nanny killing herself in front of the guests. The is a capture of shock and disbelief in the party guests, almost as time has slowed down. And while the camera franticly tries to capture the explosion of trauma and horror, it finally settles on Damien. It holds on Damien waving at the dog, his emotions absent of feeling for the loss of the young women.And while the Anti-Christ may rise, there are always those who are tasked to prevent it.Prevention is FutileThis comes in the form of Robert, photographer Keith (David Thewlis), and Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite). For Father Brennan, this is a chance for redemption. He was a part of the deception to swap the child from the beginning, putting Damien in Robert and Kate’s care. Yet, as we discover, cancer that riddles his body has him at death’s door. He makes a plea for Robert to accept Christ into his heart and to kill the boy. He warns Robert of the prophecy, of the grave danger to his wife and to himself. Yet, try as he might, the devil is always one step ahead.source: 20th Century FoxFor Keith, it is the chance to literally save his neck.

Now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded. Rather, with a combination kindness, pride and malice. This is seen early as Robert arrives at the hospital, Father Spiletto offering the swapping of the children. We know the malicious intent of Father Spiletto, even if not as deep as it truly runs. Yet, it is Robert who makes the decision to take the child – without the inclusion of his wife. This is a decision he makes on his own, for both the kindness of his wife and for the child. Yet, as antique as it is, he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family – alone.source: 20th Century FoxRobert fails to listen to Father Brennan as well, even though he knows that what the Father speaks of the child to some degree is true. And there are only a handful of people who know the truth about Damien’s paternity. There is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of Robert. And even as he is about to tell his wife, he holds back, eventually taking the secret of Damien’s paternity to his grave.His pride in his dismissal of Father Brennan extends to Kate as well. Following the death of the nanny and the attack by Damien in the car, Kate expresses a desire to have Damien checked by a doctor. As Robert scoffs at Kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life, Kate expresses how weird that is, especially in comparison to other children. This is compounded by the search for a new nanny, Robert proposing that Kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with Damien. His quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of Damien’s paternity, but also Kate’s growing suspicion that something is wrong with Damien. As she speaks of always being there to raise her child, there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning, “Who is this”, was not a passing comment. Rather the start of Kate’s struggle with an unknown truth.As Kate struggles with her feelings regarding Damien, especially following an incident at the zoo, she decides to seek help. Robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat Kate as though she were crazy. As the shrink discloses to Robert, Kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isn’t hers. As Robert sits there listening, he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth. Rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy. He even goes as far as to state to the doctor that Kate’s wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled. Once again, he makes the decision, not Kate. It is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted – the killing of the unborn child in the womb. And even after Damien’s attempt to kill Kate, and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her, as she pleads with Robert to not “let him kill her”, he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over them.And finally, it is Robert’s thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse. If he had put his pride aside and listened to what Father Brennan had said, he might have stood a chance. But instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruition.Conclusion:While a smaller part of the film, it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devil’s ability to prey on empathy. The entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on Robert’s empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his. Kate’s death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her, as Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room. And in the final moments, as Robert is about to plunge the knife into Damien’s chest, Damien cries out “Please Daddy, don’t”. The words cut deep and stop Robert just for a moment. But a moment too long, the police, here shown as faceless individuals, arrive and shoot Robert dead.The Omen may be a film about the Anti-Christ, but it is also a film that looks at the ills of man, the ability of evil to conquer good, and the role of the power we all process to play in the rise of evil. It is a film that can lend itself to different perspectives of examination and various interpretations of meaning. Where many horror films find terror of the devil trying to get inside, The Omen forces us to consider the possibility of it already being here.Watch The OmenPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and Kate are the first to be reintroduced following the time jump. At the park, Kate takes a call with no one on the other line, Damien disappearing in the moments it took for her to end the call. As she franticly searches for her son, he leaps out from behind her in an attempt to scare her. There is a deeply felt concern for her son her, establishing the deep bond between them – and her deeply rooted concern in losing him. In retrospect, the film is clever in including this moment, rather than moving straight to the death of the nanny. It speaks to the connection of mother and son, even as an audience we know this is one crafted out of love rather than biological connection. But it also speaks to a possible underlining belief within Kate that Damien is not hers – that at any moment she could lose him.As we move from Kate to Damien’s fifth birthday party, the film begins to change its pace, moving from slow meticulous preparation to an ever-increasing pace of success. The pieces have been moved into place over the years, and the final moves come swiftly. As Kate takes her son, the nanny becomes overcome by an unspoken request from a dog in the courtyard. The score swells with a haunting whispering feel, culminating in the nanny killing herself in front of the guests. The is a capture of shock and disbelief in the party guests, almost as time has slowed down. And while the camera franticly tries to capture the explosion of trauma and horror, it finally settles on Damien. It holds on Damien waving at the dog, his emotions absent of feeling for the loss of the young women.And while the Anti-Christ may rise, there are always those who are tasked to prevent it.Prevention is FutileThis comes in the form of Robert, photographer Keith (David Thewlis), and Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite). For Father Brennan, this is a chance for redemption. He was a part of the deception to swap the child from the beginning, putting Damien in Robert and Kate’s care. Yet, as we discover, cancer that riddles his body has him at death’s door. He makes a plea for Robert to accept Christ into his heart and to kill the boy. He warns Robert of the prophecy, of the grave danger to his wife and to himself. Yet, try as he might, the devil is always one step ahead.source: 20th Century FoxFor Keith, it is the chance to literally save his neck. As his photographs have proven, the devil leaves a mark on those it has targeted to kill. For the nanny, the rope shows up as a blurry line around her neck. For Father Brennan, a spike draws closer to his body each time his photo is taken. And for Keith, a slice across the neck. It once again speaks to Final Destination, specifically the third film, the devil and Death giving a hopeless attempt to be stopped. For Keith, he is given the foresight, but not the purest of intentions for success.And finally, there is Robert. He pushes back against the truth, refusing to believe his son is the Anti-Christ and the task he must carry out to end him. As Father Brennan states, once the child has taken everything from him, he will kill Robert as well. For Robert, it is the truth that becomes his undoing. As he learns of Kate’s death, he does not accept the truth of Christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge. He does not make the decision to kill Damien because he is the Anti-Christ, but rather because he killed Kate. This is further driven home as Robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery, his skull bashed in. He wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost. And the moment he gives into revenge, he accepts that Damien has taken everything from him, and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mind.Yet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled, the Anti-Christ would have still risen but they may have lived to see it. As they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of Damien, death befalls them.

Yet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled, the Anti-Christ would have still risen but they may have lived to see it. As they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of Damien, death befalls them. Father Brennan is impaled after revealing the prophecy to Robert, Keith after turning back to get the knives Robert refused to stab his son with and Robert at the moment just before placing the knife in Damien’s chest.The End Heralded by MenIt was early in the film that I concluded that the end of the world would be heralded by men. Now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded. Rather, with a combination kindness, pride and malice. This is seen early as Robert arrives at the hospital, Father Spiletto offering the swapping of the children. We know the malicious intent of Father Spiletto, even if not as deep as it truly runs. Yet, it is Robert who makes the decision to take the child – without the inclusion of his wife. This is a decision he makes on his own, for both the kindness of his wife and for the child. Yet, as antique as it is, he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family – alone.source: 20th Century FoxRobert fails to listen to Father Brennan as well, even though he knows that what the Father speaks of the child to some degree is true. And there are only a handful of people who know the truth about Damien’s paternity. There is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of Robert. And even as he is about to tell his wife, he holds back, eventually taking the secret of Damien’s paternity to his grave.His pride in his dismissal of Father Brennan extends to Kate as well. Following the death of the nanny and the attack by Damien in the car, Kate expresses a desire to have Damien checked by a doctor. As Robert scoffs at Kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life, Kate expresses how weird that is, especially in comparison to other children. This is compounded by the search for a new nanny, Robert proposing that Kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with Damien. His quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of Damien’s paternity, but also Kate’s growing suspicion that something is wrong with Damien. As she speaks of always being there to raise her child, there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning, “Who is this”, was not a passing comment.

Rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy. He even goes as far as to state to the doctor that Kate’s wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled.

"Sep 20, 2022",negative," For a while back in the ’70s, horror movies had weighty things on their minds. Americans were concerned about the real presence of evil in the world — terrorism, an unpopular war, a widely hated president — so Lucifer himself, the fallen angel representing a fallen country, brought his brimstone stench into theaters. Americans were afraid of their own children, so in many cases Satan took the form of a cherub. Americans were uneasy about the Middle East, so in films like The Exorcist (1973) and The Omen (1976), all the trouble started there — or, at least, all the spooky evidence was found there. Gee, how things have changed. 9/11, Columbine, an unpopular war in the Middle East — the stars, Mr. Thorn, I say unto you the stars have aligned for the ghastly return of the Adversary. Well, either that or June 6, 2006 was a really cool release date for a remake of The Omen. As before, ambassador Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber, in for Gregory Peck) and his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles replacing Lee Remick) find themselves the adoptive parents of the scowling young Anti-Christ — Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who by all appearances is a perfectly normal five-year-old boy, but who is attended by a snarling black dog and a nanny named Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) who speaks of having been sent by “the agency.” That would be, I presume, the famous Nannies from Hell Agency, established 1976 by Billie Whitelaw. (Thirty years experience protecting your hellchild from the sharp knives of Meggido. Call today!) The Omen was ridiculous in 1976 and it’s ridiculous now. Richard Donner’s original film, an unstable mix of old-Hollywood pomp and post-Vietnam bloodletting, moves like a snail across an acre of flypaper; any residual affection attached to it by horror fans derives more or less solely from its freakish death scenes. For that, these days, we turn to the Final Destination series, which do the Omen series one better by making the villain Death himself. I will say that thirty years of special-effects evolution have given us more realistic renditions of the church-impales-priest bit and the whoops!-there-goes-your-head bit. I can also testify that the final scene between the hapless Katherine and the ruthless Mrs. Baylock plays out much more credibly here than in the original (wherein — not to spoil it — we did have to wonder, “Wait, what? And she got away with it?”). Julia Stiles is a terrific actress in the right role, which isn’t what she’s got here. Stiles is twenty-five but could still pass for fifteen, and she will probably have to wait another ten years before seeming remotely believable — or comfortable — playing a mom. She may be too spiky a presence to exude maternal instincts, anyway. (While she may, if she chooses, make a fine real-life mother someday, it’s all about how she comes across on film.) As for Liev Schreiber, he responds to the challenge of following Gregory Peck by going small and minimalist; Peck was certainly a stoic slice of ham, but he could get it together and get his voice up when necessary. Schreiber just lets the plot bulldoze him, a passive hero unconsciously aping Tom Hanks in The Da Vinci Code, trailing behind people who are always telling him what things mean. Omen ’06 did bang-up business on June 6, perhaps owing to all the giggly teens and twentysomethings who responded as expected to the brilliant calendar marketing. Whether it has enough staying power to warrant remakes of 1978’s Damien – Omen II (the Anti-Christ as conflicted teenager) and 1981’s The Final Conflict (the Anti-Christ as Donald Trump) remains to be seen; it ranked fourth over the weekend, presumably abandoned by those who didn’t want to be so unhip as to see it on June 10 or something. Even if sequels are planned, though, the precedent of the 666 release date presents a practical problem: There won’t be another opportunity for this kind of Gregorian synergy until June 6, 2106. That means any subsequent Omen movie will just have to come out on, like, a Friday. Bummer."
"Nov 19, 2019",neutral," I was but a wee lad when &#8220The Omen” hit theaters in 1976, but I remember the film enough to know that it scared the crap out of me. Now 30 years later comes a remake, just in time for 6-6-06, and although this version is a respectful retelling, it doesn't seem to have much of a purpose. Like Gus Van Sant's remake of &#8220Psycho,” &#8220The Omen” just doesn't bring anything new to the table. For those unfamiliar with &#8220The Omen,” the movie tells the story of a U.S. ambassador, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber), whose wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles), has a stillborn child. The ambassador decides without his wife's knowledge to substitute another baby whose mother died during birth and raise the child they named Damien as their own. Director John Moore is very respectful to the original, with almost a shot-for-shot re-creation in this version. While I'll admit the film is well made, it lacks the tension and sense of doom that made the original work. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is pretty creepy as Damien and Mia Farrow shines as Damien's replacement nanny, but Schreiber and Stiles can't compare in roles originally done by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. I suppose there will be an audience out there unfamiliar with the 1976 version of &#8220The Omen,” and that audience will probably be pleased with this version. You certainly can do a lot worse when it comes to horror remakes (&#8220The Amityville Horror” immediately comes to mind), but it's still not good enough to be worth your time. If you must see &#8220The Omen, ” I'd suggest you skip the remake and go rent the original. This week's dandy is &#8220Dave Chappelle's Block Party” (B), a documentary that is the first new material from the popular comedian in nearly two years. Set against the backdrop of a fascinating rap concert, this film gives fans a dose of why the comedian has risen to such huge popularity. It also sheds a little light on why he walked away from his Comedy Central series in the middle of filming season three. In September 2004, right after signing a $50 million deal with Comedy Central, Chappelle organized a free block party that featured a combination of comedy and music in a Brooklyn neighborhood. The stellar roster of artists included Kanye West, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, Dead Prez, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, the Roots, Cody ChesnuTT, Big Daddy Kane and - reunited for their first performance in more than seven years - the Fugees. Chappelle served as emcee of the event, providing his trademark one-liners throughout the day and evening's festivities. But &#8220Block Party” has a little more going for it, with footage from rehearsals and Chappelle returning to his childhood home in Ohio, wandering through town, handing out golden tickets to invite several busloads of citizens to join the party. Chappelle also enlists the services of a college band, which ends up providing West with a memorable entrance during his performance of &#8220Jesus Walks.” While I enjoyed the concert footage, the film could have easily been about the comedian's return home and still been effective. It shows Chappelle as a guy who is maybe a little star-struck by his own success, almost to the point of feeling guilty about it. I was already a fan of Chappelle, but &#8220Block Party” made me appreciate him even more. Here is hoping his self-imposed hiatus doesn't last much longer. - Sportswriter/movie reviewer Micheal Compton now has reviews available on the Web.

"Oct 19, 2019",neutral," CRAWL (2019). Given all the cinematic bloat as of late, a pared-down thriller would seem to be a blessing, offering nothing more and nothing less than appreciated, adrenaline-pumping chills. It worked three years ago when Blake Lively stood firm against a menacing shark in The Shallows, but the idea goes belly-up with Crawl. In this one, alligators are the apex predators making life miserable for the humans, as college swimmer Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario) and her injured father Dave (Barry Pepper) are trapped in the flooded crawlspace of Dave’s Florida home while a category 5 hurricane rages all around them. Initially, there’s some tension as Haley and Dave are hopelessly pinned down by these critters, but because the script by brothers Michael and Shawn Rasmussen never offers much variation, and because director Alexandre Aja never provides a proper sense of the layout of the joint, all excitement soon dissipates. A few hapless humans wander into the frame to provide snacks for the gators, but stripped of personalities and, for the most part, even names, their ultimate fates mean little. Crawl is presumably meant to refer to the movements of both the alligators and the human protagonists, but it might as well refer to the forward momentum of the movie itself. Its solemnity results in tedium, and one wishes that its makers had taken the same approach adopted by director Lewis Teague and screenwriter John Sayles with 1980’s Alligator (starring Robert Forster, RIP). Embracing the more ludicrous aspects of the premise and ensuring the humans were quirky enough to hold attention whenever the gators were MIA, that picture was energetic and entertaining. Crawl, on the other hand, is mostly torpid and toothless. HÄXAN (1922). Those looking for something different to watch this Halloween won’t do much better than Häxan, a delirious Swedish documentary from the silent era. A nonfiction feature ahead of its time in the manner in which it employs dramatic recreations, this finds director Benjamin Christensen also turning to all manner of surrealistic imagery to relate his thesis. It takes a look at witchcraft during the Middle Ages, ultimately concluding that those burned at the stake or drowned in rivers were no different than modern folks suffering from hysteria. The psychological musings don’t arrive until late, as the majority of the picture offers background info on how superstitious people once viewed witches before plunging into eye-popping sequences in which scores of witches take to the sky on brooms and sorceresses cavort with actual demons while spitting on crucifixes and feasting on unbaptized babies. The visual effects are excellent if dated, but the makeup and costume designs are as impressive as anything seen in modern cinema (incidentally, that’s Christensen himself playing Satan). If there’s an overriding message to take from this movie, it isn’t the connection between the witches of yesteryear and the hysterics of today — instead, it’s the eternal evil of the patriarchy and the perennial hypocrisy of the church, as leering men of the cloth are repeatedly shown torturing innocent women both young and old. Criterion’s Blu-ray edition of Häxan also contains 1968’s Witchcraft Through the Ages, a shortened version of the film with added narration by William S. Burroughs. Other extras include audio commentary (from 2001) by film scholar Casper Tybjerg; Christensen’s introduction to the film for its 1941 rerelease; historical background on many of the photographs used throughout the movie; and outtakes. HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD (1961). A standard sword-and-sandal flick receives a shot in the arm from director Mario Bava, just a year after he made his mark with his Gothic horror classic Black Sunday. Bava, who had already worked as a cinematographer on a pair of other Italian-made Hercules pictures, here also assumes the jobs of co-scripter and director, and he provides the film with a certain measure of visual flair. British bodybuilder Reg Park, a three-time Mr. Universe, plays the titular muscleman, whose attempt to save his beloved Princess Deianira (Leonora Ruffo) from a mysterious illness requires him to journey to Hell alongside his companions, the happy-go-lucky Theseus (George Ardisson) and the bumbling Telemachus (Franco Giacobini). Hercules thinks he can trust the royal advisor Lico (Christopher Lee), learning almost too late that he’s the one behind Deianira’s condition. The acting (aside from Lee) is wooden and the script extremely choppy, but the film is elevated by Bava’s renowned eye for atmospherics. The helmer does a fine job of making the most of a low budget, and his use of lighting and color is typically inspired. Fans of Lee’s booming voice (and who isn’t?) will be disappointed to learn that another actor dubbed him for the English-language versions. In addition to the U.S. release version, Kino’s Blu-ray edition of Hercules in the Haunted World also contains the U.K. version (Hercules in the Center of the Earth) and the European version (The Vampires vs. Hercules). Other extras consist of audio commentary by author Tim Lucas (Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark); an interview with Ardisson; and theatrical trailers. THE OMEN COLLECTION (1976-2006). While 20th Century Fox released an Omen box set on Blu-ray back in 2008 — one which contained the original trilogy and the 2006 remake of the first film — it failed to include the series’ made-for-TV offering. This definitive box set from Shout! Factory not only houses all five films but also adds a few new extras to the generous bonus features brought over from the previous set. One of the finest horror films of the 1970s, The Omen (1976) proved to be a monster hit, placing only under Rocky, A Star Is Born and All the President’s Men as one of its year’s top grossers. Working from an intelligent script by David Seltzer, Richard Donner directed this for maximum impact, as U.S. Ambassador to Britain Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and his wife Kate (Lee Remick) slowly come to realize that their adopted child Damien (Harvey Stephens) is actually the Antichrist. Several of the shocking set-pieces have become legendary in their own right, although they never overshadow the contributions of an excellent cast (particularly David Warner as a wary photographer and Billie Whitelaw as a demonic nanny). The great Jerry Goldsmith deservedly won the Best Original Score Oscar, with the composer picking up an additional nomination for Best Original Song (“Ave Satani”). Damien: Omen II (1978) largely received dismissive reviews and didn’t even earn half of its predecessor’s take, but it’s actually the most underrated film in the franchise. As with the first film, a terrific cast (William Holden, Lee Grant, Lew Ayres and Lance Henriksen, among others) and some imaginatively staged demises goose this middle chapter in which a now-12-year-old Damien (well played by Jonathan Scott-Taylor) learns about his true nature from the satanic emissaries sent to protect him. To its detriment, The Final Conflict (1981) looks and feels nothing like the first two pictures in the series; instead, it’s a shoddy effort noticeably lacking in necessary tension, superlative acting, and top-of-the-line production values. Sam Neill stars as the adult Damien, ready to take over the world but first requiring his minions to halt “the Nazarene” from returning by killing every baby in England who was born at a precise time. A drowsy pace and an erratic script further doom this lamentable conclusion to a fine trilogy. Ten years after The Final Conflict, producer Harvey Bernhard (who produced all three previous pictures and co-wrote Damien: Omen II) tried to revive the franchise in the chintziest way possible, with a film made for network television (a Fox movie of the week, to be exact). Bernhard produced and co-wrote Omen IV: The Awakening (1991), in which the Antichrist returns in the form of a bratty girl (Asia Vieira). This one’s strictly routine, although Michael Lerner briefly juices up the proceedings as a low-rent detective. Someone eventually had the idea to remake The Omen, but given the mediocre results, the only reason seems to have been so that The Omen (2006) could be released on 6/6/06. Granted, director John Moore remaking The Omen isn’t as sacrilegious as Gus Van Sant remaking Psycho, but this beat-for-beat retelling takes the chilling atmosphere of the ’76 model and replaces it with tiresome visual effects and laughable dream sequences. The devil taking over the world is a terrifying concept, yet there’s so little urgency to the proceedings that you’d think his master plan extended only to prank phone calls to the Vatican and TPing ministers’ houses. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are no match for Peck and Remick, although the Brits in the supporting cast (David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon) acquit themselves nicely. Blu-ray extras collected in this Deluxe Edition include audio commentaries on four of the five films (including Donner on two separate ones for the original picture); a feature-length documentary on the original series; interviews with various cast and crew members; and theatrical trailers. QUARTET (1981). Here’s a lesser effort from the team of director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant, best known for the Oscar-winning likes of Howards End and A Room with a View. Adapted from Jean Rhys’ novel by frequent Merchant-Ivory scripter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Quartet is set in 1920s Paris and centers on the misfortunes of a young woman named Marya Zelli (Isabelle Adjani). Married to the Polish art dealer Stefan Zelli (Anthony Higgins), she’s shocked when he’s suddenly arrested for theft. With Stefan sentenced to serve one year in prison, Marya finds herself facing life on the street; fortunately(?), she’s instead taken in by English couple H.J. Heidler (Alan Bates) and his wife Lois (Maggie Smith). H.J. immediately puts the moves on Marya, and it’s soon revealed that Lois allows him to run through a succession of young woman as long as he will remain with her. But matters become more complicated for both Lois and Stefan once Marya unexpectedly falls in love with H.J. Ivory’s directorial aloofness damages what should be a torrid melodrama, as the affair between Marya and H.J. isn’t believable for even one moment and the vibrant backdrop of 1920s Paris frequently feels removed from the action. Adjani somehow won the Best Actress prize at Cannes for her deer-in-headlights performance, although it’s Smith who best conveys the desperation of her character. For better Merchant-Ivory titles available (like Quartet) on the Cohen Media label, check out 1984’s The Bostonians (reviewed here) and 1987’s Maurice (reviewed here)."
"Jun 28, 2019",negative," 
Horas después de revisitar el clásico de Richard Donner, me fui al cine a ver la nueva versión de ese mítico film. Ya he dicho un montón de veces qué es lo que suponen para mí los remakes. En principio no me interesan absolutamente nada, sobre todo si lo que se hace es una copia exacta del film original. Si por el contrario se coge la idea y se intenta aportar algo nuevo, otra visión del mismo tema, pues entonces ya me interesa más, aunque eso luego no justifica que guste o no. La película de John Moore pertenece al primer grupo, tanto que uno no hace más que preguntarse por qué coño han realizado este remake. Vale, supongo que la única respuesta posible es la taquilla. Del argumento no voy a hablar porque es excatamente el mismo, cambiando lógicamente la época. Ahora transcurre a partir del 2006. Un embajador americano, etc, etc, etc el anticristo y ya está. Lo dicho, exactamente igual. El colmo de la desfachatez, vamos, porque hay diálogos que son exactos, hasta tal punto que el espectador va por delante en todos los aspectos, no sólo sabe qué va a pasar, también sabe qué van a decir los personajes. Vale, es un remake, y el factor sorpresa no existe, pero podían habérselo currado un poquito mejor. En el film de Donner casi todo eran virtudes, y aquí es al revés. Para empezar, creo que los actores no son los adecuados, al menos algunos de ellos. Y todos están enormemente desaprovechados, incluída Mia Farrow, quién podría haber otorgado algo de calidad a esta película. Interpreta a la niñera de las narices, y a pesar de que probablemente sea la mejor del reparto, su intervención se limita a poner cara de sospechosa, a gritar un poco cuando hace falta y poco más. Una verdadera pena ver a esta actriz (que tampoco es de las grandes) haciendo un papel tan poco sabroso, a diferencia del original.

El resto pues más o menos igual, incluso a un nivel inferior. Liev Schrieber da el tipo como el embajador que poco a poco se va dando cuenta de que su hijo no es un ser adorable, aunque por momentos desentona un poco. David Thewlis como el fotógrafo que ayuda al protagonista en sus indagaciones está correcto y no sale mal parado en su comparación con David Warner. Pette Postlethwaite como un sacerdote arrepentido está también bastante desaprovechado en un papel que en el original resultaba hasta inquietante. Y Michael Gambon simplemente pasa por aquí a decir hola y poco más. Pero quien se lleva la peor parte es Julia Stiles, el mayor error de cásting de todos a mi juicio. Poco creíble en su papel de madre y esposa de un embajador americano. No se siente el terror de su personaje como se sentía en el original, aunque hay que decir que el cambio más sustancial de la película se produce con ella, y no voy a decir más para no desvelar nada. El pequeño Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick interpreta al maléfico Damien, pero lamentablemente no resulta tan creíble y terrorífico como cabría esperar. De hecho, en los momentos en los que se pone serio parece que está poniendo caretas, y no resulta para nada amenazador. Pero el mayor culpable es el señor John Moore, que ya destrozó el clásico 'El Vuelo del Fénix', y aquí vuelve a hacer lo mismo, anque los resultados sean un poco mejores que en el film protagonizado por Dennis Quaid. Moore copia planos del film de Donner, llegando a realizar escenas totalmente idénticas, tanto en la colocación de los personajes, como en los diaólogos o en su factura visual. Evidentemente cambia algunas cosas para actualizar el tema, pero son cambios mínimos que no aportan absolutamente nada, simplemente son cambios lógicos debido a la época en la que se desarrolla, la actual, que parece que no pero 30 años son muchos años. Moore estropea el material que tiene entre manos de la forma más absurda, no sólo copia plano por plano lo que se supone tiene que cambiar. Además tiene que adornarlo con insertaciones de los típicos planos rápidos con efectos de sonido, que encima no vienen a cuento y no aportan absolutamente nada a la narración. Lo mejor del film, y es algo que sorprende gratamente es lo impactantes que resultan las muertes de algunos personajes, algo que no he comentado en la crítica del film de Donner y que me parecía estupendo. Es enormemente impresionante cómo morían algunos personajes en aquel film, y todos tenemos en mente cierto camión con cierto cristal ¿o no?. El film de Moore también sobresale en eso, y también las cambia ligeramente (no todas) para sí aportar algo nuevo en ellas, aunque simplemente sea el enfoque. Lo peor del asunto es que sabemos cuándo van a ocurrir exactamente. En fín, una película muy floja totalmente innecesaria que espero no haga olvidar a las nuevas generaciones de espectadores la película original. Muy pronto sabremos los resultados de taquilla, que me imagino que serán altos, pero desde luego no se lo merece. De hecho no se merece ni que la hubieran hecho, pero en fín, todo hay que renovarlo aunque ya esté bien hecho. No hay nada intocable para desgracia de algunos de nosotros."
"Jun 5, 2019",neutral,"In the world of the Antichrist, the original Omen reigns supreme."
"Jan 15, 2019",neutral,The film doesn't leave you with bad dreams. It just makes you wonder: what's the point watching this remake when DVDs of the original are at hand?
"Feb 3, 2018",positive," Someone once had an excellent idea for a film to scare the pants off us: what if Gregory Peck (who represented nothing but good sense and respectability) adopted a baby boy, and that cute ickle shock-headed newborn turned out to be Satan? And Satan wanted Mummy and Daddy dead, so he could inherit everything they had — in fact ultimately inherit the earth and bring about his true aim, which we call Armageddon? What if the only thing Peck could do, to stop him, would be to murder him — or try to? Wouldn’t that be a great movie? Well, yes, it would and it was. The Omen has been making people jump out of their skins for 30 years. And now it’s been remade, but with one crucial ingredient missing: surprise. To remake, almost in replica, a horror film that depends upon surprise is rather baffling. Excuse me for pointing out the obvious but since anyone who has seen the original movie knows exactly what’s coming, doesn’t that rather spoil the shock factor? An element on which, let’s face it, a horror film rather depends? It’s odd that the director of this remake, John Moore (Behind Enemy Lines), should have chosen to miss the opportunity to terrify even those of us who had seen the original film. He could have led us to expect the original shocks, and then have delivered something new, unexpected and more disturbing. An audience that thought it knew what was going to happen, and was then completely wrong-footed, could be truly unnerved. But no. When I saw the original Omen for the first time I saw more of the sofa cushion held in front of my face than of the television screen. It would be more accurate to say I heard the film rather than saw it. This time around I was so unscared that at one point I found myself wondering whether Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) was driving a Toyota or a Lexus. Not a good sign and particularly since I am a complete wuss when it comes to horror films. You may say, ‘But what about people who never saw the first film?’ Well, hang on just a second: can The Omen really have been remade for an audience which is over 18 years of age but has never seen the original? That’s quite a limited demographic. After all, the first Omen has been showing at Christmas and Easter fairly consistently for a good many years. And, in any case, this film’s target audience should be expectant parents — they’re the ones it has the most potential to spook. No, there are two reasons for this remake, and they’re both pretty feeble. One: the release date is 06.06.06 — which we all know means Satan (and how do most of us know 666 is the Mark of the Beast? Because we saw it in the original Omen movie). And two: ‘We saw a gap in the marketplace,’ says Fox chairman Tom Rothman. And with that terrifically uninspiring comment, all is made clear. Enough of that. Go and see Offside instead. It’s about a group of Iranian women trying to get into a football match in Tehran, and it’s marvellous. With great good humour and kindliness Jafar Panahi (the director) has addressed discrimination, freedom and authority in Iran. Match day in Tehran: Iran is playing Bahrain in a World Cup qualifier. A young Iranian woman is discovered at a stadium turnstile, dressed as a boy. She is taken to a makeshift pen behind the stands where a handful of women, all wearing disguises, are being detained by soldiers. The mood is fractious: the women are upset and the soldiers are bolshie. No one has got what they want. The soldiers are sick of being in the army, and the women are tantalised by the roars of the crowd. Their fear of any forthcoming punishment is initially put in the shade by their frustration at missing the match. The two ‘sides’ begin gradually to open a dialogue, courtesy of an outspoken woman who is more than a match for the soldiers. She looks a lot like a bloke, smokes and swears openly, addresses them as equals, is aggressive or wheedling by turns, and argues with fierce integrity. The other women plead, cajole and giggle — which maddens the soldiers still further. But no one is seriously angry. The soldiers are trying to enforce a law they didn’t make and don’t really care about. They know how absurd they sound, and their side of the argument (that women are banned because the swearing and shouting in the stadium will offend them) gradually falls silent. They are gently persuaded into compassionate, reasonable behaviour."
"Jan 5, 2018",neutral," All of Hollywood will be watching -- and not through the rear view mirrors of their Beemers and Bentleys, but through the front window. This is a great animated feature, and a lot of fun.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get a ticket for doing 70 in a 45-mile-an-hour zone. It's that kind of a movie, and the real feel of the racing footage is absolutely spectacular. Director John Lasseter, who also did ""Toy Story,"" is a CGI genius. Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen, a young hot rod on a cross-country trek to race in the next Piston Cup Championship. But Lightning isn't so bright, and he gets lost in Radiator Springs, a sleepy tourist town that's stuck in the past, where all the inhabitants are autos, including Paul Newman, who plays a 1951 Hudson Hornet. Newman is Radiator Springs' big wheel as well as the former Piston Cup legend, and when Wilson shows him what he can do on a race course, we get to see what state-of-the-art CGI can do.  But when Wilson and Bonnie Hunt, the Porsche who loves him, go out for a spin, it's a breathtaking jaunt, and ""Cars"" becomes summertime genius. These cars are doing what people use to do: They go for a drive. I'd call it literature except I'm afraid it would scare you away. The film is an elegy on the America that Lasseter, music composer Randy Newman -- and even this critic -- grew up in, and have watched disappear. I think Paul Newman should be nominated for an Oscar. The last star in an animated feature I felt this way about was Robin Williams in ""Aladdin."" As for ""The Omen,"" it's the least horrible horror movie I've ever seen. No gore, no death-defying screams and not too many scares either. It is a remake of the 1976 original, and the big news is Liev Schreiber, very good actor, is starring in the Gregory Peck role."

"Dec 7, 2007",positive," Few movie remakes work as straight carbon copies of the originals. If you want to see the same film again just get the DVD, not more cinema tickets. To be successful a remake should not only stand comparison to its ancestor, but also bring innovation and up-to-date resonance for the already-informed audience. Hitchcock knew this when he made his second, more stylish The Man Who Knew Too Much and De Palma's Scarface brutally re-tailored Al Capone for the cocaine Eighties and Cronenberg teleported B-movie The Fly up to speed with romance and gore. Now, Hollywood is robbing the grave of 1976's The Omen, the classic horror thriller that more than stands the test of time and ever-diminishing sequels. What has this new version got to offer? The story of Liev Schreiber's American ambassador slowly realising his young son Damien is the Devil incarnate is exactly the same, as are all the travels, dogs and deaths along the way. Fair chunks of dialogue are lifted, too, while the rest remains a bit laboured. Gregory Peck carried it off better. Satisfactorily spooked mother Julia Stiles, creepy nanny Mia Farrow and David Thewlis' mildly shambolic photographer all grapple with the script, while the real star is not-so-cute Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick. His near silent Damien, with the requisite demonic stare and menacing stillness, is spot on. However, troubled priests Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon must have bet on whose hamming could chew up the most scenery, with Gambon coming on like comic relief. It's deftly stylised scenery, though, with lights against darks and infernal red continually clashing with religious iconography. Unfortunately some scissors-happy imp must have got into the editing room and snipped out the best bits. The classic scenes and even the climax feel disjointed, badly handled and over too quickly, dispelling any tension that the sub-Ave Satani score could muster. Saving grace comes with references to contemporary events, such as 9/11 and Palestine, as satanic prophecies. This Omen emphasises political connections throughout and again suggests the Devil will wage his war from the White House. The original's still the better film all round, but the disturbing resonance with the monolithic Bush administration here stands up well on its own, and that is pretty horrifying."

"Nov 13, 2006",neutral,Confirm[s] its pointlessness at every available turn.
"Oct 21, 2006",negative," It’s not like it’s impossible to piece together a half-decent horror remake. As recent attempts like Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre demonstrated, in the right hands there’s plenty of scope to inject a modern spin without bastardising the memory of the original. But for most studios the primary motive for remakes isn’t to construct a meaningful update, but rather to squeeze a bit more dosh out of an idea that made them money once before. In the case of The Omen, 20th Century Fox had the added incentive that the movie could be rushed out for a much-hyped theatrical release on 6/6/06; because who doesn’t feel like a devil movie on a date like that, right? Aside from a cursory nod to September 11th and a couple of dream sequences, John Moore’s movie sticks pretty closely to the original template, with Ambassador Robert Thorn (Schreiber) slowly waking up to the fact that his dough-eyed adopted son may be the spawn of Satan. But what’s lacking here is any kind of wit, originality or energy in its own right. This is closer to paint-by-numbers than a movie – really, is there any point in this movie’s existence at all? Seeing that it does stick so closely to Richard Donner’s original, comparisons between the two are inevitable. And of course The Omen 2006 suffers in every way. Schreiber and Stiles make for woefully bland leads compared to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick (hell, they’d make woefully bland leads compared to Ant and Dec), and where the original deftly blended a measured sense of pacing with shocking set pieces, The Omen 2006 remains plodding no matter what devilish deeds are unfolding on screen. The Omen 2006 isn’t dreadful. It’s slick and efficient enough, there’s a decent supporting cast and if you haven’t seen the original then it might make for passable entertainment. But for anyone with fond memories of the 1976 classic, this update is less of a travesty than an entirely empty experience. It’s almost as if the Devil himself had a hand in sucking out its soul. There’s a reasonably informative commentary by director John Moore, a (mildly different) alternative ending and a featurette about the score should you care about such things. Pick of the bunch though is ‘Omenisms’, a rather odd ‘making of’ feature that’s shot through with creepy lighting and an ominous score – despite the occasional muffled sound, it actually creates a greater sense of unease than the movie itself. Then there’s a ludicrous documentary about the ‘unholy trinity’ of 666 and how these numbers spookily appear all around us in everyday life. The lowlight is a poker champion talking of how he once pulled out a hand of, like, three 6s. Chilling."
"Oct 3, 2006",positive,full review in Greek
"Sep 27, 2006",neutral," In the last few years, we've seen two prequels to The Exorcist and a remake of The Amityville Horror, so it was probably only a matter of time before someone got around to reviving that other popular 1970s supernatural horror movie, The Omen. The producers of this film had an especially timely marketing hook: a release date (6/6/06) that lends itself to ad campaigns with a mark-of-the-Beast theme. In other ways, though, the remake of The Omen cannot help but seem as dated as the movie on which it is based. This is partly because the new film is extremely faithful to the original. Composer Marco Beltrami does not just emulate the style of Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score for the original movie, he even re-uses some of its themes. And screenwriter David Seltzer does not adapt his earlier script so much as dust it off and tweak a few time-sensitive details; for example, where the first film speculated that ""the Common Market"" was the fulfillment of a prophecy about the Roman Empire—a key piece in the end-times puzzles of Hal Lindsey and others at that time—the new film refers to ""the European Union"" instead. However, most of the other biblical interpretations remain as they were, and they just don't sound as imminent or, well, ominous as they once did. Take, for example, the poem that is recited several times in both films, which refers to the return of Jews to Zion. The modern state of Israel was only 28 years old when the original film came out, and at that time, it was alarmingly common for evangelicals to speculate that the Rapture or the Second Coming might happen before the nation's 40th birthday. (As one who grew up in the evangelical subculture at that time, I vividly remember thinking I might never see adulthood because of this.) So the first Omen came out at a time of great eschatological urgency. Today, however, the Israeli state is more than twice as old as it was back then, life goes on like it always has, and if anyone has proposed a new date for the end of the world, it would not seem to enjoy the widespread consensus, even on a speculative level, that the old date had. The remake does try to create a sense of imminent dread, though. In one of the few significant changes to the script, the new Omen begins with a sequence set at the Vatican, in which an astronomer spots a suspicious sign in the heavens, and a cardinal argues before the Pope that various recent news items are fulfillments of a passage in Revelation (which this film quotes about as accurately as Pulp Fiction quoted Ezekiel). The destruction of the World Trade Center, the loss of the Columbia space shuttle, the Southeast Asian tsunami, the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, and so on—all these things herald the imminent arrival of the Antichrist. Five years later, Robert is the American ambassador to Great Britain and his son, Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), has grown up to become a dark-haired boy with piercingly blue eyes. Everything seems to be going well—but then the nanny commits suicide by hanging herself at Damien's fifth-birthday party, in front of all his guests, after dedicating her act of self-destruction to the boy. Yikes. Creepier things begin to happen. Animals react violently to Damien's presence at the zoo. Damien reacts violently when his parents try to take him to a church for a wedding. A priest, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), shows up at the embassy claiming to know deep dark secrets about Robert's son. A photographer, Keith Jennings (David Thewlis), notices strange blemishes in the photos he takes—marks which seem to predict the deaths of the people he has photographed. And in the midst of it all, Katherine begins to fear that she is losing her own mind. On one level, The Omen is a story about a family, and a married couple in particular, crumbling under psychological stress. The film works partly because it taps into every parent's fear that the babies they dote on will grow up to become children who don't like them; it works because it presents a worst-case scenario of what can happen when children get older and develop their own separate identities, including friendships and interior lives that are not what their parents would wish for them. One of the film's subtler details—it's in the background of only one or two shots—is the sketchy drawing Damien posts on his bedroom wall, depicting his nanny's suicide. And what parent wouldn't be a little worried about a thing like that? Director John Moore, whose last film (Flight of the Phoenix) was also a remake, does not stray far from his source, though he does make a few slight changes. A famous decapitation scene, which the original film dragged out with slow motion and repetitive editing, is handled fairly quickly here. On the other hand, a scene of someone being impaled by a falling spike is amplified here, as the spike falls through a stained-glass window and sends the broken shards down into the body of its victim. Also, some of the film's bigger scares come from the brief nightmares that plague Katherine and Robert—nightmares that were not in the original film. Moore also retains some of the original film's errors. In one scene, Jennings says the town of Megiddo is south of Jerusalem, and that its name comes from the word ""Armageddon."" He's wrong on both points: Megiddo is northwest of Jerusalem, in the Valley of Jezreel, and the word ""Armaggedon"" is actually derived from ""Har Megiddo,"" meaning ""the hill of Megiddo."" In addition, the film blurs the line between what we might call a sacramental worldview and a magical worldview. Father Brennan tells Robert to accept Jesus as his savior and to take communion—not so much for his own salvation, but because it will give him the power he needs to defeat the Antichrist. Later, a monk named Bugenhagen (Michael Gambon) gives Robert seven knives, which he says are the only way the Antichrist can be killed; he even says the knives must be used in a specific way, and in a specific order, and it is unclear whether the person who uses them would need to have any faith. Such details are, of course, just the usual horror-movie hooey. And the new film is, if anything, slightly campier in this regard than the original. When Damien first sees the dog that hypnotized his nanny into committing suicide, he waves to it—and in reply, the dog drips one big fat drop of drool. And then there is the casting of Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock, the Satanic nanny who takes over. Farrow knows a thing or two about demonic children, having starred in Rosemary's Baby almost 40 years ago, and her adoption of foreign children in real life is very much a part of her public persona—so we are definitely meant to laugh when Mrs. Baylock says at her job interview, ""Caring for children has been the joy of my life."" The times may not be as apocalyptic as they once were, but this is still an Omen for the age of irony. The Omen is rated R for disturbing violent content (including a suicide by hanging, an impaling, a beheading, an immolation, a fatal injection, and several attacks by dogs), graphic images and some language (including a few four-letter words). One character also expresses her intention to have an abortion. No, no, this has nothing to do with the child of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. It's just another recycled big screen horror flick. Horror movies are so hot right now, Hollywood just can't stop cranking out remakes along with the originals. And, sure enough, just in time for its 30-year anniversary, here's a whole new version of The Omen, starring Mia Farrow, Julia Stiles, Pete Postlethwaite, and Liev Schreiber. The ""son of Satan"" plotline has opened the door for 20th Century Fox to vigorously market this new Omen to Christian audiences, just as Sony did with The Da Vinci Code. This week, I received a pamphlet in the mail that was filled with Bible verses that relate, in some way, to The Omen. And this ""tract"" also pointed out that the movie opens on 06.06.06. I was not spooked. David DiCerto (Catholic News Service) says it's ""skillfully crafted and well-acted,"" and that it differs from The Da Vinci Code in that it ""does not attack core Christian beliefs, though its horror-film treatment of religion is obviously sensationalized."" Overall, he finds it ""a fairly decent, if occasionally lurid, thriller."" ""It's still creepy after all these years,"" writes Steve Beard (Thunderstruck), who offers excerpts from interviews with the cast and director. ""While some will speak with condescending tones about the superiority of the original version with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, the performances of Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Mia Farrow, and David Thewlis were engaging and spooky. While the very premise of the film … will strike some as heretical or preposterous, it will definitely make for interesting conversation about the end of the world as we know it."" Bob Smithouser (Plugged In) writes, ""Here and there, The Omen version 6-6-06 improves on the atmosphere of the original. European locales. Creepy art decoration. Ominous ties to current events. But beyond that, this almost literal retelling of David Seltzer's story (with much of the dialogue recycled verbatim) will join Gus Van Sant's Psycho on the ash heap of pointless horror remakes."" An uncredited reviewer (Relevant) writes, ""The story is scattered, treating whichever character can induce the most fear for the moment as the protagonist. This leads to little and mechanical development on the part of the story's true protagonist, the diplomat/boy's father. When his moment to become the hero arrives, it's empty and stiff. And don't forget the massive plot holes in terms of location and events."""

Superman Returns (PG-13) 


When it was announced that Bryan Singer would be tackling the long-in-the-works big screen return of DC Comics icon Superman, both film and comic fan alike eagerly anticipated what he would come up with--after all, this is the same filmmaker who was able to make mainstream-accessible, cinematic sense of what is arguably the most complex conventional superhero mythos, that of the X-Men.  But those walking into Superman Returns to be uniquely ""Bryan Singer's Superman"" will be let down as this is more or less the sequel that 1978 Superman director Richard Donner was never allowed to complete.
This is, of course, not necessarily a bad thing, as Donner's film (and, for the most part, the 1980-81 Donner/Richard Lester hybrid sequel Superman II) treated Joe Siegel and Jerry Shuster's historic creation with the respect due any literary character with such enduring appeal, not with campy condescension just because of its comic book origins.  The familiar, lengthy, outer space-set main title sequence scored to the still-stirring John Williams theme announce this film as being firmly in line with those first two films, and so goes the whole of Superman Returns--extremely close to, if not downright aping, the originals.  After a five-year absence from earth that began shortly after the events of II (1983's disastrous Richard Pryor co-starring vehicle III and the unspeakable 1987 abomination IV: The Quest for Peace are mercifully erased from the timeline), Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) once again comes crashing down to Earth, specifically at his mother's (Eva Marie Saint) farm in Smallville.  Clark soon returns to Metropolis, the offices of the Daily Planet and, hence, the world of his true love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)--but she is now not only engaged to editor Perry White's (Frank Langella) nephew Richard (James Marsden, getting far more screen time here than he did in the sadly Singer-less X-Men: The Last Stand), but she also has a young son (Tristan Lake Leabu).
But those changes sound far more radical on paper than they do in execution, as from beginning to end (there's even the classic capper of Supes flying above earth), top to bottom, the tone, the style, the look (many of John Barry's original sets are reflected in Guy Hendrix Dyas' production design), the feel is Donner through and through.  While the attention to consistency is remarkable--writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris pepper the script with a number of detailed references to those first two films--one cannot help but wish that Singer took a more distinctive spin on the material.  He does introduce some God/Jesus/savior allegorical ideas that point to how creative yet intelligent and respectful he has proven to be in the past with comic book material, but those intriguing (if a bit obvious) interests take a clear back seat to paying near-slavish homage to Donner, whose most distinctive strength is his anonymous, workmanlike precision.
That latter description also kind of extends to Routh.  He does a completely competent job here, even if it's quite obvious he probably was cast more for his look (Christopher Reeve meets Mark Steines) than anything else.  (His voice, on the other hand, is rather disturbingly close to Tom Cruise.)  That said, the jury is still out as to if he'll be a star or any good outside of these films--unlike Singer's last great find, Hugh Jackman, who in his first scenes in the original 2000 X-Men instantly announced him as a movie star, period, and not merely a star when playing the legendary character.  But for now, for the purposes of this re-introduction film, his impeccable Reeve impersonation will do.  Bosworth's Lois is similarly competent though her youthful appearance--even younger than her actual 23 years--makes her somewhat difficult to reconcile with Margot Kidder's brassier take in the first two films.  The one cast member--nay, the one prominent member of the whole team--to bring something fairly freshly his own to the table is Kevin Spacey.  While his Lex Luthor does pick up from the madcap vein of Gene Hackman's original portrayal, he brings some of his own darker edges to the part.  For the first time in a major Superman feature, Luthor is both amusingly wacky and a believably sinister threat to the Man of Steel.  The Hackman versus Spacey comparison can be summed up thusly: Hackman uses a Kryptonite block, but Spacey wields a Kryptonite shiv.
The film as a whole could have used a little more of that type of ferocious instinct, as in terms of an adventure Returns pulls out its action showstopper very early--too early--with a spectacular jet plane rescue (a sequence that should be especially phenomenal on IMAX 3-D) and then coasts its way toward its fairly low-key whisper of a conclusion.  What goes on between is never boring--and how could it not be, what with the state-of-the-art effects; lavish set and production design (no mystery where the money in the megabucks budget went here); Spacey's Luthor hamming and sniping with new female sidekick Kitty Kowalski (a wonderfully dry Parker Posey); and the kick of seeing the Man of Steel simply do his Super-thing using his heat vision, cooling breath, and superhuman strength--but just when you clamor for Supes and Singer to deliver a knockout  rush of blockbuster excitement, they instead settle for being merely entertaining.  While that is enough to make Superman Returns an agreeable summertime diversion, it cannot help but be a bit of a let down given not so much the studio-manufactured hype (though that does count) but the anticipation by fans over the years.

Joining O2 for his mission to get his son back, initially reluctantly but ultimately as full-fledged partner-in-crime (in the most literal sense) is street hustler Coco (Meagan Good).  When Junior's kidnapper, crime boss Meat (The Game), demands $100,000 for his freedom, O2 and Coco go on a bank-robbing spree to raise the cash.  The heist scenes are good fun (and gives Good, in her first major league lead, a rare chance to cut loose), but like the energetic action beats these more engaging, if formulaic, aspects are of less concern to Hall than a rather heavy-handed anti-violence message.  It's a noble aim to have in a genre riddled with trigger-happy, violence-glorifying stereotype, and every now and again the message comes through effectively: the juxtaposition of O2's slacker cousin (Larenz Tate) being beaten at the same site as an anti-violence rally, the assembled crowd unaware of what's going on literally under their noses; and, best of all, a scene in which O2 and Coco lay bare the tragedy and pain in their pasts.  But a subdued, haunting, memorable scene like that is the exception rather than the rule as some already less-than-subtle background news references to Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa cracking down on crime but eventually build to some sledgehammer speechifying.
The frustration grows as the whole ""escape from the hood for a better and safer life"" theme takes more and more precedence over the admittedly derivative but far more effectively done aspects.  The light amusement of the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" angle soon dissipates (and one rather forced, late-in-film joke that appears in the trailer doesn't help), and even the bread-and-butter chases and gunplay lose their luster and urgency; the ultimate showdown with Meat is so abrupt and anticlimactic as if to be a mere afterthought.  Through it all, though, the cast does make the most of what they're given.  Gibson shows a solid future as a hard action lead (and there is an opening now that Wesley Snipes has sadly been consigned to the direct-to-DVD dustbins); Good, freed from the token sexy girl trap that usually confines her, smoothly juggles the comedic and dramatic duties; the ever-dependable Tate lends credibility to a fairly thankless part (when will he get another crack at a lead role like he deserves?); and in his surprisingly scant screen time, The Game oozes appropriate menace.  The one exception would be the junior Hall, the director's son, who sadly doesn't display the natural performing instincts of either his father or mother, Kasi Lemmons.
But all the good will generated by the appealing lead duo and the few effective action sequences is all but wiped away by a wholly expected but no less cheeseball coda.  No spoilers here, but its sticky sweetness is so extreme that it nearly plays as surreal parody--particularly in a film that, for most of its run time, obviously strives to address some sort of truth about the harsh, real world.

Click (PG-13) 


A workaholic family man (Adam Sandler) comes into possession of a remote control that is universal in the most literal sense: the device allows him to pause, rewind, fast forward, even picture-in-picture his life.  The expected Sandler juvenalia ensues, such as the trailer moments of slow-mo'ing the bountiful, bouncing breasts on a comely jogger and pausing to move a rude kid's catching arm so he could get hit in the face with a ball, as well as unrelated, grotesque crudeness such as his family dog's incessant urge to hump an oversized plush duck toy.  As is what has become the Sandler norm, such crudeness co-exists with schmaltz, as his put-upon wife (a wasted Kate Beckinsale, spending most of the film wearing sleepwear short-shorts) and his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner) constantly nag him about the importance of family over work.
And so one braces oneself for the inevitable sap-soaked conclusion, but no amount of preparation can steel one enough for the rather flabbergasting turn the film takes in its final third.  Director Frank Coraci's ""movie"" (as the credits pointedly state, as opposed to ""film"") ventures far beyond the expected touchy-feely hugs-'n-healing into a mass of old age makeup and balls-out, would-be Oscar clip emoting by the erstwhile Waterboy himself.  The most devout Sandler devotees would be hard-pressed to honestly call him a terribly rangy actor, and the maudlin muck of the final stretch would be a challenge to sell with a seasoned dramatic actor, let alone someone who has never possessed any sort of emotional pulse on screen like Sandler.  While I've never been a fan of his particular brand of humor, if the alternative is suffering through him struggle mightily to convey angst over lost moments with his dad is, bring on the ""comical"" outbursts of violence, tiresome ""You can do it!"" callbacks, and Rob Schneider cameos.

On the whole, however, Moore falls short, though to be charitable some of the film's problems were beyond his help.  The loaded casting of Peck in the original film was a stroke of genius and luck, as the Atticus Finch baggage of his traditional on-screen persona added a deeper, more unsettling undercurrent to the film, particularly its climax; there is no comparable contemporary star whose presence would've had the same effect, however well Schreiber does here.  In sticking so close to the original, the role of Katherine is just as thankless as it is in the first film, leaving Stiles as stranded and underused as Remick was.  Also, the idea of an evil, demonic child is far less fresh after seeing brats routinely raise hell in both horror films and comedies raise hell the past three decades.  However, places where Moore attempts to put his stamp on the proceedings don't compare, such as the far less tense editing of the climax to, more crucially, his direction of young Davey-Fitzpatrick.  Where Donner had his young star, Harvey Stephens, play Damien fairly straight for the most part, Moore has Davey-Fitzpatrick make evil eyes to the other actors and the camera, making for a wink-wink quality that undercuts any attempts at scariness."
"Jun 24, 2006",positive," It was tempting, after viewing this surprisingly good remake of Richard Donner’s 1976 horror classic “The Omen,” to begin this review with the phrase ‘Well, I’ll be damned,’ but then I thought about it, and it just didn’t seem to be the wise course of action. Still, it must be stressed that this movie had all the makings of being an amped up, slam-bang satanic action thriller, but director John Moore, who does not possess the most impressive résumé (“Flight of the Phoenix,” “Behind Enemy Lines”), shows remarkable restraint in terms of pacing, effects (there are only a handful of CGI moments), and use of sound. He lets the story do the talking, and he captures the suffocating nature of the protagonists’ dilemma to paralyzing effect.  The movie begins in Rome, where young diplomat Robert Thorne (Liev Schrieber) discovers that his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) has just lost her baby in childbirth. Father Spiletto, the attending priest, tells Robert of another woman in the hospital who died while giving birth to a healthy son, and Robert, not wanting to break the bad news to Katherine, agrees to take the abandoned son as his own. After an “accident” takes out Robert’s superior (hello, “Final Destination”) and catapults Robert to the job of US Ambassador of England, he and Katherine live a relatively normal life.  But as their son Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) approaches his sixth birthday, the Thornes witness a series of strange occurrences. Their nanny commits suicide at Damien’s birthday party. Her replacement, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow, the mother of Rosemary’s Baby herself), takes in a rottweiler as a pet for Damien without asking the Thornes for permission. Damien all but ignores Katherine, who assumes at first that it is because of her failures as a mother. Soon, however, she starts to get wise, and Robert tries in vain to keep Damien under control and his wife in the dark while enlisting the help of a photographer (David Thewlis) who has discovered a disturbing pattern in the photographs of his subjects.  The most refreshing aspect of “The Omen” is its near-complete disregard for how modern-day horror movies are made. The (creepy) nightmare sequences are all shot in silence, with the imagery doing all the talking instead of an overblown, percussion-heavy audio track telling the audience when to be frightened. Even the death scenes are old-school from a CGI perspective; in fact, one gore-free scene will have audience members squirming. This is surely due to the savvy decision to bring back David Seltzer, screenwriter of the original “Omen,” to update his own story. If anyone knows what worked and what didn’t work in the original film, it’s Seltzer, and it sure as, um, hell doesn’t hurt that he came of age in an era where the story was the most important part of a film, and as a result the urge to make a splatterfest does not come naturally.  Newcomer Davey-Fitzpatrick has the coldest eyes you’ve ever seen, though to call what he does here acting would be a stretch. (He has five lines, tops.) Pete Postlethwaite has a nice turn as the priest who warns Robert of his son’s origins, but no one suffers more for their art here than Stiles, whose Katherine knows she’s up against something otherworldly and evil, yet cannot find the strength or courage to fight it, never mind convince anyone else that it exists. It brought to mind Charlize Theron’s performance as Keanu Reeves’ wife in “The Devil’s Advocate.” The hapless female pawn of evil: there’s good acting to be had in those parts.  I went into “The Omen” expecting very little, and walked out gobsmacked. Seldom is a supernatural horror movie so sly, and Moore filled this movie to the brim with quick jabs, hidden references and otherwise unsettling visuals that may not even register on a conscious level. For the fans of the “Final Destination” and “Saw” series, they may view this as a disappointment, since it’s less about the violence than the story. But if someone wants an ultraviolent satanic thriller, they can rent “Warlock.” This, on the other hand, is horror with a soul. Sleep tight. DVD Review:
			    A disappointingly slim offering  from 20th Century Fox, especially given the fascinating subject  matter. The featurette “Omenisms,” which begins with a disturbing story about  the film to a pivotal scene being mysteriously destroyed, turns into a sterile,  lengthy making-of bit that’s more about the mundane nature of making a movie  than anything else. Indeed, director John Moore (who also provides an audio  commentary along with his producer and editor) is not at all afraid to be a  diva no matter who is filming him. But “Omenisms” holds nothing in terms of  toothlessness to “Revelations 666,” which feels like it was made for Rupert  Murdoch’s Fox Faith channel. The most unsettling extra is “The Abbey Road  Sessions,” which shows composer Marco Beltrami’s creepy score being recorded in  the most famous studio in the world.

"Jun 24, 2006",neutral," Another month, another horror remake. Though it's certainly not as bad as various other entries in this burgeoning genre - ie House of Wax, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc - The Omen primarily comes off as a slow-paced, surprisingly tedious update that ultimately feels more redundant than anything else.  Liev Schrieber  stars as Robert  Thorn, a successful diplomat who agrees to take in a homeless newborn after the death of his own baby during childbirth - though he neglects to inform his wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles), of the switch. Years later, when it becomes clear that little Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) doesn't just look extremely sinister, Robert finds himself forced to take matters into his own hands. The Omen's been directed by John Moore, a filmmaker with a distinctly bland, workmanlike sense of style - as evidenced in watchable yet visually inert flicks like Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix. The movie is consequently devoid of an underlying feeling of dread, with individual sequences far more engaging than the whole (ie there's a terrifically suspenseful bit in which Damien, riding around his house on a scooter, stalks his mother before going in for the kill). Moore's decision to ape its predecessor's exceedingly deliberate pace proves to be disastrous;  there are long stretches within the film's midsection that are just stupefyingly dull, primarily due to the fact that we're several steps ahead of Schrieber's Robert Thorn. As such, the plethora of sequences that find Robert immersed in an investigation revolving around the true nature of his son can't help but come off as superfluous and  thoroughly monotonous. This feeling of apathy extends to virtually every facet of the film's production, and there are moments in which the viewer is drawn more to the impressive set design than to the actual content of individual scenes. And while The Omen does improve as it progresses - that infamous decapitation is much more impressive here than in the original - there's simply no overlooking the needlessness with which much of the film has been imbued.

"Jun 12, 2006",negative," It seems only fitting that the Devil's true name is Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, a lineal collision of such sprawling implication that the mind reels before even the unspooling of a single reel of this finely honed yet utterly pointless remake. There is, as I'm sure you already know, the origin of Seamus, a fine old warhorse of an Irish name cribbed, somewhere along the line (if the majority of baby-naming Web sites are to be believed), from the English James, meaning ""he who supplants."" A-ha! Clearly something's rotten in heaven already, and so we move on to Davey, which can only point, conspiratorially I might add, to that beloved series of faith-based, clay animation shorts Davey and Goliath, in which a boy and his dog (not to be confused with the L.Q. Jones' film version of Harlan Ellison's seminal post-apocalypse tale A Boy and His Dog, although, really, at this point, why the hell not?) attempt to circumnavigate the serpentine coils of pixelated early-pre-adulthood. From there it's just a hop, skip, and a jump (over a vast lake of molten human carnage) to factoring in the way-too-obvious-to-ignore fact that Davey and Goliath, chums to the end, aired in syndicated format from 1960-65, which gives us, um, two sixes and a five plus a one, which, of course, adds up to – wait for it! – 666 (obviously the one, the nine, and the dash are erratum and should be discarded from the sum)! Fitzpatrick, well, I haven't had time to figure that one out yet, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the word ""tricky."" The point of all this is by now lost even on me, although I can safely say that the mystery of this remake of Richard Donner's 1976 demon-child flick is infinitely more entertaining – and puzzling – than anything going on in The Da Vinci Code. The story here is an almost note-perfect reproduction of the original with some minor details cast out (Gregory Peck, for one) in favor of the kind of actorly upgrades you get in nearly all remakes these days (Liev Schrieber, for two), which is to say, not so hot. As the American ambassador to Italy/England and nonsire of the Antichrist, Schreiber musters little of Peck's steely gravitas, although he acquits himself admirably in any case. Stiles, however, is just plain miscast as both his wife and Damien's unwitting human stepmom. Lee Remick was 41 when she tried to raise hell, and at 25, Stiles is still too cheerfully coltish to believably manage the complex maternal terrors at the heart of this character. This Omen's major (and only) coup comes courtesy of Mia Farrow. As Mrs. Baylock, the Antichrist's anti-Mary Poppins, she uses her own whippet-thin frame to gleeful, deviant effect. Having previously acted the part of Catholic girl-turned-Satan's cheerleader, Farrow here achieves a stratum of self-referential cinematic meta-irony that's oddly endearing to watch. She plays it as straight as a scalpel on an umbilicus and momentarily puts Rosemary's Baby clean out of your mind. Momentarily. Apart from the show-stopping third-act demise of Thewlis (very nicely upping the ante on David Warner's original show-stopping last gasp) and the whole Davey-Fitzpatrick what's-in-a-name mindfuck, Farrow's delicately crazed performance is the only real reason to rush out to see the film. And, it goes without saying, only if you've already savored Donner's broodingly tawdry original.

Whether you're relocating a small business or a large corporation, understanding the nuances of commercial moves is crucial. This comprehensive guide explores the intricacies of commercial moving services and provides insights to ensure a smooth transition for your business. Commercial moving differs significantly from residential moving. It involves the relocation of sensitive equipment, important documents, and large pieces of furniture, all while minimizing downtime and disruption to business operations. Commercial moving companies specialize in these types of moves, equipped with the right tools and expertise to handle the unique challenges that come with moving a business. The key to a successful office move lies in thorough planning. Start by creating a detailed moving plan that outlines every aspect of the move, including timelines, budgets, and specific responsibilities. Early planning helps in identifying potential challenges and provides ample time to address them. Involving employees in the planning process can also help in easing the transition. Selecting the right commercial moving company is critical. Look for commercial moving companies with experience in handling office moves similar to yours. Check their credentials, insurance policies, and customer reviews. A good commercial moving company will offer a range of services tailored to your needs and provide a detailed plan to ensure a seamless move. Minimizing downtime is a top priority during commercial moves. To achieve this, consider moving in stages or outside of regular business hours. Communicate with your commercial moving services provider about your business needs to develop a strategy that minimizes impact on operations. Keeping employees informed and involved is also key to a smooth transition. Effective organization is essential for a successful move. Labeling boxes, creating detailed inventories, and having a clear layout plan for the new office can streamline the moving process. Commercial moving companies often provide services such as packing, unpacking, and setting up equipment, which can be invaluable in ensuring an organized move. Once the move is complete, the focus shifts to setting up your new office for success. This involves more than just unpacking; it's about creating a functional and comfortable workspace. Work with your commercial moving services to ensure that everything is set up according to plan. Take this opportunity to reevaluate your office layout and make improvements that can enhance workflow and productivity. Relocating an office is a significant undertaking, but with the right commercial moving company, it can be a smooth and efficient process. By understanding the essentials of commercial moves, planning effectively, and choosing the right commercial moving services, you can ensure a seamless transition to your new office space. Remember, a successful move is not just about transporting items from one place to another; it's about ensuring the continuity and growth of your business in a new environment.

The dynamism of the business world requires not just metaphorical movement but, at times, literal ones too. The challenges of business relocations are many, from logistical nightmares to operational downtimes. Here's where full service commercial moving companies can be your savior.  Relocating a business isn't merely about shifting items from one location to another. It's a complex task, involving planning, coordination, and ensuring minimal disruption to the daily workings of the company. Amidst these complexities, moving companies, especially those offering full-service packages, have emerged as crucial partners for businesses on the move. Today's businesses relocate for myriad reasons. It could be to tap into new markets, to cater to expansion needs, or even downsizing in some cases. But every move brings with it a set of unique challenges. While moving companies have been long-standing partners in this journey, the evolving demands of businesses now require movers who can provide a more holistic solution. So, what sets full service commercial moving companies apart? They go beyond the traditional packing and transportation. They delve deep into managing every minor aspect, from logistics to ensuring the new setup mirrors the ethos of the business. In essence, these movers act as an extended arm, ensuring businesses continue to function seamlessly even in transit. The decision to opt for a full-service move can be one of the best a business makes. The expertise that full service commercial moving companies bring to the table is unparalleled. The safety standards they adhere to ensure assets, both delicate and bulky, are transported without a scratch. Their services provide unmatched convenience, allowing businesses to focus on what they do best, while the movers handle the rest. And let's not forget the time and potential revenue saved when the move is efficient and quick. When considering a business relocation, it's vital to weigh the initial outlay against the long-term benefits. While the upfront costs of hiring a full-service mover might seem high, the long-term gains, both in terms of operational efficiency and reduced downtime, often justify the investment. As the business landscape gets more competitive, the number of moving companies vying for attention has increased. It's imperative for businesses to do their due diligence. Look for movers with a solid track record, solicit reviews, and perhaps most importantly, ensure their services align with the specific needs of the business. A move isn't just about assets; it's about people too. Ensuring that the team is comfortable, well-informed, and prepared for the move is as crucial as the physical relocation. A smooth transition for employees often translates to quicker business resumption. Technology is rapidly changing the way we do business, and this extends to relocations too. The best full service commercial moving companies are leveraging technology to offer real-time updates, use advanced logistics solutions, and ensure moves are as efficient as they can be. In the fast-paced world of business, a move can signify growth, change, or a strategic shift. To ensure this transition is as smooth as possible, partnering with full service commercial moving companies can be the key. After all, in the world of business, time is not just money; it's opportunity. Navigating the complexities of a commercial move can be a daunting task. From ensuring that every asset is accounted for to managing the logistics, the process can quickly become overwhelming. But with the right planning and support from professional commercial moving services, your business can experience a seamless transition. Here’s your comprehensive guide to mastering commercial moves. A commercial move isn't just about changing addresses. It’s a pivotal moment that can impact operations, staff morale, and business continuity. Choosing adept commercial movers can be the difference between a smooth transition and a logistical nightmare. A relocation decision often stems from growth, a need for a more strategic location, or operational requirements. Before jumping into the move, critically evaluate the reasons. Understand the long-term benefits, and weigh them against the short-term disruptions. One of the critical decisions in a commercial move is selecting the right moving service. Not all commercial movers are created equal. Look for full service commercial movers companies that offer comprehensive solutions - from packing to set-up. Their experience, reviews, and capability to handle moves of your scale should guide your choice. This stage is all about organization. Establish clear timelines, delegate responsibilities, and set milestones. Collaboration with your chosen commercial moving services ensures that both parties are aligned on priorities and schedules. Efficiency is key. Every piece of equipment, every desk, and every file needs to be accounted for. Commercial movers often provide specialized inventory systems to track assets, ensuring that nothing goes amiss during the move. Engage department heads and communicate clearly with staff about the move. Their cooperation is vital. After all, they’re familiar with their workspaces and can aid in the efficient packing and unpacking of their areas. Full service commercial movers companies often provide guidelines and checklists to assist in this internal coordination. Commercial moves can involve complex equipment, from IT servers to large machinery. Handling these requires expertise. Commercial moving services are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge to transport such items safely. Once the move is underway, attention shifts to setting up the new space. Think about optimal space utilization, ensuring that the new layout supports efficient operations. Expert commercial movers can offer insights based on their experience with other businesses, ensuring your new space is both functional and welcoming. After the move, there's an adjustment period. Solicit feedback from staff, address any issues promptly, and celebrate the successful move. Remember, the goal isn’t just to relocate but to improve. If there are any hiccups, full service commercial movers companies often provide post-move support to help resolve them. Mastering a commercial move is about meticulous planning, clear communication, and the right partnerships. With the support of professional commercial movers and a comprehensive approach, businesses can ensure their relocation is more than just a move—it's a step forward. Whether you're upsizing, optimizing, or reshaping, remember that every move carries the promise of growth. By partnering with the right commercial moving services, that promise becomes a guaranteed success. Relocating to a new place can be a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, apprehension, nostalgia, and anticipation. Regardless of the reasons behind the move, the process invariably presents its set of challenges. While many brave the journey independently, an increasing number of individuals are relying on moving companies to simplify the ordeal. In particular, home moving companies and residential movers have transformed the relocation landscape, offering specialized services tailored to personal moves. Here’s a guide to help you navigate your move with ease. In conclusion, moving is more than just a physical transition—it's an emotional and psychological journey. While it presents its challenges, partnering with trusted home moving companies or residential movers can alleviate many of the burdens associated with relocating. As you embark on this new chapter, remember that every box unpacked and every picture hung is a step closer to making the new place feel like home. Happy moving! Choosing to outsource employee payroll duties to an accounting firm or other payroll system is a good decision for small businesses looking to make doing the payroll easier. Using a payroll system, employers no longer need to struggle with tax rules, data recording, and other frustrating tasks that take time away from them actually doing business. As easy as all of this can be, many business owners have questions about how the process works when outsourcing employee payroll to a payroll service. Relocating to a new home symbolizes fresh starts and exciting opportunities. But it's no secret - moving can be stressful, and costs can quickly add up. Understanding the financial implications and planning strategically can help you navigate this process without breaking the bank. This guide is designed to provide practical, budget-friendly tips for your next move. The first step to a budget-friendly move is understanding potential costs. These can vary significantly based on factors such as distance, the size of your household, and the type of move. Local moving companies typically charge per hour, while long-distance moving costs are usually calculated based on weight and mileage. Additional expenses may include packing materials, insurance, and potential storage fees. Understanding these costs upfront allows you to plan your budget more accurately. Once you've estimated your relocation costs, creating a comprehensive moving budget is crucial. Your budget should account for moving services, packing supplies, travel expenses, and potential additional costs such as insurance and storage. Consider setting up a dedicated moving fund to manage these expenses. A well-planned budget can provide you with peace of mind during this transition period. There are two primary options when it comes to the actual moving process: hiring professional moving companies or opting for a DIY move. Professional movers can simplify the moving process significantly. However, costs can be high, so it's important to obtain and compare quotes from several moving companies. A DIY move can be a more cost-effective option, especially for smaller, local moves. Weigh the pros and cons of both options before making a decision. Smart packing begins with a thorough decluttering. The fewer items you have, the less you'll spend on moving them. Sell, donate, or recycle items you no longer need. Then, when it comes to packing, consider sourcing free or inexpensive packing materials. Many local moving companies sell used boxes at a discounted price, or you might collect boxes from local businesses. Timing your move can significantly impact costs. If possible, try to move during the off-peak season (usually winter), as moving companies often offer lower rates during these times. Additionally, remember to check for available discounts or deals from moving companies. Protecting your belongings with appropriate insurance can also prevent unexpected costs from damages or losses. Upon arrival, setting up your new home can be managed cost-effectively too. When installing utilities, compare service providers for the best rates. When it comes to furnishing, second-hand stores or online marketplaces can offer excellent deals. Remember, investing in regular home maintenance can prevent expensive repairs down the line. Relocating doesn't have to break the bank. By understanding moving costs, planning a comprehensive budget, making smart decisions about moving services and packing, and setting up your new home economically, significant savings can be achieved. Above all, remember that the secret to a budget-friendly move is in strategic planning, not cutting corners. With the right approach and reliable local moving companies supporting your move, this transition can be both financially manageable and exciting. As a small business owner, managing your payroll system is one of the critical functions that ensure the smooth operation of your business. A payroll service is a third-party company that automates all payroll-related tasks, taking the burden off your shoulders. The question is, should small businesses invest in payroll services? This article delves into this topic in depth. Payroll services are specialized firms designed to handle multiple aspects of your employee payroll. These services are responsible for calculating employee wages, deducting appropriate taxes, managing benefits, garnishments, filing necessary tax documents, and ensuring the issuance of direct deposits or paychecks.  There are different types of payroll services available. Full-service payroll companies provide a comprehensive package, including all necessary functions, while online payroll services offer convenient web-based solutions. Lastly, payroll software allows small businesses to manage payroll tasks in-house with more ease and efficiency. When you think about the time involved in managing your payroll system, the argument for outsourcing to a payroll service becomes more compelling. As a small business owner, your time is a precious commodity. A payroll service can take over these duties, freeing you up to focus on the core business operations. From a financial standpoint, outsourcing can be more cost-effective than you might imagine. If you factor in the hours spent on payroll tasks, plus the potential costs of mistakes and penalties from incorrect filings, hiring a professional payroll service could be a worthwhile investment. One of the significant challenges with handling employee payroll is the potential for mistakes. Even small errors can result in hefty penalties. A payroll service has expertise in this area and can help you avoid costly mistakes. Compliance with tax laws is another area where payroll services shine. Keeping up-to-date with changing regulations can be a full-time job in itself. Payroll services have the resources to stay current with these laws, ensuring your business remains compliant. Moreover, a professional payroll service can provide simplified employee management. They can handle everything from new hires to terminations, benefits administration, and even employee self-service portals. When it comes to choosing a payroll service, you'll first need to assess your business needs. Do you need a full-service option, or would an online service or software meet your needs?  Features to consider include automatic payroll runs, multiple payment options, tax filing services, and integrations with existing systems. Balancing cost and quality is also crucial. While you don't want to overpay, it's essential to ensure the service you choose can accurately and efficiently handle your employee payroll. Several small businesses have reaped the benefits of hiring a payroll service. For example, a small retail store owner managed to cut down on operational hours significantly by outsourcing their payroll, allowing them more time to focus on business growth. On the flip side, businesses that chose to handle payroll tasks internally often faced penalties for incorrect tax filings and employee dissatisfaction due to payroll errors. In conclusion, hiring a payroll service can bring significant benefits to a small business. From saving time to reducing costs, ensuring compliance with tax laws, avoiding mistakes and penalties, and simplifying employee management, the advantages are substantial. As a small business owner, your focus should be on growing your business. If managing your payroll system is detracting from that, it may be time to consider investing in professional payroll services. Remember, the right payroll service is not an expense but an investment towards your business's growth and success. When DIY local moves end up being the best option but a little help with the boxes is necessary, many local moving companies provide truck loading and unloading services to take care of the most difficult part. Hiring local moving services to handle the heavy work can end up being the perfect compromise for those with access to their own or a rental truck but simply do not have the ability or desire to load and unload it.  Though many people find that local moves done on a DIY basis are their best way to move inexpensively, it is important to also be realistic about what is actually involved in this process. Hiring a local moving service that offers truck loading services is an affordable option for DIY movers who do not have help available, or simply cannot do all that lifting on their own!"

Whether you're relocating a small business or a large corporation, understanding the nuances of commercial moves is crucial. This comprehensive guide explores the intricacies of commercial moving services and provides insights to ensure a smooth transition for your business.

Once the move is complete, the focus shifts to setting up your new office for success. This involves more than just unpacking; it's about creating a functional and comfortable workspace.

Take this opportunity to reevaluate your office layout and make improvements that can enhance workflow and productivity.

The dynamism of the business world requires not just metaphorical movement but, at times, literal ones too. The challenges of business relocations are many, from logistical nightmares to operational downtimes. Here's where full service commercial moving companies can be your savior.  Relocating a business isn't merely about shifting items from one location to another. It's a complex task, involving planning, coordination, and ensuring minimal disruption to the daily workings of the company. Amidst these complexities, moving companies, especially those offering full-service packages, have emerged as crucial partners for businesses on the move. Today's businesses relocate for myriad reasons. It could be to tap into new markets, to cater to expansion needs, or even downsizing in some cases. But every move brings with it a set of unique challenges. While moving companies have been long-standing partners in this journey, the evolving demands of businesses now require movers who can provide a more holistic solution. So, what sets full service commercial moving companies apart? They go beyond the traditional packing and transportation. They delve deep into managing every minor aspect, from logistics to ensuring the new setup mirrors the ethos of the business. In essence, these movers act as an extended arm, ensuring businesses continue to function seamlessly even in transit.

Their services provide unmatched convenience, allowing businesses to focus on what they do best, while the movers handle the rest. And let's not forget the time and potential revenue saved when the move is efficient and quick. When considering a business relocation, it's vital to weigh the initial outlay against the long-term benefits. While the upfront costs of hiring a full-service mover might seem high, the long-term gains, both in terms of operational efficiency and reduced downtime, often justify the investment. As the business landscape gets more competitive, the number of moving companies vying for attention has increased. It's imperative for businesses to do their due diligence. Look for movers with a solid track record, solicit reviews, and perhaps most importantly, ensure their services align with the specific needs of the business. A move isn't just about assets; it's about people too. Ensuring that the team is comfortable, well-informed, and prepared for the move is as crucial as the physical relocation. A smooth transition for employees often translates to quicker business resumption. Technology is rapidly changing the way we do business, and this extends to relocations too. The best full service commercial moving companies are leveraging technology to offer real-time updates, use advanced logistics solutions, and ensure moves are as efficient as they can be.

Here’s your comprehensive guide to mastering commercial moves. A commercial move isn't just about changing addresses. It’s a pivotal moment that can impact operations, staff morale, and business continuity. Choosing adept commercial movers can be the difference between a smooth transition and a logistical nightmare. A relocation decision often stems from growth, a need for a more strategic location, or operational requirements. Before jumping into the move, critically evaluate the reasons. Understand the long-term benefits, and weigh them against the short-term disruptions. One of the critical decisions in a commercial move is selecting the right moving service. Not all commercial movers are created equal. Look for full service commercial movers companies that offer comprehensive solutions - from packing to set-up. Their experience, reviews, and capability to handle moves of your scale should guide your choice. This stage is all about organization. Establish clear timelines, delegate responsibilities, and set milestones. Collaboration with your chosen commercial moving services ensures that both parties are aligned on priorities and schedules. Efficiency is key. Every piece of equipment, every desk, and every file needs to be accounted for. Commercial movers often provide specialized inventory systems to track assets, ensuring that nothing goes amiss during the move. Engage department heads and communicate clearly with staff about the move. Their cooperation is vital. After all, they’re familiar with their workspaces and can aid in the efficient packing and unpacking of their areas. Full service commercial movers companies often provide guidelines and checklists to assist in this internal coordination. Commercial moves can involve complex equipment, from IT servers to large machinery. Handling these requires expertise. Commercial moving services are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge to transport such items safely. Once the move is underway, attention shifts to setting up the new space. Think about optimal space utilization, ensuring that the new layout supports efficient operations. Expert commercial movers can offer insights based on their experience with other businesses, ensuring your new space is both functional and welcoming. After the move, there's an adjustment period. Solicit feedback from staff, address any issues promptly, and celebrate the successful move. Remember, the goal isn’t just to relocate but to improve. If there are any hiccups, full service commercial movers companies often provide post-move support to help resolve them. Mastering a commercial move is about meticulous planning, clear communication, and the right partnerships. With the support of professional commercial movers and a comprehensive approach, businesses can ensure their relocation is more than just a move—it's a step forward. Whether you're upsizing, optimizing, or reshaping, remember that every move carries the promise of growth. By partnering with the right commercial moving services, that promise becomes a guaranteed success. Relocating to a new place can be a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, apprehension, nostalgia, and anticipation. Regardless of the reasons behind the move, the process invariably presents its set of challenges. While many brave the journey independently, an increasing number of individuals are relying on moving companies to simplify the ordeal. In particular, home moving companies and residential movers have transformed the relocation landscape, offering specialized services tailored to personal moves. Here’s a guide to help you navigate your move with ease. In conclusion, moving is more than just a physical transition—it's an emotional and psychological journey. While it presents its challenges, partnering with trusted home moving companies or residential movers can alleviate many of the burdens associated with relocating. As you embark on this new chapter, remember that every box unpacked and every picture hung is a step closer to making the new place feel like home. Happy moving! Choosing to outsource employee payroll duties to an accounting firm or other payroll system is a good decision for small businesses looking to make doing the payroll easier. Using a payroll system, employers no longer need to struggle with tax rules, data recording, and other frustrating tasks that take time away from them actually doing business. As easy as all of this can be, many business owners have questions about how the process works when outsourcing employee payroll to a payroll service. Relocating to a new home symbolizes fresh starts and exciting opportunities. But it's no secret - moving can be stressful, and costs can quickly add up. Understanding the financial implications and planning strategically can help you navigate this process without breaking the bank. This guide is designed to provide practical, budget-friendly tips for your next move. The first step to a budget-friendly move is understanding potential costs. These can vary significantly based on factors such as distance, the size of your household, and the type of move. Local moving companies typically charge per hour, while long-distance moving costs are usually calculated based on weight and mileage. Additional expenses may include packing materials, insurance, and potential storage fees. Understanding these costs upfront allows you to plan your budget more accurately. Once you've estimated your relocation costs, creating a comprehensive moving budget is crucial. Your budget should account for moving services, packing supplies, travel expenses, and potential additional costs such as insurance and storage. Consider setting up a dedicated moving fund to manage these expenses. A well-planned budget can provide you with peace of mind during this transition period. There are two primary options when it comes to the actual moving process: hiring professional moving companies or opting for a DIY move. Professional movers can simplify the moving process significantly. However, costs can be high, so it's important to obtain and compare quotes from several moving companies. A DIY move can be a more cost-effective option, especially for smaller, local moves. Weigh the pros and cons of both options before making a decision. Smart packing begins with a thorough decluttering. The fewer items you have, the less you'll spend on moving them. Sell, donate, or recycle items you no longer need. Then, when it comes to packing, consider sourcing free or inexpensive packing materials. Many local moving companies sell used boxes at a discounted price, or you might collect boxes from local businesses. Timing your move can significantly impact costs. If possible, try to move during the off-peak season (usually winter), as moving companies often offer lower rates during these times.

"Jun 7, 2006",negative,You know a movie is not worth the celluloid it's printed on when the only clever or even remotely original thing about it is its release date.
"Jun 7, 2006",positive," Senior American diplomat Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is called to an emergency at a nearby hospital: his very pregnant wife, Kathryn (Julia Stiles), had a difficult delivery and according to hospital priest, Father Spiletto, the baby died at birth. Despondent over the loss and fearing the impact it will have on Kathryn, Robert accepts the priest’s offer to replace the dead child with another born the same night. Little does he know that this act of compassion will unleash Armageddon upon the earth in “The Omen.” The President's Godson Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber, ""The Manchurian Candidate"") is on a happy trajectory as the U.S. Ambassador to Italy's right hand man and beloved husband of Katherine (Julia Stiles, ""The Bourne Supremacy"") when he is faced with a dire decision. Unbeknownst to her, his wife has lost their firstborn during a difficult labor. A priest, Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice, ""Gangs of New York""), suggests a white lie - the substitution of another child born within the hour of that June 6th day - and so Robert offers his wife this unknown baby to her as their own, setting the stage for the fulfillment of ""The Omen."" David seltzer (""Dragonfly"") wrote the script for the original 1976 version of this post-Exorcist Satanic tale and gussies it up with some modern day indications of what was prophesied in the Book of Revelations - the Challenger disaster and 9/11 among them. But although Seltzer otherwise offers an almost note for note replay of his first pass, director John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines,"" ""The Flight of the Phoenix"") has delivered a slight improvement, a film that is scarier and more unsettling the second time around. The audience is clued in to something amiss well before the Thorns are when a Rube Goldbergesque accident fells the Italian ambassador just as he's about to assume a more prestigious post in London. The job falls to Robert and Katherine responds by acquiring a magnificent estate she feels is suited to their new position. When Damien turns five, an elaborate birthday party turns horrific when his nanny (Amy Huck, ""From Hell,"" ""EuroTrip"") steps out onto the roof in view of all, proclaims 'It's all for you Damien!' and plunges several stories from a noose. Photographer Keith Jennings (David Thewlis, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"") captures everything and is at the Embassy the next day to photograph the priest, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite, ""The Constant Gardener,"" ""Æon Flux""), who is escorted from the premises after speaking to the Ambassador. In the darkroom, Jennings begins to make a supernatural connection that dovetails with Brennan's predictions and begins to convince Thorn that his son may be the spawn of Satan. The new ""Omen"" features art direction as subtle as a matador's cape, yet it is effective. The color red always surrounds those about to die in the Devil's quest for power and when Thorn is shocked to discover the mark of the beast, 666, on his son's scalp, one wonders why he's never really noticed the pattern on the boy's bedroom wallpaper. Katherine's psychological breakdown as she begins to believe her son is evil incarnate is supported by extremely creepy dreams and Stiles very effectively evokes the confusion, paranoia and terror of her situation, just as Schreiber, a terrific actor, conveys the gravity of his situation. The casting of a prior mom of Satan's son, Mia Farrow, as Mrs. Blaycock, the nanny whose references never get checked, was a masterstroke and Farrow is a hoot, all sweetness in public (the original's terrific Billie Whitelaw was obviously a bad guy from the get go), all shining fervor in privacy. Thewlis is a big plus as the photographer personally motivated to assist Thorn. The film's big weakness is young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien - he's creepy enough as a cutaway, but too one note overall. If the purpose of a remake is to bring an older film to a new audience, ""The Omen"" must be considered a success. It's real trick is to treat those who are familiar with the original to some new chills with a familiar story. In 1976, director Richard Donner created quite a stir with scripter David Seltzer’s screenplay about the birth of the Anti-Christ on the earth. Now, 30 years later, helmer John Moore takes that same screenplay and faithfully recreates the original in a modern, yet old-fashioned, retelling of “The Omen.” Movie icons Gregory Peck and Lee Remick played the surrogate parents to the spawn of Satan the first time around in a slick and scary tale of one man’s mission to stop evil from taking over the earth. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles reprise the roles of Robert and Kathryn Thorn in a remake that is geared for a brand new audience that would eschew the ’76 film but will readily embrace the update. As I said, the new “Omen” is a blow-by-blow reproduction of the earlier movie so, if you are familiar with the latter, you won’t get anything new from the remake. But, “The Omen” is a well-made supernatural thriller that moves along at a good and entertaining clip, from the shocking “Damien, it’s all for you!” nanny (Amy Huck) suicide to the deadly dispatch of Father Brennan (Pete Posthelwaite) and Robert’s realization that he is the step-father of Satan’s child. Director Moore does a solid job with Seltzer’s original script and talented cast in making “The Omen” a fresh telling of the rise of ultimate evil on earth. Schreiber, lacking the baggage of fame that Gregory Peck brought to the original, is able to envelop himself in his character, Thorn, as the diplomat faces increasing evidence that his “son,” Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), is anything but an innocent little boy. Julia Stiles has the tough role as fragile Kathryn who is the first to realize that something is terribly wrong with her son. The supporting cast is superb with Mia Farrow giving a kindly turn (though with a wicked undercurrent) as Damien’s newest nanny, Mrs.Baylock, and minion of the Devil. She is all sweetness as she protects her unholy ward, making her deadly part in the conquest of the world all the more chilling – the laughs from members of the audience over her antics had a distinctly nervous edge. Pete Postlethwaite gives a fine performance as the priest who is trying to right the wrongs he has committed in the service of Satan by convincing Thorn of Damien’s dangerous heritage. His demise is one of the slickest bits of F/X in the film. David Thewliss, as the paparazzi who joins Thorn in his mission, makes the original David Warner role his own. Michael Gambon is just okay in the small role as a priest who advises and arms Thorn with the weapons to kill the Anti-Christ. Aside from the several special F/X sequences, “The Omen” is meat-and-potatoes storytelling that builds its tale of the Anti-Christ in an old-fashioned, unencumbered way. John Moore made a solid directing debut with his exciting “Behind Enemy Lines (2001)” and bellies up to the bar of his latest film with capable competence. He is joined by a team of behind the camera players that help make this remake seem fresh, even today. Older audiences familiar with the 1976 version of “The Omen” will not get anything new with the remake. But, this new rendition is aimed at a new audience and provides solid entertainment on the big screen. I can see the film buffs, especially supernatural horror film buffs, watching both films back to back just to compare the two. Heck, I’d watch the first one again just to compare the two films."

"Jun 6, 2006",positive," Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) is serving as a staff member under the US ambassador to Italy when his wife, Katherine (Julia Stiles), is told she lost her baby in childbirth. A priest in the maternity ward offers Robert hope: a child was born to a mother who died in childbirth with no family to care for it. After learning that Katherine can no longer have children of her own, Robert takes the child in place of his own and lies to his wife to complete the illusion. A few years later, circumstances have propelled Robert to becoming US ambassador to Great Britain, but the mysterious deaths that got him there start hitting closer to home. Something is very wrong in the world, and Robert’s secretly adopted son Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) seems eerily connected to it all. This remake of The Omen really boils down to an out-and-out horror flick that pulls NO punches; it’s been a long time since each death was held on screen for every savory second. Impalement, decapitations, and one that will make your skin crawl the next time you’re left alone in a hospital. At the same time, it’s a creepy thriller that showcases Liev Schreiber from non-believer to man-of-faith; the only question is, will his character be convinced of what everyone else in the audience can plainly see? Will he be in time to save himself and the entire world from the son of the devil himself? There are a few requisite ‘boo’ scares (scary image and loud sound combo), but director John Moore does an excellent job of leaving not only the music out but cleverly quieting the sound until, at the same time you realize everything is too quiet, suddenly something happens and it’s not blown on a throwaway. Besides the perfectly creepy atmosphere, an above average cast (Harry Potter alumni David Thewlis and Michael Gambon are among Damien’s adversaries) keeps the drama and the mystery going in spite of the fact we all know where it’s going. Did I mention that the camera doesn’t pull away as the good guys are cut down like weeds? It’s been a while since I’ve seen the original, long enough that I wasn’t sure what happened next, and that may be a good thing for this particular remake. The only real problem with the great setup and story is knowing it has to end and knowing HOW it should end, and this is also where the script and/or director finally trips at the finish line. It doesn’t take a whole lot of imagination to think of a better (or sneakier) way to for the good guys to thwart the bad guys, but if they did, you couldn’t have a sequel, now could you? Still, they could have made it less obvious and allowed the characters to continue showing the intelligence they had previous demonstrated throughout, so while it’s a good show, it stops just shy at being as great as it could have."
"Jun 6, 2006",negative," It may be 6.6.06, but the date you should remember is 6.20.06, which is when the original Omen is re-released as a Collector's Edition DVD. The Omen, although a remake, may be a cinematic first – a film whose entire existence can be attributed to a date. The three 6’s for which the series of films (starting with 1976’s original of the same name) are so well-known are given prominent placement not only in this film, but in the blitzing marketing campaign. This gimmick is only a microcosm of the film itself, which is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original and about as unnecessary as horror remakes can be (save Gus Van Sant’s appalling remake of Psycho). This is largely jump-scare horror that is tailor-made for a big opening week and then a prompt trip to the Wal-Mart bargain bin. For those who haven’t seen or heard about movies for the past thirty years or so, the film chronicles the amazingly bad luck of Robert (Schreiber) and Katherine (Stiles) Thorn. As the film opens, Katherine gives birth to a child who dies soon after. Robert is told of the tragedy, but he can’t bring himself to tell Katherine because of the guilt she would have to endure. This is where the infamous Damien (Davey-Fitzpatrick) enters the picture, as he takes the place of the dead child that Katherine really thinks is hers. As years pass Damien never really forms any kind of connection with his parents, and as his sixth birthday approaches strange, seemingly supernatural events begin to take place. The Thorns, under the wisdom and advice of numerous religious figures, begin to believe that Damien may be the devil incarnate. Screenwriter David Seltzer may have topped John Hughes’ narrative recycling job for Home Alone 2 with this. To call this version an “update” is stretching it since virtually every scene is recreated to a tee. Because of this you’d think director John Moore, who I’m still in the process of trying to forgive for 2001’s Behind Enemy Lines, would try and mold the film a bit and give it a touch all his own. This is not the case as he drives the film through several Final Destination-style death sequences and a whole lot of puttering through standard-issue jump scares and religious mumbo-jumbo. But the real problem arises when you put the film in perspective to the original’s age. Scary little kids in films are a given these days – a far cry from 1976. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, while slightly ominous with his messy jet-black hair and blank stare, just isn’t very frightening. He has next to no lines and his sly smile and grimace is more likely to draw laughs than actual apprehension. It’s not his fault; it’s just how audiences react these days because we have been bombarded with pale, evil children. The rest of the performances are suitable, but hardly memorable. Liev Schreiber is clearly no Gregory Peck, but he at least brings some depth to Robert Thorn. Julia Stiles is run through the emotional gamut as Katherine, but there is a slight immaturity (likely age) on Stiles’ part that keeps the character from being completely convincing. Mia Farrow actually runs away with the show as Mrs. Baylock, who is actually the hellish protector of Damien. Her non-chalant demeanor is the creepiest thing about this film. Regardless, The Omen is a wash just like so many of these unnecessary, cash-cow remakes. Just like The Da Vinci Code, The Omen does not seem like a summer film, but, oh yeah, it’s all about June 6, 2006! It may be 6.6.06, but the date you should remember is 6.20.06, which is when the original is re-released as a Collector’s Edition DVD."

"Jun 6, 2006",neutral," It's good that he stands out, because for better or worse, there's not much beyond the performances to distinguish this horror thriller from the 1976 ""The Omen"" starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. While other remakes of scary '70s movies have tossed in 21st century updates -- ""When a Stranger Calls"" ... now with text messaging! -- the formula here is the same: Big-name actors. Slow pace. Shocking deaths. Creepy little kid with a bowl haircut. Other than the obvious marketing advantages of releasing this movie on 06/06/06, a second ""Omen"" seems completely unnecessary, even if it is kind of fun. The set-up -- diplomat Robert Thorn's wife has a stillborn child, so priests replace it with another baby, who turns out to be the devil's son -- is the same, although the scenario seems even more ridiculous now. Anyone who has given birth in the age of HMOs knows that hospitals do everything short of installing LoJack in the fetus to avoid a switched-baby scenario. Do you think Kaiser wants 45 straight days of bad publicity on ""Nancy Grace?"" Thorn is named ambassador to England, and after horrific things keep happening to people close to his son, he becomes a tabloid newspaper target. A seedy photographer, played by David Thewlis, suspects supernatural forces are responsible and a mystery unravels, punctuated by a series of gory chain-reaction deaths. (Young people might think ""The Omen"" is paying homage to the ""Final Destination"" series, when it's really the other way around.) Among the actors, only Liev Schreiber in the Thorn role is a disappointment, giving an uninterested, monotone performance that recalls Christopher Lambert in his prime ""Highlander"" years. Julia Stiles is much better as Katherine Thorn, overcoming the movie's Jerry Lee Lewis casting (Stiles looks like she's 14 and Schreiber looks 40) to bring nuances to her stay-at-home mom role. Newcomer Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is outstanding as Damien -- immediately joining Haley Joel Osment and those two little girls from ""The Shining"" in the Freaky-Looking Kid Hall of Fame. The producers also recruited a Robert Altman movie-worth of great character actors, including Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite. Is there anyone other than Postlethwaite who could shout the line ""Its mother is a jackal!"" and not sound totally ridiculous? In this crowd of master thespians, Mia Farrow elbows everyone off the stage, playing a very polite but seriously imbalanced nanny who acts as Damien's protector. Whether it was done with studio makeup and camera tricks or real-life sessions with Dr. 90210, Farrow's face is now approaching Loni Anderson/Priscilla Presley levels of wax-like immobility. And what could be scarier than that? Director John Moore plays the light-versus-dark themes for all they're worth, and his visual style helps make ""The Omen"" feel like a mature horror film. Truth be told, the director uses many of the same cheap-thrill techniques featured in the ""Friday the 13th"" films, but Moore has the skills to make it look like art. Writer David Seltzer, who also scripted the original ""The Omen,"" makes a few huge missteps in the second try. The movie is derailed early on by video of the smoking Twin Towers, Hurricane Katrina damage and tsunami destruction in Thailand -- all described as signs of the coming of the Beast. Whether or not it's too soon to include these recent disasters in a feature film is a matter of opinion, but in terms of filming a fantasy, these distracting real-world images take a while to get over. And even though the new ""Omen"" has a nearly identical plot, it is missing the best part from the original film and its sequels -- that totally sweet ""Sanguis bebimus! Corpus edimus!"" chanting in Jerry Goldsmith's musical score, which got cranked up every time Damien did something particularly evil. (The words translate to ""We drink the blood! We eat the flesh!"" How cool is that?) The remake is a solidly crafted movie with a lot of good scares, but it also raises the question: Why even bother with an update? -- Advisory: This film contains profanity, gore and multiple themes involving murdering children. Anyone who is pregnant, intends to get pregnant or just loves babies should not only run screaming from ""The Omen,"" but spend the next month watching PBS stations to avoid stumbling onto the movie's commercials. ... If you do go, try walking into tonight's 6 p.m. showing at 6:06 and six seconds. You might miss a trailer for ""Snakes on a Plane,"" but people will think you're a total badass.

"Jun 6, 2006",positive," My movie-geek friends and I sometimes play a game where we take an old classic flick and recast it with actors working today. Like, if you were gonna remake Star Wars, who would play Han Solo? That kind of thing. Why would we do that? I dunno — maybe it’s just the prospect of hearing someone like Josh Holloway or David Duchovny saying, “Never tell me the odds!” It’s just fun. And I think director John Moore played that game with the creepy-silly 1976 flick The Omen… and I think he had a whole helluva lot of fun in the process. Look, he got Pete Postlethwaite to dress up like a priest and say classic stuff like “His mother is a jackal!” That’s awesome. That’s pure movie-geek goofiness. And maybe casual moviegoers who don’t see the dorky joy of that won’t find much to appreciate in this remake that they didn’t find in the original, but for me, seeing an example of The Casting Game taken to fruition and up on the screen is enough of an answer to that eternal Hollywood question: Why remake this movie now?
Sure, Moore — who is building a track record of making movies that are simply popcorn-fun, like Flight of the Phoenix (another remake) and Behind Enemy Lines — makes a bit of an attempt to update David Seltzer’s 1976 script for today, throwing in some handwringing by the Vatican over all the signs of the Apocalypse that have been showing up lately, like 9/11 and the Indonesian tsunami. But for the most part, this is strikingly like the original film, to the point where part of the movie-geek fun is ticking off the classic moments as they swing around: There’s the big black satanic dog! There’s the birthday party with the hanged nanny! Here comes the bit with Damien screaming at the prospect of going to church! Oh, I think I know what they’re gonna find in that grave in the Italian cemetery! It’s like the remake of Poseidon from a few weeks ago, only better. And that’s because, in a weird way, this Omen is so much more like the original than Poseidon was. Moore didn’t mess with a classic, like Poseidon did — he’s paying homage to it. I mean, no one stages Hamlet if they don’t love the play, and not to make this Omen sound heavier than it is, cuz it’s just a cool and creepy movie, but it’s kinda like that. It’s not deep or important or challenging — it’s cinematic comfort food. Sometimes you want filet mignon, sure, but sometimes you just want meatloaf. And this is really really good meatloaf, with the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy made from scratch, not poured out of a can. I don’t mean to insult this cast by likening them to diner food — they are why it’s so much fun waiting for all the Omen moments to come around, to see how they’ll deal with them, and why the film is still so suspenseful even when you know absolutely everything that’s gonna happen. Every single one of them makes you go, Yes! That’s exactly whom I would have cast! Liev Schreiber (The Manchurian Candidate, The Sum of All Fears) is Robert Thorn this time around, the American diplomat who, out of love for his wife, agrees to a secret baby substitution that saddles him with the spawn of Satan. Schreiber’s one of those sly actors who can turn on a dime between genuinely profound emotion and deadpan snark, and though here it’s mostly things like heartstopping grief and sheer terror that he’s working with, he’s the kind of actor who keeps you on your toes, never quite knowing what to expect from him. And he’s a lot more convincing, actually, as an anguished father and husband than Gregory Peck was in the original, particularly paried up with Julia Stiles (The Bourne Supremacy, Mona Lisa Smile) as Robert’s wife, Katherine. Both Schreiber and Stiles are at least twenty years younger than Peck and Lee Remick were in the original — the other major deviation Moore took from 1976 — which supplies one of the few new spins: It’s all in the subtext, nothing overt, but now, instead of an older couple and their last-chance child, we have a much younger couple with different hopes and expectations from parenthood. And the rest of the cast is just, well, gravy. Mia Farrow, the mother of Rosemary’s baby, as Mrs. Baylock, the satantic nanny? That’s simply inspired. Postlethwaite (Aeon Flux, The Constant Gardener) as the doomed-to-be-impaled Father Brennan is perfect. David Thewlis (Basic Instinct 2, Kingdom of Heaven) as Keith Jennings, the photographer who captures warnings of impeding death with his cameras? Who else could you possible cast in that role? The kid playing Damien, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, is like an evil little Harry Potter, dark hair, blue eyes, and a malevolent pout. He’s hilarious. Evil, but hilarious. (More fun: The original Damien, Harvey Stephens, appears briefly here as a reporter.)"
