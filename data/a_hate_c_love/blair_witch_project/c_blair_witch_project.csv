Apr 4 2024,positive,so convincing was this clever chilling fake documentary that donahues mother received sympathy cards from people who believed that her daughter was actually dead or missing 
Jun 5 2023,positive, i distinctly remember driving home in the dark along a desolate country road my family lived in the boonies feeling a mild dread at my wooded surroundings it was july 1999 and my buddy and i had just seen the blair witch project at the local multiplex i had seen horror movies in the theater before but never anything that seemed so real i knew it was a work of fiction  the marketing hadnt pulled the wool over my eyes  but this was the first found footage film i had ever seen and it actually rendered me somewhat nervous as my friend pulled into my rural driveway that night and i got out of the car i wasnt the only one impressed by the blair witch project the film was a massive success going on to be one of the most profitable films of all time with a worldwide box office of 2486 million set against a budget of just 60000 thats insane but was it a fluke i dont think so id argue that the blair witch project remains an effective horror film with its firstperson camcorder style and slowburn dontshowshit delivery seriously im still waiting to see that witch giving it a rawness and realness that made what might have been a rote horror flick into something memorable not only that but the movie spawned an entire subgenre of horror  found footage  and blazed a trail for viral internet marketing it might have spawned a couple crappy sequels but its a highly influential horror film and one worth watching 20 years later think about the horror landscape of the late 1990s horror had actually been made hip again by  scream  just a few years earlier and most bigname films coming out were clones  eg  i know what you did last summer urban legend the blair witch project was almost the antithesis of these movies a lowbudget indie flick starring plainlooking folks set in the woods in rural maryland no blood no ta  yawn city right but the film got wide distribution and its firstofitskind nature made it stand out from the glossy herd some of it might have been due to the marketing more about that in a bit but put simply the blair witch project  is a scary tooreal experience and it certainly helped that no one had ever seen anything like it before its a fairly simple story a trio of student filmmakers go to burkittsville maryland to investigate the famous blair witch they go into the woods find weird rocks outside their tents and even weirder stick figure people hanging from the trees then one guy josh goes missing theres lots of screaming and finally the remaining two heather and mike are taken out by an unseen force in some random creepy house in the woods scary but nothing groundbreaking storywise but the firstperson foundfootage format gives all of this action a realness that slick cinematography and spooky mood lighting never could youre watching real people on a real somewhat uneventful hike through the woods and youre practically out there with them it helps that most of the dialogue was improvised the actors were sent into the woods for eight days directed where to go and what scenes to act each day by a series of messages left in film cans throughout seneca creek state park there might not be any snappy dialogue or incredibly staged shots in the blair witch project but theres an authenticity to the experience that makes things really scary when shit starts to hit the fan the scarefactor gets a big boost thanks to the films restraint maybe it was a budgetary thing could they even afford to make an effectivelooking witch with their pittance of a budget or maybe filmmakers daniel myrick and eduardo sánchez were students of the jaws and alien school of horror filmmaking but it certainly helped that they didnt show the witch or gore or really any of the scary visuals one would expect from a horror movie think about it you never see a dead body no witch in the movie the most graphic thing shown is a pile of sticks containing what is believed to be joshs bloody shirt teeth and hair its onscreen for a split second and its no more scary than something youd pick up at a spirit halloween shop but all of this holding back allows the viewer to ruminate to build up horrifying images in their own heads some might call that cheap or lazy but its effective as hell and it worked once hollywood saw how successful the blair witch project was it was only a matter of time before others followed in myrick and sánchezs footsteps not only was found footage a unique new way to tell stories but it was hip and capital c cheap would the paranormal activity stylefontweight 400 franchise or cloverfield exist had the blair witch project not shown that found footage could work the genre really took off in the early 2010s with a new one practically coming of every other day it seemed  the last exorcism vhs unfriended  some found footage films are memorable some are abysmal whats been made abundantly clear is that making a found footage production isnt enough to carry a mediocre film the blair witch project works because it slowly builds dread and features realistic characters that one can empathize with it also helped that it was a novel idea a truly original concept in 1999 in 2019 a director has to work extra hard to make an effective found footage movie not seem like a gimmick its not surprising that blair witch the second sequel to the blair witch project has a 37 percent rating on rotten tomatoes slicker is definitely not better when it comes to these type of films its all about creating an authentic experience  myrick and sánchez came up with the concept for the blair witch project after realizing that paranormal documentaries of which they were fans were often scarier than traditional horror movies based on the same mythology when they began marketing the blair witch project they went allin on the documentary angle pitching it as actual footage the final days of a trio of real filmmakers the marketing campaign was way ahead of its time missing persons posters were made for heather mike and josh flyers were passed out at sundance asking for information that might lead to the discovery of the missing filmmakers  the pièce de résistance was the films website which included fake police reports about the incident info on the blair witch mythology photos of the filmmakers at film class before embarking on their journey and more its the kind of stuff you see all the time done to promo modernday movies but this was back in the days of aol some people saw it for the cheeky marketing that it was but a lot of people really took it all at face value which says a lot about the power of good marketing and the gullibility of the general public  the blair witch project isnt a horror film experience on par with the exorcist or the shining but thats not a fair comparison its an experience all its own the films impact has been slightly overshadows by the overflow of found footage productions that have come out in its wake but it remains an influential movie and a potent example of the power of restraint in the horror genre even though its hella fake the blair witch project still holds up john brhel johnbrhel is an author and pop culture writer from upstate new york he is the coauthor of several books of horrorparanormal fiction including corpse cold new american folklore and resurrection high and the cofounder of independent book publisher cemetery gates media he enjoys burritos and has seen indiana jones and the temple of doom way too many times
Dec 15 2022,positive,the blair witch project is the most effective and unsettling horror movie in quite a long time just to clarify after seeing this you will not sleep well invest in a nightlight
May 26 2022,positive,the intimacy of video and the believability of the three students close the gap between film and viewer truly allowing us to suspend disbelief something horror films seldom do
Apr 11 2022,negative, with the benefit of hindsight writing a review of the blair witch project seventeen years after the fact remains a thorny prospect i can choose to look at the horror movie as a whole as objectively as possible or i can simply judge my initial experience seeing the movie in 1999 or i can even consider my subsequent viewings after the rash of found footage offshoots it inspired have worn down the gimmick rendering it no longer effective if it ever was after all more substantial narratives have improved upon the movies unsatisfying ending and rather annoying visual experience in the years since its release even while employing the same found footage structure chronicle and the bay come to mind and though filmmakers daniel myrick and eduardo sánchez didnt invent the genreruggero deodatos disagreeable 1980 gorefest cannibal holocaust deserves that crownthey popularized it my take on the film i suppose will be a combination of these approaches so lets begin with a little background much talkedabout upon its release the blair witch project debuted at the sundance film festival and was purchased by artisan for release the following summer shot on the ultracheap over eight days in a maryland forest myrick and sánchez set out to create something people would believe actually happened they were fascinated by documentaries involving paranormal research and witchcraft their production company haxan films was named after benjamin christensens 1922 documentary häxan in which dramatized sequences recreate haunting moments of torture and ritualistic killingterrifying stuff they hired unknown actors to handle the cameras themselves and shoot their experiences in the woods it was an entirely improvised experience scenario and the directors interacted with eg messed with their performers from a distance resulting in some very authentic responses hundreds of hours of footage were cut down to an 81minute feature when it came time to release the movie artisans clever marketing campaign suggested the events depicted therein were real the movies official website  still going strong contained faux newsreel footage and interviews attesting to its authenticity and the realworld existence of the blair witch legend insisting in october of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary a year later their footage was found several articles in otherwise respectable magazines and newspapers featured similar real or nottype articles about the movie meanwhile a socalled documentary appeared on cable television detailing the origins of the blair witch in burkittsville formerly blair at the time i was in high school and can attest to the widespread belief that the blair witch project was real as though any studio large or small would release a supernatural snuff film onto the public indeed when i first saw the film on opening weekend at the uptown theater in minneapolis mn the audience buzzed with belief and anticipation and though i remained skeptical i cannot deny the movies initial impact especially during the first hour of footage all playing themselves amateur filmmakers heather donahue and josh leonard are joined by a soundman michael c williams on their investigative project into the blair witch the backwoods folktale involved a mysterious figure in the woods missing children abnormally thick arm hair and wooden stick figures when they set up camp in the blair witchs supposed terrain the filmmakers experience unsettling sounds in the night wake up to curious rock piles around their campsite and quickly become lost tensions run high as the situation causes our trio to turn on one another leading to one disappearance and an abrupt ending that suggests everyone involved in the expedition died horribly the blair witch projects most effective quality remains its use of our imagination to build up otherwise silly things into horrifying omens for example josh finds some slime on his backpack one might just attribute this to slugs or some other organic residue from the forest but because josh keeps obsessing about it we cannot help but feel he was marked by something out there why me he keeps asking as though he hopes to perpetuate a selffulfilling prophecy likewise small piles of rocks and twig figures have never seemed so scary because we remember the movies initial scenes where the crew records the convincing tales of local bumpkins these quaint average folk take hearsay as fact and wholeheartedly embrace the rural legend the seed has been planted for our imagination to later run wild with terrible possibilities unfortunately what appears onscreen never amounts to much beyond psychological torment the dark and dense forest setting consistent shaky handheld camerawork and footage shot on video and 16mm leave it impossible to make out anything of significance the characters run through the woods and shout things like did you see that but the answer is nono we did not the camera didnt see it and so neither did the audience every ghost hunter and paranormal investigator on television has applied the same tactic ultimately the audience never sees a thing and the movie remains dependent on what we believe the characters see as opposed to what we see by the time the rushed final sequence in a rundown woodland shack comes to pass we hear joshs screams as mike stands in a corner awaiting execution from whoknowswhat and heather is presumably bludgeoned to death when the screen went black and the end credits began to roll i remember groaning in disappointment along with most of the theater that was it many spectators complained i remember thinking who was able to safely recover this footage from the basement of the blair witchs house was that person tormented too i also remember thinking the ending robbed the viewer of any emotional closure but not in a manner that proves satisfying many horror films over the years have ended with everyone dying yet they were much more substantial experiences dramatically the experience engineered by myrick and sánchez has almost no shelf life whatsoever beyond its runtime after that all suspension of disbelief has been shattered and the rush is over nevertheless the blair witch project received extremely positive reviews it still holds an 86 rating on rottentomatoes earned a cult following and became something of an urban legend itselfat first anyway later that same year it was nominated for a golden raspberry award for worst picture largely due to backlash about the unsatisfying ending amid the accolades roger ebert specifically praised the way the movie exploited our fear of the unknown and while the unknown remains a compelling force in the horror genres best entries halloween the thing the mist rosemarys baby etc those examples each demonstrate that believing in the unknown is dependent on seeing something sticks and stones and slime dont amount to much whereas a shape in the woods or a brief snapshot of a shadow may have elicited our fear beyond the end creditsrec 2007 and its remake quarantine 2008 are fine examples of this the blair witch project lost me the first time after the screen cut to black during subsequent viewings i have been even less engaged as a critic i must review the overall experience and not merely how frightened i was during the first hour as a film historian i must acknowledge that the movies phenomenon has come and gone while its experience and reputation have not aged well
Feb 4 2022,positive,it sticks with you as much for its old ideas as for its new ideas blair witch may represent the cuttingedge of independent filmmaking but its heart is as ancient and familiar as a grimms fairy tale
Oct 28 2021,positive, directed by daniel myrick and eduardo sánchez the blair witch project follows three student filmmakers heather donahues heather joshua leonards josh and michael c williams mike as they travel into a maryland forest to shoot a documentary about a local urban legend filmmakers myrick and sánchez deliver a typically erratic foundfootage thriller that ultimately fares best in its opening and closing sections as the movie which is certainly never boring admittedly does suffer from a hitandmiss midsection thats focused largely on the protagonists lessthanenthralling lostinthewoods exploits ie the relentless squabbling eventually becomes repetitive to say the least its clear then that the blair witch project benefits substantially from the superb efforts of its sympathetic performers and a narrative thats been suffused with attentiongrabbing distinctly spooky setpieces and theres little doubt as well that myrick and sánchez do a superb job of initially drawing the viewer into the proceedings with a first act devoted to character development and blair witch backstory the movie is of course at its best in its increasingly bleak and impressively terrifying climactic stretch with the nowiconic finale ensuring that the whole thing concludes on as memorable and nightmareinducing a note as one could possibly have hoped  which consequently does cement the blair witch projects place as a strong entry within a notoriously uneven genre
Oct 21 2021,positive, spooks love thresholds gateways and portals they famously congregate on walpurgis night the evening before may day that marks the end of spring and the advent of summer  and conversely they also gather on halloween the night that closes autumn and heralds the onset of winter  this is why october in general and halloween in particular loom so large in the genre calendar for christians its the night before all saints or hallows day although it also overlaps with the celtic pagan samhain a celebration of the end of harvest thats also a liminal time when the border between our world and the otherworld becomes fluid  halloween is a festival of masks and costumes of carnivalesque inversions supernatural encroachments and demonic incursions when the cold grip of winter sets in and the dead mix freely with the living essentially its horror time  and it has lent its name to a horror franchise which including reboots and reimaginings has now been stalking for 43 years autumn however is a flexible season traditionally for english speakers it began on lammas day 1 august and ended on halloween 31 october while meteorologists and modernity see it spanning the start of september to the end of november and north americans place it between the autumnal equinox 21 to 24 september and the winter solstice 21 to 22 december so while unsurprisingly halloween will both as a key autumnal  and eldritch  calendar event keep recurring in this selection of autumnal horror films the final choice falls in november it might be supposed that robert mulligans adaptation of harper lees 1960 novel covers events that are mostly summerbound in depressionera alabama and that the film is more comingofager and courtroom drama than horror but young siblings scout mary badham and jem phillip alford live in fear of a reclusive neighbour whom they nickname boo and magnify with their own terrifying mythology and so an element of southern gothic is there from the start after the films pivotal court case is over a coda takes place on one long october night in which all the films themes of crime prejudice and scapegoating come together in a moment of autumnal horror as jem and scout return home through the woods  scouts perspective and ours restricted by her halloween costume  they are stalked and attacked by a drunken vindictive man with a knife and rescued from murder by boo it was made by josé ramón larraz in the same year as his vampyres and similarly features lesbianism violence and a big gothic pad in the english countryside  but that is where all similarity ends for this moody psychodrama  britains official palme dor entry at cannes  comes much closer to hitchcocks psycho 1960 or polanskis repulsion 1965 as it traces the unraveling of strange sensitive helen angela pleasance returned from abroad to the old family estate in the company of her more worldly writer friend anne lorna heilbron  with the leaves on the trees starting to turn a neurotic yellow the propertys grounds yield up buried ghosts as the infantilised helen confounds the living with the dead in her secluded dolls house of repressed sexuality and murderous desire like helens former friend cory larrazs film disappeared only to resurface when its original negative  long believed lost  was recently rediscovered and restored bob clarks black christmas 1974 may have inaugurated the calendar killer but it was john carpenters film that would make halloween a fixture in the slasher annals as according to the now iconic poster the night he came home the pronoun it though is preferred to he by psychiatrist dr sam loomis donald pleasance  named for a character from alfred hitchcocks urslasher psycho 1960  to denote his escaped patient michael myers a deranged murderer of the silent heavybreathing type as myers now sets his sights on bookish virgin laurie strode janet leighs debuting daughter jamie lee curtis and other coeds in the redandyellowleafy suburbs of haddonfield illinois loomis refers to him unscientifically as the evil while evidently himself relishing crouching behind bushes in the dark and frightening children after 15 years under this doctors supervision its unsurprising that myers boyhood psychopathy has ripened autumn is the season of harvest and fritz kierschs film adapted from a short story by stephen king is folk horror fixated on reaping whats been sown in the fictional backroads town of gatlin nebraska the failure of the corn crop leads local children to sacrifice all the communitys godfearing grownups to an agricultural deity he who walks behind the rows and to install their own underage cult falling somewhere between william goldings 1954 novel lord of the flies and narciso ibáñez serradors 1976 film who can kill a child three years after this teen takeover an adult couple peter horton and linda hamilton becomes ensnared in the town on 31 october and ultimately burns down the now fertile fields this cornfed sometimes corny study of outlandish religious zealotry taps into urban anxieties about the bible belt before restoring adult order after a halloween of kiddy chaos  certainly dr lin pascoe gillian bevan replies to parkinson in the studio there are more reports on halloween than any other night of the year the fact that lesley mannings ghostwatch written by steven volk was also first broadcast on halloween in 1992 only added to its reality effect as this telemovie alarmed viewers with the possibility that the very act of watching was putting them at risk in their own homes  in october of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary reads the text that opens daniel myrick and eduardo sánchezs ultralowbudget feature which would set the template for all the found footage horror to come over the next decades while yielding a massive return on investment  doom is coming as surely as winter for heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard even as something messes with them at night this turnedaround trio find themselves irrationally retreading the same mythic pathways that they earlier filmed locals relating  and the leafy sparseness and longer nights that midautumn brings only add to the bleakness of the films atmosphere for here the endless trees bare and featureless become ever more disorienting  and nothing quite captures the groups sheer desperation like the sight of a despondent mike chewing on a fallen dry leaf sonys first computer animated film begins in territory familiar from to kill a mockingbird with kids dj and chowder spying on the house opposite and exchanging farfetched stories about its cantankerous toystealing old resident nebbercracker yet here the setting is unambiguously autumnal in what is possibly cinemas first and only opening singletake sequence focalised entirely through a deciduous leaf animation lets an impossible shot closely track the goldenhued leaf as it is blown by wind from a tree to the piles of similarly coloured leaves on the sidewalk below is swept up again by a little girls passing tricycle and finally comes to rest at the titular houses front door  the rest of gil kenans gateway horror for children concerns a house not so much haunted as physically possessed by the angry childhating soul of nebbercrackers deceased wife constance trick or treaters beware set as its title implies over halloween but confounding its timelines and storylines to dizzying effect michael doughertys debut feature is an almostanthology of five tales that crisscross and interweave over one long night in a small ohio town this structure with its disinterest in chronological linearity and its clashing of different narrative strands introduces a jigsawlike tricksiness more akin to robert altmans short cuts 1993 than to your average horror omnibus what unifies all these episodes beyond their jagged singularity of time and place is a nostalgic ec comicsstyle brand of twisted morality that sees characters punished for infringing the rules of this night when the supernatural runs riot there are serial killers ghosts werewolves and a candybrandishing pumpkinmasked child named and embodying sam hain  but the victims here are all getting their just deserts for failing to respect the spirit of halloween over this long dark night of the soul our anguished antiheroine  dressed in angels wings  must decide whether she will keep her baby or give it up this choice is staged as a garishly stylised jarringly nightmarish reassemblage of halloweens traditional iconography into something of an altogether different hue marking its difference from so much halloweenfocused autumnal horror both by its title and by beginning on all souls day two days after halloween rainer sarnets straightfaced surreal feature similarly defies categorisation for its all at once a slice of 19thcentury estonian ethnographyanthropology a bizarre funny surprisingly bawdy folk horror and a beautifully stylised if often messy and muddy monochrome study in expressionism  here villagers resort to all manner of supernatural ploys and deceptions to assist their thievery so they can survive the coming winter and its associated plague in a rural backwater that for all its small size still manages to accommodate devilish automata werewolves ghosts vampires necromancy somnambulism and witchcraft yet at its heart this is a tragic love triangle as two young locals vainly use enchantments to make their cold nights warmer even as autumns encroaching end brings its deadly chill to everything 
Apr 14 2021,positive, congratulations with your recent purchase of a brandnew rokuapple tvamazon fire stick youre ready to  as obiwan kenobi said  take your first step into a larger world that larger world is of course the world of cord cutting in which a seemingly endless supply of streaming apps services and content are available instantaneously at your fingertips but with so many options of things to watch spread out across so many different services changing literally by the day whats worth bingewatching before it expires and youd have to  gasp  pay for it allow crossing the streams to be your official guide to whats worth watching before it expires whats just been made available and whats just plain damn good vhs 2 netflix the found footage subgenre is dead long live the found footage subgenre the flame that was kindled with the blair witch project and fueled gasolinically by the paranormal activity franchise was pretty much officially killed by the negative response to the albeit commercially successful and underrated imo blair witch in 2016 sure our obsession with found footage horror films spawned plenty of mistakes willow creek the devil inside apollo 18 but it also uncovered a lot of gems lake mungo the last exorcism the bay one of the more critically successful entries into the subgenre is 2013s vhs 2 the second installment in what would turn out to be a trilogy of horror anthologies its predecessor may have set the template but vhs 2 set the standard with shorts dealing with everything from zombies a ride in the park to aliens slumber party alien abduction simon barrett youre next the guest gareth evans the raid apostle eduardo sánchez the blair witch project and more of their ilk lend their talents to a truly terrifying film that successfully found the middle ground between innovation and motivation for how to utilize handheld pov footage in the most haunting ways the film will expire from netflix on october 24th which is only a scary thought if you dont also have a subscription to either hulu or amazon prime signs hulu m night shyamalan is back in the news and for the first time in a long time its because people are excited about something hes doing more on that in a bit weve ragged on the guy for so long  mostly deservedly so  that its easy to forget that at one point in our lives a shyamalan release was accompanied by a lot of excitement and hype perhaps too much seeing as the sixth sense grossed over 670 million worldwide to go along with 6 oscar nominations youd be forgiven to think that his continued success wasnt all but guaranteed unbreakable wasnt nearly as financially or critically successful as its predecessor so it was signs that showed  at the time at least  that shyamalan wasnt a fluke as a writerdirector sure the film has some troubling perspective on faith god responds well to your anger the twist is a little nonsensical would people with pollen allergies build a house in a field of daisies and mel gibson exists but the film features some great performances from joaquin phoenix cherry jones and abigail breslin in her first big screen role in addition im a sucker for an effective scary movie that involves aliens and if youre gonna tell me that you didnt jump during that scene in the basement with the alien arm im gonna call you a liar signs will disappear from hulu like the aliens hope for conquering earth on october 31st  unbreakable hulu we were all rightfully skeptical when the visit was released but its success combined with the response to split resulted in the aforementioned excitement for a project that the internet has apparently wanted since the release of shyamalans follow up to the sixth sense unbreakable a somber and seemingly prophetically introspective take on a superhero genre that had not yet caught fire unbreakable is the favorite film for many people who have seen multiple shyamalan films even those that hate most of what hes done im living proof the film stars bruce willis as david dunn a stadium security guard who either doesnt realize or doesnt want to acknowledge that his being the sole unscathed survivor of a train derailment signals that hes something more than ordinary as moody as the sixth sense with a twist ending that packs arguably even more of an emotional punch unbreakable holds such an elevated place in my heart that im actually afraid to rewatch it out of fear that it wont hold up to my memory in that respect perhaps ill just let it expire on october 31st to help preserve its legacy predator hbo now im not sure if you heard but shane blacks the predator is not only controversial but also bad confirming again that its best to let sleeping corpses lie the predator fails so thoroughly to both entertain and engage on its own merits that its most fun moments are when it references john mctiernans action classic the oscarnominated arnold schwarzenegger vehicle it was for best visual effects but still aspires to be nothing more than a bunch of burly guys with big guns being hunted down one by one by an even burlier alien with an even bigger gun the film delivers exactly what youd expect from a reagan era action film gunfire explosions muscles violence and a final oneonone showdown between good guy and bad guy predator isnt reinventing the wheel but its having a lot of fun with what its doing come for the machismo but stay for schwarzeneggers oneliners just be sure you come before october 31st all of the titles mentioned in this section have either just been made available will be available soon or their rights have recently been renewed either way theyre not going anywhere anytime soon which is good because unless youve got little ones who are going trick or treating neither are you the blair witch project primehulushudder with how far digital and social technology have come in making the horrors of reality quickly and easily accessible to a mass audience its easy to forget how much of a phenomenon the blair witch project was when it was unleashed in 1999 shot by unknown directors with firsttime actors and heralded by a promotional campaign that blurred the lines between fiction and reality the blair witch project wasnt just a success it was a landmark in the evolution of cinema an exemplary film that popularized a subgenre that had previously existed but was little seen or respected the directors approach to the creation of the film was largely unprecedented at the time a seemingly organized cinematic improvisation that kept the actors largely in the dark  figuratively and literally  and relying a lot on luck and chemistry to generate scares and atmosphere the result was a tiny film with a budget of 60000 that grossed almost 250 million worldwide spawned two sequels and inspired countless obnoxious parodies by todays standards ie the aforementioned vhs 2 the blair witch project is pretty tame in regards to what it chooses to show you  or more accurately withhold from showing you  but for its time it was a significant achievement youve been able to venture back into the woods since october 1st the nightmare before christmas hulu the debate over whether the nightmare before christmas is a halloween or christmas movie has been raging for decades and will likely continue to rage in perpetuity but personally it just doesnt feel like its officially the halloween season until i hear that haunting song the nightmare before christmas was inspired by a poem that tim burton wrote upon seeing a department store replace its halloween decorations with those of the christmas season and was brought to life remarkably by henry selick whose stop motion work on coraline would later net him a welldeserved oscar nomination for best animated feature the nightmare before christmas is one of those rare holiday films that seems to transcend generations annually being revisited and enjoyed by everyone from children to adults which is likely a result of many adults having grown up with it passing it along to their children since the film was released in 1993 jack skellington has become a cultural icon showing up everywhere from hot topic to playstation and as of october 2nd to hulu into the dark the body hulu if youve somehow missed the incessant ads for goosebumps 2 haunted halloween on hulu then you might be unaware of huluween the streaming services rollout and promotion of all their content both original and borrowed dealing with things that go bump in the night hulu is cleverly using the halloween season to debut their horror anthology series into the dark which will feature monthly featurelength installments inspired by a holiday its premiere episode the body follows a hitman who has to transport a body on halloween night and is cowritten and directed by paul davis based on a short film he directed in 2013 starring game of thrones alfie allen reviews for the body arent great but as one of the few fans of the defunct masters of horror and fear itself im ready to give into the dark a chance the body premiered on october 5th  nightbreed amazon prime clive barker had made a name for himself as a horror writer even before he adapted his own the hellbound heart into 1987s hellraiser but it was that films success that allowed him to adapt another of his works the novel cabal into 1990s nightbreed a film that spoke to barkers social philosophy as much as hellraiser spoke to his sexuality a horror precursor to bryan singers xmen nightbreed follows aaron boone craig sheffer a young man who has dreams of a land called midian where a group of friendly monsters  the titular nightbreed   are hiding from humans who wish to see them destroyed the fragile mental state that these dreams bring about in aaron is exploited by his psychotherapist philip k decker horror filmmaking icon david cronenberg who is need of a patsy to cover up his serial killings in nightbreed its clear that both barkers and our empathy rests with the monsters an innocent group of outsiders who are hated hunted and killed by a homogenous society that sees anyone and anything different as being abhorrent one doesnt have to think too hard to see how the films message can find resonance in todays social and political climate youve been able to meet the breed since october 1st  the descent hbo now quite simply the descent is one of the best horror movies of the last 20 years ive seen a lot of horror films since neil marshalls claustrophobic film was released in 2005 but aside from ari asters hereditary none of them have scared me as thoroughly as the descent sure ive seen the film so many times that the jump scares no longer elevate me but to this day i still have a clear memory of seeing the film in theaters and beholding an entire row of young teenagers in front of me literally jump from their seats during the first big creature reveal even if it werent for the jump scares the descent is still a smart screenplay populated with fully realized characters who are kick ass women fighting for their lives amidst the enclosed caves so effectively manufactured by production designer simon bowles and lit so starkly by dp sam mccurdy admittedly high definition releases havent been kind to the limited cgi work the film contains but everything else about it rules  just look at that poster none of marshalls directorial work since has been able to equal the greatness of the descent one thing came pretty close but since october 1st you havent really had to worry about watching anything else anyway the haunting of hill house netflix netflixs the haunting of hill house series isnt the first time shirley jacksons novel has been adapted by a filmmaker nor unfortunately even the second time but based on both critical and audience responses it seems like third times a charm the haunting of hill house was created and entirely directed by mike flanagan whose exemplary horror work can already been found spread across the annals of netflix oculus hush and geralds game are all waiting for you as well stephen king has called flanagans work on the series close to a work of genius which is quite convenient seeing as the massachusettsborn filmmaker is currently at work adapting doctor sleep the sequel to the shining as of this writing im only two episodes into the series and while the scares have been limited the work done on building up the characters their relationships and whats at stake for them all has been phenomenal since his debut feature absentia flanagan has proven that he knows that you cant be scared for characters if you dont care for them first if twitter is to be believed then there are plenty of scares to come i eagerly await them youve been able to visit hill house since october 12th  somewhere in between the titles that are expiring and the titles that have just entered this world lay those that weve either taken for granted forgotten about or just plain didnt realize we could watch for free lets fix that because theyre damn good and theyre coming to get you barbara halloween shudder it wouldnt be halloween if you didnt watch john carpenters titular horror classic the film that gave us jamie lee curtis michael myers and that iconic score is still as haunting and effective as it was when it came out 40 years ago thanks in part to carpenters understanding of how to utilize camera movement and staging to unsettle viewers with a subtle sense of voyeurism on top of giving us one of the most iconic horror movie villains of all time halloween also brought the fear and paranoia that was affecting the country at large at the time into seemingly safe and secure suburbia if you plan on checking out david gordon greens sequel then youd best watch or rewatch the original classic first if for no other reason than to understand the references shudder has also brought halloween 4 the return of michael myers and halloween 5 into the fold for october if youre thirsty for more the texas chainsaw massacre shudder the 1970s saw another little known filmmaker release a lowbudget horror film that history would prove to be a seminal work in the future of the genre tobe hoopers output after the texas chainsaw massacre hasnt been treated as kindly as john carpenters and his other big hit poltergeist arguably isnt even his but when the texan passed away in 2017 he was buried with the immortal legacy of being the one who created leatherface many horror films set out to disturb the audience but few are able to concoct an atmosphere of such thorough visual and aural unpleasantness that manages to somehow behoove the film though released in 1974 and containing far less gore than a film with both chainsaw and massacre in its title would imply tcm is a remarkable albeit macabre cinematic achievement a film that feels as hot smelly and horrible as sallys marilyn burns terror would lead us to believe it was inside the sawyer abode aided in no small part by the reallife horrific working conditions im sure   oculus netflix with the haunting of hill house it seems like mike flanagan might finally get the mainstream embracing that he deserves while ouija origin of evil and oculus were relative box office and critical successes hes still only on the cusp of being a household name in the horror genre with two of his last three releases hush and geralds game being netflix exclusives excluding the complicated release history of before i wake of all those titles just mentioned oculus is the one that seems to be the most overlooked which is a shame because the film starring a postdoctor who preguardians of the galaxy karen gillan is an effective psychological ghost story the film revolves around a sister gillan who is trying to exonerate her brother brenton thwaites from murder by proving that his troubled history is the result of paranormal phenomenon caused by a haunted relic it may sound a bit ridiculous but flanagan and cowriter jeff howard do a fantastic job of making people question whether the threat to our characters is real or imagined right up until the very end of the film  blair witch amazon prime grossing over 45 million on a budget 19th of that blair witch could be considered a success but the backlash was so loud and swift that it put the kibosh on not only any sequel ideas but also on any future mainstream found footage films critics said the scares were tired and the film failed to cover any new ground but considering the innovative things that simon barrett and adam wingard were trying to do warning spoilers with both revisiting and adding onto preexisting mythology i think people were just tired with the genre and had no patience for a sequel to a decadesold film two years removed from the backlash i think that viewers of blair witch would find a wellmade horror film that attempts to inject new genre elements into a franchise that was influential to so many filmmakers including the two attempting to serve it its not the best found footage film ever but its also not paranormal activity the ghost dimension if youve been reading this blog regularly then youve already picked up on the fact its published midweek this is primarily done for the purposes of time mainly how much i dont have of it and how much of it i take to do research and compile the plethora of titles and the platforms on which they stream for me to write about here often however many titles expire before the blog is published and even before i sit down to write it meaning that a whole host of great content is lost before you even click in light of that heres a brief recap of the titles that have expired between the publishing of the last crossing the streams entry and this one just like characters in comic books though streaming titles never truly die they just reappear at later dates in venues that dont make as much sense so stay tuned
Mar 19 2021,negative, we back baby its been far too long since weve been all up in your inbox and were so happy to get back into our weekly groove we dont need to tell you that the world is a mess right now but we couldnt let spooky szn pass without proper acknowledgmentso for our very first of what will hopefully be annual halloween issue weve got zosha on the existential terror of unfriended dark web and cate on the disappointment of watching the blair witch project too late spooky szn may be on its way out but theres no reason we cant wallow in the tiny terrors of movies that are just a little too real or dont live up to our expectationswe hope youve all been well weve missed you and were so happy to get back to yelling about movies let the games begin now that description obviously strips away a lot of the nuance between the two most importantly when cate and i sat down to watch dark web together  i jokingly said i hope that this has no supernatural element at all just the actual dark web and lo it did and honestly folks it was spookier to me than the first unfriended which is supernatural horror the first one is a haunted skype call the second is a hacked one in the first the plot works hard to get you to think that these people deserve it at least in the way horror movies can warp your logic and stress a sort of puritanical punishment system for dumb teenage mistakes while in the second they do nothing but fight it but with either you get a sense that these are forces far far beyond the control and understanding that we simple humans can grasp interestingly as someone who watched the second one first and thus was informed that there was ahem no way for there to be any carryover characters from the last film i found myself watching unfriended 2 with much more suspense each time the characters attempt a new way to outsmart the hackerwho makes the danger terrifyingly real with a physical and cyber presencethey felt tantalizingly close to outsmarting the bad guy this was more than just running upstairs as opposed to running outside when escaping the masked killer these were creative problemsolving endeavors that i certainly wouldnt have thought of and after all thats what makes for compelling horror and in particular slasher film fare smart decisions that dont pay off as such unfriended 2 dark web left me on far closer to the edge of my seat than i wouldve thought for a film with such a lowhanging fruit of a name  so of course i eventually turned my attention to unfriended here i was midway through the longest september living through a pandemic and political tidal wave and ravenous for one horror film after the next i am sure that there are already personal essays out in the void that make the case for why me and so many of my friends crave horror films at this moment in time something about halloween just around the corner and covid on the other side of my mask and after watching the two i can say that this franchise feels much much closer to home than so many doeven something like host another computerbased horror film  you might know about host more by its logline filmed postmarch 2020 we follow a haunted zoom call as the participants get kicked off onebyone its a tight hour the length of their free zoom call but thats the funny thing real ones all of us by now know your free zoom call only lasts 45 minutes a bit of movie magic we sacrifice for the plot surebut it would feel less nagging if the film was more plot driven mostly what you hear is what you get the zoom call is haunted because someone decided to fuck with the zoom seance and thats about as much propelling the story as youre going to get its got jump scares but thats the entirety of your host haunts  compare that with something like unfriended 2 a 20something boy finds a laptop in the lost and found of his local internet cafe thinks its his good fortune and takes it home just in time for his weekly game night with friends as he starts logging in and loading up he finds the previous owner of the computer left some things you might not want to checklike portals to the dark web and all the evil therein  in unfriended 2 the dark web works because it feels just as otherworldly as the undead its the upside down where our laws cant touch and were vulnerable just for turning around and checking on our loved ones step wrong and youre doomed  perhaps at this moment it felt so scary not because im going on the dark web at all parents who read this i cannot stress this enough i do not and neither should you but becausejesus what the fuck would we do if our computer was haunted at this point me my friends my loved onesmany of us have had to repair our laptops or swap out computers during this time and never has our station felt quite so precarious as in those moments yes that may be a dumb thing to say during a global pandemic but i make my money via the internet and without a portalor using one thats been contaminated in some wayid be screwed and thats all ignoring the friends ive been talking off the ledge trying to counteract the brainworms they kicked up from reading the wrong kind of news  postviewing i sat trying to remember if i heard anything about either unfriended when it came out and if i intentionally shrugged off the film or just happened to let it pass me by aside from a stray line or two that felt reminiscent of a trailer i couldnt think of a feeling id had on it in the past good or bad but i also dont think it would have felt as personal to me back then after a slow build of kneejerk twitching when characters went to parties or hugged each other here was something that so closely resembled more of my daytoday an apple desktop of with folders haphazardly saved to it toggling between a video chat with loved ones i havent seen in far too long and some internet bullshit and about 18 different ways of messaging someone which i am utilizing all at once to see that corrupted felt almost personal certainly just as disorienting as my instinctive glance to the clock in unfriended 2s menu bar  but if ive learned anything else during this autumnal pandemic horror fest of mine its that i am constantly eager for something that strikes the perfect balance of horror i wont watch films that rely on torture porn or sexual assault or anything that approaches either i want enough plot to keep me going but not so much that it turns into a rumination of why do we survive im looking at you underwater and its not fun horror if the participants dont understand whats happening at least enough for a chance to fight back  unfriended 2 dark web and unfriended for that matter surpassed all my qualifications and expectations surprisingly it makes you care about the people enough that you can stake your standard thriller bets on who lives who dies who tells the story it uses its inscreen device well and has a sort of digital native understanding of the laptop things you dont understand can be easily waved away with flattened complicated expectations about worldbuilding and evil and at this moment in time the killer has never felt quite so close to home its somehow worse than the house being hauntedits your life out there and theres nothing you can do about it  when i was 10 i was very very afraid of the blair witch i was old enough to have some semblance of how the world worked but still young enough to be irrationally terrified of it it just so happens that i was also a child with an overactive imagination so the contemporaneous marketing for the blair witch project swore me off the movie for years no one seemed to know if it was real or not and i didnt need to torment my dreams with the scariest movie of all time now though as a full adult who loves horror films and has generally gotten a handle on her stress dreamsthe time felt right to backfill this missing part of my horror canon unfortunately it didnt quite live up to the hype  it isnt the movies fault in the time since it debuted grosser more terrible movies have come into existence because thats how technological advances and the onward march of time function and i too got older and more able to handle an onscreen beheading or two watching the movie gave me the same bewildered feeling i got when i finally watched a clockwork orange in college this is what all the fuss was about i am nothing if not morbidly curious and have always been drawn precisely to the things i suspect will upset me nbcs hannibal anyone im too nosy and my fomo is too strong to not be part of the conversation but as with a clockwork orange values and standards have changed dramatically in the time between the blair witch projects release and when i finally saw it frankly its got nothing on john wick 3 which i still have not gotten more than 15 minutes into despite really wanting to know what the deal is with halle berry and those dogs as you likely already know the blair witch project is about a group of three student documentarians who travel to an old town to investigate an old ghost tale when they trek into the forest and get lost they slowly lose their sanity and each other before being killed by the towns demons the problem is that the blair witch project is simply too quaint for the sensibilities of someone who cut her teeth on slasher films and murderous ghost stories and a big part of me regrets that if i had seen this film closer to release i have no doubt that i would remember it as a formative piece of terrifying media instead of simply an ambitious example of the possibilities of independent film  and the film is good make no mistake its moody and tense and the stakes increase exponentially in a way that im sure was legitimately upsetting at the time but id been prewarned that there were no jump scares and no actual blair witch looming between shots so there was an added sense that i was building to nothing my most controversial opinion is that jump scares are good actually the film it reminded me of most was actually uncut gems a movie that stressed me out so badly i had to watch it in two installments my nerves cant take a lot of constant yelling and when the intrepid documentarians behind the blair witch finally realize and accept that they are hopelessly lost in the woods running out of food and turning on each other i could feel my heart rate increase voices raised they argue and bicker and blame each other for their plight and i was much more annoyed that they wouldnt calm the fuck down than i was scared at the prospect of them being gutted by a ghost i guess its a marker of my adulthood that conflict was more upsetting to me than the specter of a serial killing ghost but in the end the inevitable death of the three students did not scare me it frustrated me with no visible villains other than their own terror i was annoyed they hadnt managed to get it together and save themselves never go into the creepy house but it must be said that the blair witch was set in 1999 maybe that trope hadnt entered the canon yet ツ 
Sep 3 2020,negative, overrated    yes im truly tempted to end my review there but out of respect for those who actually read my reviews i suppose i should offer at least a semblance of an explanation for why i consider 1999s the blair witch project the lowbudget wonder film from daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez which was originally budgeted at 35000 and ended up grossing over 140 million in the us alone sparking a series of spoofs and one pathetic sequel    i was looking forward to seeing the blair witch project id heard enough about its uniqueness and ive always admired the lowbudget independent filmmaker so i thoughtwow a perfect combination this will be great    then i immediately became distracted by glaring technical mistakes sure well there was only a 35000 budgetwell below way way way below the budget for many small independent films i could forgive a few technical mistakes its hard to reshoot mistakes when you simply dont have the budget to do so   then however i began to notice myself yawning hmmm a suspenseful horror type film and im yawningim noticeably bored and cringing at the screams of one of the leads heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams didnt help matters and ultimately i found myself feeling restless and waiting for that moment of suspensethat glimpse into the horror id been promised    it never happened    the blair witch project is not a horrible film ive seen many worse horror films over the years and the vast majority have been worse than this one it isnt so much that i find blair witch a bad filmits that i find it so remarkably bland and lifeless when everything id read from boxoffice reports to reviews to audience response offered me fear and anxiety and horror i felt none of these things while watching the film    truthfully i found myself much more entertained by the spoof the bare wench project a sexy silly romp that made me laugh and made me smile this film offered laughs only when the horror was truly disappointing and never actually made me smile   the blair witch project is more than anything a testimony to the power of marketing a film the filmmakers took a random festival type approach to marketing the film including a massive internet onslaught that put the film directly into the faces of the young adult crowd it was targeting    the end result became historys most successful independent film and continues to set the benchmark for independent films in terms of boxoffice and marketing im sure youve experienced the same feeling i have herethose moments when you look up at a screen or you read the weekend boxoffice receipts and you find yourself completely floored that a film has defied expectations and become a hit almost despite itself the blair witch project can lay claim to being the most successful independent film in terms of boxoffice percentages when you think about it and all the incredible indie films available isnt that just kind of sad 
May 24 2020,positive,the most remarkable thing about donahues work in this movie is that she is rarely seen on camera she brings depth and emotional nuance to heathers character through just her voicework and breathing
Feb 26 2020,positive,sanchez and myrick are also smart enough not to undercut the potency of their tale by attempting to explain the unexplainable they leave us with a mystery capable of haunting our dreams
Oct 14 2019,positive,one of its great strengths is that it breaks the teenage bloodbath formula there is not a jason or a freddy to be found instead blair witch is a thinking persons horror movie that exploits the imaginations power to terrify
Aug 7 2019,positive, with the second installment second because lets just forget about that horrid book of bleh of the blair witch project coming out in a few weeks aptly titled blair witch i thought it would be appropriate to review the original  i first watched the movie when i was at the oldest 7 or 8 in my cousins basement at that point the virality of the movie had just calmed down but it was still widely known as one of the most horrifying movies of all time this is proven by the fact that i nearly broke down crying when the main menu came up the second time i watched it i was in high school and still nearly broke down crying or did however now that im at a point in my life that i am confident in my abilities a fan and studier of cinema i am seeing the blair witch project as a landmark cinematic experience while i think a lot of the early acclaim was because of the viral marketing and debate behind its authenticity looking at it through the lens of a film proves that it is a modern classic if you somehow have been lost in the woods in maryland for two decades the blair witch project tells the story three amateur filmmakers  josh heather and mike  who embark into burkittsville maryland to create a documentary on the legend of the blair witch much of what we learn about the legend and experiences of the town folk are through interviews with actual citizens of townspeople who recount the terrifying tale of a witch that lurks in the woods as the documentary unfolds one thing is strikingly clear the filmmaking style and performance still feel so real that i found myself at some points still being tricked into thinking this was actual found footage of course this lends itself to the way it was filmed but you have to appreciate the vision that the directors had to have had before beginning production and incredible talent that these actors possess for improvisation now heres the thing there are very few movies that i have become emotional during however there are parts of this movie that i became physically unnerved for the characters and frankly saddened for them at some point the movie because less about the witch and more about the fragility of the human psyche what are you thinking who do you blame the scenario unfolds with so much real and raw emotion that it feels claustrophobic you feel trapped in the forest with them while the concept may feel outdated or overdone you have to remember that this is the first time a movie like this ever existed yes mockumentaries predated the blair witch project but no movie has come close to even committing this type of immersive experience to film the viral marketing and cultural phenomenon aside the movie still holds up as a masterclass in tension atmosphere and horror while the style has been copied countless times from degrees of success  the first paranormal activity cloverfield chronicle  to questionable  the chernobyl diaries all the other paranormal activity movies  it has never been replicated and probably never will be the blair witch project isnt going to hold up as well for everyone weve come to the point in horror that our senses need to be assaulted for us to feel anything turn off all the lights close the blinds turn off your phone and tell me that the experience of watching it isnt terrifying i dare you hey im karl founder and film critic at smash cut i started smash cut in 2014 to share my love of movies and give a perspective i havent yet seen represented im also an editor at the new york times a rotten tomatoesapproved critic and a member of the online film critics society
Mar 26 2019,positive,a revelation in storytelling cinematography and marketing
Nov 18 2018,negative,your friends lied to you when they said you needed to watch this film once before you die considered a horror classic but this found footage movie has been severely overhyped
Nov 10 2018,positive,there was a considerable number of people who went to go see the blair witch project believing it was a documentary thats how uncommercialized found footage was as a conceit and how elegantly crafted this movie is
Nov 10 2018,positive, review one of my few concessions to halloween is to ramp up my horror movie watching in the days before october 31st and the chance to watch one of the most fabled spookers of all time and originator of the found footage subgenre proved too good to pass up so with over 15 years perspective just how good is the blair witch project away from the sheer hype it generated on its release its become fashionable to scoff at the film in recent years but in my opinion it stands the test of time its found footage gimmick still hooks despite the conceit being flogged to death by subsequent copycat filmmakers and other less obvious elements conspire to make it a deceptively rich film first its a very ambitious and cineliterate work by directors eduardo sánchez and daniel myrick they understand the lure of legend and storytelling to the horror genre and they cleverly choose to wrap the film up in various russian doll layers theres the general blair witch myth then the documentary filmmakers shooting a pilot treatment about the cult of that story then theres what actually happens to the filmmakers as strange things start occurring in the woods before the final layer of reception  that were being told this is found footage so we know from the outset that the filmmakers didnt survive
Dec 13 2014,positive,the scariest shots from someones little hi8 camcorder document the students losing their bearings giving way to panic and finally falling victim though off screen to some ineffably unphotographably evil presence
Sep 29 2014,positive, cnn  is there really any reason to point it out these days when a film has been overhyped  or more precisely does overhype still exist  its become the movie industry standard to make sure that every man woman child and pet on the planet is salivating over each new release and 24hour informationspewers like cable tv and the internet will see to it from here on out that thatll never change even by todays bloated standards though daniel myrick and eduardo sanchezs sometimes blindingly frightful homemade horror movie the blair witch project is a special case  due to advance raves from the sundance film festival  and a welldesigned web site that adds considerably to the movies creepy mystique  blair witch garnered a sizable cult following far in advance of it actually opening from a premature raving standpoint its eyes wide shut minus the huge budget big stars fancy lighting elegant camera work and stanley kubrick  audiences and a great many critics will be jumping up and down about the whole thing even though it only contains about 30 minutes of honestly laudable footage  they are however a superb absolutely terrifying 30 minutes this is a mock documentary to some degree but its raw handheld look doesnt allow even that much formality  the premise is that on october 21 1994 three student filmmakers well played by heather donahue joshua leonard and michael c williams headed off to the hills of maryland to make a documentary about the possibly imaginary blair witch who may or may not have been responsible for a handful of grisly deaths over the years unfortunately the filmmakers never came back  a year later their footage was somehow discovered and what were looking at is the unnerving altogether mystifying evidence of what happened to them nearly all of the blair witch project is improvised  myrick and sanchezs truly inspired approach to the film was to let their cast wander the woods for several days with a tape recorder 16millimeter camera and home video camera in tow documenting the distant noises and disturbing warning signs that their directors were leaving for them in the cover of darkness then hours of evidently rambling footage was edited down to one little movie thats designed to slowly build on you like a nervous breakdown  peppered throughout are supremely disquieting set pieces that sometimes literally shout what the hell is that before we get to the good stuff though we have to deal with the movies huge nearly crippling problem  it pains me to do so because the successful sequences are so resoundingly successful  however it must be noted that if you havent had a couple cups of coffee before sinking down in your seat you may find yourself unexpectedly watching the blair insomnia project  the level of repetition when the students lose their way is disconcerting for a while just as the directors intended it to be  but any semblance of drive is soon dumped in favor of a meandering realism thats normally cut out of other films for very good reasons myrick and sanchez are obviously struggling so hard to stretch this baby out to even 82 minutes you find yourself rooting for the witch after a while  you cant really say that theres character development in the conventional sense but you do get to see the closeknit group disintegrating before your eyes  in real time  to a large degree the movie is about the horror of group dynamics donahues character is the director of the documentary and she endlessly badgers her slacker companions to get this shot get that shot cross the stream keep the camera rolling etc  shes like the straighta student bossing everyone around behind the counter at mcdonalds she turns out to be the one whos most responsible for their predicament her mapreading skills leave a lot to be desired and when her friends finally lose it and try to belt her in the side of the head you cant help but feel a secret thrill  its just that it takes them so long to get to that point youll probably want to belt the projectionist first  it really becomes trying after about 40 minutes and youve got a long way to go from there but lets talk about the soontobelegendary scares  whenever night falls the movie takes off but in a slow creep with all your childhood fears of the dark suddenly revealing themselves as absolutely reasonable since the weakregistering video camera is the main source of recording the events many of the most frightening sequences play themselves out on a virtually black screen  its bad enough when the students climb into their tent for the night and start hearing strange unexplained popping sounds surrounding them in the distance but the moment when a crying baby echoes through the darkness is wildly terrifying and donahues piercing almost animallike screams as the trio runs through the woods not knowing who or what theyre running from or where to go next will stick with you forever  honest to god i just got goose bumps thinking about it not to give anything away the movie is so vague about whats happening thats almost impossible but the final sequence is the stuff of sheer unadulterated nightmares  the images themselves with the video cameras light dimly sweeping across things that youre certain you dont want to see are hellish  it really looks like the moment when you force yourself to wake up not wanting to proceed a step further into the ravings of your sleeping imagination  it takes a long time getting there but the films payoff is all the more powerful for being a lonely dull thud  its just you and your worst fears battling to the death the blair witch project is scary because it doesnt really show you anything  a lesson that other horror directors would be wellserved to learn  theres only a brief moment when you see blood but it registers like a howitzer for the most part the soundtrack is what does it to you  if you like to camp out but still get a little creeped by unexplained noises do not see this movie  theres also a ton of f words which is understandable given the characters predicament  rated r  82 padded minutes
Sep 29 2014,positive,the very crudeness of the film stock and technique contribute mightily to the feeling that things are out of control disoriented and possibly subject to unnatural laws
Sep 29 2014,positive,  what we see couldnt be much simpler exposition is dispensed with through some talkinghead interviews with townies in the nearby village of burkittsville through which we learn of the belief that the forest is haunted by a witch from the 1700s and that it has been the site of child murders and other grisly business ever since undaunted the trio heads blithely off into the woods on their camping tripmovie shoot  they find and film little piles of rocks on the ground and paganlooking human effigies hanging from the trees they hear creepy sounds outside the tent at night by the third day the guys are on the verge of panic but the woman whos the director of the project remains chipper and breezily unconcerned even after it finally becomes clear that theyre lost in the woods from there the excursion quickly grows less and less agreeable  the cowardly lion had the right idea entering a haunted forest in search of a witch the noble beast kept repeating i do believe in spooks i do believe in spooks i do i do i do he seemed to instinctively understand that at least in the movies believing in the supernatural is the best defense against its nasty surprises spooks tend to get offended when you dont believe in them especially when youre on their turf  its very difficult to get lost in america heather assures her companions trying to buck them up this misconception  that the country has been tamed that theres sure to be a 7eleven or a mcdonalds just over the next ridge  gets quite a workout in the blair witch project the subtext is how much modern rationalism has to do with the sense of security that we get from social and technological comforts and how quickly rationalism can desert us when theyre taken away  the surprise is that within its narrow presentational conceit the film manages some real emotional depth and subtlety and some pretty trenchant observations on the humbling power of nature and maybe of supernature the director continues much to the fury of her colleagues to obsessively videotape their adventure in spite of the dire situation theyre in but when one of the guys picks up the camera and shoots a few scenes he says i see why you like this camera so much  because its not quite reality  later they berate her because even at their most desperate shes still makin movies its all i have left she blurts out whether this was scripted or just an inspired ad lib its this idea that makes the blair witch project credible  the footage is shot because the characters cling to their cameras like technological security blankets  the blair witch project manifests very little of its effect through visual ghastliness almost all of the terror is achieved through sound through the dreadsoaked atmosphere of the october woods  which except for a dead mouse seem to be free of animals and birds  and through the utterly convincing reactions of the actors as such the film is a reproach to the notion that in this era of gore its no longer possible to scare an audience with suspense and suggestion  the two most noted horror pictures of the decade so far scream and its superior sequel scream 2 were both entertaining enough but when a genre reaches the point where its alternating routine slasher shocks with jaded jokes about the hokiness of the form to which its adhering that genre is crying out to be reinvented  myrick and sanchez heard the cry like george romero and tobe hooper they simply took their cameras into the woods and unaided by prosthetic effects or campy injokes figured out a new way to scare the bejesus out of us their technique is one that has rarely been attempted in the horror field naturalistic verisimilitude its clear that the actors who shot the film themselves while improvising the dialogue along a scenario preplanned by the directors were immersed in the situation to the point that their terrified reactions cant even properly be called acting  the result of this method is so believable that the audience is put in something like the same position  its only by context that we know we arent looking at real document nothing about the blair witch project allows us to say its only a movie apart from our knowledge that its only a movie  and some audience members may even be unwilling to credit this knowledge it wouldnt surprise me at all if the blair witch project became the subject of its own urban legend leaving the theater after the screening i attended i heard a young man ask the publicist so is this real one of his companions pointed out no didnt you see it had that all characters and events are fictitious thing in the credits  yeah he said but dont they have to put that on for legal reasons  i loved this gullible viewers yearning to believe in the veracity of what he had just seen terrifying though it was  his yearning for something beyond rationalism to believe in for a less mundane more magical world for an american forest in which its still possible to get cosmically lost the cowardly lion had the right idea and so did this guy   they find and film little piles of rocks on the ground and paganlooking human effigies hanging from the trees they hear

Oct 5 2013,positive, movie review xxx the blair witch project with heather donahue michael williams joshua leonard bob griffith jim king directed and written by daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez 87 minutes neptune r  restricted because of language well yes but its an awfully ingenious fake a documentary that doubles as a horror film as three young filmmakers head off to marylands black hills forest to investigate a local legend about a demonic apparition were told at the outset that they disappeared in 1994 leaving only this haunting footage of their experiences daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez the codirectors of this elaborate hoax took the audience by surprise at the sundance film festival last january when many reportedly bought the premise and swallowed the story whole even at seattle test screenings a few weeks ago audiences were still spooked but myrick and sanchez may have outwitted themselves by creating such a welloiled promotional machine that the movies big secret can no longer be kept earlier this week they probably compounded their problems by presenting an hourlong television special curse of the blair witch that also presented this whopper with a straight face it may have been too much the result is a mind game made by skilled hands wrote laura fries in variety sanchez and company have broken the rules with this tv special and with their movie but to give away too much would spoil the fun some of the fun may already be spoiled as that heckler demonstrated theres evidently a blair witch backlash movement that sees the picture as little more than selfinduced hysteria in a sense theyre right but isnt that what all horror movies are as a piece of filmmaking the blair witch project deserves respect using the most modest means sanchez and myrick manage to tell a compelling story create recognizable characters and hold our attention even when theres literally nothing on the screen parts of the picture resemble a radio play thats designed to raise goose pimples effective as the handheld camera work often is its the soundtrack and the conviction of the actors that truly distinguishes this film we cant help wondering along with the doomed filmmakers huddled inside their tent whos out there apparently stalking them heather donahue makes the strongest impression as the documentarys takecharge director who keeps shooting footage even when her sound man michael williams and her cameraman joshua leonard think they have other priorities utterly lost in the woods they scream insults at each other blame each other for their predicament and begin to feel that theyre really in danger at first the arguments are petty and amusing one debate involves memories of gilligans island but then their fears appear to be confirmed by sightings of peculiar twig formations and organized rock piles and by sinister noises in the night it all ends badly though not quite in the way youd expect the final images are so chaotic and inexplicable that you find yourself trying to piece together the end of the story as you would if you really did find such footage this is calculated manipulative lowbudget filmmaking at its most creative
Oct 9 2012,positive,this terrifying ghost story is guaranteed to haunt filmgoers long after theyve persuaded themselves that its only a movie
Oct 9 2012,positive, the horror the  horror its everywhere this summer look at the fear on the face of gorgeous catherine zetajones in the haunting a 75 million scarefest from twister director jan de bont in which zetajones lesbian designs on lili taylor pale next to the hideous designs that a haunted new england mansion has on both of them or check out the deep blue sea with cliffhanger director

the practice seasons the gore with giggles in lake placid featuring bridget fonda and a scenestealing brendan gleeson out to stop a huge crocodile from bloodying a lake in maine its a lakefront anaconda in which jon voight became the first oscar winner to be swallowed by a jumbo snake thats right lake placid is the usual cheese passing for quality in a genre that has long since replaced inspiration with digital monsters costly effects and fresh ways to splatter blood help is on the way i have seen the new face of movie horror and its name is the blair witch project a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium better yet it does the job without guns or a glimpse of a naked screaming coed and with a budget 75000 that couldnt buy george lucas a proper car its what you dont see in the blair witch project that pumps your adrenalin and in the best hitchcock tradition keeps you hanging on in october of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary a year later their footage was found its that edited footage of their five days in the woods that we watch for the next eightyseven minutes of sweaty palms and rabid anticipation heather donahue carrying a high 8 color video camcorder and a list of questions is the leader of the crew which includes soundman michael williams and camera operator joshua leonard who shoots on 16 mm blackandwhite film the trio hikes into marylands black hills forest a twohour drive in joshs car from washington dc the purpose is to investigate a local legend begun in 1785 about an alleged witch named elly kedward who was banished from the area then called blair for luring children into her home to draw their blood a year later the towns children mysteriously vanished and the blair witch cult grew over time others are reported missing and in 1886 disemboweled bodies are found at coffin rock along with oily bundles of sticks heather interviews mary brown a disoriented resident of the area who claims to have seen the witch a hairy blend of human and beast near tappy creek when two fishermen claim that the area can be reached by an old logging trail heather joshua and michael begin their journey into the heart of darkness things start well enough until heather gets the crew lost and the guys curse her out for having them walking in circles in their tents they start hearing strange sounds outside like twigs being stepped on at daylight they discover bundles of sticks and a burial ground the cameras which cant capture the thing or things that go bump in the night produce increasingly shaky images that reflect the nerves of the crew no fair to reveal more or to reflect on the ambiguous ending which will have you arguing for days tension mounts as heather joshua and michael lose their psychological bearings rage at each other and tempt fate in a deserted cabin that fully defines heathers fear when she says im scared to close my eyes and im scared to open them stop reading now if you dont want to know the tricks that make the blair witch project such a terror treat or maybe youve already surmised that the movie is a devilishly clever scam for starters the story isnt true it was dreamed up by eduardo sanchez 30 and daniel myrick 35  friends from the university of central florida film school  who also directed and edited the movie along with three other ucf alumni  producers gregg hale and robin cowie and coproducer michael monello  they hired three unknown actors who were skilled at improvisation thats because the actors were sent into the maryland woods with only the barest bones of a story and asked to make up the dialogue as they went along sanchez and myrick also taught them how to operate the camera and sound equipment that handheld homemovie feel is for real so are the rattled looks on the actors faces the directors took their cue from producer hales army training and shot the film like a military exercise there was little contact with the actors who were deprived of sleep and sometimes food rations in the name of authenticity its doubtful even titanic dictator james cameron would torture actors to that extent still theres no doubting the payoff sanchez and myrick have made a sly virtue of limited resources and made a film that will creep you out of your skin who says imagination isnt rewarded in hollywood the filmmakers sold their chickenfeedfinanced debut feature to artisan entertainment for a waycool 15 million won raves at film festivals from sundance to cannes and spawned a mini blair witch industry that includes a novelization a comic book a soundtrack cd a scifi channel special and  yikes  a web site blairwitchcom and guess what the movie is so good that you dont for a second hate them for it
Oct 9 2012,positive,a cunningly conceived and crafted exercise in suggestibility and terror
Oct 8 2012,positive,this hyperrealistic mockumentary will scare you witless  without grossing you out one of those rare films with the power to haunt long after the final frame
Jun 18 2012,positive, titles inform us that the footage we are about to see was shot by three student filmmakers who went into the woods surrounding the town of burkittsville maryland and were never heard from again the footage was discovered by a search party a year later burkittsville 1994 heather a director josh a cameraman and mike a soundman head for the woods to investigate the local legend of the blair witch a spirit blamed for various disappearances and the murders of several children many years before after stocking up on provisions for a threeday trip and interviewing locals for their stories about the blair witch the three set out things immediately start to unravel the map heather relies on leads the three in circles and her insistence on filming everything including the trios arguments exacerbates the tension soon theyre awoken in the middle of the night by the sounds of children screaming strange piles of rocks and stick figures made out of branches are left outside their tent  shortly after josh finds his belongings strewn over their campsite he disappears a few days later heather finds a bundle made of torn strips of joshs shirt with an unidentified piece of bloody viscera inside with food and hope gone heather and mike stumble on a house in the woods glee is understandable when a smallbudget 25000 independent film not only rivals hollywoods summer blockbusters at the box office the blair witch project has taken more than 100 million and counting but also captures the publics imagination in a way no hollywood release of the season has managed theres some poetic justice in the idea that a film made by unknowns and shot on video with no stars and no special effects could trounce its prepackaged competition the ways entertainment reporting has elevated the business side of movies over discussion of their quality have resulted in moviegoers who are cynically knowing about deals and grosses but conditioned to accept the junk shovelled at them so its not surprising that audiences respond to the zerostyle of blair witch with special effects announcing nothing so much as their own price tag this pictures flat replication of reality achieved using handheld video and its ability to scare audiences witless with nothing more than shots of rocks and twigs are genuinely jolting because the film is so deliberately lacking in art in much the same way night of the living dead 1968 was you can be lulled into thinking what youre seeing is actually happening but as the megalomaniacal director played by peter otoole in the stunt man 1979 asked how tall is king kong dont myrick and sanchez know that movies are fake apart from the sadism of keeping your nonunion cast hungry cold and terrified for a week theres the question of why you hire actors if you dont trust them to act certainly the unmediated hysteria we see the actors sliding into is part of what makes the film so terrifying its also what makes it so unpleasant the method makes nonsense of the implied criticism of heathers inability to put down her camera and deal with the reality in front of her how can you take that criticism seriously from a film designed to eke every ounce of real misery and terror from its cast myrick and sanchezs method may be the opposite of hollywoods but by banishing psychology characterisation and finally humanity from their film by excluding anything but sensation the effect is ultimately not that much different from that of say armageddon the most persistent blair witch myth is that the film eschewed the usual methods of marketing in fact no film in recent memory has been as shrewdly presold as this one the buzz it generated at the sundance film festival earlier this year was sustained via a website an hourlong documentary on the history of the blair witch shown on us primetime television three nights before the film opened and prerelease displays of artefacts in the lobbies of theatres currently you can purchase a blair witch comic a film companion book tshirts and a soundtrack now comes word that a sequel is on the way the most amusing thing about hollywoods hottest new directors is that they havent actually directed anything the producer who takes credit while doing no work has long been a staple of hollywood satire myrick and sanchez have gone that stock figure one better as they told one interviewer sitting in a burger joint laughing about the actors  hungry cold and scared in the woods  who shot the movie myrick and sanchez have taken credit for somewhere p t barnum is smiling 
Oct 17 2011,positive,sanchez and myricks film knows that whats not seen frightens more easily that what is and that the imaginations thoughts of what might have happened generally horrify on a deeper level than knowing what did
Dec 28 2010,positive,this one could be too scary even for your teen
Oct 26 2010,negative,a brilliant marketing campaign to be sure but this zgrade con of a film offers no payoff for audiences looking to be scared
Apr 29 2009,positive,its a gem
Oct 18 2008,positive,a creepy tale of witchcraft murders and ghost sightings
Oct 18 2008,positive, one of the most difficult genres to do and do well is horror for years slasher films have dominated the landscape and outside of the originals friday the 13th and a nightmare on elm street they havent been very good then came scream which redefined horror by spoofing it but never really succeeded at capturing the true nature of horror by tapping into the human emotion of fear now we have a new brand of horror to admire the horror we do not see no underscore no gore just plain fear of the unknown three film students decide to make a documentary about a legend called the blair witch their journey begins innocently enough they interview several townsfolk at their destination about what theyve heard on the subject one mother holding a child explains what she knows while her child occasionally covers her mouth so that perhaps she cant speak of the witch the mother honestly believes it but refuses to admit that it could be real to her child another of their interviewees is a strange woman who bears the stereotypical witch look they also speak with some fishermen on their way out to their shooting location one fisherman thinks the legend is real while the other thinks its not they eventually start hiking to the forest to reach their first shoot and take several hours to get there they film what they can and then set up camp for the night they proceed from there on the second day get even more footage and camp one more time that night they hear noises in the forest they get out their equipment and capture what they can but cant figure out where its coming from the next day its time for them to go home but heather heather donahue decides she wants to investigate a little further and ends up angering her cohorts when they come across a sanctuary of sticks bundled into human shapes dangling from various trees heather wants to capture as much as she can but neither josh joshua leonard nor mike michael c williams have any further interest in the subject theyre ready to go and want to get out as soon as possible they finally talk heather into going but cant seem to find their car they camp one more night and are again awoken by things that go screech in the night the next day they try again but to no avail and when they try to check the map they find it is missing among the frightening things they find are piles of rocks similar to ones they had found earlier in a somewhat ritualistic area they only fear the worst which heightens their paranoia by the time the film reaches its disturbing climax we are no more certain of whats making all the noise or causing all the problems than the characters themselves are filmed in both blackandwhite on 16mm and in color on camcorder the blair witch project is rumored to have cost only 50000 there are times when it feels painfully real and others where it feels a little slow while its realism is a strong point there are many times when certain shots or setups feel faked the most impressive part of the film is when they are using both the 16mm and camcorder cutting back and forth without the dat since 16mm cannot be shot with sound we are forced to listen to whats going on through the camcorder which becomes apparent when the two are separate and they switch between each one time in particular you are watching heather running the 16mm while hearing her voice in the distance on the camcorder the images are quite jarring and may cause some with motion sickness to feel ill but are all part of the bigger experience the performances are as close to perfect as have been seen so far this year and the film itself is well edited and written blair witch is proof that you dont need expensive visual effects extravagant plots dozens of characters or buckets of blood to make an excellent horror film not to be missed if you like horror films but seeing it you have to realize that its not armageddon its not scream and its not saving private ryan its an inexpensive film that leaves you terrified with little more than darkness sound effects and your own imagination
Aug 4 2008,positive,blair witch should go down in history as proof that it doesnt take a big budget to make a great movie in fact it may not even take a budget at all
Jan 15 2008,positive,this is a highly original and wellmade film which is one of the best of the year and a welcome change from the recent slasher genre which most horror films seem to be classified as these days
Sep 24 2007,positive,it is a horror film that shows nothing  no blood no violence  explains nothing and seems to mean nothing but scares you and keeps scaring you long after it is over
Sep 24 2007,positive,heathers shaky video work can induce motion sickness  it looks like combat footage as she bolts through the woods  but just try turning away
Sep 24 2007,positive,  the blair witch project demonstrates that theres nothing scarier than nothing the movie has no ghosts or witches on display and its lone bit of gore is a piece of cloth containing a mottle of indeterminate organic material it has no surprises either since you know going in that the ending wont be happy the movie opens with a placard declaring that three film students went into the woods near burkittsville maryland to make a documentary and were never heard from again and that their footage was discovered a year after their disappearance the placard doesnt mention who edited the footagethe ghost of hitchcock cassavetesbut thats a minor point i could tell you the storygive away every detailand the blair witch project would still freeze your blood working on a budget thats chump change and a script thats little more than a framework for actors improvisations directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez have harnessed the most irrational fears of every human alive they have reanimated the genre not by adding to it but subtracting from itby cooking it down to its bare bones and then rattling those bones like fiends the first thing theyve done is remove the omniscient point of view with the important exception of that opening title card there is no larger perspective the film studentsa woman heather donahue and two men michael williams and joshua leonard the characters bear the actors namestote their own video and movie cameras so that we see what they see and no more actually we see even less since we lack their peripheral vision and are cruelly limited to whatever passes through their lenses thanks to firstrate sound equipment though we hear everything they hearespecially a snapping of branches in the dark outside their tent that escalates into an omnidirectional clatter when they yell into the darkness hello the darkness remains dark a light illuminates the foreground but the blackness beyond that pool seems if anything blacker there might be no more irrationally terrifying shot in the annals of film than the one in which the camera hurtles behind heathera hazy white streak in the center of the screenamid crackling sounds as she throws a look into the trees and shrieks what is that what the fuck is that we never see what the fuck that is if we did some part of us would probably relax because it would look like a special effect but no part of us is allowed to relax ever  i s the blair witch project a work of art not by my definition art rarely tortures you so singlemindedly after the first halfhour in which the students interview burkittsville residents about the history of the blair witch one elly kedward found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter the remainder of the movie is their increasingly desperate odyssey through the woods they trudge one way double back pore over maps and compasses whine trudge some more come upon mysterious piles of rocks or bundled twigs and whine even louder the action unfolds in a season halfway between autumn and winter and the washedout tones suggest that the blair witch took the forests colors with her when she died the grueling monotony is broken only at night when the students go into their tents and the sounds come again and the very celluloid seems to shiver with cold and fear the camera twitches incessantly the lone stationary shot is when heather sobs an apology to her parents for having dreamed up the project and the way shes framed and halflighted she looks like lon chaneys phantom of the opera with nostril hair i dont apply the adjective visceral casually the shaky camera summons up our fightorflight responses leaving the screening my wife was convinced she had food poisoning from an earlier meal when we stopped and analyzed her symptoms we realized that she had motion sickness the movie had literally made her sick the power of that cant be slighted however i love horror pictures and am a tough scare but i started having nightmares about the blair witch project before i even saw itsolely on the basis of its preview i slept even less after i did see it when i caught an interview with the superbly nervy heather donahue on television the first thing i thought was thank god shes alive then she said this movie must be working because people come up to me all the time and say thank god youre alive  the other day an envelope arrived at my door with a bunch of sticks lashed together in the familiar form of the blair witch talisman i rushed to the phone and called the movies publicists to make sure this was a promotional gimmick when they said yes i started breathing again otherwise i might have called the policeor an exorcist  w hat is it about the blair witch project that taps into such primal emotions consider its antithesis the remake of the haunting has the bad fortune to open in the same month and what might have been dismissed as just a lame overstuffed bigstudio scare picture will now be held up as a counterexample robert wises 1963 original based on shirley jacksons the haunting of hill house is overrated but it manages to evoke the eeriest aspect of jacksons fiction the way the characters neuroses acquire an inexorable life of their own and threaten to eat them alive nothing much happens in the empty mansion but when something doesfor instance a thunderous pounding on a pair of big doors as if all the characters accumulated nervous energies had been focused on one spotthe movies reticence pays off like gangbusters or ghostbusters in the new version directed by jan de bont speed 1994 twister 1996 that pounding comes early and serves as an overture for a bunch of computergenerated special effects ghosties that swirl around like tinkerbell statues that spring to life and grab people everything is exasperatingly often laughably overexplicit and once a dread becomes material a ghost story becomes a monster moviea different far less terrifying beast here are sound effects so hammy that they might have been borrowed from one of those old hauntedhouse party albums doors dont creak they crrrreeeaaakkk and then close with a reverberant kerchungggggg from the second liam neeson and his subjectscatherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilsonset foot in the farcically garish hill house its clear that something evil is watching them you can tell because something evil respires so loudly that hes either darth vader or an asthmatic by the time poor taylor stands up to the big bad ghost on behalf of a lot of little good ghosts people in the audience are holding onto their stomachs to keep from retching with laughter writing directing actingthis is one of the most maladroit ghost movies ever made but even if the script werent so tineared and the direction so clunky the haunting still wouldnt come within screaming distance of the blair witch project the reason is philosophical de bont a lavish materialist who thinks that movies can do anything if you throw enough money around wants to scare you by showing you stuff myrick and sanchez want to scare you by not showing you stuffand by reminding you how much you cant see and will never know with all those cameras onscreen theyve liberated horror from the realm of moviesfrom the realm of the lightand nestled it back into the dark where it was born
Sep 24 2007,negative,the viewer never glimpses anything more than the shadow of a clever movie
Sep 24 2007,positive,what gives the film much of its force and its mounting sense of queasy uncertainty is its narrative method which ensures that we know no more about the proceedings than the characters do
Jul 23 2007,neutral, if star wars episode i is the geek event of the summer the blair witch project is the hipster event  the movie you have to see not necessarily because you want to see it but because you want to be able to say youve seen it as a lifelong horror fan and one who so recently suffered through the haunting i was more than eager to subject myself to what has been described  okay hyped  as the scariest movie since halloween and the exorcist what i got instead was a neat premise and not an original one either one or two mildly creepy moments a final shot designed to send em out buzzing and a whole lot of bickering in between in october of 1994 reads the ad copy three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near burkittsville maryland while shooting a documentary a year later their footage was found the movie we are watching purports to be that footage though i trust that by now everyone knows that it is actually a work of fiction  the work of three improvising actors entrusted with camera equipment in the woods under the remote supervision of two directors who figured out a plausible context in which to make a featurelength film on video and 16mm a great deal of thought went into the blair witch project and whats most disappointing is how little of it shows up in the film itself as the threeperson documentary crew  director heather heather donahue cameraman josh joshua leonard and sound man mike michael williams  stumble around the bleak maryland woods a sense of strangeness and dread gathers in the repetitive shots of the ugly leaves and tangled branches which look the same from scene to scene adding to the characters disorientation they are pursuing a supernatural legend in a dead forest that looks as if it would prefer to stay dead blair witch has a terrific grainy ambiance but thats about all it has  its all suggestion and no payoff like a softcore porn video  and when the characters are lost and shrieking at each other ones patience begins to wear thin an improv movie like this lives or dies on the strength of the performances and each of the actors here has some good moments  generally when theyre quiet heather donahue for example has been encouraged to play heather as a shrill bitch a lot of the time so when shes scared shitless into guilty silence  she knows shes largely responsible for getting the crew lost  shes much more effective than when shes shrieking in terror or rage but sometimes you miss the structure that a fully scripted horror movie can offer and the actors often arent up to creating their own dialogue on the fly when the map goes missing josh delivers this statement heather this is so not cool heather this is so not cool her response i know its not cool and the performers really run fuck into the ground i realize that frightened exhausted people may revert to repetitive fourletter vocabulary but after a while it seems like a failure of imagination on the actors part conversely the most famous scene  heathers anguished apology into her camera  sounds totally prescripted and inauthentic and its framed a little too artfully as if heather knew her terrorstricken halfvisage would become the movies marketing icon the filmmakers go for realism whenever possible the characters for instance are realistically irritating at times which may be a mistake blair witch rides bumpily on its premise that what were watching is real yet since we know its not all we can do is judge how well it has been faked we become connoisseurs not emotionally involved in the characters plight the movie feels like an improvisatory exercise not a pure shot of ungovernable horror and its chills amount to the usual spooky omens ooh a bunch of sticks and odd rustlings in the dead of night it feels like the work of clever people dabbling in horror  a calling card a riff a watercooler topic for a few weeks after its release horror movies may be so cluttered and ironic now that some people may take this films minimalist backtobasics method as a form of integrity which in a way it is but the end result isnt very satisfying most of the movie in fact deals with mundane fears like getting lost in the woods the filmmakers devote more time to arguments over who lost the map than to supernatural terror and much of it is far too highpitched as if foulmouthed hysteria would be enough to frighten us some have said that if we didnt know blair witch was fake it really would be as terrifying as many critics are claiming but who ever thought halloween or night of the living dead were really happening those movies scared us because well they were scary not because they were cleverly faked to seem real blair witch is a labored gimmick with too much realism and too little inventiveness in an early scene in 1981s an american werewolf in london now theres a great horror movie two college students are lost on the foggy moors surrounded by bloodfreezing growling noises one of them clenches his teeth and says quietly ah shit david what is that that brief understated scene does everything that this movie tries and mostly fails to do in 86 minutes the blair witch project may bother those who are easily freaked out and it may dissuade a few campers but the lofty talk in the press of its being a new horror masterpiece is nonsense thats a burden of hype this scrawny cinemaverité stunt cant carry
Jul 14 2007,positive,the three actors manage not only to capture some beautiful footage but also to spout believable and consistent dialog without digressing into the standard scream pop culture references
Apr 27 2007,negative, pike in a long time incidentally when did scary become the highest commercial accolade a movie could receive not that the blair witch project struck me as particularly scary even by infantile standards where is the suspense where is the involvement where is the identification we know from a printed foreword that the three young filmmakers are doomed and by the time i got to know them a little i didnt much care what happened to them  in accordance with the coy nomenclature of this fauxfound footage the actors and the characters have the same first names thus heather donahue plays and is heather the domineering young woman director of the trio michael williams and joshua leonard play mike and josh heathers goofily surly helpmates i didnt catch what exactly the two guys did in the way of technical functions but they never seemed too impressed with heathers capabilities which makes one wonder why they trusted her to lead them into an unknown forest all three of them carrying backpacks so heavy and bulky that hannibal would have hesitated loading them on his elephants when he was crossing the alps toward rome  go back i kept saying to myself go back but heather the bitch was in no mood to listen she thought she knew everything you could tell from the early oncamera interviews she arranges with a variety of local yokels her broadly supercilious tone makes it clear that she considers herself superior to everyone around her and that includes mike and josh whom she treats as her slowwitted slaves  heathers unsympathetic smugness from the outset strangely is what has made the movie such a big hit with audiences and critics im willing to bet anything that if the movie had been simply about three guys lost in the woods it wouldnt have gone anywhere critically or commercially the antifeministbacklash spectacle of a pushy female leading two comparatively inoffensive males to be slaughtered by persons unknown and unseen gives the audience a readymade scapegoat for the disaster i was struck also by the complete absence of any erotic tension or fraternal friendliness between the guys and the girl even before the three fools are frightened out of their wits by strange wooden markers and burial mounds of carefully arranged stones  all the while i kept wondering why they started out on this silly project in the first place indeed i was so detached from the mission that i began noticing things that didnt make sense in the context of the sheer terror of the experience why do they keep lugging around their backpacks long after it becomes clear that they should be running for their lives yet the filmmakers do deserve credit for a clever image in the last 10 seconds that at least works poetically but that is not nearly enough for all the lowbudget leaveittotheaudiencesimagination pretentiousness that precedes it i was reminded of nothing so much as the lowbudget catpeopleintotaldarkness shenanigans of producer kirk douglas and director barry sullivan in vincente minnellis the bad and the beautiful 1952 from a studiosavvy screenplay by charles schnee actually heathers camcorderrunamok antics makes her even more irritating to a viewer forced to look at seemingly endless dead footage of trees and shrubbery  i must confess that from the age of 5 i cannot remember ever wanting to be scared by a movie moved yes amused yes thrilled yes turned on yes but scared never these days i get my fill of fear and horror by reading the daily obituaries in the new york times  still there have been a few instances of my being vicariously scared despite my welldeveloped distancing defenses its only a movie andrew when i saw psycho 1960 on the first day of its theatrical release without any advance buzz or screenings the shower scene made me scream it confirmed for me my mother complex how could she go that far to complicate my already messedup sex life as a consequence psycho  for all its formal perfection as an insightful work of art has never come close to being my favorite hitchcock film ranking far below vertigo 1958 shadow of a doubt 1943 notorious 1946 and rear window 1954  after psycho  for me the only truly frightening premise for a horror film is to be found in wes cravens a nightmare on elm street 1984 why because dreams are among the few things we can never control in our lives and the idea that our dreams can invade our existence with homicidal impunity constitutes a waking nightmare  but the spectacle of three filmstudent types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid and since you never really get to know these lambs led to slaughter it is as if you were ghoulishly watching a horrible automobile accident from a safe vantage point there is more than a trace of banal horror movie trickery involved in getting the audience agitated by the hysterical screaming of a female character too full of guilt and shame over her fatal incompetence for us to identify in any way with her plight this is what i didnt like about the climax of henrigeorges clouzots les diaboliques 1955 with weakhearted vera clouzot screaming up a storm to cue and amplify the audience reaction  by now the inescapable triumph of evil and just plain nastiness has become commonplace in american movies young people particularly seem to be drawn to the most mindlessly nihilistic messages in movies i am not sure why and i have long ago stopped worrying about it as it is i find the blair witch project much less hateful than arlington road with its more expert projection of a satanically debilitating paranoia but i dont give the blair witch project extra points for being so cheaply made many of my esteemed colleagues have chosen to use this unexpected moneymaker as a club to beat the overpriced overgadgety overdigitalized and overhyped mainstream turkeys gobbling up the multiplexes emotional emptiness unfortunately is unacceptable in a movie whatever its budget  frank ozs bowfinger  from a screenplay by steve martin takes a stab at synergizing the talents of two of the funniest men in showbiz but the union of steve martin and eddie murphy does not so much multiply the mirth as fractionate it not because of any lack of chemistry between these two comic talents but because the idea of doing a parody of todays hollywood moviemaking is selfdefeating a more challenging trick would be to make a movie taking todays hollywood at all seriously  even so mr martins screenplay is surprisingly heavyhanded with the subject at hand i say surprisingly because mr martins previous collaborations with director oz little shop of horrors 1986 dirty rotten scoundrels 1988  housesitter 1992were subtler and sweeter comic

Jul 21 2005,positive, in a world that rewards film artifice for how tricky it can get  think the matrix or the phantom menace  the blair witch project is a breath of fresh air  presented as if showing real events the film is about three college students who enter deep woods in maryland to shoot a documentary about a creepy legend it seems a woman charged with witchcraft in 1785 was banished from the town of blair mysterious disappearances and horrific deaths have hit the area ever since the last time in 1941 like jonathan harker naively approaching castle dracula heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams the actors lend their real names explore the legend in october 1994 they venture forth with a 16 mm camera a camcorder camping equipment and a map they have trouble reading they are never heard from again the actors themselves shot all the footage  surely this is a first for movies  and some may balk at the deliberate crudeness of their visuals these mix blackandwhite film stock with color video most of it jumpy poorly focused and badly framed yet these arent affected shakycam shots overused in tv commercials rather the films stark homemovie feel serves a real purpose fueling its disturbing sense of youarethere reality you could quibble that they wouldnt have used their cameras so much we dont miss much but heather  the obsessive leader  has a compulsion to record things and in darkness the cameras provide illumination not just documentation as stephen king suggests in his latest novel the girl who loved tom gordon being lost in the wilderness is frightening enough most of the students tensions erupting arguments and emotional unraveling stem from that simple fact as convincing and potent as it can be on these terms be warned that the film is far removed from todays cinema standards for many blair witch will be a tough sell and the oversell its receiving does not serve it well this is one horror flick with no graphic special effects or socalled money shots one computergenerated extra in a george lucas picture would blow the entire budget for this movie but you cant put a price on imagination and originality besides some of the best fright fests of recent decades have been similarly cheap yet effective from night of the living dead in the 60s to the texas chainsaw massacre in the 70s to the evil dead in the 80s blair witchs harsh realism sets it apart and that realism owes less to convincing visuals than remarkably naturalistic performances from actors who improvised each line many movies try to transport us with dazzle but few have the convincing reality of blair witch if you can handle its unconventional approach you wont feel as if youre seeing a film so much as witnessing a living nightmare

Feb 8 2003,positive, the blair witch project rated r  running time 122  released 71699  the effectiveness of the blair witch project depends greatly on the  audiences uncertainty about whether or not it really happened the amateur  style and the pervasive reality of the situation imply that this was simply  a homemade documentary that went terribly wrong this notion is also fostered  by an ingenious device employed by writerdirectors daniel myrick and eduardo  sánchez some of the films shoestring budget i have heard anywhere  from 20 to 60 thousand was used for development of the internet website   which includes  a detailed history of the bogus legend dating back to the 1700s pictures  of found video and audio tape and film with links to let you  see and hear the footage as well as police photos of the car and other  gear supposedly discovered in 1995 there are news stories about the rescue  efforts and recovery lawsuits statements from the students parents etc  all this plus a quasidocumentary about the legend which aired on scifi  last weekend created the rumor that this story was all true myrick and  sánchez saw the incredible potential of the internet as a rumor mill  and used it to the best effect  three college students heather donahue the director joshua leonard  the cameraman and michael williams the sound engineer are said to  have been lost in 1994 while attempting to make a college film project involving  the legend of a witch who lived centuries ago in remote maryland at the  beginning of the film they are seen preparing for a camping weekend packing  joking interviewing locals from burkittsville md formerly blair and  setting off into the woods with a video camcorder a 16 millimeter movie  camera and a digital audio tape recorder after their planned documentary  seems a bust they lose their map lose their way and lose their patience  with each other what emerges is a shockingly realistic home movie of increasing  terror leading to the students mysterious demise  in a master stroke myrick and sánchez hired three actors to basically  play themselves in fact in the film they are not so much acting as living   using their real names and simply capturing on film and videotape  the unsettling situation in which they found themselves sacrificing production  quality for realism myrick and sánchez cut the three actors loose  in the forest in seneca creek state park md for 6 days and never contacted  them directly during that time each day the campers would be instructed  to hike to a spot where sealed messages were left for them giving minimal  hints as to what to expect or which way to go that day every night the  crew would find different ways to play with their heads but  they never knew what to expect and what we get is pure realism  their  raw unrehearsed reactions to the eerie sights and sounds they experienced  cutting back and forth between the video and 16mm film shot by the actors  the blair witch project conveys exactly what the rumors say it is   the rough footage taken by three lost students who finally disappeared  myrick and sánchez created something that will be remembered not  so much for its story or professional quality but for its novel approach  and the impact that resulted though there is no music no script and no  special effects this is the most gripping horror film i have ever seen  in addition to the genius of myrick and sánchez the films effectiveness  owes great debt to the performances of the actors especially heather donahue  the tone which grows gradually from lighthearted cynicism to fullblown  terror is dependent completely on the ability of these three actors not  to break character while the cameras were running donahues tearful final  scene shot after a week in the woods is some of the most real acting i  have ever seen

Jun 18 2002,positive,  the blair witch project thriller starring heather donahue michael c williams and joshua leonard directed and written by daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez r 87 minutes at the bridge and act oneact two in berkeley its also distinctly unpleasant the thrills in this oneofakind film which opens today after winning acclaim at the sundance and cannes film festivals arent the artificial kind we know from genre pieces such as halloween or nightmare on elm street  but the raw soulscraping horror of a nightmare codirected by daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez the blair witch project is a pseudo documentary about three student filmmakers who get lost in the maryland woods hoping to explore the 200yearold legend of the blair witch and the cult that surrounds it the film crew bickers gets lost and finally panics at the possibility of never getting out alive the movie pretends that the filmmakers  the overbearing director heather donahue laidback cameraman joshua leonard and prickly sound recordist michael c williams  each disappeared in the woods the footage in blair witch were told was discovered one year later thats a pretty cool concept for a film in fact the blair witch project is pure fiction and donahue leonard and williams using their real names are actors who are still alive but at least half of the appeal of the the blair witch proj ect comes from wondering how they and the filmmakers were able to create such amazing authenticity onscreen how did the actors none of whom came to the project with much film experience reach the primal offthechart emotional states that we see in the film is it just brilliantly good acting  the kind that john cassavetes drew from his actors  or did myrick and sanchez scare the living hell out of them in interviews and in press materials provided by the films distributor myrick and sanchez say they spent two days training the actors in the use of film and video cameras and set them loose in the forest with no script a modicum of food and only a rough set of situational guidelines whereas the tenderfoot characters they play are unable to read topographical maps  and find themselves desperately walking in circles  the actors in fact had global positioning system gsp handsets to find their way the dialogue were told was all improvised and the camera work was all done by the actors for better and for worse the blair witch project has the grainy handheld look of a home movie or student project funkiness of that sort works here because it heightens the realism  and replaces the filter of professionalism that typically insulates and protects us from true terror it also becomes excruciatingly unpleasant for anyone including this critic who gets sick from watching too many handheld camera swoops and jerky pans as with breaking the waves celebration and woody allens husbands and wives the blair witch project is certain to nauseate a portion of its audience as an experiment in technique and simulated realism blair witch is enormously successful myrick and sanchez pave new territory with their selfdescribed method filmmaking and their actors donahue in particular are incredi bly effective at yanking us into the desperate terror that their characters experience after a while though the blair witch project is neither fun nor exhilarating in that adrenalineinducing way were accustomed to from horror movies its just dreadful and draining and for some of us literally sickening
Apr 3 2002,positive,its an old and simple idea but in this era of effectsoverkill and total visual saturation it seems original even brilliant
Mar 24 2002,positive, the blair witch project written and directed by eduardo sanchez and daniel myrick with heather donahue michael williams and joshua leonard an artisan entertainment release at the kendall square and in the suburbs  probably the first time audiences were scared at a movie was at that legendary 1895 screening of the lumière brothers larrivée dun train en gare when viewers panicked at what they thought was a real locomotive hurtling at them their fright no doubt passed with the films second screening and certainly with the popularity of georges mélièss pioneering specialeffects fantasy a trip to the moon a few years later but that first naive thrill over an illusion remains an elusive goal for those who make and watch movies more than just the voyeuristic realism of tabloid tv shows like cops its about the desire to be drawn into a trompeloeil deception a vicarious immersion into primal firstperson terror such is the appeal of independent filmmakers eduardo sanchez and daniel myricks bold brilliant ultimately doomed the blair witch project a film concept so fresh and obvious anna campions loaded in 1994 had the same basic premise but a much different treatment its amazing no one has come up with it before no credits or title sequence frame what purports to be the ultimate found footage shot by of a trio of students who vanished while making a documentary film about the blair witch a 200yearold legendary apparition haunting the backwoods and the subconscious of the black woods of western maryland the gimmick is so ingenious though that it doesnt work as with cuttingedge specialeffects extravaganzas wonder is replaced by fascination as to how the illusion is crafted we know this isnt real so fright gives way to assessing how clever the filmmakers are at trying to sustain our disbelief very clever indeed at least to begin with the three young filmmakers make distinct impressions in their selfshot jumbled melange of preliminary footage heather heather donahue toughminded and overly earnest and the brains of the project operates the video camera for the behindthescenes or the making of footage hers is the dominant point of view and perhaps the unconscious shaper of what follows the other two crew members seem more like skeptical hired hands wispy josh joshua leonard who wields the 16mm blackandwhite camera and beefy mike michael williams the sound man have a slacker charm and insouciance they are clearly cowed by heather and the tension between them and their boss is not sexual or sexist but authoritarian bantering and lowkey though they are in their improvised dialogue the actors should get a writing and cinematography credit the three hint at a borderline hysteria that could ignite even without the manifestation of a blair witch the details of that legend as concocted by the filmmakers and related in pseudointerviews with locals have a creepy authenticity originally a woman banished from the community in the 18th century for unorthodox medical practices perceived as black magic the witch has since returned in various incarnations a pair of fisherman interviewees point out a rock where victims were found bound and eviscerated they tell of an old house in the woods where in the 1940s an old man confessed to killing children at the witchs bidding going in search of that house our three heroes lose their way the film does too there forms a pattern of nocturnal terrors followed by an daytime rationalization its the pattern of shirley jacksons the haunting of hill house though it may not be discernible in jan de bonts fxheavy upcoming adaptation the haunting and a gradual breakdown of civilized façades the night is cut by heavy breathing truncated dialogue and distant howls in the darkness the day reveals artifacts left behind  a hole full of stones stick figures that are a masterpiece of ambiguous evil and for a night or two the terror is visceral but as in any horror film repetition breeds contempt like another artisan release pi the blair witch project might have been more powerful as a short subject or some areas could have been further developed is heather herself the witch onto whom mike and josh are projecting their own terrors what is the significance of the two film formats in terms of point of view is one more real than the other couldnt more have been implied with the space off screen and the ellipses of time between segments of footage and what of the cameras role as a device for fending off however futilely inescapable horror that last question might be the point of the whole project the scariest shot in the movie is not any literal image hurtling from the screen but a frame of total darkness seeing may be believing the blair witch project suggests but what is unseen is terrifying beyond belief 
Mar 4 2002,positive, the opening title card reads on october 21 1994 three filmmakers heather donohue joshua leonard and michael williams hiked into the black hills forest of maryland to shoot a documentary film on a local legend called the blair witch and were never seen or heard from again one year later their footage was found the blair witch project is their legacy documenting their final days and nights in the woods and the events that unfolded before their cameras right off the bat lets salute the fact that this scary fictional film written directed and edited by daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez gives us goosebumps without resorting to the pyrotechnics of bloody gore and hyperviolence the drama taps into the same elements of mystery and dread that made horror stories told around campfires in the dark so hairraising and addictive like those whispered tales the emphasis here is upon the monsters murderers and demons that haunt our consciousness anyone who has ever been lost or out in the woods at night will relive the experience during this film anyone who has been in a lifethreatening situation with others will recognize the way fear and selfpreservation can swallow up bonds of friendship teamwork and trust perhaps the most surprising and thoughtprovoking aspect of the blair witch project is that it serves as a cautionary tale for us all our behavior in a crisis may be the legacy of our life that all the world sees despite its flimsy dialogue and its lack of character development this horror film made for teens and twentysomethings adds a few fresh twists and turns to a genre that has recently become enslaved to nothing more than special effects
Nov 12 2001,positive,there should be a nice dose of vicarious dread in it for you
Sep 18 2001,negative,the movie isnt half as diabolical as its marketing plan
Aug 19 2001,positive, authorities turn up raw footage shot by a group of film students who disappeared in the black hills forest of maryland the tape details the mysterious events leading up to their disappearance daniel myrick and eduardo sanchezs the blair witch project is as riveting and terrifying a study of fear as it is a chilling reminder of the inscrutability of myth heather donahue is as obnoxious as she is sadly aware of the limitations that come with being a female filmmakershe seeks control over a crew of men unwilling to give her the benefit of the doubt shooting a documentary on the mythical blair witch heather and her companions realize the futility of their project when the townspeople they interview prove to be less than engaging subjects the deeper they move into the woods the spookier their journey becomes their documentary becomes a diary of fear and in the end comes to resemble what they hoped to secure all along they are naïve journeyfolk unaware that theyve become pawns of the very myth they seek to capture terrifying despite the fact that so little happens the blair witch project is most remarkable in its evocation of myths refusing comprehension ed gonzalez is the cofounder of slant magazine a member of the new york film critics circle his writing has appeared in the village voice the los angeles times and other publications

Feb 14 2001,positive, the blair witch project has received so much advance press that you probably already know that it is a mockumentary thats received rave reviews on the festival circuit and thats too bad since all that attention ultimately does a disservice to the audience those who go into the film cold are of course more likely to experience thrills and chills than those who know what theyre getting intothe second group however can expect an unsettling experience capped by a couple of jolts at the finish as the films twists and turns are impossible to predict and do generate lowkey suspense some rave quotes suggest that youre in for a scare of exorcist proportions whereas blair witch is essentially an exceedingly ingenious diversion in short the film is a clever entertaining stunt no more no less and a terrific calling card for its fledgling filmmakers daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez an opening statement tells us that on oct 21 1994 heather donahue joshua leonard and michael williams hiked into marylands black hills forest to shoot a documentary on a local legend of the socalled blair witch a woman named elly kedward who was supposed to have caused half the youngsters of blair village to vanish more than 200 years ago in 1824 the town of burkittsville was founded on the site of blair between november 1940 and may 1941 the town was rocked by the ritualistic slayings of seven children by a local hermit named rustin parr who after giving himself up tells authorities that he did it for an old woman ghost once were informed that the student filmmakers disappeared without a trace but that we will be looking at the footage they shotfound a year laterwe are abruptly thrust into the quickly menacing world of that footage the filmmakers have taken tremendous pains to bring to it enough coherence so that we can be involved in the students plight as it unfolds yet maintain enough jaggedness so that blair projects fakery is utterly convincing leonard serves as cinematographer shooting in 16 millimeter while williams is the projects sound man in the meantime heather records the groups growing rifts on high8 video and her comments on those rifts this is an unobtrusive and persuasive device that provides a crucial narrative flow in a completely natural way heather whose project it is comes off as headstrong and determined to maintain control of her shoot at all costs shes strong on using all the correct terms for the shootfromthehip kind of documentary shes trying to make theres something highhanded a little condescending and insensitive about heather as she goes about interviewing locals before she and her crew enter the forest where they quickly get lost and soon become subjected to a series of mysterious and malevolent incidents the men become outraged at heather for the predicament she got them into but all three young people are smart enough to know that if they are to have a hope of making it out of the forest theyve got to pull together all three are playing roles although they use their actual names and the way in which myrick and sanchez make improvisation work within their outline keeping their cast in the dark and off balance as much as possible is nothing less than amazing you can if you want buy into the possibility of supernatural forces acting as the prime mover or believe the trio has fallen victim to some unseen person or people who simply are in the grip of madness donahue leonard and williams are as absolutely believable as everything else about the film if youre willing to look beyond the fright tactics in blair witch you can enjoy it as a kind of mordant commentary on the presumptuousness of brash and inexperienced documentary filmmakers who in this extreme instance plunge into a forest wilderness with woefully inadequate preparation and who actually think they will somehow be able to record supernatural manifestations on film in the final analysis blair witch is perhaps more amusing and satisfying as a cautionary tale deflating a certain kind of filmmaking arrogance than it is as an offbeat horror show an artisan entertainment presentation writersdirectorseditors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez producers gregg hale robin cowie executive producers bob eick and kevin j foxe cinematographer neal fredericks music tony cora production designer ben rock art director richard r moreno running time 1 hour 27 minutes
