Apr 12 2024,negative, napoleon 2023 is ridley scotts latest film an epic biopic about napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix his rise to power and his relationship with josephine vanessa kirby it starts with the execution of marie antoinette catherine walker and ends with bonapartes death in exile the little over two and a half hour film a four hour directors cut exists takes its viewers on a sumptuous yet tedious paint by the numbers tour of the selfappointed emperors life offering little to no insight into the man the people around him or the time but prioritizes mocking the little mannot in size but in terms of insecurityand hoping to displace historical and cultural memory of him by becoming the definitive film about the man unfortunately to do so it would have to sustain a viewers interest for the entire run time i was very excited to see napoleon because i had comp time burning a hole in my pocket if a holiday falls on a saturday and you work on the friday before and monday after the holiday you get a floating day off that is good for 30 day it was my first daytime screening and first double feature screening daythe other film was eli roths thanksgiving 2023 i love ridley scott an entertaining director who has made some of my favorite movies alien 1979 and blade runner 1982 he has also made movies that i have despised such as prometheus 2012 his latest films all the money in the world 2017 and house of gucci 2021 have been about the pitfalls of famous families with money set in italy and are great prurient fun because these movies feel like you are seeing something private and exclusive it is mostly spectacle where viewers can leave feeling superior to the people on the screen and napoleon seems to be more in line with that goal and not like his deeply serious actionadventure dramas like gladiator 2000 and kingdom of heaven 2005 in which scott respects the protagonist so if you are expecting napoleon to be like one of his factbased somber films like black hawk down 2001 or american gangster 2007 keep on moving if you are looking for a film that looks as if scott has a time machine and took his equipment and crew with him then napoleon is the movie for you it is sumptuous costumes sets the three major battle sequences the coronation scene was a recreation of jacques louis davids painting coronation of napoleon the most stunning battle is the films centerpiece the battle of austerlitz if there was no audio the film would be perfect with the audio scott made some bold creative choices that did not work and provided more insight into the director than the titular historical figure that scott purported to be making a film about side note while i studied the french revolution and the period following i am not making any allegations about whether scotts film is historically accurate and do not have an educated opinion about the reallife bonaparte i do not care enough to do a historical deep dive especially since scott is very vocal about not caring either these are my impressions of scotts thoughts on the period based on his film scott is not a fan of the french revolution and is a royalist also as a british person it is not a surprise that maybe he would have a bias against bonaparte and the french feel a bit tenderhearted towards queens and prefer an established class structure instead of a more fluid approach napoleon opens with the execution of marieantoinette and it is a scene filled with pathos a mother protecting her children the cruel crowd taunting her recording marieantoinettes breath to reflect her fear and effort to keep it together he shows no such sympathy to subsequent former revolutionaries in danger and sees them as hypocrites using ideals to get wealthy and supplant the royals he sees their pain as a grand joke scott initially depicts bonaparte as above the emotional fray quietly observing focused and seems to admire bonaparte most when he is at his most humble undercover and making battle plans bonaparte gets the ragged breath treatment during the first battle the siege of toulon once josephine hits the scene he becomes a blowhard pathetic oneminute lover a bumbler who humiliates himself every minute of the day which is fine but monotonous for a long movie josephine gets straight up depicted as a whore not only a married woman who had lovers josephine had descendants and if i was scott id watch my back side note french versus americanbritish films have very different sensibilities and tone when it comes to sex and adultery i have no idea how bonaparte and josephine felt about their relationship and again do not care to read their letters to each other but my gut tells me that a british person would lose something in translation and automatically consider adultery to be a character defect and a sign of immortality whereas french films barely lift an eyebrow at couples have multiple lovers and knowing about it bonaparte was not a typical french man but considering that these lovers did not end up dead and josephine was the love of his life it feels as if any british or american director would be incapable of not projecting their own prudish judgment on this couple napoleon is one of those films where most of the actors speak with a british accent which tends to be confusing the action unfolds in britain france egypt austria and russia if everyone speaks in a british accent how is the viewer supposed to know that they are in austria it requires being riveted every second of the film and knowing that if you see people playing cards in a long opulent hall bang the scene is in austria youre welcome now you will know the film flashes brief a persons name and title appears the location is not always indicated though scott is generous with indicating the month day and year and will divulge the location but it is rapid and more inconsistent than it feels the problem with the sun never setting on the british empire including with casting of movies means that it puts more of a burden on the filmmaker to provide other clear context clues and scott kind of does not care his attitude is who is going to check me boo the box office anyone speaking a foreign language appeared during napoleons battles outside of europe including russia which shows which countries scott thinks of as other or not european if there are french people in the cast they are not playing the most prominent roles edouard philipponnat who plays tsar alexander is a finnish french actor phoenix is american and other than being a good actor if im being generous with my analysis his american accent may symbolize how bonaparte was an outsider a corsican born frenchman with italian noble heritage what does that mean on a practical empathetic level no idea scott only references how bonapartes class and birthplace makes him unlike others in the ruling class a boor but does not expand further and seems to root for his displacement so the hierarchy can be securely back in its proper place even when creating a villain the villain should be interesting but emperor commodus is not in the building it felt as if phoenix reprised his fictional alter ego version of himself from im still here 2010 and became a larper he is having a great time playing a buffoon who says the most outlandish selfcongratulatory things that even the briefest fact check would reveal as a lie but it is tiresome to hit the same joke repeatedly as if you were watching the last half hour of saturday night live if you are looking for a performance that makes you forget that you are watching a film and feels lived in you will have to wait until the denouement when the duke of wellington rupert everett finally puts a stop to bonapartes shenanigans he is the only person who reacts like a real person would after the british capture bonaparte bonaparte holds an impromptu court over breakfast lecturing a group of sailor children wellington walks in horrified and astonished that anyone allowed such foolishness and everetts exasperated tone and line read showed the right amount of astonishment at his mens incompetence it is a genuinely funny moment and made me wish that there was a way to get more everett the other jokes are about laughing at someones expense whereas the punchline is about relatability to a completely unrelatable man a war legend and political figure from another time napoleon is a gorgeous movie but you wont see it when you fall asleep between battles the combination of pitch perfect visuals with comedic outlandish dialogue does not ever gel and scott lacks the necessary pacing to let everyone enjoy the joke perhaps he should have partnered with terry gilliam
Mar 12 2024,neutral,a battleladen pilgrimage through the historical highlights of frances most prolific emperor cuts considerable corners in conveying his military machinations questionable casting jarring tonal shifts and a repetitive dependence on the battlefield
Mar 6 2024,negative, while im not a fan of the movie theres a line in 2005s charlie and the chocolate factory that has stayed with me candy doesnt have to have a point thats why its candy that quote kept popping up in my head while watching napoleon the latest from revered director ridley scott make no mistake napoleon is not candyits not enjoyable for its own sake or some sort of sweet reward that stimulates the senses but scotts new film does seem to be lacking a point to the extent that i kept searching for some greater meaning or a reason for it to exist its technically proficient but emotionally beige a sort of neutral existence that doesnt really check any boxes its not a methodical review of historic events often indulging in apocryphal stories rather than what actually happened but its not some impassioned grand tale of legend either attempting to ground itself in the world of bonaparte at the same time its also not some examination of the inner world of the wouldbe world conqueror making his motivations and processes an inconsistent and rarely definable quality of the character is that the point that the real napoleon cant be known that life is a mix of myth and mundane i genuinely have no clue and it is vexing after many years of many filmmakers attempting to take on the story napoleon arrives horrifically inert and painfully tedious where its 158minute runtime often feels like 158 days the movie centers on napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix and his rise through the ranks of the military and french society through his various victories for the aristocracy while he earns many wins on the battlefield almost all on the backs of enormous casualties on his own side its the infighting among the constantly shifting ruling class that presents opportunities for the successful general it culminates in his ascension to emperor before incurring multiple defeats and exile twice over spoiler alert i suppose but youve had over 200 years to know the arc of his story meanwhile during all this tumult and ambition napoleon falls for josephine vanessa kirby a former noble that fell into the prisons during the french revolution and eventually becomes bonapartes bride there are many ups and downs of the relationship much of it around affairs and a lack of josephine providing an heir for the man who would be king of the world but napoleon is utterly enchanted by this womanalbeit showing it in his own way these two trackspolitical plots and his homelifeare intertwined in various ways that reveal a complicated man who has basic drives love sex ambition jealousy pride but shows them in increasingly odd ways is that the point that this looming figure is just like us who happens to benefit from being at the right place at the right time while remaining simple if emotionally awkward i just dont know nothing in napoleon is consistent except for how lethargic everything feels the inner workings of the court should be rife with intrigue or drama or comedy or something instead its a rote rotation of characters as power transfers between various members over the decades that tumultuous marriage with its passionate romance and clashes should be brimming with emotion and reveal something about the characters or the historical figures or something but the script from writer david scarpa does very little with these moments there are some bits of comedy with napoleon making quips or being a randy husband theres some pathos as josephine struggles as she is gradually pushed aside yet still retained and fairly controlled by her eventual exhusband but all of it is just occasional and slight and never feels like a piece of a cohesive whole the fact that napoleon has a singular author is astounding because this feels like an exquisite corpse where each section is passed to another writer with a constant mixing of emotions and meanings is that the point that a persons life isnt part of some grand tableau but an inconsistent melding of the complementary and the contrary napoleon may not be profound but surely the man behind blade runner gladiator and so many other grandiose titles delivers impressive set pieces right for even with his lessthangreat entries like prometheus the counselor or exodus gods and kings ridley scott produces some incredible spectacle and impact sequences unfortunately that is not the case with napoleon with most of those big battles not feeling epic or producing much in the way of grand scope the scale is there with many extras or at least digital ones and great costuming and eraappropriate props who mostly get gruesomely slaughtered in the abattoir of war but the blockingstaging isnt interesting nor are there any particularly memorable images from any of these clashes and the lack of emotional investment in the lead or any of the nameless supporting soldiers means that nothing really has much of an impact is that the point that war isnt meant to be a visual delight or there are billions of nameless faceless who have sacrificed themselves at the altar of ambitious petty men this lack of engaging imagery extends beyond the battlefields to the courts and balls and palaces again the film delivers beautiful costuming and some cool recreations of sites but napoleon is shot so boringly with uninteresting lighting and what feels like a somewhat obscuring scrim that dials down all the interest and brilliance of each scene dp dariusz wolski is better than this the man shot 1998s dark city which is a sumptuous feast for the eyes with interesting setups lighting and camerawork and hes done a lot of great work since collaborating often with scott but one would think that thered be a focus on natural light to mimic the era and ground it in the mundaneespecially with camera technology being such that it doesnt need strong light sources to capture these moments or it would be bathed in glorious lighting to properly establish these legendary figures in these momentous times or switching back and forth somehow to say something anything about the duality or relationship between these two worlds or something is that the point that its all just awash in uninteresting hues because this is just life no matter the outsized person in the middle of it its quite possible i just didnt understand napoleon i got the plot points and followed along with the narrative and character development but whatever was the larger message that scott and crew sought to explore feels nonexistent this lavish production never feels like an incredible story nor does it ever feel particularly intimate truthfully napoleon rarely feels like anything perfunctory emotions that are adequately portrayed by talented actors adrift in a sea of tedium its a literal epic crossing time and geographies but is an utterly hollow exercise that leaves audiences with one resounding question what was the point you can find our full content archive   here with links to all old

Feb 12 2024,neutral, this is paul salfen with your klak movie minute in theaters now is napoleon the epic ridley scott biopic on the diminutive french leader starring the not so diminutive and americanaccented joaquin phoenix that is historically questionable but still an epic piece of cinema while a lot focuses on the wild and crazy relationship between him and his wife that made him even crazier played perfectly by vanessa kirby this two and a half hourplus battleheavy film shies away from nothing and really does give you kind of what you expect epic action in a way that we know and love scott for and a bonkers performance that we know and love phoenix for supposedly there is a 4 hour cut that probably makes more sense and would be more digestible in a twopart viewing but for now we get a big screen experience that will for sure be a divisive watch amongst critics and viewers  but likely totally hated by the french i personally found it a fascinating watch and exactly what i expected but have since found that many dont agree but if you go in knowing that its taking a lot of liberties with some questionable dialogue and some humorous and ridiculous actions by napoleon that likely didnt happen it may just serve as some good entertainment under the it is what it is cinematic category thats it for this week join me next week and every week for another movie minute right here on 975 klak amfm magazine and recrd
Feb 5 2024,positive,although i was never bored this twoandahalfhour film made me feel like i was sitting through a threeandahalfhour film 
Feb 2 2024,negative, the latest biopic of napoleon directed by 85year old ridley scott attempts to tackle the rise and fall of napoleon bonaparte the military officer who rose on the crest of the french revolution orchestrated a coup détat in 1799 and went on to crown himself emperor in 1804 napoleon was eventually defeated by the combined forces of a number of european powers at waterloo now belgium in june 1815 he died in exile on the island of saint helena in the atlantic ocean six years later bonaparte 17691821 was a complex worldhistorical figure the era of the napoleonic wars 18031815 which originated in the great revolution of 1789 and the revolutionary wars fought from 17921802 was critical in the development of modern society scott however does not indicate in his public comments or in the body of the film itself any great interest in history and historical processes his napoleon is a shallow collection of impressions psychological insight of the dimestore variety and brief battle scenes which are not even presented so as to explain napoleons military prowess napoleon opens with the following titles 1789revolution in france people are driven by misery to revolution  and brought back by revolution to misery this profound insight seems to sum up the filmmakers view that the revolutionand perhaps history in generalis rather a waste of time the revolution was a pointless event everybody ended up just as badly off as they started out all in all they should have simply stayed in bed in any event as the films action begins the viewer is rushed headlong into a sequence depicting the execution of queen marie antoinette catherine walker in october 1793 we see the bloodthirsty mob taunting the monarch as she stoically raises her head up in defiance walking to the guillotine pelted by rotten vegetables where scotts sympathies lie here are evident the young bonaparte joaquin phoenix is an aloof and cold onlooker his presence a taking of artistic liberty that has no basis in fact we then witness the jacobin revolutionary maximilien robespierre sam troughton addressing the question of the queens execution before the national convention terror is nothing more than justiceprompt severe inflexible asserts robespierre portrayed unsympathetically napoleon watches the conventions session he meets with paul barras tahar rahim a powerful politician and later a member of the ruling directory who is seeking to recapture the southern french city of toulon from the royalist forces aligned with the british capture the fort that dominates the harbor and you have the city the young artillery officer tells barras after storming the city and routing the british navy the success of napoleons victory in toulon elevates his rank and stature following the military triumph barras tells napoleon that robespierre is unfit to rule because of his lawless terror napoleon previously a supporter of robespierre who helped promote the younger man to the rank of brigadiergeneral swiftly moves to the side of reaction robespierre finds himself denounced and deposed in a turbulent gathering of the convention in the thermidorian reaction of july 1794 thermidor was the 11th month in the new french republican calendar he is sent to the guillotine with a bloodthirsty mob cheering the execution on just as it cheered the death of marie antoinette thus ends the radical phase of the french revolution and the consolidation of the new bourgeois state and society is set in motion the rest of the twoandahalf hour film jumps along from one event or episode to the next often with little dramatic or historical coherence we follow napoleons courtship of the aristocratic widow joséphine de beauharnais vanessa kirby and later his 1798 campaign in egypt a foreign escapade the directory hoped would reduce his stature and popularity at home the events in egypt are somewhat ludicrously portrayed with the french troops bombarding the pyramids an invention of the film returning to france napoleon accuses the leaders of the directory of corruption and incompetence i have returned to france to find her bankrupt he begins to conspire against the ruling group with figures such as emanuel sieyès julian rhindtutt charles maurice de talleyrand paul rhys and joseph fouché john hodgkinson the minister of police who has previously helped plot robespierres downfall the fateful coup of 18th brumaire november 9 1799 is carried out which leads to napoleons coming to power the film is relatively accurate here bonaparte apparently lost his nerve and nearly failed in the coup attempt against the council of five hundred the boisterous deputies derided napoleon as an outlaw and a powerhungry upstart and assaulted him he was only able to succeed ultimately with the help of his brother lucien and soldiers armed with bayonets in a bloodless coup napoleon becomes the first consul of france scotts napoleon proceeds to charge ahead through the rest of the principal events of its subjects life in 1804 he crowns himself emperor an act that famously enraged ludwig van beethoven whose symphony no 3 eroica was initially dedicated to napoleon over the course of the subsequent decade of war the film provides glimpses of various battles including the famed french victory over the austrians and russians at austerlitz 1805 finally there is bonapartes fateful decision to invade russia and its consequences the battle of borodino 1812 a pyrrhic victory for napoleon in which his army sustains colossal losses is followed by the occupation of moscow by french forces the russians largely abandon the city and set it ablaze depriving napoleons forces far from home of food and other supplies not surprisingly the films quasidenouement takes place at waterloo in 1815 where french troops are defeated by two armies one of them a britishled force commanded by the duke of wellington rupert everett napoleon is sent into a much more severe second exile on saint helena where he passes his final days as a whole scotts film leaves the viewer interested in history none the wiser for the experience it provides little insight aside from the most superficial into napoleon as a personality and historical figure or the french revolutionincluding its earthshaking intellectual sources in the enlightenmentand its aftermath the work devotes a good deal of its time to the relationship between napoleon and joséphine their sexual issues and jealousies and her childlessness and the couples consequent splitting up to no great effect the focus feels forced in part driven by contemporary gender politics joséphine is obliged by the latter to be a decisive force in napoleons life and career this napoleon even rather foolishly hints that bonapartes invasion of russia was driven in part by his jealousy over his former wifes flirtation with the youthful tsar alexander i edouard philipponnat the acting in general is decent although phoenix is over his head attempting to play a substantial personality the limitations of his performance are the limitations of the script and direction he treats the character largely as a desperate loner and upstart someone trying to prove himself to the european upper echelons bumbling and mumblingin unconvincing method acting stylehis way through as noted many of the events in napoleon are rushed past hardly giving the viewer the ability to register them or consider their significance the technical elements and the cinematography and spectacle are all impressive but they add little to ones knowledge scott presumably admires napoleon as a military genius which he certainly was but this was rooted in large part in the social transformations set in motion by the 1789 revolution which receives no discussion whatsoever frederick engels observed that the science of war created by the revolution and napoleon was the necessary result of the new relations brought about by the revolution the two characteristics of napoleons magnificent discoveries mass warfare and mobility presuppose the degree of civilisation of the bourgeois epoch ultimately we gather scott views the french revolution and the entire epoch as not much more than gigantic mistakes leading to millions of dead napoleon ends with a lengthy list of deaths in the various conflicts after 1789 history according to this philistine conception is just one pointless thing after the other the napoleonic era has been the subject of serious literature and art in the past some of the most remarkable novels of the 19th century represent the period including stendhals the charterhouse of parma thackerays vanity fair and hugos unabridged les misérables all of which treat the battle of waterloo and of course tolstoys monumental war and peace which recounts napoleons invasion of russia all of these works and many others attempted to make sense of the events in relation to the existing european society and its dynamics ridley scott has never demonstrated such an interest or ability alien blade runner gladiator etc and doesnt demonstrate it here one even suspects that scott may be nervous about the prospects of revolution today however justified such an event might be as a response to widespread social misery moreover scott who favors spectacle over substance in his filmmaking adopts a distinctly cavalier attitude in response to criticisms of the films inaccuracies scott commented when i have issues with historians i ask excuse me mate were you there no well shut the fk up then artistic liberties are inevitable but the latter need to correspond in an important constructive manner to the spirit and substance of the content under examination unfortunately scott is out of his depth here stanley kubrick intended to tackle the life of napoleon and carried out extensive research he was unable to make the film instead directing barry lyndon 1975 set in part during the seven years war kubricks project has apparently been taken up by steven spielberg in the form of an hbo television series sergei bondarchuks waterloo 1970 featuring rod steiger as napoleon and christopher plummer as wellington with a brief appearance by orson welles as louis xviii is also worth noting napoleon bonapartes historical role has long been subjected to marxist analysis which has unraveled its contradictions as both a figure of reaction in relation to the radical egalitarian impulses of the french revolution and as a terrifying jacobin abomination to feudal europe and the british ruling class the french revolution engels argued was the victory of the great masses of the nation working in production and in trade over the privileged idle classes the nobles and the priests but that triumph soon revealed itself as exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this estate as the conquest of political power by the socially privileged section of itie the propertied bourgeoisie bonaparte trotsky once wrote halted the revolution by means of a military dictatorship however when the french troops invaded poland napoleon signed a decree serfdom is abolished this measure was dictated not by napoleons sympathies for the peasants nor by democratic principles but rather by the fact that the bonapartist dictatorship based itself not on feudal but on bourgeois property relations on another occasion trotsky pointed out that robespierre sought his support among the artisans the directory among the middle bourgeoisie bonaparte allied himself with the banks all these shiftswhich had of course not only a political but also a social significanceoccurred however on the basis of the new bourgeois society and state these are complex but not esoteric or inaccessible analyses the artist who starts out by turning a deliberately blind eye to serious historical study and research who decides to fly by the seat of his pants when taking on epochal events is unlikely to come up with a compelling or enduring work scotts napoleon is one such result
Jan 21 2024,negative, who was it that said history was just one damn thing after another this is what sir ridley scotts epic napoleon 2023 feels like when not focused on the electrifying performance of joaquin phoenix as the diminutive great man himself and his passionate playful volatile relationship with his lover and wife and exwife josephine  beautifully portrayed by an entirely miscast vanessa kirby  for starters josephine was six years bonapartes senior phoenix is 14 years older than kirby and while that bit of information in itself maybe would not mean much now socially it would be a significant hurdle in the period of history depicted as well as in the troubles that led to the dissolution of the pairs marriage  the inability of josephine to conceive an heir to the throne and salvage napoleons lineage from oblivion she already had children from a previous marriage  the psychological mechanics of the relationship as well as the power games of the duo also would have been well informed by this particular nugget of age seniority of the empress as well as her calculating yet quite nourishing approach to handling the mesmerised lustful advances of the lovesick bonaparte she was also a downtrodden sophisticated womanoftheworld to the socially awkward victorious arriviste and more of that dynamic would have meant a better grasp of napoleons historically documented obsession then again the actor himself is perhaps too old for the role yet is perfectly cast for it he acts as if he were the younger person in the couple  and thus upholds the illusion in phoenix finally there seems to have been a significant breakthrough in the portrayal of the military genius in comparison to all the performances that preceded the ones which i have seen there is such a strategic ferocity behind the way he moves within a space a kinetic immediacy assessing all its weaknesses finding ways to resolve the problem of conquering an area in an entirely mathematical way his significant lack of consideration regarding the means necessary to achieve that end yet an efficiency and expediency of his actions all traits of someone at the pinnacle of military acumen as are the reasons why he was truly admired by his troops and even by enemy soldiers see the aftermath of waterloo  equally his overt disdain towards anyone lacking combat abilities is as palpable as anything aimed most towards whom he perceives as undeserving examples of the aristocratic class what we gauge about bonaparte from scotts napoleon is that he was perhaps a man of extreme violence but never someone that would downplay and undermine true merit even his ironic and mischievous approach to emperorship seems entirely plausible when we are presented with a closeup of pheonixs face while plotting an ingenious attack  we believe him and this brings us nearer to an understanding who napoleon was at the core of things there is nothing about the performance that is posturing and selfreferential it comes from a place of prolonged understanding almost a haunting an invocation of the doomed french emperor as if the spirit of the man had been resurrected by some form of cinematic magic for the purposes napoleonic apologia however other than the redhot focus at the character of the central figure of scotts lengthy production and his singular passions all else in it is merely an opulent display in high cinematic skill by frequent collaborator cinematographer dariusz wolski  but there is not much heart and soul put into the drama of it the battle scenes although meticulously choreographed seem too anecdotal and procedural ie one damn thing after another all except two  napoleons advance on moscow his shock at seeing the city in selfinflicted flames and the part in the battle of austerlitz where an entire army seems to disappear into the ice this is because these scenes had what the others of the ilk lacked  a depth of emotional involvement in warfare one perfect shot telling us so much else we needed to know a talent scott masterfully displayed throughout gladiator 2000 even if it was a strategic choice on scotts part  portraying a mans day job war and messianic tendencies empire as only a backdrop to the personal while spending all available dramatic energy on bonapartes character and his desire for josephine it still backfired offering the public a spectacle when in fact you are telling an intimate love story sometimes does
Jan 10 2024,negative, ridley scott movies always feel like capitale events because theyre always about big things case in point napoleon now streaming on vod outlets like prime video of course he wasnt a big thing per se the french ruler being a little you know untall on one end but big things isnt intended to be a literal description this period biopic reunites scott with his gladiator star joaquin phoenix who plays monsieur bonaparte as a deep deep weirdo who happens to be a genius military strategist  and also possibly the worst sexhaver in the history of having sex in the interest of giving some focus to the story of a notorious historical figure who did a hell of a lot of conquering and political coupdetating the film frames the napoleon saga within his relationship with his wife josephine played by vanessa kirby notably scott was criticized for taking some liberties with history pushing back with a flimsy were you actually there defense when he couldve explained to all the pedants that this is a movie made with writers and actors and cgi and artificial lighting and other things that render it fundamentally inaccurate and therefore lends itself to taking creative license in pursuit of something you might call historical fiction now if only scott was making a passionate defense of a movie that deserved it the gist well cover a couple of decades give or take a couple years of napoleons phoenix life here starting with his witnessing the public beheading of marie antoinette in 1793 then going all the way to waterloo in 1815 he starts his pretty good run of gross imperialism during the siege of toulon leading the frenchs successful assault on the british navy during which napoleons life is saved when his horse rears up and catches a cannonball that wouldve changed the living shit out of the course of history  for better or worse im not sure because this movie isnt particularly interested in making anything particularly clear whether its character motivation detailed depictions of events or any implications spinning out of those two components anyway napoleons victory earns him the title of general which leads to him playing a part in ending the reign of terror  his soldiers fire cannons directly into a batch of significantly less heavily armed civilian rebels  and therefore becoming one of the countrys key political leaders at this point we learn that napoleon is far better at commandeering troops than speaking to other human beings in a social setting he walks into a party and gives off serious nerdtrovert wallflower vibes but his reputation precedes him enough that the widow josephine kirby is compelled to approach him and ask him why hes leering at her like a creep they have a couple of dates followed by this exchange between josephine and a friend do you find him without appeal the friend asks no then perhaps that is enough sounds like love in its purest form and so the lovely josephine perhaps a social climber or maybe someone seeking security for her children or perhaps enamored by men who look like the jack of diamonds from a deck of cards that have seen a few too many fiery hands of whist marries napoleon after which they retire to the marital bed so he may unleash his randy inner beast most likely a cokedup jackrabbit or any type of ugly rodent while she rolls her eyes wrinkles her nose a little and does whatever people did with their brains before they could passively scroll through instagram from here were supposed to believe that all the wild ups and downs of their marriage are the passionate emotional framework for napoleons career as tiny emperor of france and conqueror of territories he gets in trouble for leaving the scene of his overtaking of egypt  cue the firing of cannonballs into the great pyramid of giza which the pedants will point out never really happened and to which scott essentially replied hey it looks cool though  so he can go home and chastise josephine for taking a lover on the side a fact that gets splashed across all the newspapers and yet josephine and king cuck stay together because the screenplay seems to insist upon their being forever bonded to each other like one thing superglued to another thing even though we never really understand why their loveglue is so sticky in the first place  anyway they really hit the rocks when the fruit juice of napoleons stubby loins fails to produce an heir something that was very important for 19thcentury emperors theres the possibility that josephine is unable to conceive but its more fun to ridicule his ass this starts a big marital battle which if you stretch it a little is mirrored by napoleons battle against the allied austrianrussian forces since josephine and napoleon love each other but cant make it work just like napoleon thinks he has a good thing going with the russian tsar until he doesnt and the movie goes on like this for a bit with their marriage going south as napoleon sends his troops out to massacre and be massacred and he does it all for her or maybe because of her i think sort of almost what movies will it remind you of scott has only directed a handful of this type of battle epic  exodus gods and kings kingdom of heaven robin hood maybe gladiator  but it seems like so many more because each is really really long andor have even longer directors cuts performance worth watching my longheld assertion that phoenix is worth watching in anything is put to the test with napoleon he seems either miscast or unable to find the key to the characters charisma and drive phoenix flashes with brilliance  its inevitable with an actor of his caliber  and hes fascinatingly unpredictable at times but the performance ultimately reflects the films overall lack of coherence memorable dialogue im not built like other men im not subject to petty insecurity says napoleon who later bleats to a british ambassador like a petulant boy you think youre so great because you have boats sex and skin not much skin but there are a couple of amusing sex scenes that illustrate napoleons to put it gently marked lack of bedroom savvy to reference another scott film see also matt damon in the last duel  our take napoleon is one of scotts many impressive mediocrities another expensive and ambitious endeavor that doesnt live up to the potential of its considerable talent in front of and behind the camera it feels either rushed or underwritten or overedited or all of the above its narrative crux is supposed to be the strange and beguiling mismatched romance between jospehine and napoleon  shes lovely and elegant hes uh stubby and kisses her like a chihuahua attacking a dropped ice cream cone  but it seems as if the scenes that are supposed to convince us of their eternal passion have been hastily excised in order to put greater emphasis on the battle sequences mind you theyre pretty goodlooking battle sequences expertly staged and executed although they lack dramatic consequence because the screenplay gracelessly hopscotches from one set piece to the next and never establishes any rooting stakes in the conflict on second thought we dont need rooting stakes rather scott should be cultivating our fascination and curiosity with the ethics of imperialism and what drives men to quest for power  food for thought that never finds its footing in a mushy narrative that lacks clarity and detail and has no flow tonally its flat and unengaging leaving us uncertain whether we should be taking it seriously or reading phoenixs simpering interpretation of napoleon as satire phoenix inspires some laughter at times  destiny has brought me this lamb chop is how napoleon punctuates one verbal scrap with josephine  but is it intentional should we take this guy seriously or is this characterization along the lines of a looney tunes portrayal of hitler from the 1940s we expect phoenix to give a gobigorgohome performance and he upends that expectation with an understated turn that feels flat and uninspired subtle without the depth of writing to bolster it would napoleon rather be rolling his cannons through russia or back home in jospehines arms its a mystery not to be solved here theres talk of scott releasing a fourhour directors cut that might salvage napoleon but as it stands this 158minute version is disappointingly incoherent
Jan 4 2024,positive,scott makes no apologies for napoleon and never treats him as some hero for france napoleon succeeds at presenting the insecurities of this mans life for audiences who may be unaware of french history i just wish it was narrower in its scope
Jan 1 2024,positive,joaquin phoenixs blustering performance conquers as napoleon
Jan 1 2024,negative,this is such a misfire it is 2 hours and 38 minutes of my life i would like back at the end of the movie i knew nothing more about napoleon than i did when it started
Dec 29 2023,negative, british director ridley scott turned 86 on november 30 in a sweet cinematic coincidence american director woody allen turned 88 on the same day another american filmmaker martin scorsese was 81 on nov 17 and just to give some attention back to the brits mick jagger the frontman for my favorite rock and roll band the rolling stones turned 80 on july 26 all of this is to state that age is only a number do you need more proof clint eastwood is 93yearsold and the upcoming movie hes directing juror no 2 recently resumed production when the sagaftra strike ended scotts new film napoleon is just settling into theaters allens 50th featurelength movie as director coup de chance which was shot in paris premiered at the venice film festival in september and is currently scoring high with audiences in europe it arrives in 2024 in the united states after six weeks in release scorseses killers of the flower moon is still playing to appreciative audiences and is a major academy award contender jagger and the stones have confirmed tour dates and they will be singing satisfaction across america next spring not only has scott proven that a fellow his age has the energy and capability to shoot an epic motion picture with monumental battle scenes  his napoleon was filmed in 2022 from february through may  but hes also proven to be a cantankerous highspirited promoter of his own work scotts napoleon gives truth to the maxim that you dont go to the movies to learn history the tale of french emperor napoleon bonapartes rise to power plays fast and loose with the facts very fast and very loose on 60 minutes his thinskinned responses to criticism of the film were so colorful that the repeated bleeping of vulgar words was necessary it was clear that he found the whole brouhaha enjoyable suffice it to say the french are apoplectic about scotts interpretation of well of almost everything in the movie its not just that bonaparte never fired cannons at the pyramids in egypt something that is shown but the good that he did for french society is generally ignored emperor napoleon was gifted with a monumental ego but he also labored hard to build a more equal society in france the day i walked through the astonishing gilded palace at versailles outside paris where the wealth of the nation was flagrantly spent by louis xvi and marie antoinette i thought to myself no wonder the people revolted bonapartes presence and leadership calmed the country before he became ruler france was in complete and utter chaos the reign of terror was a horrific chapter in the life of frances citizens city fought city soldiers fought other soldiers political edicts voted in by the ruling elite changed hourly there were so many factions jockeying to lead that it became impossible to know what the laws were blood flowed in the streets the middleclass fought the peasants and the peasants slaughtered the middleclass tens of thousands died many more were imprisoned the sound of the whoosh of the guillotine was ceaseless unfortunately scott races through the buildup to the enigmatic bonapartes rise to power because he has only two things he really wants to showcase they are napoleons wars in which to conquer frances enemies and his sex life such as it was the battle scenes are plentiful the horrific fighting takes center stage at austerlitz and waterloo scott goes for spectacular visual sequences and he delivers regarding napoleons marriage to josephine im not sure who is in a position to confirm whats put on screen but it comes across as a relationship that if true feels borne out of bitterness and regret scott seems obsessed with making some kind of point that the french reputation for romance is a mockery of real love if we arent watching soldiers die in staggering numbers with astonishing ultraviolent often grotesque special effects were watching two adults act as if they hated each other from the very first touch josephine played by an acceptable vanessa kirby was a marginal member of the elite her first husband was beheaded during the reign of terror and she was temporarily imprisoned however its clear that scott sees her as a golddigger from whats on the screen its possible that napoleon might not have liked josephine all that much however this could be a result of joaquin phoenixs desultory performance as the emperor myth says that bonaparte had stomach problems and wasnt much of a hail fellow wellmet type of personality phoenixs acting is glum and frankly leaden hes not stoic which would have been an asset hes onenote and dull scott reduces the domestic melodrama which is a major chunk of the belabored 158minute movie to what seems like musings from the fragmented mythology weve read about napoleon and josephines manipulative history together they act like sadomasochistic misfits david scarpas scattershot screenplay is filled with genuinely bizarre attempts at humor scotts napoleon is a visual and aural choice between the blood of thousands of young men dying or the incessant carping from a married couple one bright light is the acting from rupert everett as the duke of wellington everett edifies the scenes at waterloo the films production values are very good but to what are they in service of course you might want to go for the situation comedy jokes bonaparte is by turns gloomy and goofy hes quite grandiose when pontificating none more so than when he says destiny has brought me this lamb chop really mr scott really first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of

Dec 29 2023,positive, i said i hoped to get at least two on the list of foreign films i posted last week watched because i wanted to stay conservative while getting to a lot more well  i only watched two one perfect days because it was a gwnyfca nominee i needed to finish the second the promised land because someone on my twitter feed mentioned itim glad they did because i liked it enough to put in my current top ten of 2023 running tomorrow at the film stage the reason i only got to two despite watching more films is that were at the stage of the fyc game where expiration dates come into play some studios pull access the day of your groups nominations some give you until the end of the year some until the end of january it becomes a juggling act wherein i needed to see the below sony pictures classics titles before wednesday while having another month to check out ifcs the taste of things i only had three more days to watch napoleon but an unspecified amount of time to fire up godland add the fact i needed to catch four films for final gwnyfca voting and priorities start to get moved around would i ever have considered watching the eras tour if it hadnt been included on our ballot no should it be on the ballot considering its a straight concert film and not a documentary well if other members thought it should then it should thats the only prerequisite that matters its a pretty solid list of films again so definitely take a look if youre wondering what to watch next im bummed how to blow up a pipeline didnt get more than a breakthrough director nod but ecstatic all of us strangers snuck into the best film race thats the beauty of an aggregate vote most disappointments will be met with a pleasant surprise a man of faith matthew goodes cs lewis visits a dying nonbeliever anthony hopkins sigmund freud at the latters behest to discuss the existence of god did this meeting actually happen no one knows the film confirms as much before the credits but what would they have said if it did the premise behind matt browns adaptation of mark st germains play is an intriguing bit speculative fiction wherein they mold what they know about both men into a spirited dialogue however since it is all hypothetical can you ever really supply a concrete truth from the exercise can who these men are upon meeting truly change once they say their goodbyes not really the truth we as an audience find is therefore a generic one mankind is a flawed species that ultimately has no one to blame for its inevitable demise but itself thats the one thing these two characters can agree upon whether its a result of there being no god to save us or god simply watching to see if we finally save ourselves so despite solid performances and an entertaining script built upon flashbacks that show freud and lewiss own flaws and hypocrisies the film mostly just moves in circles its a series of gotchas that ultimately finishes with a knowing smirk settled upon both mens faces to mark their enjoyment in the fact that they held their own to not lose the debate  even if no one actually wins it either it takes about three hours and forty minutes but frederick wiseman finally shows us a moment where chef michel troisgros is captivating a table of customers at his michelinrated restaurant with the story of his family we have gleaned a bit of it before then that oldest son césar manages that establishment with his father still very much involved while youngest son leo manages the familys second restaurant but its nice to have it laid out with context and detail beyond our assumptions based solely on narrative clues before then menusplaisirs  les troisgros is all vibes the clanking of glasses and clinging of silverware while everyone in the kitchen sautés and sears as orders are called out from the front something needs more salt a plate is missing a component yet no one is quite sure what beyond its absence chefs are working out how to adjust for food allergies or taste like a client admitting he doesnt like chocolate and the organic meat produce and wine suppliers give us a brief explanation of their processes the cheese monger even gives us a tour to round everything off this is admittedly my first wiseman film and i can see why so many people adore his work mostly i can see why pbs adores it since the systembased flyonthewall documentary aesthetic provided really lends itself to the educational sphere above entertainment it wont be for everyone as a result i personally dont see a need to dive into the filmmakers past works solely based on his involvement the style complements the scope of his subjects but it doesnt necessarily hold itself as a reason to watch on its own you must be curious about the place and ready for an insane investment of time my enjoyment came from making fun of the customers and their pantomime of affluence safely confined to a world of affluence with no fear of my judgment at the moment of being filmed i do not see the appeal to ever eat at an establishment like this but i do totally respect the troisgros clan as artists and their restaurants as their galleries so which one is it did ridley scott learn from his experience with house of gucci that forcing bad accents only makes biopics worse or does the lack of french accents in napoleon reveal that it was the gucci actors who decided to do whatever it was they thought they were doing and he let them perhaps its simply a product of style and how scott wanted to deliver the respective comedic tones that run through bothif said tone is intentional something i must believe since hes too seasoned and particular a filmmaker for it not to be he wanted gucci to be a cartoon and napoleon the rise and fall of a bratty boorish idiot to his credit both do prove entertaining sadly they also both fail to be much more than that david scarpas script focusing on napoleons joaquin phoenix is hilarious life through the prism of his relationship with josephine vanessa kirby is an intriguing one considering the letters they wrote to each other which as the movie explains were stolen and sold upon her death i like the idea that these two were always better together despite their deficiencies where fidelity was concerned and that he ultimately paved his own demise by choosing legacy over love i dont however think the film does a great job keeping this focus considering kirby is all but absent for the majority of the second halfa pawn shown in the background or remembered solely through phoenix uttering her name as he writes about his latest insecurities josephine isnt given enough to make the whole as electric as it is when the two of them are debating the merits of their union in the private and public spheres of their ambition i wish she were since the rest is rather forgettable boring even when it comes to moments like waterloos inevitability save phoenixs always funny petulance ill give scott credit for the battle on the ice though its a fantastic scene rivaled only by phoenix and kirby goofing around as they portray their characters silly flirtations maybe scott will eventually tear down the oscarbaity façade his projects seem unable to relinquish and just make the fullblown farce it seems he so desperately wants i hope its coming so we can reevaluate this current era of his career as a leadup to its insanity rather than a muddled mess and if as rumors say a fourhour directors cut is released on appletv i dont think ill watch because its not 2005 we were deprived of scotts vision when kingdom of heaven debuted and subsequently granted the opportunity to see it afterwards last i checked its 2023 and apple had the ability to just release what theyre apparently going to release anyway on streaming right away rendering this cut an intentionally inferior product in the hopes curiosity rather than desire gets viewers to double dip its a potential precedent making me consider whether i should avoid apple titles altogether kôji yakusho embodies the character of hirayama with so much personality and childlike awe for the little pleasures in life that we know hes going to eventually put an x somewhere on that tictactoe board he finds tucked away in one of the bathrooms he cleans this is a man who stops what hes doing to admire reflections dancing on the ceiling who takes pictures of trees with film and revels in the classic rock cassettes hell never sell because they arent just a fad to him how can he not choose to make some strangers day with a friendly game this is who director wim wenders and cowriter takuma takasaki have created to live at the center of their perfect days hirayama is a creature of routine who takes pride in his life and work regardless of how easy it is for others to dismiss the choices hes made to build it into what it has become he doesnt have to clean public toilets with a meticulousness that can never be preserved due to the fluid nature of the facility itself after eventually meeting his niece arisa nakano and sister yumi asô we can presume he walked away from a charmed existence but the leaving shouldnt define him so we never find out for sure nor should we when the film specifically asks us to take hirayama at face value it doesnt matter what his past was or what his future holds now is now and while it may look as though hes alone hes not without people who care for him even if its just as the regular customer who gets a glass of water each day hirayama enjoys reading listening to music and watering the saplings he finds and relocates to his tiny apartment but his interests being solitary doesnt mean he is too yes he hardly talks but he listens watches reacts young takashi tokio emoto could learn a thing or two if he ever fell silent long enough to pay attention the result is a simple tale of controlled monotony broken up by sharp interludes of intrigue sparked by changes both small a homeless man not being where he usually is and large favors and hiccups steering hirayama off course its a quietly sweet look at a person unbeholden to the constraints of an everevolving societys demandsa man who knows himself and is comfortable living within the means of that identity no more no less it doesnt mean he wont still get sad or frustrated that few join him on that path though thats merely the price he pays for the opportunity to always be surprised because no tears yakusho sheds will ever diminish the warmth of his smile this one hits hard and precisely when you least expect it because nikolaj arcels the promised land adapted by him and cowriter anders thomas jensen from ida jessens book is billed as a revenge film pitting mads mikkelsens poor military captain ludvig von kahlen against simon bennebjergs sadistic nobleman frederik de schinkel while that is what the plot provides for a majority of the runtime the narrative proves so much bigger not in external scope but in the internal growth of a man beholden to unjust rules kahlen has already overcome his peasant status by earning a rank in twentyfive years that men of means receive in just a few months his hope is to leverage that standing into a chance at morenamely infertile land that denmarks king wishes to settle but has yet to bear fruit so he makes a deal with the government if he produces enough yield on his own dime to attract settlers and expand the kingdom they will give him a title kahlen covets that recognition and he will stop at nothing to prove worthy of it enter de schinkel a cruel landowner who lords over that region precisely because no one can pose a threat without the ability to farm his power is thus predicated on the heath remaining a wasteland so he looks to bribe kahlen into leaving and eventually strongarm him out when he refuses kahlen is a pragmatic idealist who believes if he works within the system he can ascend within it de schinkel is a spoiled brat who knows that his wealth allows him to bend that system to his whims its david vs goliath on multiple fronts but while mikkelsen is as terrifying as hes ever been whenever de schinkel pushes him to the edge of civility the real fight onscreen is that between kahlen and himself because no matter how unfeeling he wishes he could be to mimic those he wants to treat him as an equal his past ensures that his shrewdness wont devolve into malice its not for a lack of tryinghe simply cannot work alongside good people long enough to prove de schinkel and denmark wrong without endearing himself to them without in some cases discovering that he loves them too what at first seems like a bit of added intrigue to the personal land war being wagedkindness and respect for a housekeeper amanda collins ann barbara and orphan girl melina hagbergs anmai mussoon reveals itself to be the central point because kahlen has a choice to make become that which he desires at their expense and thus become their undoing or stand up for their humanity and dignity at the expense of his dream will he feed into the broken system that abandoned him or rise to become an alternative to it its not a simple question and kahlen doesnt automatically choose the correct answer he tries to straddle the linedoing right by those he should while also not risking his own desires but half measures only work for the side that doesnt care if he lives or dies anyway theyll destroy those who cannot survive without him giving everything he has so the while the path forward leads to violence the real challenge is showing where that violence comes from arcel and company arent just satiating our bloodlust in this conflict theyre dealing with intent need and want are not equal the beauty of the promised land isnt in its ability to open our eyes to this reality but revealing it to kahlen were watching his brain get rewired as he witnesses the consequences of greed and selfrighteousness and awakens himself to the fact own actions are driven by the same sins it leads to a devastatingly brutal climax before shifting towards an emotional epilogue bringing everything together in the simplest yet most profound way possible by filling the void of tragedy with a wealth of hope because a man isnt a title on a piece of paper hes the imprint left upon the hearts of those who love him from the first scene inside the titular lounge ilker çataks film cowritten with johannes duncker portrays how the faculty is just as cliquish and immature as the students they gossip they judge they villainize and conspire it eventually gets uncomfortable enough that carla nowak leonie benesch tells the assistant principal rafael stachowiaks dudek they need to stop speaking polish and stick to german so as not to alienate themselves shes new to the school after all this is her first semester and shes on the outside looking in she doesnt yet know that crossing over might take her soul the teachers lounge starts with a tribunal of sorts someone has been stealing money and supplies and for reasons undisclosed the staff believes it is a student in nowaks class so she dudek and thomas liebenwerda michael klammer confront the classs representativestwo students who are in effect singled out to rat on their friends nowak does all she can to defend the kids and tell them they dont have to say anything liebenwerda pulls out an attendance list and asks them to nod when he reaches a suspicious name thats all it takes to label a child guilty no proof no witness testimony no confession just assumption and one thats easily negated as far as facts are concerned once the parents get involved yet it sticks nonetheless in the court of public opinion that child is marked now being the child of immigrants he already was the teachers can apologize or shrug off the effect of such stigmatizations casting liebenwerda as a black actor adds crucial layers to his actions as persecutor throughout the film all they want but they dont truly care the only one who does is nowak sadly that knowledge is worthless when youre on an island alone amongst a group of catty fearmongers worse than children because their age and experience embolden them to believe they have irrefutable authority it leads carla to take matters into her own hands by staging a scenario that might allow her to clandestinely catch the real perpetrator in the act the unfortunate reality of the overall circumstances however demand that she involves others after doing so others that escalate confuse and exacerbate an already tenuous ecosystem its a tense and heartbreaking journey as the ripple effects of what occurs threatens to destroy futures the psychological damage is immense as accusations are hidden facts are shrouded by ambiguous language and rumors are allowed to run rampant what then is the truth is truth even a legitimate concept anymore when half the population has been trained to use opinions and selfsatisfying desires as a means to refute empirical evidence and to make matters more complex truth should become secondary to the most important aspect of the whole the safety of children nowak might be the lead but it is young oskar kuhn leonard stettnisch who sits at the center of this drama his mother eva löbau wants revenge on the school using him as a pawn to get it the school wants blood from the thief who took hundreds of pencils neglecting him to procure it and then theres carla watching the world implode around her best student carla the person who unwittingly started the whole ordeal and now regrets how her role allowed the collateral damage the kids to steal control of the narrative and create even more benesch is fantastic the exasperation the compassion the guilt of causing pain and the anger that those around her think it was warranted even when she tries to do the right thing those in power deny her so as not to show weakness to them sacrificing one kid is worth sweeping it all under the rug listening to the loudest voices causes less trouble than listening to the voices of reason because at the end of the day schools arent made for kids they arent built to educate and better society theyre institutions of capitalism they babysit so parents can work training the next generation of workers so who cares if one gets left behind you could turn jeff harris book about tenório júnior into a generic documentary with disembodied voices and archival footage or you could take his numerous recorded interviews and turn them into animated talking heads with javier mariscal and fernando truebas style from chico  rita giving it an energy to match the bossa nova and samba beats of the era they shot the piano player is thus two things at once an account of how harris journey to write a book about brazilian music evolved into a historical account of the disappearance of one of the scenes been pianists as well as how that shift in perspective evolves into a metaphorical representation of south american life under an everincreasing blanket of dictatorship the animation is great the music is better and the story is fascinating if only to ensure this revered yet unknown artist outside of the memories of legends doesnt become completely lost to time its a tragic politicallymotivated crime like many that we hear about from that periodthe majority of which see the us government as a complicit partner with blood on its hands jeff goldblum playing harris can be distracting sometimes i wondered if the filmmakers piped in reaction words for laughs like new scenes beginning with goldblum just goofily and breathlessly saying hello but his involvement obviously adds marketability for a subject that might not have gained traction without it which is a shame since it is an intriguing bit of convergence between music and politicsanother blindly persecuted artist by a totalitarian regime preemptively silencing any potential dissent

Dec 24 2023,positive,  napoleon bonaparte 17691821 was born on the frenchowned island of corsica at age 16 he graduated from a military school and became an officer in the french army this biopicture picks up after napoleon joaquin phoenix honed his military skills in europe and africa and returned to france he masterminds the defeat of royalist rebels supported by anglospanish ships in the city of toulon he then rises quickly both in the military and in government   napoleon seizes power when a new government is formed in 1799 in 1804 he declares himself emperor in an incredible ornate ceremony he then embarks on a series of wars to satisfy his gigantic ego and his belief in the military victory as transformative   psychiatrists would say that napoleon exhibits symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder a grandiose sense of selfimportance a lack of empathy a willingness to exploit others frequent envy and a need for admiration all these are evident in the film   director ridley scott whose films include gladiator robin hood and the last duel excels at action sequences and this movie is full of them but the story also focuses on napoleons love of josephine vanessa kirby his wife and muse the mans compulsion to go to war conflicts with his desire to be home with her especially when he fears she may have affairs in spiritual terms his two types of tunnel vision limit his capacity to lead   tunnel vision in a spiritual context refers to a narrow perspective where one is able to see or understand things in a limited or restrictive way this kind of vision can make us miss out on the bigger picture or other vital aspects of life   while the film gives us scenes of napoleons victories over austria russia and prussia the objects of his tunnel vision crumble when josephine is not able to give him an heir he divorces her although they remain in contact meanwhile the french people become exhausted over war and taxes in 1812 this overconfident dictator leads his troops in an invasion of russia in which he lost about 80 percent of his men in 1815 he suffers a final defeat at waterloo   a closing screen chronicles the fatalities in the napoleonic wars totaling in the millions this makes the following quotes from napoleon about war more to be lamented than emulated 
Dec 23 2023,positive, anyone who has taken a primary school history class knows napoleon bonaparte even those who dont know his name should recognize the pintsized military man with his hand in his jacket pocket hes immediately familiar in fact it feels almost surprising that hollywood retellings of his life are so few and far between so when ridley scott announced joaquin phoenix to play the universally recognized historical figure my mind boggled would the pairing harken back to the glory days of gladiator or would the result be simply another flat and utterly mediocre historical drama  napoleon traces the life of the general and french emporer of the time joaquin phoenix charting his rise to military power through his relationship with the love of his life josephine vanessa kirby ridley scott directs the movie from a script by david scarpa  napoleon hits theaters with big and lofty goals this story covers a lot of complicated but oftexplored history during its twoandahalfhour runtime like many ridley scott films there is a lot going on here through all levels of production  to begin with napoleon is a veritable feast for the eyes every frame is stylistically gorgeous and looks like a million bucks  ultimately this should come as no surprise ridley scott stands among the greatest filmmakers of the last halfcentury he gave us blade runner for crying out loud  in fact it makes perfect sense that the director who brought us gladiator would bring a movie with such vivid and operatic battle sequences these moments which are scattered throughout the runtime are most certainly the cinematic high point the peak is likely the battle of austerlitz the sequence is stark and harsh but at the same time beautifully atmospheric the seasoned and wily filmmaking when brought together with a borderline unhinged performance from joaquin phoenix results in a magnetic sequence its difficult to tear your eyes away from everything happening onscreen  however this all sets up a strange and wacky second act all of a sudden napoleon is layered phoenix is playing to the cheap seats napoleon is even perhaps kinky who would have imagined that  in fact for this portion of the movie his casting feels to be a reflexive comment on napoleon as a human being phoenixs performance brings more than the occasional reminder of his work in gladiator this character may be a majestic leader but hes still a simpering yet petulant manchild this is a brave choice that flies in the face of how we often remember historical figures  at the same time napoleon becomes yet another work in a long line of films to commit a cardinal sin underutilizing vanessa kirby since the actress burst on the scene in the crown shes been heralded as one of the best of her generation however she keeps finding herself in movies that dont know how to use her talents this is yet another  ultimately strong worldbuilding is napoleons true selling point ridley scott unsurprisingly puts forward a visually stunning feature it looks as rich and vivid as this history should be however this is largely a case of style over substance while there are interesting moments involving these characters nothing gels into anything cohesive there are many flashes of brilliance but their depictions pale in comparison to the beauty of the worldbuilding  a film nerd from my earliest years watching abbott and costello that eventually translated to a masters degree in film history i spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms as well as covering film and television
Dec 23 2023,positive, only ridley scott might have taken on a project as ambitious as napoleon and avoided embarrassment if he doesnt entirely succeed this may be because the subject is simply too vast too complex to be crammed into twoandahalf hours there are thousands of books on napoleon 17691821 with new ones being published every other month every campaign every letter every aspect of his private life or personality has been scrutinised by professional historians and enthusiastic amateurs keep reading and rather than becoming more familiar he only grows more mysterious in both public and private napoleon is a wealth of contradictions a hero of the enlightenment and a relentless warmongerer a champion of the revolution who reinstated an absolute monarchy an aesthete who found time to attend operas and plays in the midst of a campaign a romantic who divorced the only woman he truly loved in the quest for an heir and strategic alliance a dedicated technocrat who gave france a code of laws an education system an improved postal service roads and public works but felt that only martial glory would secure his legacy will the real napoleon ever stand up a provincial upstart from corsica he never overcame his lingering insecurities even when all the kings of europe were cowering at his feet his brilliance as a tactician and his long record of military success made him acutely resistant to the advice and opinions of his allies like the narcissist he was regardless of what all the world might be telling him napoleon would trust his own judgement whats amazing is that it worked  allowing him to pull off miraculous victories as a general and a politician  until his star deserted him and all his calls went wrong to a greater extent than possibly anyone else in history napoleons rise and fall were entirely selfgenerated as may be imagined such a figure creates unique challenges for the director who wants to bring him to the screen and the actor who plays the role although there have been numerous cinematic portrayals of napoleon the greatest is probably abel gances silent epic of 1927 the restored version of gances napoleon clocks in at roughly five hours and leaves off at the point where the young general is establishing his reputation with his early italian campaigns gance originally planned to make six films on napoleon but because the first was released at a time when the film industry was switching to talkies his masterpiece stumbled at the box office and the grand scheme lapsed in scotts napoleon the italian campaigns are disposed of in a sentence they happened somewhere off camera while we werent looking what we get instead is the ambitious young commander who led the successful seige of toulon suddenly challenging for the top job in a postrevoutionary france that badly needs someone to restore order and confidence weve also skipped napoleons childhood in corsica his complex family connections his time at the military academy and most of the machinations that would see him installed as one of three consuls who took control of the country in 1799 in a popular coup détat in no time at all he is supreme ruler it was a meteoric rise to power but in this film it happens in the blink of an eye the only early campaign we see is his occupation of egypt which was generally disastrous but portrayed as a triumph thanks to napoleons masterly understanding of propaganda these scenes allow scott to include sweeping views of the pyramids and a strange vignette in which napoleon goes facetoface with the mummy of a pharaoh who looks suspiciously like ramses the great ok point taken in place of an origin story we get a whiff of cinematic fantasy beginning with the beheading of marie antoinette which napoleon watches impassively a mere face in the crowd historians have been quick to point out he wasnt in paris at the time and to list massive inaccuracies in every detail of the execution in this preface to the story scott and his scriptwriter david scarpa are announcing that they are prepared to take serious liberties with the historical record these liberties will continue until the very end with more campaigns and personal battles being left on the cutting room floor including the final conflicts following napoleons disastrous russian campaign that will lead to his abdication in this version hes back from russia and instantly signing the paper the big question is whether these savage cuts and rearrangements ruin the film historical purists have already cast their verdict in unequivocal fashion but scott and scarpa might argue they were making a movie rather than a history lesson they have taken their stand on two points the major battles that defined napoleons career and the relationship with his wife josephine that provides the most acute insights into his personality there may be nobody in the industry who does battle scenes as brilliantly as ridley scott napoleon fought 61 major engagements of which only a handful are covered in this film but the scenes of austerlitz and waterloo are gripping and dramatic soldiers are mowed down by cannon balls men and horses disappear under the ice of a frozen river in billowing clouds of blood combatants hack at each other with swords and bayonets or are blown away by close range musket fire its breathless entertainment and it feels horribly real as for the marriage of napoleon and josephine it sets huge challenges for the lead actors joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby the first obstacle to credibility is that josephine was significantly older than napoleon who married her when he was 30 years old and she 36 phoenix at 49 is 13 years older than kirby we need to accept that phoenixs weatherbeaten countenance will be the same whether he is supposed to be in his 20s or his 50s the onus is on the actor to make us forget about age and believe wholeheartedly in his rendition of the character josephine cheated on napoleon in the very first days of their marriage acting as if she was very far from being in love with this corsican brute he was the opposite declaring himself smitten from their initial meeting for the rest of their lives even after he had divorced her for largely political reasons napoleon seems to have remained in love with his errant extravagant wife the scene where they sit down together upon his return from egypt to confront her infidelity is one of the highlights of the script as josephine deftly swings the balance of power in her direction whatever she felt at the beginning of the liaison she and napoleon will become the firmest of couples each necessary to the other although the merits of this film are being contested in terms of its historical accuracy it lives or dies on the performance of joaquin phoenix who bears little physical resemblance to napoleon conscious of the puzzles within the great mans personality phoenix has chosen to play him as an introvert hiding his own insecurities behind a mask of indifference he is grumpy and troubled devoted to his official duties tortured by a sense of destiny one imagines the real napoleon was more mercurial with the charm and intelligence to get his way in almost every encounter nevertheless phoenix has pitched his tent on a particular version of napoleon and remains consistent from start to finish we may not like this portrayal of napoleon or believe in its accuracy but as a display of the actors craft its a job well done its tempting to say the same about ridley scott  a consummate professional among contemporary directors an old hand equally at home with a battle scene involving thousands of extras and an intimate têteàtête between husand and wife for any director napoleon might be seen as a lunatic enterprise as ambitious and overreaching as the emperors belief in his own starry destiny but while its impossible not to have reservations about this film its equally impossible to avoid being impressed scott has given us a magnificent flawed epic with a lead actor strapped into the character like a pilot in his cockpit i occasionaly gasped when i realised how much history was being omitted but got caught up in the flow as napoleon surged inexorably towards his fate perhaps the best approach may be to forget about the facts and enjoy the sheer effrontery of the fiction
Dec 23 2023,positive, the script by david scarpa all the money in the world dutifully takes us from high point to high point as napoleon bonaparte rises through the ranks during the french revolution and after taking advantage of the chaos brought by the guillotine and the reign of terror to position himself as a strongman ultimately in a country that just got rid of its king napoleon works himself into the job of emperor early on napoleon meets a noblewoman recently sprung from the bastille  joséphine de beauharnais vanessa kirby their story isnt the fairytale romance since joséphine had other lovers while napoleon was away shooting cannons at the egyptian pyramids and such napoleons attitude toward joséphine is more of a spoiled child jealous and sniveling than ostensibly the most powerful man in europe things come to a head when napoleon pressures joséphine to bear him a son and heir phoenixs performance is a curious mix of bravado and petulance capturing both his military smarts and his personal foibles hes nicely matched by kirby who quietly manages her emperors mercurial moods with a diplomatic tone and a tigress purr  much of scotts movie focuses on napoleons military prowess and his hubris  both in his invasion of russia where he started with 600000 soldiers and limped home with 40000 and the climactic battle of waterloo where he was completely outclassed in tactics by the duke of wellington rupert everett its in those battle scenes where napoleon earns our attention there are few directors still working who can bring the spectacle the sheer bigness of a war epic like this the way scott does he makes every cannon blast hit home
Dec 20 2023,negative,the movie plods along until his inevitable death in 1921 and there doesnt seem to be a point to showing the story at all which makes we wonder why did i bother
Dec 19 2023,negative, as i was watching ridley scotts napoleon written by david scarpa i gradually became aware that i was sitting in a dark room watching an image of actors pretending to be napoleon jaoquin phoenix and josephine vanessa kirby not a good sign when the trailer promised triumph after actionpacked triumph in fact the film does open on a thrilling battle the lifting of the siege of toulon in 1793 a few years into the revolution granted his first command napoleons diligent reconnaissance led him to formulate a daring midnight raid to capture the british fort there and turn it against their own ships i should note at this point that the film plays very loose with historical accuracy the plan is explained to us beforehand the camera direction is clear and consistent and we get a sense of napoleons nerves before he charges into battle himself none of that ever reappears in the rest of the film what is repeated however are napoleons bathetic closecombat skills stunts coordinated by natalie wood  complete with panting sound designed by michael fentum  the gore here of a cannonball shot directly into his horse vfx supervised by illia afanasiev and the twisted humor of when after the battle he reaches into his horses corpse pulls out the cannonball and tosses it to younger brother lucien matthew needham saying send this to mother sfx supervised by neil corbould if the whole film had been like either the previous paragraph or the one above it an excellent time would have been had by all alas a ridiculous man though this napoleon is  with his american accent among a sea of british voices rupert everetts duke of wellington is the most british of the lot and the indeterminate european accent of edouard philipponnats tsar alexander i casting by kate rhodes james  the film still feels the need to give its scarecrow a heart that would be kirbys josephine napoleons first wife and lifelong beloved she enters the film being noticed and pursued by napoleon and though she immediately sees what a silly man he is even laughing in his face shes a widowed former aristocrat who needs security so she marries him and as she doesnt take him seriously very publicly takes a lover while hes busy shelling the pyramids of giza big mistake napoleons juvenile jealousy comes crashing down on her head and using some emotional blackmail he makes her take him seriously thenceforth she endures being his love object sometimes even wringing some fun out of it as seen in one breakfast scene cribbed from amadeus 1984 at least thats what it looks like onscreen curiously their love letters seem to tell an entirely different story as heard in voiceover when napoleons off fighting russia hes still a jealous powerbottom but josephine responds with equal passion phoenix and kirby are both outstanding actors and their dynamic is clear when the script is but most of the time were not quite sure where they stand whos in charge whos humoring whom unlike in say scenes from a marriage 1973 this relationship doesnt feature dialectical reversals just a precarious woman trying to fulfill the expectations of her powerful and impossibly fickle husband napoleons dithering is his secret weapon good things come to him the command at toulon the enemy into his trap at austerlitz an offer to join the coup of 18 brumaire the throne itself its when the film lets him actively choose that he suffers josephine and her infertility necessitating divorce the doomed winter march on moscow leading to exile on elba waterloo where he takes the initiative in attacking the coup itself is a good example its offered to him and he accepts but on the day when he tries to take the council rostrum the council members heckle and beat him to within an inch of his life pratfalling down the steps he narrowly escapes outside where lucien is waiting to seal the deal with a troop of gendarmes what follows is highstakes improv to justify military intervention including some intuitive fraternal chemistry and the crucial use of a sword napoleon who reenters to ask shall we vote may have rifles at his back but hes lost all face thats why hes once again panting since the subject of this biopic has no center the films stance is unclear and so the technical side feels muddled not knowing what to emphasize the pacing drags edited by claire simpson and sam restivo dariusz wolskis cinematography is underlit so that even the setup for the battle of austerlitz is hard to comprehend the cgi for the winter camp at austerlitz and the burning of moscow by alexander himself the film reminds us looks cheap and so many comedic moments fall flat due to lackluster execution with the major exception of the slapstick coup scene
Dec 19 2023,positive,dariusz wolskis camera work on battle scenes is spectacular
Dec 15 2023,negative, for a film with as many contradictions as napoleon its odd for it to be so straightforward it covers 28 years but it never feels like a lot of changes its over two and a half hours which while not a herculean runtime never entirely slows down perhaps its because it never really gets started ridley scotts latest opens with a public decapitation of marie antoinette catherine walker giving way to the 1793 siege of toulon the violence is often unsparingly graphic so why then does it feel so cosmetic shouldnt a live horse eviscerated by a cannonball to the chest do something to the viewer maybe not when theres such little context if napoleon is one thing its episodicahistorical even david scarpas script begins in the trenches and is content on staying there everyone and everything are simply window dressing that includes napoleon bonaparte himself joaquin phoenix whom the film oversimplifies from intrinsically flawed leader to wholly externalized manchild after the siege he wins the affections of joséphine de beauharnais vanessa kirby the two soon marry its a relationship of manipulation and droll humor the film isnt bothered to get invested in napoleon often works as a vessel for war scenes with the rest as connective tissue it ostensibly follows bonapartes rise and fall until his death in 1821 but given how the films intermittent structure prevents it from accruing any momentum there is no true ascent much less a crash it sees its characters as circumstantial worse yet its interest in the politics surrounding them borders on nonexistent acid spit would be one approach to this story as scott and scarpa seem to aim for at points but they settle for ambivalence instead scott livens up napoleon on a strictly macroscopic level the violence itself is inherently upsetting if unmoving in context but scott and cinematographer dariusz wolskis mise en scène exists just at the cusp of something grandiose their work is often layered in composition propulsive in motion while stoic in staging its never momentous but in some ways thats appropriate only in such moments does napoleon balance its technical bombast with the fatalistic bent of its story meanwhile arthur maxs production design remains up to snuff even if scott often isolates it from the characters at hand theres a bizarre lack of setting to the whole experience rather the actors exist on their own planes physically and emotionally phoenix oscillates between hamming it up and folding into a demeanor that hints at a more destructive pathos and while his work gels with the films humorous streak it renders the character lost in his own story conversely kirby does good work with a role the film doesnt care for she manages to excavate a cleverness from joséphines pastwhich again the movie bypassesgrounding moments that otherwise edge on selfparody in the process and yet against all odds and flaws napoleon isnt particularly dull despite being a 158minute passive viewing experience the editing from claire simpson and sam restivo maintains a coherence to the more spectacular moments but allows the runtime to putter along alas its easy to see what could have been the class commentary the fatalism of it all the metaphor of the male ego visàvis the historical epic itself scott has mentioned the existence of a 270minute directors cut its not a satiating prospect but one must wonder how much substance got the axe before coming to its theatrical form here the end title cards list the increasing death tolls from bonapartes battles which point to something pointedly coldgrim even but napoleon lacks the work to stick that landing faltering as an epic and a character piece its one thing for a movie to not care for human insight its another for it to fail to engage with conflict in any meaningful way inside or out cordcutting once carried the promise of reducing live tv costs but with most services nearing a 100 per month that statement checks less every day that said there is a handful of cordcutting services with reasonable monthly prices below we list them maybe youve just seen oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathonor more fun yet rankall of christopher nolans films or maybe youre one of the few who havent seen interstellar yet if you are then you should change that immediately the dystopian epic is one of nolans best and with that incredible twist in   which netflix country has interstellar for whatever reason the hunger games series isnt available in the same countries around the world youll find the first and second aka the best installments in hong kong for instance but not the third and fourth its a frustrating dilemma especially if you dont even have a single entry in your region which is   which netflix country has each movie of the hunger games
Dec 14 2023,negative,its clear i think that in spite of various attempts to make napoleon work as a biopic the film doesnt have a bio it has a general of genius something like a sports figure who is alive only in games or tournaments
Dec 14 2023,positive,epic battle scenes but the personal story is lacking
Dec 13 2023,positive,it feels as if scott is flipping the bird to a film industry that takes itself too seriously
Dec 13 2023,neutral, ridley scotts napoleon attempts to capture both the epic military achievements and personal relationships of one of historys most powerful figures starring joaquin phoenix as the french emperor and vanessa kirby as empress josephine known for his prowess in historical dramas scotts latest endeavor falls short in grasping the complexity of napoleons rise and fall the film delves into the events that shaped napoleons trajectory offering a reductive almost anecdotal vision of his life while the rough combat scenes stand out as the films most attractive aspect  the bloody battles against the russians are potentiated by gloomy undertones and martin phipps tenebrous score  the overall narrative comes across as disjointed and superficial  even cinematically rewarding in terms of carefully framed shots the evocative cinematography is by dariusz wolski what we experience is lifelessness phoenixs portrayal of napoleon oscillates between bravery and vulnerability mirroring the films own conflicted nature the lack of a personal perspective also prevents the film from delving into something bolder  to make matters worse phoenix and kirby have no chemistry and the films energy fizzles out before reaching its conclusion abel gance successfully tackled napoleons story in 1927 but scotts adaptation is another missed opportunity to explore the complexities of frances most significant military commander and historical ruler
Dec 13 2023,positive, film critic michael cook reviewed napoleon and leave the world behind on good day arkansas watch the video to see how cook rated the films to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 12 2023,neutral, ridley scott is one of the cinematic kings of visual spectacle and in that sense his biopic napoleon is on par with anything hes ever made however hes apparently got a fourhour directors cut of napoleon coming out on apple tv in the next few months and so my recommendationunless youre a diehard napoleon fan with miniature napoleonic battlefields in your basement and secretly enjoy wearing a replica of emperor bonapartes black felt bicorn hat the one that just sold for 21 million at an auction in france last sundayis that you stay away from the current 25hour theatrical version why its a crashing bore its a chronically underlit funerealtoned dourperformancespacked nonhistory lesson i mean theres a scene where napoleon blows the top off egypts great pyramid of giza with a cannonball and then opens up some golden sarcophagus pharoah khufu was it and sniffs the mummy and pokes old khufu in his parched face yeah sure that happened beginning in 18thcentury france with the reek of the rabid revolution in the air corsican gunnery officer napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix ambles around with his hands behind his back surveying troops and contemplating how to beat the british the first battle scene is 1793s siege of toulon director scott who delights in destroying the human chest by having aliens explode out of it here explodes napoleons trusty steeds chest via a baseballsized cannonball not since roland emmerichs the patriot has the grotesqueness of a cannonball strike had such a  ghastly depiction it must be said the cannons should here be nominated for an oscartheyre a character unto themselves a kind of greek cannon chorus but as with marie antoinettes chopped top i didnt really care to contemplate that much carnage a closingcard tells us that napoleon fought in 61 campaigns five of these battles are showcased for the film in addition to toulon there are the aforementioned 1798 battle of the pyramids 1812s battle of borodino 1805s battle of austerlitz and finally the infamous 1815 battle of waterloo where duke of wellington arthur wellesley rupert everett defeats the legendary frenchman napoleons battles generally had a success rate of 80 percent and the man left some three million souls dead under his command imagine killing three million people vanessa kirby best known from the mission impossible franchise makes for a tempestuous unfaithful and possibly possessed joséphine we learn that she is a woman with needs and when her corsican ruffian husband leads his army off to the ottoman territory of egypt shes fooling around with a dashing young courtier which leads to napoleon dropping everything and rushing home comically to see if after having been massively cuckolded he can shed that snakeskin of shame all of france is aware of the situation after all when joséphine then queries as to whether her husband has had affairs too he responds with of course as if a man of his power is so entitled its one of many double standards that joséphine has to learn to deal with over the course of their marriage historians have suggested that napoleon lacked sexual energy but here the interpretation is that hes quite energetic but entirely selfinvolved which is funny and mr phoenix obviously enjoys the concept sending up napoleon by stomping his feet whinnying like a horse and champing at the bit to convey his fervent matrimonial intentions one imagines that the missing connective tissue here is within director scotts fourhour version and this contributes to the tone jumping around so much and the lack of overarching cohesion in how the character is depicted which again give the comedic bits more of the effect of a mel brooksstyle satire instead of supporting a classic ridley scott historical epic but because mr scotts satirical take is also clearly intentional casting joaquin phoenix and his zany theatrical choices makes sense mr phoenixs stockintrade after all are disturbed men often with sexual issues personally id rather not link one of the greatest warriors history has ever produced with mr phoenixs übercreep the joker in my mind but i dont know enough napoleonic history to be able to tell if his is even a remotely valid interpretation my guess is no vanessa kirby on the other hand takes a more grounded approach to the material and while this does help the audience relate to her more fully from an emotional standpoint it also makes it feel as if ms kirby and mr phoenix are in two completely different movies and this is all well and good if such a standalone fictitious creation produces a good lesson to be learnedadvice that audiences can take away a moral to the story whats the lesson in napoleon while i was able as always to appreciate ridley scotts technical virtuosity and painterly eye i didnt care about any of the characters involved or have even a minimal personal investment in their outcomes as was mentioned at the outset by his own admission this cinematic rendering of napoleon is literally only half of what mr scott originally intended so the fact that the whole thing comes off as halfcocked is hardly a surprise and so while theres nothing immediately apparent to be found here the lesson in napoleon may yet be forthcoming in the fourhour version but i also have to say after having seen the twohour film i have zero interest in the fourhour one
Dec 12 2023,positive, now in theaters ridley scott is an unstoppable machine he pit sigourney weaver against an alien in 1979 now 44 years  and many classics  later he pits joaquin phoenix against the world in the epic napoleon choosing broad brushstrokes over intricate details scott and screenwriter david scarpa attempt to condense the titular characters entire complex life into a twoandahalfhour narrative the result while flawed is glorious majestic atmospheric visually stunning led by two charismatic leads scott at 86 shows the young uns how its done the narrative begins in 1793 when a young napoleon joaquin phoenix still an officer observes queen marie antoinette catherine walker beheaded by a guillotine soon he proves himself to paul barras tahar rahim a politician and revolutionary leader by fighting off the british followed by a series of battle victories executed with ease and finesse ambitious from a young age napoleon does not even attempt to hide his overinflated ego nor his grand aspirations he finds himself entranced by joséphine de beauharnais vanessa kirby a coquettish widow before long they get married her public infidelity drives napoleon to abandon his troops in egypt after winning the battle of the pyramids yet he does not divorce joséphine  not yet at least her inability to birth him an heir eventually leads to the collapse of their marriage scotts film may be overstuffed and unwieldy but its also never boring and unexpectedly hilarious he and scarpa zoom through major historical events napoleons coronation the battle of austerlitz the battle of borodino the failed invasion of russia the battle of waterloo and napoleons exile interestingly the filmmakers focus more on the central relationship some of the explosive films most powerful scenes involving the two leads quietly exploring their power dynamics the nuances of their weirdly symbiotic relationship phoenix is magnetic per usual utterly inhabiting the central character while avoiding the pitfalls of playing a largerthanlife personality in fact he goes in the opposite direction that of introspection which renders his performance that much more enigmatic kirby too sidesteps the usual clichés of a female supporting character in a predominantly male feature not only holding her own but forming the heart of the otherwise steely affair also thank heavens they didnt deage them for the earlier sequences id rather buy into a 49yearold phoenix playing a 24yearold napoleon than be distracted by the pixels all over his face the battle sequences are of course jawdropping in scope legendary cinematographer dariusz wolskis camera glides over darkgreen hills or foggy wintry terrain eyeing the clashing armies with a perfectly calibrated balance of indifference and reverence one particular instance with a horse is bound to get the audience riled up the battle of austerlitz with its bombardment of a frozen lake may mark the standout for its not the exploding ice that astounds the most  its bonapartes eyes viewing the destruction with the mix of pride and nonchalance that wolski captures so well the film explores what drove napoleon avoiding gimmicks or easy targets it never even mentions his height his ego his love of his people and country  and of course joséphine  and well something else something that phoenix leaves for interpretation hes both kind and heartless devoted and selfabsorbed its definitely not your typical portrayal of a famous historical figure and the better for it according to imbd the director has over 68 titles in development the man has long since set the standard for how its done he continues to challenge himself studying fascinating historical figures venturing into outer space and exploring the family dynamics of a notorious fashion mogul gladiator 2 bring it on now on amazon prime you have to give it to ridley scott the 83yearold stalwart is a machine producing or directing film after film year after year in ridley scotts the last duel a character proclaims there is no right there is only the power of men it is a line that not only carries weight the factbased drama all the money in the world is both timely and timeless depicting the greediness of our world where unfortunately the money is film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Dec 11 2023,positive,youre not going to have a complete picture of the events that comprised napoleons life but you might just have a better understanding of who the man was and why were still so fascinated by him over two centuries after his death
Dec 8 2023,neutral, on this episode jd and brendan discuss ridley scotts latest film napoleon starring the strangely hilarious joaquin phoenix it does appear sadly that this is another kingdom of heaven situation for ridley scott as we do know that a 4hour version is coming to appletv soon the theatrical cut has its limitations and we do our best to talk about what those are here and what we hope for in the final version
Dec 8 2023,neutral, over two decades after they worked together on gladiator yes it really was that long ago ridley scott and joaquin pheonix reunite on this bigscreen biopic of the famously vertically challenged general its called a napoleon complex for a reason even if you slept through history in school you are likely aware of at least some facets of the french emperors life  thanks in part to a certain eurovisionwinning song by abba but obviously theres more to the man than an awardwinning floor filler and here scott tries to capture the essence of napoleon while also revelling in the spectacle of his military leadership spectacle is something that scott does well and napoleon is no exception he recreates six of the warmongers most famous conflicts yes including that one in gruesome and gory detail the scenes are bloody and not for the squeamish war is always brutal but when its conducted on horseback with swords and 19thcentury weapons it seems even more visceral especially when experienced in imax which i did but there is more to the man than his military career and outside of the complex battle scenes the focus is on the man behind the uniform at the crux of the story is his relationship with his beloved josephine played by vanessa kirby who you may know from the crown and mission impossible from the moment napoleon sets eyes on his beloved he becomes obsessed and their volatile and passionate relationship is seemingly only marred by the fact that she cant bear him a son and heir at 157 minutes long this epic is a marathon  not a sprint maybe dont order the large drink it takes us from napoleons midtwenties up to his death at the age of 51 despite the quarter of a century time frame there appears to be no attempt made to deage pheonix however which sometimes feels jarring kirby gives a magnetic performance as josephine and makes it easy for viewers to see why the general would fall for her unfortunately much of the depiction of their relationship wouldnt be out of place in a carry on film they actually never made carry on napoleon but it feels like it would have been a good fit in the franchise while he never uttered the famous not tonight josephine phrase attributed to him every night josephine would be far more fitting as the saying at it like rabbits springs to mind despite this there is never anything erotic about their encounters and their relationship feels cold rather than passionate this is not the fault of the actors they are saddled with clunky dialogue from writer david scarp pheonix portrays napoleon as somewhat boorish and buffoonish it would seem unlikely that the real napoleon exhibited these traits predominately given his success in both the military and political fields as a result the oscarwinning actors take on the character makes him almost cartoonish i found myself looking at my watch never a good sign until it got to that battle with now elder statesman rupert everett brilliantly cast as the duke of wellington running through the abba song in my head i of course mean waterloo and i defy you not to sing it to yourself when that scene comes on screen i surmised that napoleon did surrender and therefore the movie must be almost over after that the film trundles on for another few minutes but indeed the end is nigh for our anti hero at this point after so much pomp and splendour his onscreen death while in exile on the island of st helena is anticlimactic this should probably come with the disclaimer based on true events asked to defend the historical accuracy of it by the bbc scott asked historians were you there oh you werent there then how do you know but it doesnt really take a historian to appreciate that a lot of libertys have been taken here equally it doesnt take a psychiatrist to know that scott barely scratches the surface of napoleons psyche seemingly there is a fourhour cut that is due to land on apple tv at some point this may fill in some of the gaps but until then this is a gloriously epic tale that appears to be more inspired by its eponymous hero than firmly rooted in fact vanessa kirby and catherine walker in a very brief appearance as marie antoinette at the beginning of the movie are both wonderful unfortunately phoenix completely hams it up turning napoleon into somewhat of a caricature visually spectacular but emotionally unfulfilling  this deserves a watch as a wellcrafted piece of cinema rather than beautifully woven storytelling which is a shame
Dec 8 2023,negative, napoleon a technically impressive epic with grandiose battle sequences featuring gritty set designs and legions of miserablelooking extras is a 158minute roast of the titular historical figure whose 60 battles throughout his two decades in power have been boiled down to six of scott and writer david scarpas choosing the inclusion of waterloo the battle that marked the end of the napoleonic wars was obvious the battle of austerlitz was another jazzy win for the french leader with an incredible sequence that found napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix dunking his foes in the frozen water as they attempted to retreat but the battle that takes up a majority of the films attention is napoleons turbulent relationship with his wife josephine vanessa kirby whose erratic behavior frequent infidelity and inability to provide him an heir was enough drama to be a fulltime job napoleon was no casanova at least not according to phoenixs portrayal and scarpas writing who attribute the emperors rise as a result of the tumultuous postrevolution landscape and good ol fashion rightplace righttime napoleon had some impressive military operations  the movie portrays a few of them  but they are undercut by his spoiled schoolboy obsession with his wife  napoleon opens with the gruesome execution via guillotine of the infamous french queen marie antoinette a seminal event in the french revolution and one that marked an opportunity for napoleon then a scheming military strategist and war general to gain popularity and seize political power he finally crowned himself emperor in 1804 a ceremony portrayed in the film with a reckless tyrant throwing tradition aside and pulling the crown over his own head a symbol of his unyielding control of france on paper it sounds thoughtful and powerful in phoenixs hands the scene is a gag and napoleon is another overindulgent petulant royal  told through letters to josephine napoleon does do an incredible job with setting the scene drawing audiences into the epic battles napoleon fought throughout his career the battlefield sequences are brutal audience members can almost taste the mud that flicks up after the horses the rudimentary quarters for the commanding emperor wreak of bodily stink and misery napoleon thrives under scotts ability to command his own army of camera operators set creators and the thousands of workers to bring the scenes to excruciatingly visceral life  unfortunately the film is far more interested in the dramatic and mercurial relationship between the lead and his much older wife who had been previously widowed with two children than it is in deep diving into the famous historical figures professional triumphs and failures josephine had been a mistress to a number of other newsworthy men and the legally binding document did not stop her from continuing on as an adulteress kirby for her part is wonderfully miserable as the confused temptressempress though the film never truly dives too deep into her background or gives her enough meaningful attention as far as straight biopics go napoleon is a weird one the film like its subject is temperamental and rash scott hones in on the small details in napoleons life that make the historical figure out to be less cunning and calculating than his notoriety and longlasting legacy would imply then in phoenixs hands napoleon turns completely childish rash and imbecilic phoenixs penchant for dry understated performances turns this one into a downright comedy a wes anderson character study trapped in a steven spielberg period drama is this meant to be funny is it funny at all where does napoleon start when phoenix never seems to end this will work for some viewers as an unexpected dramcom it does not work for me instead i found the scope of the films budget the beauty of its set design the intricacy of its costumes and the many details that make it an exceptional output by a firstclass director to be utterly undermined by a nonsensical script that focused on comedy jabs and laconic vignettes to tear down a famous figure who as it happens doesnt need any help being the vertically challenged butt of every joke even 200 years later 
Dec 8 2023,positive, war is hell of course in ridley scotts biopic of napoleon bonaparte but for viewers of this film safe in their cinema seats it is also inescapably magnificent scotts film is the latest of dozens focused on this towering personality some great abel gances innovative passionate and patriotic silent film of 1927 some worthy sergei bondarchuks colossal productions war and peace and waterloo some  less so king vidors war and peace starring herbert lom this venture  which really should be seen on the biggest screen you can get to  comes out close to the top of the list thanks to its thunderous battlefield scenes painterly depictions of key moments in napoleons rise to power and an engrossingly complex central performance from joaquin phoenix scott and screenwriter david scarpa chart napoleons career from the chaotic years of the french revolution we open with the beheading of marie antoinette and the jumpstart to prominence he gave himself masterminding a surprise attack on the british garrison and fleet at toulon
Dec 7 2023,positive, the latest effort from the endlessly prolific filmmaker ridley scott the historic epic dramatizes the fascinating life of french figure napoleon bonaparte tracing his rise and eventual fall  only to be followed by a second rise and fall  and examining his love and perhaps downright obsession with his wife josephine and while it gets an uneven performance by joaquin phoenix  who certainly looks the part at roughly napoleons height at 5foot8 and regularly wearing the bicorne hat ends pointed to the shoulders that is synonymous with him  it is lifted by the level of excellence from costar vanessa kirby as josephine that weve come to expect even at about two and a half hours napoleon plays like the cliff notes version of the french military leaderturnedemperors tale so we hope we do get the promised option of a fourhour cut when the movie lands on apple tv in theaters this week and distributed by sony pictures releasing it primarily is an apple studios production it feels as though weve been escorted too quickly through his career even though the movie spends no time on his childhood introducing us to him only when he is on the precipice of the first of many military victories as napoleon progresses he ascends long live the republic men shout as he is promoted captain to brigadier general and ascends long live the emperor other men shout later at his 1804 coronation with relative ease at least for a while his greatest challenge is josephine with whom he is smitten upon their meeting at a ball when she asks him about his costume and he somewhat awkwardly replies that it is merely his military uniform soon after that she sends him a note asking for the pleasure of his company and after smelling it he rubs it against his neck at their lunch at an outdoor cafe he pulls her chair closer to his but it is a subsequent act of hers that suggests she is the one with the power in this dynamic even after their marriage her rumored behavior will become a great distraction to him as he is trying to achieve glory for france in a faraway land aside from the battle sequences the scenes in which phoenix and kirby share the screen are the films strongest thanks largely to all that kirby the crown pieces of a woman can convey with her eyes and even just a few lines of dialogue theirs is a complex relationship to say the least and the film lacks a certain pop when napoleon isnt sparring  or conducting another activity  with the woman he cant help but adore it doesnt help that none of the films myriad other characters is remotely welldeveloped including napoleons brother lucien matthew needham and paul barras tahar rahim a key figure during the french revolution napoleons meetings with rival heads of state such as édouard philipponnats alexander i the tsar of russia are rather compelling however and phoenix does some of his best work in those scenes at other times the actor  who portrayed the villainous roman emperor commodus in scotts academy awardwinning 2000 film gladiator and whom the director says he wanted for the role after seeing his excellent work in the titular role of 2019s joker  is simply underwhelming no doubt phoenix is going for subtlety but the performance frequently feels flat again though the battle sequences are there to pick up any slack while they appear very modern in their execution they thankfully fall short of feeling overly stylized which could have nudged napoleon into the realm of the action movie the scene from one of the trailers where the french forces fire cannonballs at an enemy napoleon has lured onto a snowcovered semifrozen lake great stuff as a character study napoleon is effective but only so effective at one point he is described by someone who knows him as a man bent on peace at any cost text the viewer is left with just before the closing credits roll suggests napoleon is quite concerned with that cost but we never truly get that impression until then what is the film ultimately saying about him as penned by david scarpa  writer of scotts 2017 film all the money in the world and his upcoming gladiator 2  at least with this theatrical cut its a little murky
Dec 7 2023,positive,despite all the history the battles and the politics this movie stays on track as a personal story this makes napoleon and josephine characters in the story who are easy to relate to as well as being a strong focal point for the film
Dec 7 2023,positive,  you wouldnt expect something so bratty and petulant to come out of the mouth of the legendary french commander and leader but you would expect something so bratty and petulant to come out of the mouth of joaquin phoenix the guy whos playing him in this film   having phoenix that prankish loose cannon his best actor oscar win for playing the joker almost seems like it was prophesied assume the role of bonaparte feels like another one of scotts crazy casting moves adding some chaos to an otherwise stodgy true story lest we forget he brought lady gaga adam driver al pacino and a ridiculouslooking cuckoobananas jared leto another scenerychewing oscar winner who once played batmans archnemesis together a couple years ago for house of gucci and had them overact their heads off while some mightve thought that movie was a campy clusterfuck i was quite amused by how scott refused to rein in these alisters letting them add more absurdity to that insane story of 80sera greed and murder   when you think about it it makes perfect sense for scott to link up again with phoenix who also served as a producer to play bonaparte more than two decades ago scott had phoenix play the powermad regal antagonist in gladiator the onetime rapper went all in on making his character a petty pervy swoleinthechest tyrant  you just couldnt wait for russell crowe to slide his foot way up that emperors ass   phoenix is still a petty pervy swoleinthechest tyrant in napoleon but this time he injects his performance with empathy bonaparte may be a stubborn sonofabitch engaging in bloody battle after bloody battle like a man staging an intense neverending game of chess with his opponents but hes always a dedicated determined warrior fighting even when things clearly arent gonna go his way   it is fascinating watching phoenix play bonaparte like hes a gamer whos constantly on the verge of rage quitting while hes surrounded by actors rupert everett swimming pools ludivine sagnier a prophets tahar rahim who at least are acting like theyre living in the time the movie is set theres practically nothing french or noble about phoenixs bonaparte even when he becomes emperor of france he mostly acts like hes in cosplay  a comiccon king   as with most period piece biopics this is really a love story when dude isnt in battle he has quite the toxic relationship with his wife josephine vanessa kirby napoleon is crazy about this gal even when shes creeping around with another guy while hes abroad napoleon also had side chicks so she feels her creeping is justified phoenix is at his nuttiest whenever hes around kirby and her icyass stare whether theyre engaging in bitter buttonpushing or messy babymaking phoenix really makes bonaparte look like a rabid dog in heat during the love scenes these are two broken people who are clearly made for each other even when they have to divorce because she cant give him a son   but enough about phoenix and his wacky ass napoleon has scott once again making an action epic  one that incidentally his old friend stanley kubrick wanted to make but never got around to  that is equal parts majestic and bombastic as the movie focuses on six major battles that bonaparte fought the battle sequences are vast unpredictable and gory as hell even horses arent safe from the limbshattering madness   its almost like the 85yearold scott continues to make these vivid violent visually voluminous movies because no one else really does them anymore scholars and historians be damned  hes on his david lean shit while most blockbusters look like theyve been cobbled together on somebodys ipad the practical effects sweeping locales captured by veteran cinematographer dariusz wolski and minimal cgivfx that scott works with on napoleon almost feels like a middle finger to this age of ai considering the movie will be shown on imax screens and in 70mm first before it goes to streaming on apple tv who bankrolled the picture he really wants you to get up close and personal with the colossal carnage that goes down whether its on the battlefield or in the bedroom   becoming an orlando weekly supporter for as little as 5 a month allows us to continue offering readers access to our coverage of local news food nightlife events and culture with no paywalls 
Dec 7 2023,negative, napoleon is the latest film from scott to be a miss for this film critic joining both house of gucci and the last duel i missed my screening in midnovember because of lastminute scheduling conflicts in the nations capital while i had an opportunity to attend a fyc screening during thanksgiving weekend my sinuses had other plans in mind while i was told that there would not be any screeners apple tv recently sent a digital screener this week as a result i watched the film on wednesday night going off of how many times i paused the film to see the remaining time i would have been very bored while watching the film in theaters the film follows the rise of napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix and sees this journey through his relationship with wife josephine vanessa kirby napoleons military and political leadership is also on full display during battlefield sequences that are drawing both acclaim and controversy for their depictions ridley scott and joaquin phoenix can defend this film all they want it does not change the fact that they get so much history wrong as such it is not surprising that french historians are slamming the film i mean if a filmmaker were to make a film about one of the american founding fathers and it was filled with inaccuracies people would be calling it out oh wait this happened with a pair of miniseries john adams and sons of liberty you can never go wrong with a documentary in that regard if this is the film that is just over two and a half hours in length it makes you wonder what ridley scott has in store for his fourhour cut will it be in a miniseries format or one lengthy film in which audiences can press pause as they wish personally speaking i would rather skip over whatever the filmmaker is planning if this very inaccurate film is any indication danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Dec 6 2023,positive,napoleon paints a pleasingly knotty often unflattering portrait of its protagonist who is shown as shrewd in battle vulnerable in love and socially ill at ease and is full of quirky often humorous details and dialogue to savour
Dec 5 2023,negative,mr phoenixs napoleon could never have commanded so much as a squadron of the salvation army and though the movie is sprinkled with a few reasonably hearty battle scenes overall its something like mr scotts waterloo
Dec 4 2023,negative, napoleon might deliver some great lead performances but the rest of it is kind of a mess it struggles to tell history in an accurate and intriguing way when it comes to historical biographic films liberties are almost always taken in the case of napoleon it somehow both flies through the events of his life while also dragging on and on when viewers that dont know all the details of his ruling and exiles they should not have to take to the internet to fill in the gaps after the movie wraps however with napoleon this writer is not a history buff but knew some things had to do just that in order to fully understand the life this man lived  this movie covers the majority of napoleons later life including his marriages battles he fought in and death while there is enough action sprinkled throughout the film to try to keep things interesting the visual effects especially when it comes to injuries dont look all that great in particular the early scene with his horse is done very poorly looking fake and awkward  joaquin phoenix does what he can with the script and every so often he delivers a great line but the majority of the dialogue is weak and even laughable at times the same goes for vanessa kirby these two try as hard as they can but the writing and editing fail them they are never allowed to shine in their roles as napoleon and his wife josephine there is ever any real chemistry between the two which causes the story to lose any emotion that audiences are supposed to feel  several times we are shown napoleon napping on the job and we cant help but wonder if that is because he was trying to slug through this film as well and couldnt keep his eyes open even those who are not well versed in history know that napoleon was a tactical military genius something this film rips away from him at times he is depicted as a fool who just happened to get lucky during some battles that isnt at all the case of the true man and it makes it painful to watch it isnt all bad as some of the battles are well shot they are spaced apart enough to try to keep the pacing moving and interest peaked the issue is that all of the stuff in between not only drags but feels as if it is jumping past key parts of the story because of this the story feels all over the place and becomes hard to follow overall napoleon is mediocre at best it is slow and boring while simultaneously moving way too fast the lead actors do what they can with what they are given but the dialogue and editing distract from their performances in the end it is just fine and nothing spectacular or interesting instead of rushing out to theaters to see napoleon find a documentary or history channel special chances are you will not only learn more you will be more entertained napoleon is a spectaclefilled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic french emperor napoleon bonaparte played by oscarwinner joaquin phoenix against a stunning backdrop of largescale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director ridley scott the film captures bonapartes relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive volatile relationship with his one true love josephine showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed tessa smith is a rotten tomatoes tomatometerapproved film and tv critic she is also a freelance writer tessa has been in the entertainment writing business for ten years and is a member of several critics associations including the critics choice association and the greater western new york film critics association
Dec 4 2023,neutral,napoleon thrives when these masterfully crafted battles are coming to life in the most epic way possible the movie feels messy on occasion but there is plenty to admire
Dec 2 2023,positive, somewhere at the nexus of gladiator and barry lyndon resides ridley scotts napoleon in which joaquin phoenix is allowed encouraged to be weird in between stunning action sequences set amidst rugged natural beauty portraying the notorious m bonaparte on his rise from relative obscurity to emperor the actor excels at each life juncture conveying battlefield brilliance and bedroom horniness with equal aplomb  the balance of visceral war imagery with dark quirky humor from screenwriter david scarpa all the money in the world ably captures the multifaceted nature of an immensely talented but intensely flawed individual and leaves viewers in tantalizing wonder at the next amusing anecdotes and details that will arise between iconic battles as his beloved josephine vanessa kirby provides a grounded yet still wild foil for phoenixs occasionally inherent vicelevel quirks yet its scott whos the true collaborator here by surrounding his star with gorgeous scenery and intricate production design and allowing him to indulge his particular dramatic whimsies the director crafts an idiosyncratic biopic that stands tall among its stuffy peers
Dec 2 2023,positive, the defiant scowling figure slouching on the french throne on the flyers that advertise ridley scotts latest epic need not feel too defensive about the latest film made about him as a biopic it barely scratches the surface and leaves so many questions about napoleon unanswered the man who has inspired a couple of hundred films and hundreds of thousands of books is still an enigma as a historical spectacle however napoleon is one helluva of a brilliant ride and joaquin phoenix an interesting casting choice as the famous emperor mocked as a man without manners was he really so uncouth maybe not as stylish as the french would have liked but he was the son of minor italian nobility and attended military academy in paris if he always spoke with a corsican accent it didnt seem to diminish his skill at rallying the french troops it is incredible to think that the postrevolutionary first consul who became emperor faced no less than seven coalitions of european forces as they tried to topple the corsican upstart from the french throne ultimately he did meet his waterloo and his life ended on a small island just like it had begun this movie has to be seen on the big screen this is topflight immersive cinema made with a wonderful eye for what looks good and with great flair for creating experiential entertainment scott and his cinematographer dariusz wolski a frequent collaborator have created a dazzling kinetic cinema experience the veteran director has of course an enviable filmography of influential genre movies including alien blade runner thelma  louise and gladiator so its a pity that the writing here lacks insight as an exploration of a key historical figure the screenplay by david scarpa now working with scott on gladiator ii is written for the contemporary ear and thats okay but it doesnt delve much into the family background of this fascinating historical figure nor place his remarkable legacy within the context of modern european history after the cries of battle dim this is something worth googling as portrayed here napoleon bonapart is both soldier and passionate lover a military man a brilliant strategist and tactician who longed for and loved his lively wife the fawneyed josephine vanessa kirby the occasional voiceover based on letters they wrote to each other while he was away on campaigns reveal the depth of their feelings for each other yet a cursory glance at modern history reveals his awesome legacy a legal code underpinned by principles of fraternity liberty and equality under the law that was carried across europe and remains there to this day a key role in the end of the holy roman empire and in the rise of the middle classes and meritocracy how did napoleon achieve this a critical dimension to his story but it is not so easy to translate to screen the action opens on napoleon a gunnery officer in the army during the french revolution witnessing the death by guillotine of queen marie antoinette in fact he was not present at that event in 1793 but poetic licence allows us to see that he doesnt cheer like the rest of the bloodthirsty mob it signals something else is going on for him the bravura staging of napoleons first significant military victory a few months later that year with the recapture of the port city and naval stronghold of toulon augurs well there are many beautifully staged battle sequences to come as the film sticks with the military side of things phoenixs strangulated voice and surly manner are a good match for his controversial character and kirby is a wonderful josephine from timetotime a voiceover reveals the contents of their private letters and the film concludes with some odd suggestions that the pair were a codependent power couple now thats an angle surely worthy of another film ive a sneaking suspicion that including the famous victory led by wellington rupert everett gave the filmmaker a certain satisfaction in a totally invented scene wellington and napoleon who never met express a shared appreciation for things english gentle light rolling hills and substantial breakfasts its a bit bizarre but also a welcome downtoearth note on which to end the story of a man who lived enough lives for ten men
Dec 2 2023,neutral, scott has now made a version of napoleon and its apparent that if kubrick had any special advice on the topic he never gave it to scott scott has been and still could be a great filmmaker see alien blade runner and thelma and louise but his new twoandahalfhour epic now playing in san francisco is as rudimentary and as passionless as cliffsnotes its akin to a bored professor teaching from a droning study guide to begin with there are too many secondary or supporting characters that pop up and then disappear like a game of whacamole most are briefly introduced and then vanish for a while only to reemerge again maybe a half hour or 45 minutes later frankly for anyone who is not a napoleon scholar its difficult to keep track of all the names and dates and places especially as events leap forward years at a time its a memory card game with little chance of winning the movie begins in 1793  thankfully avoiding napoleons childhood  as marie antoinette catherine walker goes to the guillotine as she walks to her death an angry crowd throws food which sticks in her voluminous curly hair then head hair and food must be maneuvered into the hollow of the guillotine for the fatal chop this weirdly is the movies most inspired sequence and the only time scott seems to be thinking cinematically the rest of the film ticks off check boxes napoleon joaquin phoenix rises through the ranks of the french military goes to war becomes emperor gains allies loses allies regains allies is eventually defeated at waterloo and finally is exiled on the island of saint helena where he died in 1821 many viewers will pay to see the many battlefield sequences with their mud blood horses flags spy glasses swords rifles lances and cannons  the cannonballs here explode like miniature atomic bombs  but the scenes blur together at the films center we have phoenix who most can agree is a fine actor phoenix does fine things with napoleon showing his lust for power his selfassurance as well as his baser emotions its a wellrounded performance even incorporating some moments of humor  lets hope the line destiny led me to this lamb chop becomes a meme  but not necessarily among phoenixs deepest or most affecting work where napoleon comes briefly alive is in the casting and performance of vanessa kirby  herself a recent oscar nominee for pieces of a woman  as napoleons wife josephine this character might have been little more than window dressing  but kirby brings flash and fire to the role easily the equal of phoenix their scenes together are the only ones that have any spark perhaps because the performers each feed off of the energy of their sparring partners its a shame that napoleon is such drudgery in past decades when studios learned that biographies are catnip for oscars it has become clear that the best ones  bennett millers capote or steven spielbergs lincoln for example  focus on a single important event in the subjects life the ones that try to cram an entire life into the length of a movie tend to end up like napoleon with scene after scene describing to us what happened without ever getting into the poetry of it and without time for nuance ironically if scotts film could have gone on longer he might have ended up with something truly magnificent and spectacular  such as abel gances silentera napoleon released in 1927 and restored to a fiveandahalfhour running time in 2012 that movie was so inventive and intoxicating that it has endured for nearly a century  conversely the most interesting thing about scotts napoleon is the tidbit that apparently the emperor had a talent for falling asleep while standing or sitting up
Dec 2 2023,positive,is it a gladiator absolutely not but you know its hard to be another gladiator
Dec 2 2023,positive,that brings us to the battle sequences they are outofcontrol great
Dec 2 2023,positive,i found it impressive and kind of startling at times but i was not emotionally moved
Dec 1 2023,positive, french emperor napoleon bonaparte is one of the more fascinating historical figures around so it comes as no surprise that he is once again depicted in film with napoleon  the latest from director ridley scott with scotts steady direction and some strong work from joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby its a film that works well enough even if the film doesnt really tell you anything about the emperor that you didnt already know what napoleon lacks in newfound insight it makes up for with some well crafted sequences and phoenix and kirbys dynamic chemistry napoleon takes a rather simplistic approach following the rise and fall of bonaparte  his addiction to power and how that addiction ultimately led to his downfall david scarpas screenplay also takes time to step away from the battlefield to document the volatile relationship between napoleon and the love of his life josephine kirby their relationship would make social media blush a complex web of oneupmanship where it is hard to tell who is really in charge between those two scott uses the relationship to create some surprisingly humorous moments with phoenix portraying napoleon with this horndog aloofness that only accentuates that dark humor phoenix plays the emperor in a manner where you can always see the wheels turning constantly planning his next conquest on and off the battlefield kirby continues her string of strong work making josephine both a scheming temptress and as someone who truly loved napoleon in her own strange way the relationship is the heart and soul of napoleon but the film provides a little more scott has always been a director capable of staging grand action sequences that strength is on display with several set pieces on the battlefield that is best seen on the biggest screens possible the action is so good that the film probably could have used a little better balance of the story  and perhaps shaved a little time off the nearly three hour length ultimately the flaws of napoleon are fitting of its subject matter  an experience that is satisfying even if it happens to be a little messy and uneven
Dec 1 2023,negative, robert horton is a scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic this series of critics notes is chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connect them to the riches of scarecrows collection napoleon begins in 1793 its title character a young corsican captain and ends with his death in 1821 in other words 86yearold ridley scott has been a field general much longer than bonaparte ever was there must be some strong identification between movie directors and napoleon the big nappy project stanley kubrick worked on makes you wonder whether kubrick mightve abandoned it for being a little too on the nose but if scott feels a kinship for his central character in this film he hides it rather well joaquin phoenixs napoleon is easily the most opaque figure onscreen hes anxious his eyes darting nervously before leading a bold move at the siege of toulon hes impetuous grabbing the crown at his imperial coronation hes laughably banal greeting the freshlydefeated austrian king by blurting out its so nice to finally meet you like a matron at a church social most of all he is a maladroit lover whether wooing josephine vanessa kirby by staring intently at her across a crowded room or boffing away in primal fashion in the bedchamber between these moments phoenix waddles around mumbling his way through the part much more than mumblegoldstandard brando did in desiree its absolutely fine to have a modern napoleon and the screenplay credited to david scarpa seems set up to give us an antihero  and yet this exhaustedlooking fellow in the funny hat wanders through history more hapless than worldbeating monster  the battle scenes feature some startling images as one expects from this director scott knows how to commandeer his forces so that we get a breathtaking idea of how the armies at austerlitz come together and why napoleons strategy was so brilliant a few politicalintrigue scenes serve to connect the high points but this movie is at its most charged when napoleon and josephine are involved in some kind of congress and this is where you see what the movie might have been as a critic im not big on instructive movie reviews where the critic knows how all this could have been better if only the filmmakers had done this and that but indulge me for a moment because the movies interest in the private life of bonaparte cries out for an approach that proposes that the great man a brilliant military tactician and inspirational battle leader was clumsy with his wife though he loved her fanatically if we saw napoleons vigor surely it would sharpen the difference between the films two realms and the romance would become more poignant as a curious sort of pushpull dance in which europes conqueror could only ever be partly successful that approach would at least offer a contrast a useful central irony for a dynamic film theres a splendid moment when the future lovers out on a proper date are sitting at a table and napoleon all but shoves josephines chair closer to his ownthe military strategist arranging the field of play but phoenixs napoleon though he may occasionally raise his sword and charge into the breach is a shuffler as bumbling on the battlefield as he is in the boudoir now this is an approach and there are monty pythonesque satirical touches the final shot included that hint at a wilder and more critical slant on the subject an afterword in which the deaths attributable to napoleon are listed has more bite than what has come before so what is this movie meant to be it moves at gratifying speed but looks rushed and downright dingy at timesan especially disappointing point because if ridley scott is hardly given to introspection he is nimble at making surfaces shine if scott were given to introspection you might wonder whether napoleon is meant to comment on the facile nature of the directors past work its easy manipulations and violence i doubt it but the film does look tired when it erupts with dazzlingly weird momentssuch as josephine breaking into laughter when she reads her divorce statement to the world an act dictated by her inability to bring her husband an heirthis movie comes alive unlike his protagonist scott seems more excited by foregrounding the mystery of love than crushing enemy armies
Dec 1 2023,positive, lisa johnson mandells napoleon review says that director ridley scott has reached his apex with this intriguing examination of one of the most enigmatic and outrageous leaders of the 1700s joaquin phoenix is peculiarly perfect in the lead ill admit i was a bit dubious about the casting of joaquin phoenix as the iconic french military icon mostly because he was reported be going with his natural american accenthe couldnt be bothered to get an accent coach but with most of the cast playing germans french and russians using standard midatlantic accents authenticity was clearly not the goal surprisingly the film doesnt suffer from that napoleon stands alone in history and phoenixs interpretation of him stands alone in film what napoleon achieved in france rising from relative corsican obscurity to become an allpowerful commander and emperor of france then facing exile on a barren island only to escape and return to power again is a quite the mercurial feat punctuate that with his outrageously volatile relationship with joséphine played masterfully by vanessa kirby and you have an epic tale to tell if the editing leaves audiences a bit confounded its understandabletheres just so much juicy material to pack into one film i would suggest viewers read up on napoleon even if it only involves skimming the wikipedia notes before settling in for this riveting cinematic eventit will decrease your confusion and increase your awareness of the utter havoc one audacious man can wreak on the world scott has always been both revered and skewered for his graphic and unforgettable battle scenes and napoleon could be the apex of them all more than gore although make no mistake theres plenty of that they rivet attention with insights into military strategy and personal dynamics giving them unique and fascinating dimension but at the core of napoleon is his manic fascination with his lover wife and ex josephine kirby is sublimely layered while phoenix is creepily unhinged its a portrayal of a relationship unlike any youve ever seen lisa johnson mandells napoleon review says that director ridley scott has reached his apex with this intriguing examination of one of the most enigmatic and outrageous leaders of the 1700s joaquin phoenix is peculiarly perfect in the lead products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation

Dec 1 2023,positive,a huge display of pageantry on the battlefield and human squalor in the bedroom magnificent to look at vanessa kirby shines as the manipulative josephine joaquin phoenix mumbles and murmurs as the lead
Dec 1 2023,negative, joaquin phoenix stars as the eponymous ruler of france tracing his career from an eager corsican officer during the french revolution to his death in exile in 1821 scotts film traces his rise to power and his myriad military victories along with his tumultuous relationship with his beloved wife josephine vanessa kirby whom he divorced in 1810 due to her inability to conceive though he remained devoted to her for the rest of his life  the film certainly hits the highlights of napoleons career but at a certain point it just feels like its lurching from battle to battle without providing much connective tissues to provide much human interest or historical context for what were seeing phoenixs napoleon is as petulant and needy off the battlefield as he is brilliant on it which is a great gag and a nice change of pace for the biopic of the great man tropes that the film certainly could have fallen into hes a man who just couldnt stop fighting whose hubris becomes his ultimate undoing but we never quite escape the feeling that were watching a live action rendering of the wikipedia article on napoleon rather than a fully fleshed out film  those who go in knowing very little about napoleon bonaparte are unlikely to emerge from napoleon feeling as if they know more about him than when they went in it has some tremendous set pieces the icy battle of austerlitz is a truly breathtaking spectacle and phoenix is tremendous in the title role but it nevertheless feels truncated even at more than two and a half hours long scott reportedly has a 4 hour directors cut planned for release exclusively on appletv and while the films runtime already feels bloated due it to its unwieldy pacing perhaps a longer cut is whats needed to really let this story breathe as it stands its a deeply flawed work filled with flashes of brilliance surrounded by poorly paced and half baked connective tissue that never really allows its stronger impulses to blossom one hopes that a directors cut will bring a less hackneyed vision to the screen in 2024 
Dec 1 2023,negative, the latest historical epic from director ridley scott proves  to be one of his worst films with napoleon featuring an uneasy blend of  exciting battle scenes alongside dry political drama and cold chemistry between  leads joaquin phoenix and vanessa kirby  a biopic of legendary 18th century french  emperor and military commander napoleon bonaparte the simply titled napoleon lacks the passion and intrigue that a movie about such a notorious historical  figure should have  napoleon begins with the title character played  by joaquin phoenix witnessing the execution of marie antoinette catherine  walker during the french revolution the aspiring napoleon makes a name for  himself by leading the siege of toulun against royalist rebels and would continue  his military contests in fierce battles abroad political instability in france  results in the ever ambitious and popular napoleon to become emperor napoleons  relationship with his wife josephine vanessa kirby meanwhile becomes  turbulent when she is unable to produce an heir to the throne  scripted by david scarpa the last duel napoleon plods along as a greatest hits package of the little emperors rise and  fall scott would have benefited in having the extra time to flesh out his characters  and their motives especially regarding the subplots involving complex political  matters the inconsistent use of accents throughout napoleon furthermore  robs the film of a geographical and cultural identity even more curious are the dull performances from the  films cast especially joaquin phoenix who never seemed to inhabit the skin  of napoleon bonapart with the oscar winners performance closer in feel to a cosplay  version of the iconic historical figure amongst all the period setting and battle sequences   which are spectacular in design and execution  it is the romance between  napoleon and josephine which scott deemed to be the soul of napoleon unfortunately  napoleon it is a film that lacks spirit 
Dec 1 2023,neutral, ridley scotts napoleon bonaparte is petulant overconfident he likes to make animal noises and is often ill at ease he is deeply infatuated with his wife he can fall asleep at crucial moments his ambitions are boundless his limitations often comical hes very into cannons he combines the extraordinary and the extremely ordinary in disconcerting ways scott and screenwriter david scarpa all the money in the world have taken the long view following their subject over the course of almost thirty years the film begins with the execution of marie antoinette and ends with napoleon in exile in st helena toppling sideways off a chair almost inevitably what they have come up with feels abridged and truncated with blinkandyoullmissit moments from the historical record fleeting incidents of exposition grand gestures and moments of splendour battles shown in intense expansive detail continue reading for only 10 per month subscribe and gain full access to australian book review already a subscriber sign in  if you need assistance feel free to contact us if you have forgotten your sign in details or if you receive an error message when trying to submit your comment please email your comment and the name of the article to which it relates to abr comments we will review your comment and subject to approval we will post it under your name
Dec 1 2023,negative, almost 100 years ago abel gance made a movie about napoleon bonaparte that was more than 100 years after the french conquerors death but bonaparte still cast so big a shadow that gance felt he had to break film aesthetics to do his subject justice in his 1927 epic napoleon he pioneered so many cinematic techniques that it astonished the most innovative french new wave filmmakers decades later its a lot to ask an 85yearold filmmaker to do something similar when he makes his own movie about the legendary conqueror what i dont think is too much is for that director to create something insightful that makes us see its subject in a new light or at least engages our attention after all 81yearold martin scorsese succeeded on both counts with killers of the flower moon despite some creative bursts this is where ridley scott and his movie fail lets start with what works here napoleon offers two excellent combat sequences one during the battle of toulon and the other during the battle of austerlitz the latter shows just what made napoleon joaquin phoenix a military genius as the general directs his forces to deceive his austrian and russian enemies into thinking theyve ambushed the french camp and then chase them across a frozen lake this culminates in a cool shot of french cannons punching holes in the ice and consigning thousands of soldiers and horses to death in the frigid waters napoleons first attempt to seize power is treated as bloody farce with the politicians giving him and brother lucien matthew needham a serious beating and chasing them out of the assembly building before the bonapartes return with armed soldiers scott directed phoenix to one of his greatest performances in gladiator  to this day i find uses in my daily life for the line it vexes me im terribly vexed yet im roundly underwhelmed by phoenixs performance here more than i ever have been by his acting his napoleon is a charmless lump who has cgi to make him look shorter the film is supposed to rest on the relationship between him and joséphine de beauharnais vanessa kirby the aristocrat he marries for political purposes david scarpas script makes some vague indications that she has social skills that he lacks but the movie doesnt follow through on this plot the marriage has about as much passion as the joyless sex that napoleon and joséphine have in a fruitless attempt to produce an heir the film implies that napoleon loses the battle of waterloo because hes mourning her death from pneumonia and it gives no emotional weight to the story i prefer the explanation that he lost waterloo because his terrible hemorrhoids kept him from mounting his horse and surveying the battlefield its surely not encouraging that pablo larraíns el conde  a chilean blackandwhite vampire movie that came out two months ago  stages the execution of marie antoinette more convincingly the movies 157 minutes speed by all the highlights of napoleons rise and fall without stopping to extract any deeper meaning from them scott loses the thread of the story detailing napoleons dealings with britain austria russia and his friends enemies and frenemies within france the story of this corsican gunnery sergeant a quintessential outsider who brought europes kings to their knees probably has something to tell us about todays political landscape too bad napoleon doesnt find it
Dec 1 2023,negative, sixteen years later eli roth has finally delivered the actual film thanksgiving and its a holiday horror treat christmas and halloween have a slew of horror films set on their holidays but thanksgiving only has roths film and a 3500 indie project shot in less than two weeks called thankskilling in that film the killer is a homicidal axewelding turkey with its memorable line gobble gobble motherfker a line that was thought of before the script was even written thankskilling was reportedly shot in 2006 a year before roths faux trailer debuted i just needed to give thankskilling a little shoutout thanksgiving is the third fake grindhouse trailer to get a movie spinoff the others being robert rodriguezs machete and jason eiseners hobo with a shotgun  all three have made the transition to the big screen with inspired success in roths case he carefully recreates all the key moments in the trailer from the mascot turkey getting decapitated in the thanksgiving parade to the cheerleader on the trampoline although i did prefer the trailer version of her demise but while the events of the trailer are faithfully adhered to roth trades in the gritty 80s grindhouse visual style for something much slicker and more modern which does make me a little sad  but the brilliant addition roth brings to the feature film is the backstory to the killing spree he opens in plymouth massachusetts with a thanksgiving meal interrupted by the need to kickoff a black friday sale early at the local department store an increasingly unruly horde pushes at a barricade held back by just a pair of overwhelmed security guards the scene quickly turns gruesome as greedy shoppers are incited to riot when they see the daughter of the stores owner and her high school friends getting early access  the genius of the opening rampage is that there are no monsters or serial killers just a mob of ordinary folks hoppedup on the rabid consumerism of black friday and willing to trample and kill each other over the possibility of getting a waffle iron for anyone who has watched real scenes of black friday mobs you know the horror is real and well worth skewering with horrific humor but a year later there is a serial killer in town and hes out to get revenge on those he deems guilty of causing the black friday mayhem he chooses to wear the mask of local historical icon john carver the first mayor of the plymouth colony as roth has noted in interviews when history hands you a name like that you have to use it for your slasher film i have to confess that i have not been a fan of anything roth has done since his 2005 film hostel so i was gleefully surprised by thanksgiving he is a different director and it is a refreshing revelation he finds a vigor and satiric bite thats been missing from his work for a long time and thats something to be grateful for  he designs clever holidayinspired kills and serves up a horror comedy to delight genre fans but be aware theres a lot of gore and the deaths are mostly punchlines rather than anything meant to elicit real emotion i find this to be perfect holiday cheer but i know its not for everyone grindhouse proves to be a gift that just keeps giving now if we can just a a movie from edgar wrights fake trailer for dont i will truly feel thankful ridley scott has toyed with history before in 1492 conquest of paradise he tackled a sort of christopher columbus bio and history plays a significant role in his films the last duel and kingdom of heaven but while scott might have a visual flair for these period stories he seems less able to connect us emotionally to his characters or narratives based on scotts recent public dismissal of french critics the director seems to be channeling a bit of his main characters arrogance in fact hes been channeling that vibe for awhile as his recent string of films particularly the last duel and house of gucci have deservedly drawn criticism but scott still riding on some deserved laurels for his earlier work has zero tolerance for complaints about his films  his napoleon actually starts off on a strong note it opens with napoleon played with scowling gloom by joaquin phoenix displaying his strategic acumen to turn a siege to the advantage of the french and displaying scotts ability to stage action the other highlight of the film is a strikingly shot battle on ice that captures the brutality of war but in a visually stylish manner but as the film progresses through its nearly threehour run time it never finds a balance between the epic and the intimate and i walked away feeling like i have not gained any insights into napoleon or what made him tick and the film tries to cram so much history and battle into the film that it all becomes a blur granted this period of french history is packed with betrayals coups political upheaval and more so it is a genuine challenge as a teenager i read a fascinating biography of napoleon by vincent cronin that attempted to capture his complexity it may have been a somewhat romanticized portrait but it was compelling and provided fascinating insights and speculation into what might have driven napoleon to his spectacular rise and then led to his equally spectacular fall i had also heard rumors of a possible napoleon film with al pacino and that has always stuck in my memory as dream casting so perhaps i came to scotts film with expectations that he could never meet but scott and phoenix gave us a napoleon that was almost a caricature in depicting his petulance and making height jokes and i am not sure whats up with phoenix as well as leonardo dicaprio see his performance in killer of the flower moon with their severely downturned mouths and almost monolithically dour demeanors in napoleon scott even gives us scowling faceoff between phoenixs napoleon and rupert everetts duke of wellington  scotts recent fondness for casting very american actors such as phoenix and in the last duel matt damon ben affleck and adam driver as very european characters seems problematic phoenix fares moderately better than the trio in the last duel but none of them seem wellsuited to their roles in phoenixs case i just could never believe him as a commander of vast armies and was never convinced of the love between him and the empress josephine ian holm has played napoleon in a trio of very different projects hes a footnote in terry gilliams timehopping time bandits he is defined by the women in his life in a british series napoleon and love and he is both napoleon and his double in the wonderful the emperors new clothes i would take any one of those performances as more enlightening and enjoyable to watch than phoenixs  one of the greatest films never made was stanley kubricks planned napoleon biopic kubricks intensely detailed research in preparation for the film is chronicled in the book stanley kubricks napoleon which i highly recommend checking out if you can find a copy steven spielberg is trying to recreate something based on kubricks plans im not sure hes the right person for the job but i would be curious to see what comes of it i also recommend abel gances silent film napoleon but i cant recommend scotts napoleon despite occasional visual spectacle it fails as history and as biography and even as just an entertaining piece of cinema
Dec 1 2023,negative, napoleon bonaparte is a monumental historical figure it only makes sense that a biopic of his life on screen  directed by none other than ridley scott  should be equally monumental well in theory the film starring joaquin phoenix now out in uae cinemas ticks many of the conventional boxes expected of an epic historical hollywood blockbuster theres outstanding costumes beautiful cinematography bold imagery and a captivating score who was napoleon well it depends what version of history youre following from a powerhungry political animal to a patriotic genius a pillaging tyrant or an averagelooking man with a penetrating gaze who made up for his alleged short stature with a commanding presence above all else napoleon was complex if not perplexing phoenix plays napoleon  the general first consul and then emperor of france  as a grumpy irritable man prone to nonsensical and erratic outbursts even his subtle facets of vulnerability  the way he covers his ears when cannons burst his panicked breathing during the first of many battles feel like a forced and lazy attempt to humanise napoleon scowling and yet expressionless temperamental for show with a sense of humour that doesnt land it feels as though phoenix may have taken cues on how to play the character not from historical accounts but from the behaviour of rapper kanye west also phoenixs napoleon may be the only time we hear the figure speak with an american accent not only does this crucial detail pull viewers out of the story its also comical in all the wrong ways no one should depend on a hollywood film for historical accuracy they exist to entertain or at least inspire curiosity into the past and in this regard one can forgive many things bad costumes questionable special effects dubious performances inaccuracies in histories or bad accents in small doses dont ruin a film for me but one element that is hard to fathom is a writer or directors failure to keep their audience engaged in the end its all about storytelling its unfair in many ways to portray the very full life of a towering figure like napoleon in one film its mainly unfair to the audience  two hours and 38 minutes is a long time to stare at phoenixs begrudged face as he attempts to save his marriage or at least make it work while conquering europe this was also the films main issue is this the story of napoleons military life or is the main plot his tumultuous and toxic relationship with his wife josephine the film does a poor job at cohesively fusing napoleons personal and political lives which all versions of history tell us bled into each other they are two simultaneous storylines that meet at random touchpoints only to veer off into another battle all of which are indistinguishable from one another at some point it is a frustrating experience attempting to understand this portrait of napoleon the tagline of the poster for the film reads he came from nothing he conquered everything but did he really come from nothing napoleon was born into an aristocratic family and descended from italian nobility one would assume the film would show us this version of nothing but it does not there are flashes of his mother and brother with no conclusions to their presence in his story scott depicts an ambitious character without a tangible source for his motivation and his rise to power without a clear direction in how he achieved this while the film attempts to present an analysis of the male ego this napoleon is at best a caricature of a complex man with an american accent and a sour expression perhaps the worst thing about the film is how it leaves the audience with the same question it has from the start  who exactly was napoleon bonaparte
Dec 1 2023,neutral, director ridley scott did not come to praise napoleon bonaparte with his new film napoleon  he came to bury the french emperor under a muddled script dimly lit scenes overwhelming battle sequences and one of the most offtarget performances by joaquin phoenix in the oscarwinners career as scott has done with so many movies the film is filled with lush and large scenes whether it be the coronation of bonaparte or his battlefield defeat at waterloo these scenes show the grandeur and ugliness of bonapartes life if the film was only being judged on a cinematic scale it would be a massive success the problem is writer david scarpa the day the earth stood still fails to find his writing north star the story clumsily goes from an unorthodox love story to a muddled political drama neither storyline is good enough to make up for the mistakes of the other one napoleon charts the rise of bonaparte phoenix from the beheading of marie antonette to his final exile history shows that while bonaparte made some major military mistakes he was either lucky enough or wise enough to rise to the throne scotts decision  and the way phoenix plays bonaparte  is to make him more like a bratty toddler than a man who rose to extreme power he becomes stubborn when all others are questioning his decisions when it comes to romance it is awkward courting phoenix has always shown a great knack for there being a flicker of sanity or insanity behind his eyes how that goes depends on the character there is nothing behind his eyes as bonaparte what should have been a broody power is more like a tantrum prequel even when he is supposed to show lust for josephine vanessa kirby its as if he was playing the act of passion as described by a 3yearold child even when these two historical lovers engage in sex bonaparte looks like a cartoon character flailing away the disappointment is doubled as kirby is wasted most of her scenes have her staring off into the distance with bonaparte such a weak character a strong performance by kirby would have helped create a little emotional spark both phoenix and kirby also suffer from the projectile vomiting way scarpa wrote the script it is as if he consumed all the historical knowledge of bonaparte and then threw together only the chunkiest of pieces there are historical and personal moments that happen without any explanation because of the rush to get to the big events the film has a running time of more than twoandahalf hours even that is not enough to look at both the career and personal life of bonaparte scott should have picked one specific area and focused all energy into using the allotted time to tell the best story instead the time is filled with snippets one example is the annulment of the marriage because josephine cannot provide bonaparte with an heir during the reading of their divorce decrees kirby plays the scene with an occasional laugh and smirk there was nothing to set up why this reaction happened scenes before the moment would suggest a more sad or angry approach with the story having so little structure and the main performance coming up short scott had to bank on the major battle scenes to carry the day whether practical or computer generated the fighting is impressive in scale the problem is that scott opted for very natural lighting throughout the movie this makes for some dramatic scenes at a party or in the bedroom it doesnt help on the battlefield that features large groups of uniformed men charging into each other it is very difficult to tell which side is getting the biggest end of the carnage scott has shown with blade runner gladiator and alien that he is one of the most talented directors working today his fingerprints are all over napoleon but in this instance the film was an example of his cinematic reach exceeding his grasp to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 1 2023,positive, the first question francophiles will ask is why are a british director of oscarwinning epics ridley scott gladiator and an american character actor joaquin phoenix joker collaborating on a biowar film about a legendary diminutive 56 french leader possibly because the films name alone sells itself and history buffs will be curious scotts rep for stylistic overblown extravaganzas is another calling card there will be bloodand war and the prospect of watching quirky phoenix analyze the leader and put his spin on the character is another draw napoleon bonaparte was born on the island of corsica on august 15th 1769 a descendant of italian nobility an outsider to the french monarchy he aggressively championed the french revolution in 1789 rising from the military ranks he ruled france from 1799 to 1804 as first consul then as its first emperor from 1804 to 1814 bonaparte was heralded as a battlehungry military strategist who fought wars all over europe he and his troops invaded and conquered iberia spain italy and forced austria prussia and russia to coalesce and quake under french domination basically he made most of continental europe his captive  aside from the warrior life the conqueror had a wife named joséphine vanessa kirby pieces of a woman who was married before they met she was sexy and he was smitten from the start during one of their first meetings they sat across from each other in a parlor she suggestively opened her legs and purred if you look down youll see a surprise once you see it you will always want it he did they tied the knot she became an empress but could never bear children and give him an heir it frayed their relationship the script by david scarpa a screenwriter with a sparse resume is a cliff notes approach to napoleons achievements its peppered with rivals colleagues and friends that passed through the leaders life its like the writer aimed for a cross between a pbs historical drama a sweeping doctor zhivagotype war movie and a backstairs at the palace soap opera one where the empress beds a young man which publicly humiliates her husband the hodgepodge of subplots mixes but not well scenes where napoleon and josephine make love dont add an erotic touch its like watching a mutt and the winner of the best in show at the westminster kennel dog club show mating and the dialogue isnt always a big help either napoleon i found the crown of france in the gutter i picked it up with my sword and placed it on my head really  scott seems miffed at finding ways to make the characters threedimensional partial blame goes to scarpas thin writing which doesnt match the gravitas intelligence and imagination of david franzoni john logan and william nicholson the oscarnominated screenwriters of scotts academy awardwinning gladiator that film made the roman general maximus larger than life and no ones fool it turned an esoteric historical figure into an icon this one turns an icon into an esoteric and eccentric wart scott is notorious for placing style over substance story and characters again his towering production elements shroud the basics for all the money he was paid for this role estimated 10m why didnt phoenix attempt a french accent yes the movie is in english and this isnt a french production but fake it make the audience believe in the littlest way that this man is from corsica and not the usa the same can be said for the other cast members who play french military and political leaders who dont feign anything gallic  kirby is english doesnt hide her home accent but she deserves a pass shes the one actor in the entire film who is consistently mesmerizing regardless she works the lighting with her poses her softness as she speaks is so beguiling her joséphine is the temptress that turned a world leader into a clown embarrassing him greatly but not enough for him to completely fall out of love  abubakar salim as general dumas the french armys first fourstar general edouard philipponnat as tsar alexander the emperor of russia during the napoleonic wars and youssef kerkour as french military commander general davout also excel ian mcniece as king louis xviii whom napoleon displaced for 100 days in 1815 and rupert everett as british field marshall arthur wellesley the duke of wellington napoleons rival who ended 23 years of french domination in europe at the notorious battle of waterloo are excellent too  napoleon bonapartes excursions last for 2h 38m editors sam restivo and claire simpson which by killers of the flower moon standards 3h 26m makes it short and sweet if film fans trek to their local cinema the meticulously staged war sequences played like chess games will keep them intrigued especially in imax theaters where the horrors will be a gruesome spectacle and views of the sphinx will amaze the film may play well one day on streaming services too but some of the movies majesty will be lost  napoleon was a man who nearly conquered the world a husband who lost his dignity an emperorwarrior who died in exile surely there was a better way to tell his story a better way to make a petite man a giant 
Dec 1 2023,positive, ridley scott the filmmaker behind napoleon is a european of course the veteran producerdirector a native of south shields in the tyne and wear district of northeast england is as english as it is possible to be but for all that the indefatigable 85yearold scott has something in common with all the celts saxons angles jutes picts vikings normans and innumerable other ethnic groups who made england and the presentday united kingdom their hometheyre all at least nominally european numerous wars have been fought over the issue  thats where napoleon comes in scotts 56th directorial effort tells the story of another european a 19thcentury corsican french warriormonarch whose name still resonates in world history two centuries later for better or worse scotts napoleon is a rousing redblooded experience an oldfashionedand emotionally relatively uncomplicatedhistorical epic outfitted with modern production techniques and filled to overflowing with battles intrigues and the scandalous relationship between former artillery officer napoleon bonaparte joaquin phoenix and his restless wife joséphine vanessa kirby  in scotts film with a screenplay by frequent collaborator david scarpa all the money in the world the man in the high castle napoleon works his way up from an army captain in league with the french revolution luridly depicted in the films opening scene to the rank of brigadier generaland eventually emperor of francethanks to his seemingly unquenchable thirst for bloody warfare toulon the corridors of paris during the reign of terror egypt italy the austrian empire russianapoleon and his troops subjugate the population everywhere they march up until that nasty business in waterloo cgi soldiers heads and horses necks explode under mortar fire and regimes go up in flames meanwhile the conqueror falls in love with joséphine de beauharnais kirby the young widow of a guillotined aristocrat shes a postrevolutionary party girl not entirely smitten by the coarse corsican and his batteringram style of sexual intercourse but willing to overlook some matters while living in some of the continents most lavish houses director scott digs down deep into his bag of extravagant european settings here even in the wake of house of gucci all the money in the world hannibal and the duellists he apparently hasnt yet exhausted the supply despite centuries of destruction europe is still remarkably well equipped with fancy real estate  phoenix may not be every moviegoers first choice for the title role especially for those who winced at his performance as the cruel roman emperor commodus in gladiator and yet the actor who starred in joker and two lovers arguably deserves the role of a violent megalomaniac so all is forgiven never mind that a few of his line readings are stiff and that napoleons childish friskiness in one or two scenes seems odd lets just say that phoenix cuts a fine figure in the saddle waving a saber and let it go at that kirbys impersonation of joséphine is another matter entirely from the very first glimpse of her as the merry widow at a cocktail party shes a beguiling combination of the bewildered coquette and the poule de luxe every time darusz wolskis camera swings her way joséphine looks as authentic in her empirewaist gowns as phoenix does in his cockadebedecked uniforms kudos likewise to paul rhys as diplomat charles maurice de talleyrand and edouard philipponat as alexander tsar of russia a pair of dealmakers in the age of enlightenment volumes have been written about scott and the lasting effect his visual sense has had on contemporary bigscreen entertainment napoleon belongs in the front rank of his creations alongside such landmarks as blade runner alien and black hawk down for its thrilling battle scenes its ironic characterizations of the revolutionaries who became their own special brand of aristocracy and for the essential europeanness of the project itself this glittering sweaty panorama of antique world history should be essential viewing

Nov 29 2023,positive, i dont think audiences were expecting napoleon to be quite as funny as it is at least i know i wasnt and the shocked ripples of laughter that picked up steam as the movie went along at my midday postthanksgiving screening suggest the rest of the audience wasnt either but ridley scotts napoleon is something like an epic tragicomedy emphasis on the comedy this is not the movie to watch if youre looking for precise breakdowns of napoleonic politics or strategy though the political scenes are often quite amusing and no one working today can shoot an epic battle sequence quite like sir ridley nor is it a typical great man movie or even an atypical great man movie it is rather more like a farce a look at the absurd vanity of greatness it was not clear from the start that this would be the films main operating mode in the early going at the siege of toulon you get the sense that this could have been a slightly different type of movie napoleon joaquin phoenix sends his troops forward to capture the fort held by royalists and their british allies as they scale the walls he gets antsier and antsier finally diving into battle himself no phoenix doesnt quite resemble maximus in gladiatorrussell crowes roman general had a steely reserve that phoenixs twitchy napoleon does not even in this early sequencebut you can understand why he was a leader of men and why his men would follow him a general on the front lines is always appreciated by his men at least in the movies as the film progresses however the comedy piles up theres the moment where napoleon retracts his offer of dessert to an underling who informs him that his wife josephine vanessa kirby is having an affair or the moment when hes negotiating with the british and petulantly ululates in frustration you think youre so great because you have boats or the moment when frances republican pols chase him from a meeting with their feet and fists and he scurries to his men screaming about how they mean to do him harm and thus he must claim the emperorship these sequences are all sold by the pleading look in phoenixs eyes as if he cannot believe some new injustice is being done to him and by the wheedling tone of his voice coming off of ari asters beau is afraid phoenix has more or less set the bar for awkward guys trying to come off as slightly more impressive and competent and confident than they really are again i do not think this is the movie that napoleon scholars of either the professional or amateur variety wanted im not even sure it entirely works as an epic film in the mode of scotts gladiator and kingdom of heaven i am curious to see what the planned fourhour version for appletv thats coming out after the twoandahalf hour films theatrical release will look like perhaps it delivers a greater dramatic arc that some will find more satisfying than the comic stasis delivered by this picture as it currently exists but the movie playing in theaters now zips along despite its running time the smokefilled battle scenes look like beautiful muddy chaos and the performances were uniformly winning and amusing in short napoleon delivers nearly everything ia movie lover with no real interest in the meaning of napoleon the manam looking for in a motion picture
Nov 29 2023,positive, im not built like other men says napoleon bonaparte early in ridley scotts grandiose bloodcurdling epic the corsican who becomes emperor of france in the late 1700s is indeed that rare thing a leader fired by his ego and a desire to conquer scotts film  in which napoleon is played by joaquin phoenix in a true powderkeg of a performance  traces his rise through the military to emerge as one of the most powerful figures in european history the director of roman epic gladiator and crusades tale kingdom of heaven knows how to stage spectacle like few other directors the battle scenes are jawdropping from cannonballs tearing through flesh to soldiers slipping into freezing water during the infamous invasion of russia what surprises however is how well the emotional battleground plays out early on napoleon meets josephine vanessa kirby the widowed motheroftwo who will become the love of his life the detail in their courtship is splendid as napoleon rubs his sweat on the missive he writes her and even yanks her chair to be by his side his lovemaking is similarly brutish as he attempts without success to sire an heir while jealousy courses through his veins when he discovers she takes a lover whilst he is on a campaign in egypt with scarpas elegant script spanning two decades its both easy to get swept along in the majesty of scotts images and lost in the politics of the era only when rupert everetts snarling duke of wellington emerges muttering that napoleon is vermin is there a wellrounded antagonist to match the might of the films titular warmonger yet scott frequently finds a way to prick the pomposity of his protagonist when napoleon sits on a throne in a room overrun by pigeons he is assaulted by a cavalcade of droppings quite whether the film truly gets under the skin of napoleon and looks at what makes him tick is debatable but phoenix is resplendent as the caesar of france his refusal to undertake a french accent a wise choice alongside him kirby is a resolute josephine and largely european support  tahar rahim ludivine sagnier and julian rhindtutt among them  impress among a cast of thousands

Nov 28 2023,positive, ridley scotts napoleon doesnt jettison the cradletograve biopic of socalled great men as much as discredit it with a discernible wink rather than serving as a comprehensive chronicle of the eighteenthcentury french conqueror napoleon is a parade of significant vignettes the film packages its antibiopic approach with the elegance afforded by bigbudget productions while presenting napoleons arc with a slyness usually found among hollywood outliers joaquin phoenix indelibly plays napoleon bonaparte with an elusiveness that befits the films treatment phoenixs enigmatic playful and casually authoritarian napoleon saunters rather than strides into the hallways and battlegrounds that will earn him a place in history books hes a man of his time but also already beyond time  as aspect that is vividly brought out in the scene when he arrives in egypt and witnesses the fate of its pharaohs  first encountered during the anarchy of the french revolution in 1789 napoleon makes a play for total power swatting away royalists and opponents while proving his military genius through a series of wars one conquest bedevils napoleon out of the chaos of the french revolution emerges josephine played by vanessa kirby with becoming hauteur laced with animalistic survival instincts josephine provides napoleon with an emotional anchor she marries napoleon but stays just out of his reach in the same way that the movie itself stops short of an unambiguous portrayal helpful title cards chart the years and locations of napoleons rise he marches on uninterrupted until a campaign in russia where his eventual waterloo is foreshadowed  if the russia segment references soviet director sergei eisensteins 1938 classic alexander nevsky scotts film has resounding echoes of stanley kubricks equally elusive barry lyndon 1975  among kubricks unrealised projects was a napoleon biopic scotts own directorial debut the duellists 1977 set during the napoleonic wars haunts his latest account of the folly of narcissistic powermongers renowned cinematographer dariusz wolskis soft lighting and painterly compositions reflect a prephotography era scotts reputation for brutal and yet poetic battle sequences punctuate a narrative filled with conversations and arguments in the quietest and most compelling moments napoleon and josephine sit at either ends of a couch he uninhibited in his ardour and she implacable in her reserve the mildly satirical tone in david scarpas screenplay is a nifty way to avoid an explicit critique of napoleons reign while also providing a fresh way to drag the mothballed historical drama into the revisionist present the movie isnt quite history as farce but its nearly there there is startling gutsandgore detailing in the violence wrought by napoleon but also a studious distance from the man whose overweening ambition reshaped france and much of the world i see nothing but success in my future napoleon declares in one of his many missives to josephine surely hes joking  if napoleon appears to be parodying himself at times theres never any danger of taking tahar rahim as french courtier paul barrass or rupert everett as british duke arthur wellesley too seriously either the light touch carries over for the most part hypnotic in its own way but also slippery at times the 160minute movie is kept on course by scotts masterly staging  magisterial without the bombast delicate where it could have been heavyhanded  vividly filmed battle scenes and the two perfectly judged central performances  the general is most electric in his grownup dynamic with his consort which is tempered with an understanding of how transactional such relationships could be if phoenix is quietly mesmerising kirby is combustible napoleon is never more petulant when he demands absolute fidelity from josephine or credible in his yearning for her even after the relationship has ended inscrutable for the most part phoenixs napoleon gives himself away when he first sets eyes on josephine of all his conquests she proves to be the most challenging  and the most elusive
Nov 28 2023,negative, im almost embarrassed to admit that while watching ridley scotts ambitious movie about an ambitious french soldier who would be emperor i kept thinking about a similar motion picture that never saw the light of exposed film things looked good until along came an impressively accurate 1970 soviet unionitaly coproduction waterloo starring rod steiger as napoleon bonaparte it tanked at the box office and united artists pulled out leaving kubrick to recycle his research into his lushly realized 1975 period piece barry lyndon even so by the time we get around to witnessing napoleons historic defeat at waterloo our capacity to appreciate gory wellcrafted encounters of soldiers muskets cannons and swords has reached a saturation point probably take a cue from his eyes wide shut by concentrating on the complex fascinating relationship between the two lead characters napoleon and josephine a spunky attractive widow he marries two years after meeting her at a survivors ball the always watchable joaquin phoenix presents napoleon as a capricious socially awkward man of keen strategic intelligence and a delusional ego vanessa kirby brings a sly sexuality and a spine of steel to the aristocratic josephine a perfect tempered foil for napoleon who under an adherence to national duty eventually kicks her to a french curb for failing to supply a requisite heir napoleon cries out to be a marvelous story of conflicted conditional love not a studied battlestuffed epic as scott and screenwriter david scarpa force it to be the supporting characters barely get enough screentime to establish themselves anyway outside of rupert everetts scowling duke of wellington granted scotts visceral rendering of the bloody battle of austerlitz  in which russian and austrian troops meet cold death beneath a frozen lake broken up by bonapartes cannon balls  highlights the movie
Nov 28 2023,negative, fortysix years and more than two dozen films ago british filmmaking legend ridley scott made his feature debut with the duellists a thrifty but gorgeous account of a violent rivalry between two officers in napoleon bonapartes army to their credit his dueling american leads the brooklynreared harvey keitel and the northern californian keith carradine made not the slightest attempt to look or sound like 19thcentury frenchmen but they might as well be the marquis de lafayette compared to the sleepy mumblecore shuffle joaquin phoenix brings to the title role of napoleon sir ridleys return to this setting and era  this gory but thematically bloodless 160minute biopic runs an hour longer than the duellists covers an even greater expanse of time28 years from the beheading of marie antoinette up through napoleons death in exile in 1821and cost more than 40 times what the duellists did way back when adjusted for inflation which just goes to show you that 200 million of apples money the same princely sum the tech giant spent on martin scorseses far more enthralling killers of the flower moon can buy you sweeping locations and hundreds of periodaccurate costumes and practically shot battle scenes but it cant buy a point of view napoleon is a handsome but deathly dull coffee table book of a movie glancing toward but never fully committing to the kubrickian comedy it aims to be stanley kubrick spent years trying to get a bigbudget napoleon biopic made though it never came to pass ill put that failing somewhat on scotts inability to land on a consistent tone but mostly on the shoulders of his star with daniel daylewis having abdicated the role phoenix stands as the whatshegonnadothistime film actor of his generation what hes opted to do this time is to quote chinatown as little as possible perhaps he used up all his energy anchoring last springs beau is afraida threehour psychological horror comedy that swung for the fences maybe he was saving himself for lady gaga his costar in the forthcoming and french musical sequel joker folie à deux  screenwriter david scarpa has opted to use napoleons 14year marriage to josephine his first her second as the fulcrum of the narrative and you can feel vanessa kirby our josephine fairly begging her topbilled scene partner to give her something if shes wasted in the latter two mission impossible flicks as some have claimed her misappropriation here is more surprising and lamentable phoenix got an oscar nomination for best supporting actor from his heel turn as the craven and fictional roman emperor commodus in scotts best picturewinning gladiator back in 2000 that performance worked in part because his weaseliness contrasted against more stoic work from the likes of russell crowe oliver reed and richard harris phoenix didnt have to carry the movie here he does because scarpa hasnt given josephine any sort of identity apart from her association with napoleon which seems to pivot between genuine affection and mere survival instinct from scene to scene sexual chemistry is no part of it theres a running gag about what a lousy lay the great man was with kirby wearing a bored expression through one rabbitspeed doggystyle coupling after which phoenix declares let that good work make us a son the other laugh lines scarpa has given phoenix land too clearly were meant to chuckle when he claims i am not subject to petty insecurity and to guffaw when he explodes at one of his british opponents you think youre so great because you have boats the writer and the actor both want to puncture the great man myth and its a laudable impulse but their comic aspirations mix like oil and water with scotts maximalism something more modest in scale like the duellistsor hell a stage play about napoleon and josephine that kept all the battles offstagewouldve suited their intentions better especially considering that cinematographer dariusz wolski working with scott for a ninth time has opted to shoot napoleons various campaigns in a washedout grayscale color palette that inspires droopy eyelids rather than awe or revulsion title cards at the end of the film present the casualty estimates from napoleons 61 recorded battles a number north of 3 million napoleon gets a jolt in its final hour from the appearance of rupert everett as the duke of wellington one of the british military commanders who finally defeated napoleon at waterloo but by the time he shows up its too late for the movies wikistyle survey of the latter 60 percent of napoleons life to coursecorrect into something more compelling the movies most memorable bit comes early napoleon woos josephine by honoring her young sons request that napoleon return to him a sword that belonged to his father who like josephine was imprisoned during the reign of terror but unlike josephine was sent to the guillotine visiting an armory and learning that no one kept track of which sword was confiscated from whom the future emperor just grabs one at random and passes it off as an heirloom perhaps the rumored fourhour cut of napoleon that will appear on apple in january will contain more such morsels of revelation meanwhile scott and scarpa are collaborating on another movie scheduled for release this time next year one you could be forgiven for thinking it might be the 85yearold scotts waterloo its sequel to gladiator we dont have one readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read if you think that its important to have high quality local reporting we hope

Nov 28 2023,negative, napoleon bonaparte famously once said never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistakebut someone should have interfered with ridley scotts  casting joaquin phoenix as the french emperor and vanessa kirby as josephine because of his brilliant military strategy  from 1798 to 1815  the corsican thug scored victories at the battle of the pyramids battle of marengo battle of trafalgar battle of austerlitz battle of jenaauerstadt battle of rolica battle of borodino and battle of ligny having seized power crowning himself emperor in the chaos that occurred after the french revolution working from david scarpas historyheavy script director ridley scott gladiator spends 2 hours 38 minutes alternating between brutality on the battlefield and violence in the bedroom succeeding more in the former than the latter  since he used 11 cameras filming simultaneously for the frontline carnage in the titular role joaquin phoenix is almost as quirky and creepy as he was as arthur fleck in joker he whines sneers and  almost comically  habitually covers his ears after ordering the canons to fire what he lacks is charisma eventually as history tells us napoleon was defeated at waterloo by an angloallied army under the duke of wellington rupert everett with prussian reinforcements he was exiled to the islands of elba then st helena too bad nothing is mentioned about the european effects of the secular napoleonic code which eliminated traditional noble and clerical privileges and ignited changes to civil administration and law fyi two classic films  both called napoleon  were made by abel gance 1927 and sacha guitry 1955   stanley kubrick wanted to make a film about napoleon with jack nicholson  audrey hepburn after 2001 a space odyssey but that never came to pass and eventually apple tv will stream ridley scotts directors cut which runs fourhours
Nov 28 2023,neutral, for the last two centuries the reputation of napoleon bonaparte has fluctuated is he a monster a madman a master tactician the scourge of europe or its liberator a revolutionary hero or a powercrazed tyrant for the last two centuries the reputation of napoleon bonaparte has fluctuated is he a monster a madman a master tactician the scourge of europe or its liberator a

french leaders driedup penis at auction there was old boney reduced to being the ridiculous hobby of the series silliest character his manhood compared to a strip of beef jerky leave it to veteran helmer ridley scott alien blade runner  thelma and louise gladiator to make napoleon big again  really big  in a 159minute saga packed with beauty blood and spectacle tracking napoleons swift rise and stretchedout fall the script from david scarpa all the money in the world and the tv series the man in the high castle feels both packed and oddly empty too long and not long enough we see napoleon joaquin phoenix of the master the joker beau is afraid building on a military victory at the siege of toulon to rise in the army then going on to take swathes of europe and the middle east we see him navigating late 18th and early 19thcentury french politics  a quagmire of revolts uprisings coups corruption and rapidly shifting ideals and alliances  to become first consul and then emperor even as hes conquering the world however he seems unable to hold the heart of his wife the shrewd gorgeously imperious josephine the crowns vanessa kirby their love affair is transformed by scarpa into a kooky vaguely kinky psychodrama  at times comically overheated and at points rather poignant the two meet at the socalled survivors ball held by aristocrats who had lived through robespierres reign of terror where josephines prison haircut gives her the look of a punk princess kirby as always is electrifying to watch and phoenix is his unpredictable self his take on napoleon feeling modern and weird given to abrupt tonal detours  you think youre so great just because you have boats napoleon bursts out at the british ambassador at one point sounding like a petulant eightyearold boy  we never really understand what fuels napoleons need for conquest either politically or psychologically he wants to prove hes not a corsican ruffian unfit for higher office and a brief conversation with his brother suggests he might also be desperate to impress their mother sinead cusack who has maybe eight lines of dialogue here and still manages to terrify but overall the film doesnt know what to do with napoleon sometimes it seems like a serious epic designed to shine up his wellestablished mythology at other times it feels like a sneaky comic challenge to the great man theory of history puncturing napoleons sense of worldhistorical fate  his belief that he is the inheritor of alexander the great and caesar  with glimpses into his awkwardness and overcompensations the film is on much firmer ground in its depiction of the military campaigns where scotts craft overcomes scarpas uncertainty fans of the battle of austerlitz will find everything they want here and maybe more as scott delivers expertly conceived shot and edited war scenes created almost entirely with practical effects there are very few cgi cheats here with the film using actual human actors not pixels to embody the deep horror and visceral physical brutality of war scott combines the larger sweep of tactics with close kinetic camerawork that brings the viewer right into the chaos of handtohand combat with the ugly deaths and the screaming horses slipping in blood its an accomplishment but a difficult one to take in at this particular moment with the world currently at war real war some viewers might find these cinematic battle scenes hit differently studying at the university of winnipeg and later torontos york university alison gillmor planned to become an art historian she ended up catching the journalism bug when she started as visual arts reviewer at the winnipeg free press in 1992 there is genuine comedy here and also a real measure of pathos too often though napoleons withering condemnation of its subject feels less like a meaningful conclusion than a narrative dodge a convenient way to sidestep a more trenchant complicated look at napoleons political legacy ridley scott  the wellington of cinema  has created an outrageously enjoyable cavalry charge of a movie a fulltilt biopic of 212 hours in which scott doesnt allow his troops to get bogged down midgallop in the muddy terrain of either fact or metaphysical significance the tactical issues that have defeated other filmmakers history said napoleon bonaparte is a set of lies agreed upon that sound you hear 200 years later is ridley scott banging his fist on a table with appreciation before shooting a scene in which the man known as the nightmare of europe literally fires a cannon at the great pyramid of

function of game design its a subtle but effective repudiation of the great man school of historiography which supposes that highly powerful individuals are the defining factors in the development of worldshifting historical events a category often bestowed upon napoleon bonaparte the subject of ridley scotts latest historical epic this is a figure who after all inspired much of the great man historical school and whose previous biopics themselves often replicate the common idea of napoleon as a unique culturallypotent and earthshifting figure the opposite to the great man theory suggests that it is the history of the masses colored with less perceptible cultural and social shifts that defines history priming the ground also for these iconic individuals to take their place they are merely products of their environment for better or worse great man history is in a sense easier to digest understand and make palatable heroic or villainous figures existing outside of time define an era and produce a great deal more cultural ephemera  news items artistic works political responses  for future historians to parse through twoandabit centuries down the line we know intimate details of napoleons biography but we barely know the names of many of those who stormed the bastille on that fateful day on july 14 1789 kickstarting the french revolution from which napoleon would emerge but great man history also makes figures more abstracted and totemic positive figures such as nikola tesla become icons for nationalist state building in both serbia and croatia while great man writing on figures like adolf hitler or joseph stalin flattens their crimes into historically exceptional acts obscuring the levels of complicity and agreement within the populace over which they rule the hollywood historical epic has always had plenty to say about these great men and the odd woman too and scott has long been one of historical epics most accomplished practitioners his willingness to play with the conventions of the genre even with a megabudget production is precisely why this biopic starring joaquin phoenix as the man himself is so refreshing as napoleon is very much a repudiation and a revolt against historys great men scotts vision of napoleon bonaparte is that of a passenger in his own story he rises through the ranks of the postrevolutionary french army largely on the coattails of more politically savvy allies he spends significant sections of the film just wandering through scenes looking at things or people unwilling or incapable of engaging with them he is cuckolded by his wife josephine vanessa kirby and enraged when she is unable to bear a child hell napoleons crowning of himself as the emperor of france  arguably the defining moment of his life  is depicted almost glibly in a brief scene where one of the subjects leading diplomats talleyrand paul rhys casually suggests he should be emperor cut to the next scene at the coronation of napoleon and josephine no political machinations no negotiations no monologues  just one cut to the next perhaps this is partly a remnant of the fact that napoleon has supposedly been cut down to two hours and 38 minutes for theatrical release from a fourhour directors cut which scott plans to release on apple tv but its a running theme in the theatrical cut that history happens to napoleon rather than napoleon making and shaping history the effect makes for a fascinatingly strange historical biopic in which key events land with no impact this is not necessarily a bad thing  in fact it separates napoleon from other epics of its kind creating an ahistoricism that says more about the historiography and perception of the subject than his actual life and actions if you want to find out more about that napoleon remains one of the most writtenabout figures in world history  there is a glimmer of truth in scotts presentation of napoleon as a historical passenger france is one of the worlds longest running states and political units and the development of the french state is vitally important to the development of modernday ideas about nations peoples and ethnicities often for the worse if you ask me in spite of violent revolutions ruptures and wars the french state has existed in some form or other since the capetian era in the 10th century the french revolution in 1789 may have abolished the monarchy but it did not abolish the state itself even events such as vichy france the rump state of france which functioned as a nazi puppet state during wwii exists as part of a continuity of the french state with the institutions continually proving far more resilient than its people or leaders scotts napoleon suggests this throughout political bickering the generals military command and his relationship to josephine are all superseded by the concerns and power of the state the films central protagonist is rarely the center of the scene even when phoenixs leathered face fills the screen in a widescreen closeup phoenixs performance is also a superb repudiation of historical epic expectations he plays napoleon small and not just physically the subject is a weirdo with a wobbly voice and an unsure presence in rooms of power this is a continuation of phoenixs recent work in joker 2019 and beau is afraid 2023 where he also plays outcasts who end up as part of journeys far larger than themselves amidst all this scott ensures a glorious sheen of opulence throughout napoleon his greatest skill as a director has always been his marshalling of production design and cinematography to create unmistakably filmic settings whether scifi or historical even at the expense of tighter plotting or narrative tension light streams in through musty windows dripping in through exquisite sets lighting up charismatic actors kirbys empress josephine is a particular highlight in beautiful costumes meanwhile the battle scenes may be some of the best action scenes in scotts filmography with huge setpieces built largely on physical effects and a concrete sense of geography where are rival armies approaching from where are napoleons men where is the momentum of battle the staging is crystalclear and gloriously bloody which makes it all the more fascinating how differently and muddily scott opted to present the rest of napoleons life traditional historians have already been raging at the historical inaccuracies present in napoleon but in its rejection of the subjects great man status scott offers a refreshing analysis of the uselessness of this sort of historiography in civilization vi one gains access to different sorts of buildings and boosts basic granaries give way to bustling megacities amphitheatres pave the way for art museums and then broadcast centers libraries provide the foundation for universities and research labs the games developers have presented this as a continuum on which a people exist and build a political identity for themselves scott suggests that napoleon doesnt exist as a unique individual but as one of a continuum of statebuilding and historical causeandeffect just another actor and not the star

Nov 28 2023,negative, after the violent throes of revolution in a bankrupt french republic on the brink of collapse a man captured the hearts of his people and rose to rule this is the story of napoleon bonaparte the subject of director ridley scotts new movie napoleon in theaters for thanksgiving napoleon was one of the most fascinating people in history unfortunately for all its bigbudget set pieces and stars scotts film is underdeveloped and confusedin its basic historical storytelling but more importantly in what it has to say about its subject and the meaning of his life napoleon begins with the bloody fall of the french monarchy and with it the head of its famous queen marie antoinette from there we meet napoleon joaquin phoenix a lowborn but ambitious officer who seizes his chance to rise to power in the chaotic aftermath of the revolution the movie follows the major beats of his life point by point from his first military success at toulon to his final exile on the island of saint helena scott pushes through these phases in confusing succession from toulon which is in france napoleon is suddenly in egypt if youre a student of 18th and 19thcentury europe and its constant power struggles you know napoleon campaigned through egypt to weaken frances rival great britain by nipping at their middle eastern holdings but if you dont already know this context you simply see napoleon with the great sphinx at gizaand likely wonder what hes doing there and why also strangely handled is napoleons conflicted love affair with josephine the woman he made empress of the french then later abandoned their story is the stuff of legend one of historys great enigmas they remained deeply connected after their divorce and her death devastated him his name was reportedly among the last words she spoke in life but napoleons script tells rather than shows much of this worldhistoric romance as josephine vanessa kirby formerly princess margaret in the crown is radiant as usual but some of the dialogue between her character and napoleon was so awkward it elicited laughs from the audience in my screeningand not the good kind phoenix plays napoleon as a cold silent strongman at times a brute hes an excellent actor in the right role but this portrayal doesnt get us any closer to understanding the phenomenon that was napoleon why did his people love him so fervently why for that matter did josephine napoleons napoleon is wholly without appeal leaving the film without a theory of his rise to power that viewers could consider applying to powerful figures of our own time that central lack is a shame because napoleon has some strong elements if a glorious cavalry chargepennants streaming hooves thundering sabers flashing in the sunis what you like in a historical epic this movie is for you scott gives each war scene special attention from the placement of artillery to the bitter cold of the russian invasion battle nerds will be pleased more militaryfocused excerpts of the film could be useful for high school students of european history its unclear what went wrong with napoleon a good director a very capable cast and an epic scale in production come together to make something less than the sum of their parts maybe recent strikes in hollywood hampered the postproduction editing or maybe the participants just didnt meld whatever the reason the film has moments that could have been profound napoleons encounter with the monuments of longdead ancient pharaohs could have been a meditation on the fleeting lives of even the most successful of ambitious men instead the moment passes without that depth the movie also leaves out any mention of faith without prior knowledge a viewer could almost finish the film never knowing there were priests and churches in the land of notre dame the french revolution shook the church as much as the monarchy but in this telling the church seems to have never existed scott does show napoleons grand rebellion of placing the crown on his own head rather than submitting to the churchs placement of the crown but the movie does not show why that mattered napoleon could speak to us today he arose in a time of populism unrest revolution he captured a countrys imagination both feeding and feeding on its selfnarrative of greatness ultimately he failed his peopleand blamed them for that failure fill in a few context clues from wikipedia and napoleon can provide a serviceable history lesson but it could have been epic in more than its battles it could have been an epic tale of a man who almost gained the whole world napoleon has several sex scenes though they are brief there are a few moments of gore as would be expected in a movie about premodern european wars the violence is generally muted but it adds up to enough for an r rating
Nov 28 2023,neutral, another in a long list of flawed and boring movies about the emperor of france i could hardly sit through ridley scotts napoleon with my eyes open i prefer both the classic 1927 silent film by abel gance and the 1954 flop desiree with marlon brando as a miscast but memorable bonaparte and rapturous jean simmons as desiree clary the fiancee he should have married who became queen of sweden instead of the trashy adulterous josephine who broke his heart and allegedly died of a nasty combination of diphtheria and syphilis none of this nor anything else that threatens to take napoleon off the battlefield long enough to tell a moving or human story is detailed enough to concern producerdirector ridley scott who is more interested in overloaded and overpopulated war scenes than illuminating history the result is a colossal bore that is never passionate exciting sexy or entertaining with an illfated titled performance by joaquin phoenix that borders on catatonic the tedium begins in 1794 when robespierres reign of terror symbolized by gambling and guillotines ignited the french revolution and war hero napoleon bonaparte was promoted to brigadier general of the french republic there is no mention of desiree but when he meets josephine she spreads her legs and says if you look down youll see a surprise once you see it youll always want it  whatever it is i guess he likes it because he marries the trollop in corsica liberates egypt declaring im a brute that is nothing without you and by 1799 seizes power and divides the government with josephine at his side  thus begins a dull history lesson from the battle of austerlitz in 1805 to the disastrous invasion of russia in 1812 a defeat with 28000 french losses if this movie has any basis in fact napoleons conquests and failures were the most boring in history louis the 18th demanded his arrest but french troops embraced him with loyalty one battle after another and he declared himself emperor of france leading up to the eventual battle of waterloo and yet another arsenal of cannons swords and exploding horses with their guts blown all over the landscape  screen titles inform you what battle youre watching but the armies all look alike so you never know who napoleon is fighting or why the longer it goes on the more exasperated and emotionally uninvolved joaquin phoenix becomes and the more i look at my watch the only impressive thing about ridley scotts direction is the masses of extras he employedthousands of them even if they were paid as little as 10 an hour the budget must have been astronomical one battle scene follows the next and we are forced to live through every one of them  through it all the acting remains muted and forgettable except for the eyerolling overemoting of vanessa kirby a josephine who is always on the verge of hysterics the screenplay by david scarpa is dreary and turgid hopping around episodically without any character development and evoking only a sketchy picture of napoleons historic rise and fall and his nasty violent marriage to josephine there is nothing here to engage the heart nothing to explain or demonstrate the qualities that made him charismatic enough to captivate france a napoleon without a valid napoleon is a fourth of july without a firecracker we get it you like to have control of your own internet experience but advertising revenue helps support our journalism to read our full stories please turn off your ad blockerwed really appreciate it
Nov 28 2023,positive,napoleon showcases how imperialism misguided destiny and the inferiority complex of nation and man alike leads to death and destruction  ridley scott is in top form not many filmmakers have such a command on their craft as him
Nov 28 2023,positive,this one is for everyone who loves a historical epic and believe me fans of this genre will have a lot to feast their eyes on but this is a flawed film and its flaws are highlighted by the fact that when it is good  its actually pretty amazing
Nov 28 2023,positive, boneys old bird caught out of the nest again reads an 1812 newspaper headline in ridley scotts napoleon cutting to the heart of the french emperors tempestuous romance with his wife josephine the film delivers one whopping epic sight after another the pyramids smoking like the twin towers after being fired on by cannons an army of austrians plunging through the ice at austerlitz the mud and blood of waterloo but what you most take away from the film is the sight of napoleon bonaparte on all fours snorting like a pig scampering towards the open legs of his wife youre a beast she murmurs the conqueror is conquered
Nov 28 2023,negative,napoleon is protracted as if running time and rambling narrative incidents amounted to substance napoleon parades an empty spectacle for a market uninterested in learning from history
Nov 28 2023,negative, its tempting to suggest that director ridley scotts decision to tell the story of napoleon bonaparte using short fragments is a tongueincheek salute to the onetime french emperors physical stature bonaparte has become an icon of shortform masculinity to the extent that the term napoleon complex also known as small people syndrome is named after him and describes aggressive behaviour that seeks to overcompensate for physical or social shortcomings however the fact is bonaparte wasnt short the enduring image of him being a tiny disgruntled man is thanks to the popularity of the work of british cartoonist james gillray in reality bonaparte was approximately the same height as joaquin phoenix who is the protagonist of the sprawling biopic napoleon  this scrap of factual accuracy might just be a coincidence for the better part of napoleon scott is not bothered by prosaic things like historical record despite the regular captions that inform us of years and locations the directors response to the news that french critics had pointed out inaccuracies in napoleon was one that hummed with adolescent belligerence  were you there oh you werent there then how do you know take that all ye historians including michael broers historical consultant on napoleon who when asked about scotts take on bonaparte delicately opined that his professional opinion as the author of a threevolume biography of bonaparte is not quite that in all fairness there is arguably enough scholarship on napoleon bonaparte for those interested in a straightforward biography and woe betide anyone who turns to hollywood for lessons on european history what is more interesting to note are the areas in which scott has chosen to veer away from historical realism and where hes leaned towards authenticity napoleon begins with queen marie antoinette walking up to the guillotine while a mob bays for her blood from the crowd to the 18thcentury parisian square and the decapitated head that is triumphantly displayed everything feels chillingly accurate the fictional detail is the sight of napoleon in the crowd factually speaking he was in toulon which is where the narrative jumps to soon after the opening scene theres no explanation for why scott felt the need to tweak history and begin with the french queens beheading  unless the motivation really was as simple as reducing violence on a female body into a casual spectacle  the lavish budget and ambitious scope of scotts cinematic ambitions are evident in the panoramic shots of wars that gouged tranquillity out of pristine landscapes like the windswept grassy plains around waterloo and the snowblanketed fogwrapped russian countryside theres a sequence in which a group of soldiers fall through a frozen lake to their death turning from human figures into abstracts made up of unnatural angles slow swirls of red blood and jagged shards of white ice cinematographer dariusz wolski filmed the terrible beauty of this scene in a way that manages to be both the stuff of enchantment and also horror whether or not this is actually what happened in the battlefields where the legend of bonaparte was created scotts recreations of the war scenes feel both real as well as credibly dramatic  then there is the fiction like joaquin phoenix fixed in the amber of his late40s playing napoleon from the ages of 24 to 51 or vanessa kirby 35 who is charismatic enough as josephine to make you turn a blind eye to facts never mind that the real josephine was six years older than bonaparte and didnt have the equivalent of kirbys cutglass posh accent the historical josephine spoke french in a creole twang  she was born to a family of white settlers in the french colony of martinique her accent didnt endear her to the parisian elite she survived an uprising in the colonised island made her way to mainland france navigated elite french society and emerged from the french revolution and reign of terror as a widow with a prison record and two children from here josephine became the empress of france at age 46 after almost 15odd years of marriage josephine was forced to consent to a divorce from bonaparte who wanted heirs ironically while there are no legitimate direct descendants of bonapartes line josepine is counted as an ancestor by the modern dutch swedish norwegian and belgian royal families none of this is of interest to scott who sees josephine only as a vague embodiment of feminine distraction she is the love of his napoleons life and the military geniuss achilles heel a chesty temptress whose careless infidelity distracts napoleon from key campaigns and reduces him to a howling mess she is the lover with whom napoleon does babytalk and the woman who can go from submissive to dominatrix in the space of an exhale napoleon relies heavily on the famously passionate love letters that bonaparte wrote to josephine while they were married to give the film an emotional charge but the longing in the words feels awkwardly dissociated from the action on screen  despite two powerhouse performers delivering compelling performances napoleon and josephines relationship rarely feels either coherent or poignant there are only fragmentary moments that crackle with electricity their relationship zig zags erratically moving from attraction to distaste to violence without a perceptible connecting thread one of scotts many tweaks to history is in the scene where the imperial marriage is dissolved having repeatedly suggested napoleon is hopelessly in love with josephine while josephine only tolerates him because shes a dependant the couple are shown to have settled into a comfortable unhappiness when they decide to end their marriage the historical record says the divorce ceremony had an audience of witnesses before whom napoleon and josephine read out statements of devotion to one another before dissolving their marriage josephine was in tears while reading her statement scott adds a detail he has napoleon slap josephine when she breaks down creating a moment that is unsettling for both how jarring and fleeting napoleons viciousness feels much like the decision to include marieantoinettes beheading in napoleon scotts reworking of history in this case can only be described as disappointing  had scott been interested in josephines perspective maybe this fictional love story would have come across as poignant and conflicting unfortunately scott has little interest in interiority and this is not just true of josephine even phoenix doesnt get much scope to build a nuanced character instead his napoleon ricochets from year to year war to war ever grumpy and never changing the transitions are few and the pace is jumpy david scarpas script feels more like a powerpoint presentation made out of spark notes than the recounting of a storied life one moment napoleon asks his young new wife would you like to see the bedroom the next moment a newborn infant is brought to him in one scene napoleon seems to command the affection and loyalty of french soldiers even though his military strategies used them as cannon fodder moments later hes lost his troops and is being exiled despite the excellent battle scenes which make majestic use of the big screen the film leaves one with little sense of what made bonaparte a military genius and there is no mention at all of any of his actual contributions to french polity not that the 160 minutes that scott devotes to bonaparte feel wellspent but considering how dramatic and eventful this life was perhaps it would have been served better as a series rather than a film 
Nov 27 2023,positive, my my at waterloo napoleon did surrender oh yeah and for decades before that general bonaparte wreaked havoc across europe north africa and russia gaining a reputation as a genius a despot an icon and a brute there are literally thousands of books about napoleon as well as myriad films tv series songs and memes dedicated to dissecting parodying and discoursing him everyone has an opinion of him so how do you even begin to make a new version of this wellworn tale if youre sir ridley scott you toss history to the side and delve into a heated mishmash of battles narcissism sex and hats  if youre looking for the utmost fealty to the past this film is not for you it opens with napoleon joaquin phoenix witnessing the execution of marie antoinette at the height of the reign of terror that defined the french revolution that didnt happen he didnt fire cannons at the pyramids of giza and he didnt dine with the duke of wellington this might bother some but for me scotts mythologizing of an already heavily propagandized life was crucial to what makes napoleon work when its firing on all cylinders for scott this is a classic ragstoriches story to be retold and refuted at the same time  bonaparte is a lowly corsican soldier and social misfit whose brilliance on the battlefield sees him claw his way to power as is befitting a film made by the guy who brought us gladiator the battle scenes are stunning he really does make this stuff look easy as well as merciless in the first battle  the film is structured around a number of key battles that defined napoleons career  we see bodies flying and horses massacred in frighteningly detailed fashion the death toll of each battle is evident the mass suffering never ignored by the camera even if napoleon himself is indifferent to his mens agonies for all who worried that napoleon would downplay or justify the body count of bonaparte do not fear its clear that scott and screenwriter david scarpa are not impressed by how this mans intense vanity led him to such lengths the flipside of bonapartes obsession with victory is his obsessive yearning for josephine played by vanessa kirby he cannot live without her she doesnt seem all that into him except as a means of protection for a former generals wife in a postrevolution paris his adoration is tough to deal with so its no wonder she quickly finds a new lover which the entirety of france knows about long before napoleon does his uncouth nature is in stark contrast to the steely control of josephine as portrayed by kirby as charismatic without even having to make an effort her stillness has an allure that could only work with an actress like kirby so used to doing everything with nothing  phoenix by contrast is an absolute fcking loser and it is amazing still using his valley boy american accent his napoleon is a selfmythologizing dork who is smart enough to craft his own legend but unaware that hes just the absolute worst to be around hes pompous but too insecure to stand up to his own mother when he bellows in one mans face about thinking hes so great because he has boats the sheer absurdity of this man cannot be denied it also helps that phoenix is a brilliant slapstick performer best seen in one moment where he runs away from a crowd like a hanna barbera character speaking of absurdity there are jokes in napoleon this is a funny movie deliberately so the contrast between the ceaseless violence of the battlefield and napoleons stumbling through society and marital squabbles makes for a largerthanlife expansion of a marriage story when napoleon is on top of the world the battles look easy when he is forced to divorce josephine for the crime of not being able to provide him with a son the fights become agonizingly drawn out his own ego is bruised but it doesnt make him consider the cost of his games  the problem with reviewing a ridley scott movie is that youre keenly aware hell have a directors cut of the thing you just watched on the horizon and that it will be a much richer denser experience hes really the only director working today who has the luxury to release a 200 million epic and then get a longer cut with more juicy stuff jampacked in to that same crowd would that all our favourite filmmakers got that opportunity and scott has more than proven himself with these extended editions kingdom of heaven became an outright masterpiece with its directors cut the muchmaligned neonoir the counselor is more caustic and perverse in scotts unfettered take you could write a thesis on the various cuts of blade runner and how they drastically change the narrative with each redo there is a napoleon directors cut on the way to be made available on apple tv and i cant wait to see it but its disheartening that the theatrical cut of this film the one the vast majority of people will see first has to feel like a compromise to make it happen  because ultimately this still feels like a fourhour film sliced into a 140minute one theres not enough time with josephine to give their relationship the heft it demands which leaves phoenix and kirby to do a lot of heavy lifting with their conflicting chemistries what we get is so striking and crucial to the entire point of scotts retelling of the bonaparte story its through this torrid romance one with routine infidelities that the french newspapers endlessly reported on that napoleons impulses and desires are filtered their famed love letters are used as inner monologue voiceovers offering a contrast of rhetoric to action in terms of their marriage then reflected further in the battle scenes but more is needed to maintain this balance heres hoping the directors cut satisfies  a lot of critics seem irate at napoleon for its take on history so lackadaisical with the truth and far more concerned with the idea of this man than his reality maybe theres no literal truth in phoenixs pompous tyrant brat with wife issues and big loser energy but there is power to this version of a familiar story scott cares more about how the myth is made and who gets to make it and we all know how often that is defined by men like this maybe he doesnt deserve to be shown as anything more than an amoral loser with an emotional support hat
Nov 27 2023,negative, napoleon was a weepy masochist a soso general who was forced to be named emperor he loved only one woman and cried when he divorced her he wanted josephine instead of an heir for the bonaparte dynasty france will not forgive ridley scott for the insult beheading by guillotine was so common that for women subjected to this public death the hair style was called the coiffure à la victime beheadings were big crowd pleasers this final act shame was done by the executor right before the walk to the block marie antoinette heralded and cursed for her outrageous costumes would have had her hair cut and arranged beforehand by her attendants she had months to prepare after her husband met his end having her hair quickly chopped by the executor would have been for her far worse than the beheading when napoleon first sees josephine her hair has been badly chopped she was so close to death by guillotine that she had been prepared so her neck could be easily placed on the block  the french revolution had finally deposed of the legendary monarchy the imprisoned king louis xvi believed the way to avoid his fate at the guillotine was to negotiate with the revolutionaries he failed but queen marie antoinette refused insisting mon métier est dêtre royaliste i am going to bypass the historical or nonhistorical recreations of the bloody battles and the route napoleon took claiming the leadership then throne of france i am going to focus on napoleons relationship with josephine which is at the center of the film apparently bringing france back to a monarchy was not that difficult napoleon was not a ruthless cruel politician scottscarpa refuse to accept how dominant he was he cries bitterly when forced to have a male heir he sobs signing the divorce papers if he stayed married to josephine who could not provide him with an heir he would be a onetime emperor not the founder of the bonaparte dynasty  scott insists that napoleon is nothing without josephine vanessa kirby his letters to josephine are sensual masterpieces and at the time flowery language of desire was intentional and proof of an aristocrats education do you think the french peasants had the time and education to write letters without being in someones company there were no other means of promoting sexual arousal it is like the female centered popularity of soft pornographic literature or erotic scenes in movies and series see fellow travelers even writing those letters must have excited napoleon he had to imagine those sexual things before writing them down then giving it away to travel thousands of miles to josephine would have also thrilled him the fear of his letters falling into enemy hands would have also added another dimension of heightened thrill josephine should be praised for evaluating napoleons psychological weakness and exploiting it  cleverly josephine did not give napoleon the honor and respect he was widely given josephine was an aristocrat napoleon was not we know this because she boldly takes lovers when he is on campaigns and does not respond to his daily pleading letters she brilliantly toyed with him many of his authentic letters to josephine narrated by phoenix suggests the real reason for his obsession with his wife he says in a letter that she is the only woman that can please him what does that exactly mean did the already sexually sophisticated josephine provide a service to napoleon no innocent conventraised royal virgin would be familiar with according to my research the director and screenwriter have drawn a radical different napoleon than history has presented historians state he had 21 confirmed mistresses there were also persistent rumors that existed about his relationship to his stepdaughter hortense de beauharnais and his own sister pauline bonaparte who it was said loved him more than her lovers all over france it was whispered that napoleon was occasionally impotent at some dinner tables an acceptable topic of discussion was the exceptionally modest amount of napoleons ejaculated semen and the size of his penis disproportionate even to his diminutive stature  napoleon offers us an emperor who was not happy with his victories the power his place in history and his desire for a dynasty only josephine made him happy he presents his newborn son to josephine for her approval mommy look i did goodt he battle scenes costumes the production are brilliant however phoenix has decided to besmirch the glory of napoleon visit napoleons tomb dôme des invalides in paris see the tribute the massive structure presents the french do not see napoleon as scott does as a pussywhipped crybaby selfcreated emperor who might have had some soso victories and was a depressed discontented bore consider this after the monarchy was abolished king louis xvi marie antoinette their children were housed in the temples small tower where they had access to some of the luxuries they were accustomed to  fine food and wine new clothes clean sheets and books to read the queen even had one of her beloved dogs in her rooms when they moved once again to the temples great tower their living conditions were still agreeable their rooms had a flushing toilet and wallpaper and their food was served on silver they had their servants
