"Sep 24, 2023",positive," Even though I saw this movie three days after it opened, I felt like it might as well have been three weeks after its release. Last summer, there were four superhero movies and I saw every one of them on their opening day, first show of the day. Unfortunately, this just wasn’t possible with The Avengers, but considering that it made over $200 million in three days, I don’t think Marvel really noticed my missing $10. Also, with all the money it made, I don’t really feel like I need to go over the WHOLE plot for you guys because it feels like everyone has already seen it. Instead, just like I did with Iron Man 2, it’s going to be much easier to just go over how well I think each character/actor did in this movie, and that’ll also be a lot more fun for me. Before I do, I suppose I can just briefly say that Loki, as made famous in Thor, also made famous by just being Thor’s brother, uses the “Tesseract”, which all comic book fans should recognize as the Cosmic Cube, to teleport an intergalactic army to destroy the world. In retaliation, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow are called together to fight the impending galactic war. Brief enough? Now I get to talk about everybody! Maybe it’s RDJ’s public personality that gets me kind of annoyed with him and the fact that he is kind of full of himself, but considering his financial and critical success has warranted him being a tad “bragadocious”. I was also nervous that the whole movie would focus on him, considering he’s already got two Iron Man movies under his belt and I always associate Captain America as the leading Avenger. Even though I had these reservations, I was glad to see that Tony Stark didn’t have much more screen time than anyone else, and considering he didn’t have to burden the weight of the whole film on his shoulders, he was able to be a more comical Tony Stark than we’d already seen. Lots of one-liners, jabs at other characters, and an overall tendency to downplay the seriousness of a situation. Steve Rogers even called him out on the fact that he was self-centered and narcissistic, which made me nervous that there’d be a scene where Steve Rogers would have to say some “You really are a hero!” bullshit, but we were spared. Even though Iron Man was a key part of defeating the aliens, nobody made a big deal out of it, which really fits in with the Tony Stark I know. That despite no matter how many successes he might have, he’s still kind of an egotistical prick and nobody wants to pay him ANY compliments. I love Captain America. Call me old-fashioned for loving America, and I’ll call you a goddamned Communist. What I love about his character is that he ALWAYS knows what is right, and does everything in his power to stand up for it. Whether it was in the Civil War storyline where he had to allow himself to be arrested or sacrificing himself at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, he knows what to do and doesn’t hesitate. One scene in particular near the end of the film, despite not being the most powerful member of the team, he told everyone exactly what to do and exactly when to do it, and everyone fell into rank. They knew that this guy had fought evil incarnate in World War II and trust him with everything. Whether he was breaking up a fight between Thor and Iron Man or jumping across the helicarrier to literally SMACK a grenade out of the air to protect Stark, Cap really proved that he’s more than just a science experiment. I also stand by my opinion that Chris Evans is handsome enough and funny enough to put him into any superhero outfit and do a great job. Remember how I mentioned that the Thor movie really only served as a stepping stone to build up to The Avengers? Boy howdy, was I right. Even though Thor wasn’t the best superhero movie last summer, it introduced you to a regal character who lives in a world completely removed from and much more vast than anything us humans on Earth could even wrap our heads around. He proves himself not only wise in the way he tries to handle Loki and his desire to merely take him back to Asgard, but also showed how powerful and essentially God-like when he knocks Hulk on his ass with one punch or summons lightning to vaporize and shit ton of aliens. I’d say that in films, just like in the comics, Thor works much better as a supporting cast member than as a the major player. He could basically solve everything problem with a giant hammer and some lightning. You might have found Loki to be a quivering, whining prick in Thor, so imagine how big of a douchebag he got after floating around the universe with nothing but the thought of vengeance in mind? They were able to play up the “God of Mischief” aspect much more in this movie as we saw how easy it was for him to manipulate humans, rather than in Thor and he was just playing tricks on his brother. We were able to see how cowardly he was and knew he wasn’t nearly as powerful as any one of the Avengers and had to call on someone else’s army to fight for him. He strategically manipulated every character to feed off of one another’s insecurities, and even though he wasn’t physically some sort of powerhouse, you could see how annoying he could be to deal with. Hiddleston was also showing some vulnerability as an adopted son who never received the love of his father, and even though you knew he was the villain, had a tiny bit of sympathy for his situation. This was the part of the movie I was most worried about, considering that after two movies based on Hulk, there’s yet to be a successful incarnation of him on film. The thing about this character that people want to see most is actually what’s easiest to put on the big screen, which is a big green monster destroying everything. The more interesting parts of the character are figuring out how he deals with this timebomb that’s inside of him and the effect it had on his psychological state. Luckily, through the nature of this being an ensemble film, Dr. Banner was only used in small doses, mostly to show off his level of intelligence. There were a few scenes between Dr. Banner and Tony Stark that were really fun to watch, because they both felt like they had found an intellectual peer and playmate. When Dr. Banner left and Hulk showed up, obviously it was fucking awesome. HE SMASHED EVERYTHING. I went get into everything he smashed, but the smashing scenes were fun. I also kept doing double-takes when a character said “Banner” because I thought our dog might be in the theater. I made a pretty bold claim with Iron Man 2 which was that Scarlett Johansson was a good choice to play Black Widow AND that she was one of the best parts of that movie, but most people thought I was just distracted by her tits. I suppose there might be a little truth to that, but just because she was good in this role doesn’t mean I think she’s a good actress. In fact, I think she’s not a good actress and every other movie I’ve seen her in she just seems distant and emotionally apathetic to everything going on around her. Luckily, while portraying a Russian assassin and spy, having an outward appearance of not giving a shit about anything or being emotionally involved in anything going on, things work out pretty well. Granted, in this movie, she had a few moments that seemed a little too superhuman and far-fetched in regards to her abilities, but it was really only one sequence so I can forgive her. Mostly because of, well, you know, boobs. Having only really appeared as a silhouette in Thor and having no other film appearances, Hawkeye was obviously going to be a tough sell as an Avenger. Rather than try to give him a long backstory, we instead spend most of the film seeing Barton as a villain who is having his mind controlled by Loki. One reason I really liked them doing this was that it removed the need for a backstory because all you saw was Hawkeye being a badass with a bow and arrow and showing of a multitude of different trick arrows. Another reason I liked this was because in the Marvel Universe, Hawkeye was introduced as a villain. He might have only been a villain for three issues before joining the Avengers, but still, it’s something that’s constantly referenced in the books and I think that using him as a villain for the first half of the movie not only showed you his abilities, but also made you enjoy the heroic things he was doing that much more. Two things I didn’t like, however, was the fact that the mind control he was under was undone by Black Widow just punching him a whole bunch, and I figured Loki’s spells would be a little more powerful. I also think that Hawkeye should have been played by Alan Alda, but I guess Jeremy Renner was an acceptable substitute. Although I thought his cameo in Iron Man was pretty cool, the other times this incarnation of Nick Fury haven’t been as faithful to the character as I had liked. Granted, that basically means I didn’t really care for his scenes in Iron Man 2, but Samuel L. Jackson is a character on his own. He has a reputation of coming across like a badass, but also being really funny, talented, and can deliver these badass lines or insults while adding a smirk to the end of them to let you know he’s just fucking with you. The Nick Fury I wanted to see wasn’t a jokester or anything other than a grizzled war veteran who has gone to Hell and back to ensure the safety of the country he so loves to defend. It’s almost like he has the heart of Captain America but with the skills of Black Widow. Well, maybe not the bazongas of Black Widow, but the covert spy stuff. Lucky for me, they toned down Fury’s interactions with the team so you knew he was the one in charge and wasn’t taking shit from anybody. There was also a scene that involved him motivating the team by showing them something taken out of a dead agent’s coat, but once the team leaves, another character pointed out that they weren’t actually in his coat, but in the agent’s locker. This showed that Fury was willing to do anything and everything to get the reaction from people that he knew had to be sparked in them, even if that meant lying to them. His role in this film definitely made up for the doubts I had going into it. Someone who was introduced a few years ago to plant the seed of what S.H.I.E.L.D was and where all these Marvel movies were going, Agent Coulson has become a loved character to many fans. Even though he is typically only in Marvel movies delivering half a dozen lines, those lines are well-timed with great delivery by Gregg, even giving Robert Downey Jr. a run for his money in a few scenes. We got that sense from Coulson again in Avengers, and adding in the obsession that a S.H.I.E.L.D agent would clearly have for Captain America, the fanboy moments between Coulson and Steve Rogers were really charming and endearing. And congratulations to Mr. Gregg for having the character take a permanent seat in the Marvel Universe in not just films, but being introduced into the comics as well! If there’s one show I hate hearing people tell me is funny, it’s The Big Bang Theory. If there’s two shows that I hate hearing people tell me is funny, it’s The Big Bang Theory and How I Met You Mother. Knowing that Smulders was on that show, I figured the only reason she landed the role was to get audiences of that show interested. Lucky for me, I was wrong. DEAD WRONG! Well, not dead wrong, but I wanted to say that. Maria Hill is a tough character because she is essentially Nick Fury’s right-hand man, but considering she is younger and a female, the relationship could easily fall into a stereotype. This is typically avoided, and I always viewed the Nick Fury/Maria Hill relationship to be a lot like the Yoda/Luke Skywalker relationship in The Empire Strikes Back. We know that the apprentice can clearly handle their shit, but they still also have a lot to learn. We saw Maria Hill questioning Fury on his actions, even doubting his choices, but knew her rank and never opposed his views, clearly knowing that he was the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a reason. She handled what she needed to handle and stepped up when necessary, letting the audience know that she’s be okay in the event that Fury was ever compromised and she would have to take the reins. In  short, EVERYONE DID A GOOD JOB IN VARYING DEGREES. Wow, I could have just said that instead of typing up all those other things. I knew this movie was going to be good. Everyone knew this movie was going to be good. In fact, I’d even say this movie was a GREAT superhero movie. As far as things I didn’t like, I’d say there were only two issues, maybe only one and a half…AND THEY’RE ONLY ISSUES! Let me clarify: I had ZERO problems with this movie. One issue was that I was disappointed that nobody ever shouted “AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!”, but considering this was their very first gathering, I could understand that not showing up naturally. I guess I hoped that in the epilogue, after all of the action, Fury would have mentioned assembling in some way. I know that any lines of dialogue I could come up with right now would be cheesy, but Joss Whedon is a much better writer than I am and I guess I hoped he had found a natural way to slip that in. The other issue was that even though this was a great superhero movie, it was just that…a great SUPERHERO movie. This movie won’t win any Oscars, any acting or directing awards, or be recognized with any other outstanding achievements. This movie is by no means a bad movie, not by a long shot. It was a witty, smart, action-packed, fist-pumping, stand up in your seat and high-five your friends FUN movie. After seeing the trailer for Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises, it was hard to thing of The Avengers as being any sort of game-changer in the superhero genre. I’m also not saying that this movie needed to change the way we view superhero movies, it just felt very safe. Safe isn’t bad, safe is good! That’s why people where helmets and seatbelts! For some reason, which I can’t quite put my finger on, I kept having flashbacks to when I first saw Independence Day. Maybe it was because it was just a big, fun summer movie, or the fact that there were alien invaders, or the fact that you knew the good guys would win, I had the same excited feelings for The Avengers as I had almost twenty years ago with Will Smith. Whether you’re a comic book fan or not, you will have fun with this movie, and even though we spent close to two and a half hours watching this movie, this only felt like the beginning. I was totally willing to watch these characters interacting with another for two and a half more hours, just to see what kind of trouble they’d get into. Oh yeah, and I think I predicted a few years ago how closely this movie would mirror the events of The Ultimates comic book series, and I am glad to know I was right. What the fuck are these Chitauri aliens? JUST CALL THEM GODDAMNED SKRULLS AND BE DONE WITH IT! I think you were right in saying that the movie was good, but it was still a superhero movie, I had the same trailers before it and truly, in comparison, The Avengers is exactly what it is and nothing more, a superhero movie, a very safe one at that. I’m not one for reading comics but, is it really possible to create a superhero movie that would shake things up that much? I also managed to snag a copy of that poster you used above. It won’t get the prime wall spot, but I can still say I watched The Avengers assemble for 5 years. I was just trying to give people what they want! I think everyone knew going into this that plot wasn’t going to be what people were going for. They were just excited to take those few moments they’ve seen in previous movies where Tony Stark talks to Thunderbolt Ross or Agent Coulson finds Thor’s hammer and stretch that into lots of fun interactions.  As far as “shaking things up”, I’d definitely say that The Dark Knight totally shook the status quo of what could be accomplished through the use of characters created in comic books. Although The Avengers is a great superhero movie, I think The Dark Knight is just a great MOVIE, regardless of genre or source material. I was sitting in a diner while those posters went onsale and had to use my mobile to try and get a copy…and failed! You jerk! The only Marvel poster I have that Mondo released were the Olly Moss Captain America set and the Tyler Stout Captain America, which I only got because I won a lottery he held. I’m jealous! Yah, I usually work all day so it is rare I get one. I literally missed the earlier Marvel posters by 5 minutes. I managed to get a Cabin in the Woods one as well. It’s funny, I almost told you my tips for trying to snag these prints, then realized that if you buy one, I can’t! The Cabin in the Woods came out at the same time as The Exorcist one did, and I got Exorcist in my cart, but when I got greedy trying for Cabin in the Woods, they both sold out. MY LIFE SUCKS!"
"Jan 7, 2023",positive," Unlike The X-Men, which arrived full formed in 2000, The Avengers is the comic book version of the supergroup, with stars in their own right coming together (not without some friction and ego-thumping) for a battle royale. So Marvel put together a long term plan, launching their stars in a series of solo films and building an entire universe of heroes and villains for the screen. They teased audiences with brief cross-overs and then, after years of setting it all up, brought together the team: Robert Downey’s cheeky, cocky Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth’s warrior prince Thor, Chris Evans’ earnest Captain America, and Mark Ruffalo taking over as Bruce Banner and The Hulk (the third actor in as many films), giving the character a haunted, embittered edge. To round out the team, the film expands the role of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a slinky superagent, from the second Iron Man film, and adds Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an archer marksman briefly seen in Thor.  Samuel Jackson presides over it all as Nick Fury. It could have been a disaster, with so many characters to juggle and personalities to respect while engaging in a big, noisy, apocalyptic battle with no less than gods and aliens. And it was a measured gamble to bring in Joss Whedon, a man with well-earned fan credentials and an affinity for this kind of genre storytelling, to write and direct. No question that he brings smarts and style and self-aware wit to his productions (Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV, Serenity on the big screen) but his audiences have been, shall we say, small and passionate. It was the perfect marriage of subject and sensibility. You wouldn’t accuse The Avengers of being good drama, but the sprawling, splashy spectacle and its much-much-much-larger-than-life heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen. Whedon loves his characters and enjoys tossing them together to watch the sparks of colliding egos fly. And he has a knack for keeping an eye on the stories and the characters in the mess of battle. But mostly, he embraces the elevated melodrama of the conceit—these superpowered beings are our answer to the Greek gods and heroes, and they were nothing if not unpredictable, mercurial, and vindictive—and then works his way back to the humanity under the costume. And it doesn’t hurt letting Downey off the leash to rile up the gathered egos. You get the sense that, sure, Whedon is having a blast visualizing the scope of a comic book battle with the millions of dollars of CGI at his command, but he’s having even more fun setting these lone wolves loose to sniff around and bark at each other before warily settling into a pack.

"Nov 20, 2022",positive," Developed in 1963 as Marvel’s answer to DC’s superhero team Justice League (featuring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, et al.), The Avengers supplies a comic tradition where numerous superheroes join forces against a common or superior enemy, but not without facing off against each other first. Naturally, superheroes have bold personalities; they’re champions of their particular realm—why shouldn’t they swell with pride about it? But when assembled, such personalities clash and infighting occurs, and our favorite heroes must inevitably learn to work as a team before they can tackle the colossal threat that brought them together. Another comic tradition is the “crossover,” where an overarching storyline unfurls in the pages of multiple issues and usually ends in a double-sized, chromium-covered, mega-book to conclude the storyline. The Avengers is the equivalent of this, but not without planting the seeds for future sequels and spin-offs. Marvel Studios started something wholly unprecedented in 2008 by laying the groundwork for this film in Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. Each individual entry contains tidbits pointing toward this larger film, and by maintaining a hands-on approach to their productions, they ensure each entry is strong enough as a stand-alone feature, but also a key component in a larger whole. As a result, there comes an expectation that The Avengers, being a culmination of several successful blockbusters, should be nothing short of epic. It should appeal to both fanboys and those unfamiliar with comics. Broadening the storylines established by the preceding films, it should give each character their due and yet not allow a single star to shine too brightly. It should be bigger, louder, smarter, more expensive, and ultimately more entertaining than the other films. So, does it succeed? Hell yes. With these requirements in mind, Marvel hired writer-director Joss Whedon to helm The Avengers. He’s a former comic author in the pages of X-Men; he’s garnered a cult following for his TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer; he directed one modestly successful film with Serenity, an offshoot of his show Firefly; and he’s also a resounding comic nerd and generally adored among fanboys. As such, he appreciates the material enough to know what comic fans expect from a film like this, because it’s what he would expect. More importantly, he understands how to make the material universal, adapting it in such a way that general audiences will be able to identify with the central characters without the need to know their off-screen backstory. What’s more, working with a reported budget of $220 million, Whedon has resolved to put every dollar toward wowing his audience with the most satisfying event movie to come out of Hollywood in recent memory. Working from an initial draft by Zak Penn (X-Men: The Last Stand), Whedon’s script picks up where 2011’s Thor and Captain America left off. Banished Asgardian mischief-maker Loki (Tom Hiddleston) forms an alliance with an alien race called the Chitauri (lizard things with biomechanical armor), promising them the Tesseract, an energy cube of unlimited power, if they lay waste to Earth so he may rule. Loki steals the MacGuffin from its current holders, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and his super-spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and hides it while the Chitauri plan their attack. At the same time, Fury relocates to his new HQ—a massive, cloaked flying aircraft carrier, a spectacular effect—and plans for the worst. To find the Tesseract and stop Loki, his agency brings together a proposed team of heroes, The Avengers. When the personalities gather, the film’s first half explores their squabbling and clash of egos, until finally, they band together for an exhausting second half in the battle against Loki and his alien army. Whedon’s storytelling is at its best as he balances screen time amid Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, portrayed by some very fine actors. Top-billed and center stage, Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark dons his Iron Man armor, carting his genius behind his snarky motormouth and signature narcissism. Another classic egocentric, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), travels from Asgard to confront his adopted brother Loki, spouting Shakespearian brogue along the way. Mark Ruffalo, who replaces Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, brings a soft-spoken nerviness and impressive nuance to his character. His alter-ego, The Hulk, was performed through motion capture and looks like Ruffalo; the effect is entirely convincing and occasionally brilliant. Displaced in an era not his own, Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans) brings a naïve but necessary idealism to the team to help unite them. Reprising her Iron Man 2 role, Scarlett Johansson represents the sole female member of the group as the former assassin Black Widow, but Whedon has gone to great lengths to make her stand out arguably more than any other. The newest member, seen briefly in Thor, is a bow-and-arrow sharpshooter named Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who seems somewhat underdeveloped next to the others. Save for the resident Captain, each character could be described as “Does not play well with others.” Obvious attention is placed on Marvel’s most successful hero and franchise fan-favorite Iron Man, but this is hardly a solo effort. Granted, the film’s climax takes place on Manhattan streets surrounding the newly erected Stark Tower, but Stark’s dramatic arc feels less significant than those of Banner or Black Widow. In The Incredible Hulk, Banner still struggled to control his green rages, but in the exciting finale, his counterpart becomes relatively self-aware—he becomes a hero instead of a monster. Seeing this side of Hulk may be more consumable for audiences, who can finally root for a character able to differentiate between good guys and bad guys. Ruffalo, an actor normally associated with indie dramas, admittedly outdoes Norton (and Eric Bana before him) when his character blossoms—enough for audiences to clamor for another solo Hulk feature with Ruffalo as the star. Likewise haunted, we learn much more about Johansson’s Black Widow and her blood-soaked past; her best scene is not only a film-best but provides the film’s most impressive acting: She interrogates Loki, who responds with jaw-droppingly violent and cruel threats, snarled with precision by Hiddleston. The look of terror on Johansson’s face is undeniable and then punctuated with a wonderful turnaround. With any comic book film, there are always mild-to-great disappointments in how the filmmakers have adapted characters from the page to the screen. Some are merely nitpicking on the part of fanboys; others are noticeable by anyone. For example, anyone could tell too many villains clogged up Spider-Man 3, whereas no one outside of a comic book shop cared how Galactus was rendered into a cloud-thing in Fantastic Four 2. Here, fanboys can delight in how much Whedon gets right. But in addition to not exploring Hawkeye enough, Whedon’s choice to provide our heroes with a high body count via anonymous Chitauri aliens (obscure Marvel characters, to be sure) is questionable. Granted, his story infuses elements of The Avengers issue #1 from 1963, in which Loki manipulates Hulk into a frenzy and, in turn, unites the Avengers, but in the last half, Whedon’s focus remains on Loki orchestrating a war of Chitauri pawns. Of course, this decision makes an effective storytelling device by allowing The Avengers’ first assembly to be about an ideal gathering of heroes more than the disposable villains. Still, the comic nerd in me wanted a more recognizable crowd of baddies for our heroes to clobber. (Fortunately, the Chitauri’s presence leads to a post-end-titles scene that will leave fans giddy.) However negligible a disappointment Whedon’s choice of alien race may be, he makes up for it in his arrangement of stunning battle sequences, superhero smackdowns, and most importantly a riotous sense of humor. Early on, Iron Man and Thor go head-to-head, followed by the two powerhouse characters, Thor and Hulk, throwing each other around (their conflict comes up again later on, unexpectedly, abruptly, and hilariously). Likewise, Stark’s quick-witted zingers and Cap’s dislocation in another century furnish no end of laughs in Whedon’s usual brand of smart, punchy dialogue. These conflicts and joking moments are mostly for comic effect, but they also illustrate how non-cohesive these characters seem when placed next to one another, and how they require wrangling to become a team. S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), a nice-guy character present in this ongoing franchise since Iron Man, serves as superhero glue. In a subplot both funny and tender, he’s star-struck by Captain America and wants only f0r the Captain to sign his vintage superhero trading card set. As Whedon injects copious amounts of humor into the proceedings, he plays with his characters’ dynamic and personal limitations in a self-aware style, but without risking the integrity of the characters themselves. Rather, he enhances them. When it’s all over, only one question remains: How will audiences react to solo stories for characters like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk in the future? A film as grandiose as The Avengers threatens to dwarf anything placed next to it. Won’t next year’s Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 seem underwhelming in comparison? Could Marvel have unwittingly undone their smaller franchises by making too good a film here? My hope is that as long as Marvel continues to distribute the kinds of quality superhero films we’ve come to expect since Iron Man, faithful audiences will return for the next building block not only in the individual stories but in anticipation of the inevitable sequel to this giant-sized crossover. Marvel should take care and make the best films they can in the coming years, as they risk turning the in-between movies into nothing more than “the next building block” to The Avengers 2. That said, you won’t likely find a more rousing, purely entertaining, popcorn-munching blockbuster this summer. No spectacle on par with this film has arrived in theaters since Avatar, and at a similarly long 142 minutes, the film breezes by. On these levels, and a plane of sheer superhero movie joy, The Avengers delivers in every respect. It’s not a flawless film (what film is?), but its modest flaws (mostly the quibbles of comic book aficionados) are washed away by its incomparable height of showmanship that has yet to be matched in this genre. While Christopher Nolan’s Batman films elevated the superhero film by achieving an unparalleled dramatic and artistic timbre, Marvel’s decidedly more comic-booky endeavors find their pinnacle in The Avengers. Just as it should, the film outdoes what have now become its five prequels. After four years’ worth of building piece by piece against mounting expectations, Marvel and Whedon have managed to satisfy the majority of fan expectations, and in some ways, even exceeded them."
"Aug 19, 2022",positive," Marvel Studio’s “The Avengers” is the culmination of what may be the most ambitious project in film history. For those movie fans who have been living in a cave for the past several years, Marvel has been releasing several individual superhero movies that have all set the table for this huge event film. Two “Iron Man” pictures, “Captain America”, “Thor”, and “The Incredible Hulk” have all been linked together through brief reoccuring cameos and hidden after-credits scenes that refer to something called “The Avengers Initiative”. As any comic book geek could tell you, that’s a reference to the Marvel superhero team that first debuted in comics in 1963. On the surface, the idea for an Avengers film that’s directly tied into other individual superhero movies sounds great. On the flip side, even though the other films have been good, there are still plenty of areas where “The Avengers” could go off track. Well as a movie and comic book fan, I’m happy to say that “The Avengers” not only meets the challenges of it’s vision, but it’s an action packed adrenaline rush that offers some of the most fun I’ve had at the theater this year. To handle this rather large undertaking, Marvel placed the project in the hands of Joss Whedon. Whedon was a good choice mainly due to his variety of experience. He’s found success in television, film, and comic books and he uses his knowledge of each combined with Disney’s deep pockets to create a movie that would appeal to the fanboy and the casual moviegoer alike. One thing that helps Whedon is that the film doesn’t require your traditional origin story. While we do see the generation of the team, we know all of the characters from the previous Marvel movies so Whedon is able to dive right into the story. That being said, don’t mistake this for a deep, engaging story that will challenge the audience. But I’ll also say that anyone going into “The Avengers” for that has already missed the point. Throughout the other Marvel films, particularly “Captain America”, we learned about a cosmic energy source known as the cosmic cube. In “The Avengers”, S.H.E.I.L.D. head honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has a team of scientists led by physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) trying to harness the power of the cube, now known as the Tesseract. But suddenly the cube activates and opens a portal allowing the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to entire the facility and steal it. Knowing the immense threat associated with the Tesseract being in the wrong hands, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative. But getting such a diverse group of superheroes to cooperate and coexist proves to be a lot harder than expected. Fury starts by contacting Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). He sends her to India to find Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) while sending Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to Stark Tower to speak to Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). While the two are gone, he approaches Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and sends him on a mission to retrieve the Tesseract. Upon hearing of Loki’s involvement, the thunder god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) also entires the mix as does the marksman and assassin known as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Each of the heroes have their own baggage and their own personalities which often times clash to the point of dysfunction. But their disagreements give us some of the movie’s cooler and often times funnier moments. As you would expect the situation worsens and it’s up to the team to pull together or the world will be taken over starting with New York City. It’s a pretty cut-and-dry story but it really works because Whedon understand his characters and he knows what kind of movie he’s trying to make. His familiarity with the Marvel comic book universe is clearly seen throughout the picture but nowhere more than in his treatment of the characters. As a comic book fan, I was really impressed with how they all felt right and it’s clear that the source material played a big role in shaping the on-screen versions. But Whedon never falls into the trap of taking things too seriously. The movie is filled with laugh out loud funny moments that are cleverly used and they never feel cheap or forced. They mix perfectly with the razor-sharp dialogue and the jaw-dropping action sequences. But the fantastic action and special effects shouldn’t surprise anyone. Afterall, “The Avengers” is a superhero action picture and Whedon knows it. The action comes at a furious pace and I can see where some may view it as relentless. Personally, I was completely wrapped up in it. The movie sells the superhero action through some of the most spectacular visuals and editing that you’ll see. I was blown away. I can’t write a review of “The Avengers” without mentioning the incredible cast. One of the reasons the Marvel films and particularly “The Avengers” works so well is because of the amazing casting. Everyone is invested in their character and not one single performer phones it in. Downey, Jr. continues to be the perfect Tony Stark mainly due to his natural ability to use sarcasm and fire off funny quips without hesitation. Chris Evans, known more for his goofier roles,  is also quite good as the serious and straight-laced Captain America. I also really liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. He’s the third actor to take on the role and he nails it. Much like Downey, Jr., Hemsworth is the perfect Thor and he shares some of the film’s best scenes with Hulk. Renner and Johannson also handle their roles very well. But I have to give special time to the wonderful Tom Hiddleston. He’s a remarkably diverse actor and he shows it here. His Loki is mysterious, mischievous, and evil and Hiddleston slithers through his scenes stealing many of them. There are also nice smaller performances from Gregg, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cobie Smulders that are just icing on the cake. I can see where some people may not respond as positively as I did to “The Avengers”. The action is pretty much start-to-finish and if you’re not interested in the characters you’ll have a hard time embracing the story. There are also a few shortcuts taken with the story for the sake of convenience that could have been done a little better. For me, I have a connection to these characters through all my years of comic book reading and this film exceeded my expectations. But being a comic reader isn’t a prerequisite for enjoying this movie. If you’ve liked what Marvel has put out leading to it, you’re going to love “The Avengers”. Sure, it’s a loud, energetic summer popcorn flick, but it’s also a really good one. It’s honest and it never tries to be something it’s not. Featuring one of the better ensemble casts and some top-notch directing from Joss Whedon, “The Avengers” is a big budget blockbuster that actually deserves all the money it’s going to rake it. When’s the next showing? I’m ready to see it again. Yeah I didn’t respond to it as warmly as you have but that is most likely due to having never read a comic in my life.  On the other hand I also agree that you’ve got a great cast, an undeniably iconic bunch of characters and some impressive action so what’s not to like!?  A lot of fun but just not a five star film to me. I don’t give many 5 star ratings and I tried finding reasons not to give this one 5 stars. But I just couldn’t. I simple had too much fun. I was also incredibly impressed with Whedon’s ability to bring the other tie-in films to such a climax (which is what “The Avengers” is). Great review Keith! I just finished writing mine as well, it’ll be up tomorrow. I agree w/ your assessment, it’s definitely a fun movie and one that’d be fun to watch over and over again. Thanks a bunch Ruth! I’m anxious to read your take on the movie. I don’t give many 5 star ratings but this film really worked for me when considering it for exactly what it is. I’m having to wait until the weekend. Hoping to check it out either Friday or Saturday. WELL worth a second viewing on the big screen! Decided to drop the movie down to a 4 1/2 star film. It’s not that I came up with a substantial reason or that a serious flaw or gaping hole came to mind. But I began comparing it to the few other films I have given 5 stars to. I asked myself ” Between “The Avengers” and “______” which movie would I be more inclined to watch again first?” In almost every instant, it was the other 5 star film. I also considered that “The Avengers” really does require the viewing of the other lead-in films to get a grounded understanding of what the bigger picture is. For me that worked extremely well. I saw each lead-in film and I’m a big comic book fan. But how would it appeal to casual fans and how does it stand on it’s own? I still stand by every word of my review and for me personally it was an amazing experience to see these characters come to life before my eyes. And while what Marvel was able to accomplish is nothing short of amazing, I’m not sure if “The Avengers” is what should be called a 5-star all-time classic. A great movie no doubt, but maybe not a 5 star one. The film is an action film.. not a thinking film.. But great film anyway. Had fun watching it. The action however was too fast sometimes. I couldn’t catch up."
"Aug 14, 2022",positive," The words ""never before seen,"" ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and ""revolutionary"" get thrown around a great deal in the movie business.  Everything wants to be on that cutting edge ahead of everyone else.  Few movies deliver on those adjectives.  When that cabin door opens in 1939's The Wizard of Oz and everything sepia turns to color, a new world is opened, not just in the movie, but with movies themselves.  In 1995, when Pixar's Toy Story brought computers into animation, that was a ""game changer,"" another buzz label.  Just three years ago, Avatar's technical achievements in performance-capture technology and 3D filmmaking raised the bar and was something dreamed of, but never thought possible.  I may be picking out too tall of a pedestal, but there's an element of newly broken ground to the culmination that is The Avengers, from Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Pictures. Where The Avengers breaks historic ground is in long-term planning and scope.  Many films in many years have had several years of tedious planning put into them, but not like this.  Plenty of film franchises have gone on to make connected sequels.  The Harry Potter series was built for that, but not like this.  Never before has a film attempted to merge this many individual entities.  Aside from classic horror showdowns like Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, nothing of the sort in terms of uniting characters has ever been attempted at this scale.  In my lifetime, the closest I've ever seen to a character being in more than one project was Michael Keaton's cocky federal agent Ray Nicolette appearing as a cameo in 1998's Out of Sight from Steven Soderbergh and as a supporting character in 1997's Jackie Brown from Quentin Tarantino.  Both films were based on Elmore Leonard novels, but that doesn't mean Jack Foley (George Clooney) and Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) were going to team-up and start a crime spree together down the road.  What The Avengers had in mind was bigger than that. Marvel Studios gained control of their own properties instead of farming them off to the highest bidder (i.e. Spider-Man is housed at Sony and the X-Men universe remains at 20th Century Fox).  Success allowed them to start bankrolling and selling their own movies without splitting with distributors like Paramount and Universal.  That clout increased when Walt Disney purchased all of Marvel Entertainment (movies, comics, and all) on New Year's Eve 2009.  They became their own creative control.  Few franchises can say that. Through uncompromising planning and genius forethought, Marvel shrewdly enacted a master blueprint of developing five individual origin films (2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, 2010's Iron Man 2, and last year's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) from four different directors that built off of one another, were inter-connected, and culminated to the common goal of this massive team-up we are witnessing with The Avengers.   Many studio chiefs (just ask Warner Brothers with their DC Comics library of Superman, Batman, and the like) have dreamed this, but none have tried it and none have succeeded until now.  The Avengers is exactly that: a dream come true.  No one thought it was possible, but Marvel stuck to their guns and the pay-off monumentally delivers.  In The Avengers, we learn very early on that the Cosmic Cube, a.k.a. the Terrasect, a source of endless power wielded and recovered from Captain America: The First Avenger, will be the object of our villain's affections.  That villain is Loki (the excellent Tom Hiddleston), the adopted brother of Thor and brief former king of Asgard, and he demolishes an underground S.H.I.E.L.D. base to take it away from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, with a full role instead of his usual cameos) and company.  He also gains mind control over Terrasect specialist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard from Thor) and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s sharp-shooting archery assassin Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner).  Fearing the Chitauri alien army that Loki has behind him, Fury decides to reactivate his rumored ""Avengers Initiative"" as a response team to Loki's global threat. Fury, the trusty agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), and Natasha ""Black Widow"" Rommanoff (Scarlett Johansson), begin to enlist and recuit the resurrected WWII hero Captain America (Chris Evans), the reclusive gamma scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, taking over for and improving on Edward Norton), and take a gamble working with Iron Man himself, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr., zinging the one-liners). When the God of Thunder, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), tracks Loki to Earth, he too sees that S.H.I.E.L.D. and he have a common enemy and goal, that being recovering their lost colleagues and Terrasect.  Thus, a team is formed, but one with many kinks and differences, which come to light and clash wonderfully as The Avengers plays out. While Robert Downey, Jr. is the headliner, each main character gets their time to shine in the center spotlight with not only ""wow"" moments of action bliss, but also meaty character-driven scenes.  Combined with extremely well-written, laugh-out-loud humor from Joss Whedon, the interactive experiences between these formerly separate personalities is outstanding.  Whedon, as a fellow fanboy on the inside and popular comic book writer on the outside, knew when and how to use and respect the epic moments that occur throughout the movie.  With all of that said, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk steals the show.  He instigates the best shock, awe, and leap-out-of-your-chair spots out of everyone on the team. With this nearly five-year, six-movie blueprint of building to The Avengers completed, it will be interesting to see where Marvel Studios goes with both Avengers sequels and new individual adventures from these now-iconic characters.  Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2 all have the green light.  After this film, I expect a renewed interest for more Hulk that may lead to that character getting a much-deserved sequel, hopefully with Ruffalo at the center.  As with any Marvel movie, stay after for the credits for TWO extra scenes.  One sets up the likely heavy on the horizon for The Avengers 2 and the other is for pure geeky enjoyment.  Once again, all of this scope in The Avengers constitutes nothing short of a movie-making miracle.  Go back a rewrite the definitions for ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and those other buzz words from the opening. The bar has officially been raised. LESSON #1: POWER CORRUPTS-- Simply put, power corrupts, especially if it's a mythical cube that could be a source of limitless energy for an entire planet. When something comes around looking stronger than you, you respond by raising your level of strength.  After that, you want a show of strength to prove that you're still on top. LESSON #2: THE MOTIVATION TO JOIN A TEAM OR A CAUSE-- While Nick Fury and the people from S.H.I.E.L.D. talk a good talk about the threat of alien war, each main character has their own reasons for being there, staying there, and fighting for this cause.  Motivation comes in many forms and many levels of strength.  You will see that going on here. LESSON #3: STEPPING UP WHEN NEEDED-- In order to get Lesson #2 to happen for the motivation to work, the decision must be made to commit and step up when it is necessary.  The decision-making step follows the stimulus of motivation.  Again, each one of the future Avengers steps up in a different way. LESSON #4: WORKING AS A TEAM-- Once you get a team assembled and motivated, they have to work together, not against each other to succeed.  On this team, each big-time player brings a different skill set of strengths and abilities that must be utilized properly and in the right moments in battle.  Kudos to Captain America and his natural leadership ability."
"Jul 7, 2022",positive,"The Avengers, as a movie, can be best described as one of the most prominent examples of a crowd pleaser."
"Feb 11, 2022",positive," Ever since the post-credit sequence in 2008’s Iron Man, fanboy audiences world-wide have eagerly awaited the assembling of The Avengers, Marvel’s answer to DC’s Justice League. The Avengers, made up of such heroes as Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, has always been a beloved comic book property for diehard Marvel fans. Under the watchful eye of S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury, The Avengers would team up to take on the villains in the Marvel canon while saving room for constant bickering among themselves. Ever since the moment Samuel L. Jackson’s Fury told Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark of the planned initiative to bring earth’s mightiest heroes together, Marvel Studios has introduced audiences to not just the carefree, narcissistic Iron Man. Edward Norton brought the Hulk to the screen (again) in ’08, but due to some contractual/creative differences, Norton’s satisfying take on the big green man marked his only outing as the beast. Stark returned to the screen in 2010’s love it-or-hate it Iron Man 2. Aussie Chris Hemsworth (best known at the time for a flash-shot performance in 09’s Star Trek) brought the proud, Shakespearean Thor to the big screen in 2011. In the same year, Chris Evans completed the pre-Avengers rally with Captain America’s origin. Through the thick and thin, these set-up movies have had their strengths and weaknesses. Everyone loves Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, but many complain the Iron Man movies lacked the scale necessary for superhero glory. Most have already forgotten about The Incredible Hulk (a shame, really. I find the film highly underrated.), and Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger were enjoyable introductions to the characters, no more and no less. When Joss Whedon took the reins of The Avengers, a mighty task was placed in his hands. Bringing together so many different variables for one of the most anticipated films in recent memory requires a level of skill that very few directors possess. The Avengers proves that you have to let the experts take on the big projects. In any other hands, The Avengers could have turned out to be a colossal train wreck. Honestly, hiring anyone else but a veteran of the source material would have been a huge mistake on Marvel’s behalf. So far, the studio has tapped directors that fit the content individual films perfectly. Whedon, a proven champion of geekdom, took on the task at hand and created a rare treat for fans of both the comic and film series. While watching The Avengers, you can’t help but see the level of complexity in the story. I can image that bringing five different storylines/dynamic characters together for a summer blockbuster event must have been exhausting, but Whedon made it look easy. His script masterfully pulls together the diverse members of this superhero team to take on a threat long established in the Marvel universe. The Tesseract is no stranger to viewers. This glowing cube of unlimited power came to light at the end of Thor when Nick Fury introduces Stellan Skarsgård’s kindly physicist to the object. Actually, Tony Stark’s dad Howard fished the relic out of the sea when searching for the then-lost-in-action Captain America. The events of Thor must have brought the cube back into the forefronts of the secretive S.H.I.E.L.D’s mindset. Entering into The Avengers, the so-said ‘Avengers Initiative’ is no more. Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark continues to further his weapons-free empire with establishing a new line of Stark Towers, large buildings than run on clean energy. Captain America himself, Steve Rogers, freshly defrosted after 70 years in ice, continues to establish life in the 21st century. Thor, as far as we know, is resting peacefully in his kingdom of Asgard. Thor’s devious brother, Loki, starts off the events of The Avengers with a bang. The cast out prince, a fan of what the Tesseract can do for both him and a few of his otherworldly friends, steals the artifact from S.H.I.E.LD’s headquarters while taking a few of its key members hostage under a mind-altering spell. Nick Fury, seeing this as an act of war, assembles the super-characters together to take on Loki and whatever the trickster god has up his sleeve. From this point on, The Avengers becomes a balancing act of epic proportions. Whedon manages to fit the booming ego of Tony Stark, the gung-ho, to-the-books Captain America, the no-nonsense Thor, the timid-yet-potentially dangerous Brue Banner, the expert archer Hawkeye and the super-spy Black Widow together in the same movie, while throwing in a massive alien army, a boatload of S.H.I.E.L.D agents and some inspired set pieces to boot. Downey Jr.’s Stark never misses a beat, and Evans’ straight-laced take on Captain has never been better. Hemsworth continues to prove why he’s the perfect fit for Thor, and Samuel L. Jackson expands his Nick Fury character into a true, unabashed leader. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow gains added depth from Whedon’s screenplay, and Johansson takes the character to a new level not yet previously established with her minimal presence in Iron Man 2. Tom Hiddleston continues to impress as the vile Loki, and Clark Gregg continues to bring the fun with his straight-faced Agent Coulson (or, to Stark’s girlfriend Pepper Potts, Phil). Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye adds to the fun, and newcomer Cobie Smulders holds her own as Maria Hill, Fury’s right-hand woman. I couldn’t help but become enamored with Mark Ruffalo’s take on Bruce Banner. Both he and Whedon capture the character in a way that manages to honor the comic roots while bringing a fresh take to both Bruce and ‘the other guy.’ While Whedon takes Hulk to smash-happy nirvana in the film’s latter sequences, Ruffalo’s quasi-sarcastic portrayal of Banner had me hooked. Whedon gave him the words, but Ruffalo brought the power. His scenes with Downey Jr. create instant gratification. The action sequences in this film rise above anything else in Marvel’s long lineage of theatrical releases. We’ve seen plenty of the New York assault in the promotional material, but one striking section of the film has gone largely unspoiled, and for good reason. Whedon orchestrates the mayhem with sheer amazement, allowing for the characters to shine rather than fade into the scenery – a bane in Michael Bay’s Transformers series. While the film rests heavily on scientific jargon to lead the plot during the first half, Whedon pushes the gas in the last hour-and-a-half-or-so to create one eye-popping, hair-raising scene after the other. Thankfully, the film never forgets to add in a laugh here and there. Whether it’s one of Tony Stark’s wise quips or the realization of a pop culture reference on Cap’s behalf, The Avengers remains constantly funny without ever sacrificing the seriousness of the scale. From now on, superhero movies in the Marvel universe will look to The Avengers as a shining beacon of what these films can aspire to be. If you get the right talent in the driver’s seat to lead the endeavor, amazing benefits can be reaped. Joss Whedon deserves a big pat on the back for what he did with The Avengers. The story works, the acting is superb, the humor is on key and the action sequences are breath-taking."
"Jul 28, 2021",positive," EnlargePeter OpaskarArs Technica turns 21 at the end of this year, but film coverage on site can't exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet. Quietly, we've been reviewing movies on the Internet for 11 years now—a baker's dozen years if reviews of 3D experiences count—starting with this Max Payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism. But beginning in 2014, we made film a regular topic on site. And these days we annually bounce from SXSW to Fantastic Fest with plenty of regional film events in between. Now, this ain't Variety, and we do not write about everything (though we have covered Beauty and The Beast and The Jungle Book somehow). But Ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section. We failed at Vulcan salutes with Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds. We caught the premiere of a Academy Award-nominated movie at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Somehow, we even helped save a Star Wars-adjacent movie from obscurity (earning an IMDb credit and inspiring a full-length remake in the process).

So with the end of the decade rapidly approaching, we felt it was OK to indulge our film list-making impulses. This is not necessarily a Best Films of the decade list—undeniably great things like Lady Bird, Moonlight, The Master, Bridesmaids, et al. are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science, technology, and genre fare. It is not a list of the Most Important films, either, as this decade of streaming's rise, female directors taking the reins, continued globalization of cinema, and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinema-centric press. But the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the Orbital HQ years later, and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward. It's probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry, audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema, too. It turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama (though we all underrated First Man, folks). If you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may have been the in-theater experience of the decade. The vastness of space has never been more vivid, even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists. The Matt Damon-led The Martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting, continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science. No one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016, but Arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense, gripping sci-fi story. And Hidden Figures puts the familiar period-piece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate. Add any number of other fine space movies to this lot—Interstellar, Ad Astra, etc.—but this quartet revived a cinematic subset Ars will always have a fondness for. The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes. By no means did it start here (the Nolan Batman trilogy began in the 2000s, as did the MCU with Iron Man in 2008), but it became an expanded universe, cinematic event these last 10 years. The first Avengers hit in 2012, and box offices haven't looked back since. Picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible. Your preferences of memorable Spider-Man (Into the Spider-Verse), Iron-Man (Iron Man 2), Captain America (Winter Soldier), or other regulation superhero flicks (Ragnarok ever-so-slightly over the original Deadpool?) may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward. The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular (Avengers: End Game over the original Guardians by a hair). But the caped crusades we'll remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree. Black Panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity. Logan took a hero long familiar to film-goers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a Western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process. And while Wonder Woman may be the most straightforward super-hero-y of the three, it showed a female-led comic book conquest was worth doing, especially when it leveraged well-executed period-piece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry. For the future of the then-beleaguered DC Comics entertainment arm, Wonder Woman also proved everything didn't have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience (all the fun being had in HBO's Watchmen seems to indicate DC took the hint). And, OK, it's not a traditional superhero movie, but we couldn't make an of-the-decade film list and exclude Mad Max: Fury Road entirely. Like more traditional caped-crusader flicks, this is an existing IP with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original. It starts with a very super villain-y evil plot (our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the bad-team War Boys; another hero has to help a group of women known as the Five Wives escape forced procreations). The film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character. Finally, perhaps most like the trio above, this newest Mad Max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar post-apocalyptic world. Max Rockatansky may be back (invigorated by Tom Hardy), but the star of the show is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the post-apocalyptic female hero sci-fi action fans deserve."
"Jun 24, 2021",positive," The Avengers is the biggest success Marvel, Disney, and the entire comic book movie industry has ever seen. Directed by Joss Whedon of Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame, The Avengers was the (first) end result of the shared universe experiment that Marvel Studios was attempting. This finally brought Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and more all together for a true celebratory fireworks display. If this worked, it would change the landscape of film forever. The Avengers would go on to not just be Marvel Studio’s biggest hit, but it would become the third highest-grossing film of all time, only behind James Cameron’s Avatar and Titanic. It is the textbook example of a comic book movie, the gold standard to strive for, and a validation of comic book storytelling as an art form. It was a truly monumental success. How was this achieved? The choice for Joss Whedon to direct was perfect. Whedon is a master at directing an ensemble cast, to the point where it’s basically what he’s known for. The exciting part of The Avengers is seeing all of these different characters together and interacting onscreen, and Whedon’s penchant for being able to juggle multiple characters and their stories, in addition to his trademark witty dialogue, ensured that every Avenger got their time to shine, and their own arcs to go through. It’s an impressive feat for a movie of this scale. The Avengers also proved to be accessible to general audiences, even those who had never seen a single Marvel film beforehand. You don’t necessarily need to have seen any of the previous films to understand what’s happening in The Avengers, every character’s introduction at the beginning of the film tells you all you need to know about them. Another smart choice the film makes is that it keeps the plot simple and streamlined. The Avengers needs to overcome their differences and work together to stop Loki and his alien army. That’s really it, and the film never deviates from it. Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner is leaps and bounds better than Edward Norton’s. Ruffalo’s Banner is cautious and he’s someone who fears The Hulk not because of any danger to himself, but because he knows innocent people will be hurt. His face reads deep emotional pain and sadness over the life he was robbed of, but he also has a strange sense of humor about his situation. At this point in his life, Bruce has given up trying to rid himself of The Hulk and instead has a sort of good natured-ness about his condition, understanding that it’s something he simply has to try and live with. He also still tries to do some good in the world, even in hiding. We see that he’s become a local doctor in the country he’s hiding out in. Ruffalo somehow balances levity and charisma, which Norton’s Banner never had, with even more emotional depth than Norton’s Banner ever had. He brings real subtlety to what is arguably Marvel’s least subtle character. And he accomplishes all of this in one single scene: His introduction and conversation with Natasha. And sparks were flying between those two in that scene and throughout the whole film; I resent the argument that their romance in Age of Ultron “came out of nowhere”, but we’ll save that discussion for another time. The Hulk himself finally became a character to cheer for. This marked the first time he was truly successful onscreen, because he’s just so much fun in it. The iconic “I’m always angry” scene is still the greatest Hulk transformation to date, and his delighted grin at Cap’s orders to simply “smash” shows us that he’s having a good time, so we do too. The visuals of Hulk are acceptable in his solo film, but The Avengers is the first time he doesn’t just look good, but looks great. I’m sure having some Disney money helped the motion capture technology this time around. The Avengers is also the first time we see Hulk use his powers for something other than destruction. His leap and catch to save Tony from his free fall received just as many cheers and applause in the theater as the legendary shot of all the heroes circled together. Not only does The Avengers stand on its own without a hitch, but the events of the film would go on to directly affect all future films, with ideas brought up in The Avengers coming back for our heroes to deal with. Tony Stark faces the first situation that he truly can’t have any sort of control over. It’s a situation he can barely even comprehend. The concept of aliens and gods is completely foreign to Tony; a threat he never even considered to be a possibility until now. And in the climactic battle, in his first truly heroic, selfless act, he almost loses his life. This all would go on to haunt him throughout the rest of the MCU, and it is the biggest influence on his behavior and decisions moving forward. Steve Rogers is fresh out of his frozen slumber and trying to understand his place in the modern world. What does Captain America represent to the current climate, if anything? “Aren’t the stars and stripes a little old-fashioned?” he asks
Coulson. Steve serves the purpose of the everyman in this film. He isn’t just new to aliens, he’s new to everything, to the very world that the film takes place in. He starts off with the idea of “We have orders. We should follow them.” But Tony’s rebellious and untrusting nature, paired with Bruce’s own suspicions, are enough to send Steve on his own investigation into the very people he works for. What he finds is that S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction, even basing these weapons off the inventions of Hydra and their use of the Tesseract. It’s a direct betrayal to what Steve thinks S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for, and it reminds him that the world, even seventy years in the future, with all of its social and technological progress, is never as black and white as it may appear. He, along with Natasha and Clint, defy their orders as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., steal a Quinjet, and take off to fight in the Battle of New York. While he does continue to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., his trust in them is broken and he knows them to be flawed. This loss of trust in the government he devoted his life to serve follows him throughout the rest of his time in the MCU. Natasha proves to be more than just a capable fighter, she is first and foremost a spy, and a master at mental manipulation. From the interrogation in her introduction to her ability to outsmart the literal God of Mischief himself into giving away his plan, Black Widow is really given her due here. Her time working for the KGB and even S.H.I.E.L.D. means that she has blood on her hands and crimes to make up for. “I’ve got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.” Natasha chooses to try and make the really heroic decisions, to protect and fight for a better world, to make up for the mistakes of her past and hopefully clear her conscious. Clint Barton, after being brainwashed by Loki, wants to make up for the people he killed while doing Loki’s bidding, and maybe even get a little revenge. Clint is also just a really good guy who always does the right thing, similar to Steve Rogers. Is Hawkeye wasted in this film? A bit, yes. Having him be mind-controlled for most of the runtime does prevent us from getting to know the man, but it does show us how capable Hawkeye is as an adversary. He takes down an entire helicarrier and brings S.H.I.E.L.D. practically to its knees, almost single-handedly. So while we may have not gotten much of his character, we do get to see skills on full display. He also gets some of the best action beats in the Battle of New York. Thor comes to Earth to stop Loki, but also wants to save him. Thor still holds out hope that his brother can be redeemed and come home. He never fights him with the intention of killing him, and during every altercation he pleads with Loki to stop his conquest, to realize that he has the power to put an end to it and do the right thing. Thor tragically realizes that his brother may simply be too far gone, and beyond saving. Loki murders Coulson in front of him, and then proceeds to try and kill Thor without hesitation. In order to save the planet, he has to steel himself and be prepared to kill his own brother if it comes to it. It’s a test not just for his dedication to being Earth’s protector, but for his worthiness to lead and take the throne of his own planet. Speaking of the God of Mischief, Loki became the real breakout of The Avengers, creating a massive fanbase and adoration for the villain. How was this accomplished? In an email sent to Joss Whedon, Tom Hiddleston, an actor who one hundred percent understands and dedicates himself to the character, sums everything up about why Loki works so well as the antagonist for the Avengers. “It’s high operatic villainy alongside detached throwaway tongue-in-cheek; plus the “real menace” and his closely guarded suitcase of pain. It’s grand and epic and majestic and poetic and lyrical and wicked and rich and badass. Throughout you continue to put Loki on some kind of pedestal of regal significance and then consistently tear him down. He gets battered, punched, blasted, side-swiped, roared at, sent tumbling on his back, and every time he gets back up smiling, wickedly, never for a second losing his eloquence, style, wit, self-aggrandizement or grandeur, and you never send him up or deny him his true intelligence. That he loves to make an entrance, that he has a taste for the grand gesture, the big speech, the spectacle.” Loki earns his right to be the ultimate baddie that no Avenger can beat on their own; a Saturday morning cartoon, mustache-twirling villain, while at the same time a genuinely menacing, incredibly intelligent, manipulative mastermind. He repeatedly outwits our heroes, and in doing so forces them to overcome their differences and work together to finally defeat him. His ability to bring the Avengers to their lowest point is what eventually leads to his own downfall. Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson ends up being the secret weapon of the film. Coulson is the consistent string that ties together all of the films prior, even more than Nick Fury. He has a personal relationship with Natasha, Clint, Tony and Pepper, Thor, and, in a genius move, is revealed to be the biggest Captain America fanboy. It adds a new level of innocence to the character and Whedon knows how to make him lovable, giving him the light comedic moments in the first half of the film. Coulson is the representation of all the comic book fans who are sitting in the theater eager to finally see their heroes come together on the big screen. He’s the biggest advocator for the Avengers Initiative and believes in every single one of them and their ability to save the world. “We need you.” he tells Tony in Iron Man 2, in the first time he drops his tough government persona and reveals his true, genuinely good-hearted nature. It’s why his death at the hands of Loki works. Coulson’s murder is the loss of innocence, the first true death of a recurring character in the MCU. Coulson never gets to see his dream of the Avengers together come to fruition, if anything he only witnesses the opposite. Yet with his dying breath he understands what his death might be able to accomplish. “This was never gonna work if they didn’t have something to…” Coulson’s death serves as the catalyst that finally brings The Avengers together, and it specifically spurs Tony and Steve into action. Tony, who was initially cautious around Coulson, learns to trust and respect him because he learns that Pepper does. His death wakes him up to the fact that his selfishness and uncooperativeness has consequences when the stakes are this high, and innocent people’s lives are at stake. Steve learns what Captain America means, or should mean, to the people of the modern world, and what he needs to do to accomplish that. “With everything that’s about to happen, people might just need a little old-fashioned.” Coulson tells him. All of this leads us to the grand finale, the fireworks display, the celebration of all of the work and dedication that Marvel Studios put together in this new idea of a shared movie universe. The Battle of New York works not just purely as spectacle, though it certainly is that, but as character-driven action. An action sequence that is earned, that makes all of the build up throughout the previous films worth it. The Avengers, finally assembled, working together to stop the biggest threat the world has ever faced. Emphasis is put on not just taking down aliens, but on saving and protecting the people they’re fighting for. This role primarily goes to our heart and soul, Captain America, who makes containment of the alien army the number one priority, choosing to stay on the ground and defend a single choke point, saving and getting as many civilians to safety as he can. The Avengers remains one of the only superhero universes where the films remember that they need to show us the heroes actually saving people, not just fighting. The Battle of New York remains one of the greatest action sequences to ever be put onscreen, and it has yet to be topped in the MCU (though Infinity War is looking into giving it a run for its money). It works on every level, and is absolutely thrilling to watch no matter how many times you’ve seen it. The Avengers was an event. It was something that everyone had to go see and witness. The idea of multiple characters from several different movies appearing all together in one big extravaganza was completely new and exciting. It’s something that no one has able to successfully replicate since. Look at Sony’s Amazing Spider-Man universe (scrapped after only two films), Universal’s Dark Universe (dead before it even began, only one film in) and, of course, DC’s ill-fated Justice League universe (in disarray after two films and who’s grand team-up film ended up being their lowest-grossing out of all of them). Why was The Avengers successful where others weren’t? Marvel’s secret is the immense amount of planning and forethought they put into their universe, and above all, their dedication and time that they commit to all of their characters. It’s why I’ve spent this entire essay primarily talking about each one of them. The awesome spectacle is nothing if I don’t care about who’s involved. Marvel’s devotion to the Avengers team and the time spent with each of them is what makes it all work. It’s what makes the grand display of an hour long action scene worth it and thrilling. Even though The Avengers was dropped down to fifth place after the 2015 nostalgia trip that was Jurassic World and The Force Awakens, it remains a benchmark of entertainment and popular culture. Marvel Studios knew that this was make it or break it time. They delivered, and the world has never been the same since. Connections to the MCU: The Battle of New York and the public emergence of the Avengers is the biggest impacting moment of the entire MCU, and the aftermath of it all would go on to affect not just the films but the television shows as well. Every show set in the MCU, minus Agent Carter, takes place post-Avengers. Spider-Man: Homecoming deals with people getting their hands on leftover alien technology, Tony gets some serious PTSD from the battle, Loki’s deeds carry on into the Thor sequels. S.H.I.E.L.D. secretly planning to make weapons from the energy of the Tesseract, the World Security Council attempting to nuke New York City, and Fury’s little white lie surrounding Coulson’s death, all serve to show the darker underbelly of the organization, an idea that would come back in the biggest way possible in The Winter Soldier. A member of that council would go on to become a major antagonist in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and of course, Coulson would return to spearhead that very show. We are also given our first glimpse at the ultimate MCU villain, Thanos. He gives Loki the scepter and the army to steal the Tesseract and conquer Earth for him. Loki’s failure and loss of not one, but two Infinity Stones does not bode well for his fate when he runs into Thanos again in Infinity War.

"Apr 22, 2021",positive," There are several moments during Joss Whedon’s ecstatically awaited Avengers Assemble – the Marvel franchise mash-up promised since the Samuel L. Jackson-starring post-credits sting of 2008’s Iron Man – that you’re certain you’re watching, quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. This sensation doesn’t last too long, obviously (you’ll probably come to your senses during a post-film-wee moment of clarity) but, considering the extent to which the film pulls out all the stops in its relentless desire to simply entertain you as much as possible, is seems cruel and churlish not to hyperbolise just a little.  Whedon, of course, is currently enjoying success at the moment with the magnificently ape-shit The Cabin in the Woods, yet Avengers Assemble marks the ex-Buffy helmer’s first stint as director since 2005’s Serenity, the big-screen version of his so-brilliant-it-was-disastrously-unpopular TV series Firefly. That evidence of this directing hiatus isn’t present in Avengers Assemble is something of an understatement: Whedon has not only managed to tie together the disparate strands of the brands Marvel wanted to unite, he’s done so in a film which is bombastic, hilarious, confidently and – in places – exquisitely directed. Most importantly of all, it’s hard to recall another film released in recent years that is simply this much fun, from beginning to unapologetically preposterous end. Of course, in order to get our heroes together in the first place we need an enemy worthy of their attention. Step up Tom Hiddlestone’s charismatic and deliciously evil Loki, last seen on the business end of a harsh bollocking in Thor, who teams up with a reassuringly nasty race of indiscriminate aliens to enslave the Earth (hey look, no one said it was The Wire). Whedon then wastes little time before re-acquainting us with those we’re here to see: Samuel L Jackson’s super-spy Nick Fury, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, stepping into the perpetually-torn shoes of Bruce Banner), Thor (Chris Helmsworth), as well as newcomers Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlet Johansen). Most of the bit-players from each character’s solo efforts also get a look in, and it’s a real treat for those who’ve managed to see each of the separate hero’s films that have led to this one. Whedon doesn’t exclude those that haven’t, though – enough back-story is given for each to bring the audience up to speed, so if you haven’t seen The Hulk or Thor then don’t worry, you won’t have any trouble keeping up. Goodies, baddies, McGuffin, that’s all you need to know – the deeper layers are there for those who want them. And, when the ensemble is brought together, Avengers Assemble truly begins to shine.  Wedon’s shtick, if it’s not unfair to call it such, is sassy, witty scripts, and he’s on career-best, zinging form here. Downey Jnr is effortlessly droll, while no shortage of surprise laughs come from the unlikelier members of the group who, for the most part, each get their own golden chucklesome script nuggets. You just get the sense that everyone involved is having a rollocking good time, and this permeates into you through some form of chummy, good-natured osmosis. It’s only Renner’s Hawkeye that feels a little underused; this is, admittedly, for plot reasons which won’t divulge, but we may have to wait for the mooted Hawkeye spin-off to give him the cuss-quipping screen time he deserves. When the excrement hits the propeller, which is frequently does, Whedon also orchestrates the vast action scenes with aplomb and joyous flair. Michael Bay, the leading purveyor of epic, mindless action, could learn a thing or two here: these scenes are thrilling and refreshing in their clarity, largely eschewing the shaky-cam and quick-cut histrionics that hinder so many films of this scale. Sure, there’s little in the way of genuine threat, but in giving an audience what it wants (seeing these heroes team up to lay the smack well and truly down) Avengers Assemble delivers, and then some, and then a bit more. Then it nips out for a fag, comes back, and delivers again. The only real complaints are inherent to the plot itself, which is fairly standard, maniacal overlord fare. It’s serviceable and, certainly, never dull, but these are plot points that have been pounded into flat patties by countless films that have come before, and the sense that story had to be kept light in order to give screen time to the re-establishment of the characters pervades. The film’s also cheesier than a Wotsit fondue on occasion, but – crucially – it’s always aware of it, and we’re all in on the joke, whether you’re a Stella-guzzling comic-phobe or pale, seasoned uber-geek. Also, by way of minor gripe, Captain America is shit. Just saying. 
Captain America’s shitness aside, Avengers Assemble somehow manages to be much more than the sum of its parts, making it the best time you’ll have a the cinema this week, and probably for a good few weeks to come. Like a beautiful superhero’s game of soggy biscuit, only everybody wins and no one wants to cry afterwards. A mega-budget action extravaganza that succeeds on just about every level, and it’s one you should certainly go and see as soon as possible. "
"Apr 1, 2021",positive," Otherwise known as “The Avengers” everywhere else in the world, Avengers Assemble sees the first “Marvel Team Up” film that nobody was quite sure if it would work… until it cracked a billion at the box office! While Iron Man obviously kicked the MCU off, it was this film that sold both fans and studios on the idea that a shared universe of visual media could not only be pulled off, but if done right can be pretty damn lucrative, and trust me: this was done right! So let’s take a look at the first Avengers film, shall we? When Thor’s evil brother Loki gains access to the unlimited power of the energy cube called the Tesseract, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., initiates a superhero recruitment effort to defeat the unprecedented threat to Earth. Joining Fury’s “Avengers” are Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. The Avengers succeeds due to two reasons: a fantastic cast and some really great and exciting action scenes (sadly the director of which has turned out to not be a very unpleasant man, but ah well… not going hold that against the cast and crew of the film…) Robert Downey Jr. is still the focus of a lot of the attention as Tony Stark / Iron Man but thankfully that is entirely in his character, and he’s great at it! Chris Evans’ Captain America, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner / Hulk do all get plenty of screen time though, and their various interactions are great: Cap and Stark arguing due to completely different philosophies on life, Thor getting rubbed the wrong way due to his lack of knowledge on Earthly affairs, and Stark trying to poke and prod Banner out of curiosity and eventually to motivate him to not be afraid of his power. This was Ruffalo’s first appearance in the role and he nails it, both funny and vulnerable, a really good take on the character. Then there’s Tom Hiddleston as Loki, once again perfectly nailing the snide and sarcastic villain role, and again his scenes with the Avengers themselves are all so well written and enjoyable. The crazy thing about this ensemble is that there are many other cast members to mention! Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is… well, Samuel L. Jackson, but that plays well in the role he has and he has the kind of presence to be the man who pulls all these people together. Scarlett Johansson is back as Black Widow, which given she is the only female member of the main cast shows how far the MCU has come on that from in the last decade, and she does a good job as “bad-ass secret agent”, her interaction with Banner / Hulk are fun as well. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye is good but sadly he does spend a lot of the film as a mind controlled zombie, but hey-ho, and finally we get more of Clark Gregg as SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson and Stellan Skarsgard back as Erik Selvig to continue the cliffhanger from Thor. It also features Cobie Smulders as high ranking SHIELD member Maria Hill, though beyond an exciting chase at the start of the film her role is limited. Speaking of the start of the film: here’s a quick sum up of the plot! Loki takes the tesseract, mind-controls a bunch of people (including Hawkeye), causes some trouble as he gathers equipment to open a portal and let some alien allies invade, and then gets caught by a combination of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. I still love a moment where Thor and Loki are arguing on a cliff and Thor is tackled away mid-sentence by Iron Man (who at this point doesn’t know if he’s friend or foe) and Loki just acts like he was waiting for the rest of the conversation to happen. After a fun mini-battle everyone joins up on Nick Fury’s helicarrier where Bruce Banner and Black Widow are also based and soon it comes under attack by the people who are under Loki’s influence. Banner Hulks up, Thor is outsmarted and thrown to the Earth and Agent Coulson is killed (… for now, if you count Agents of SHIELD…) Coulson’s death becomes the catalyst to force the team to work together, which is good because Loki successful opens up a portal above New York and lets a whole army of Chitauri warriors invade. Otherwise the only other complaint you could have is if you don’t like this kind of super hero, quippy and action-y film, but in that case… why are you watching it?"
"Dec 1, 2020",negative," o how does one pose a threat to a demigod, a supersoldier, a man in an indestructible metal suit, and a hulking green juggernaut? Well, it can’t really be done. But with a surplus of loud explosions, massive battles, and limitless CG effects, the right amount of adventure to appease fans of such monumental clashes between good and evil can be feigned. “The Avengers” keeps the concepts simple enough, but piles on so much mayhem it can become wearisome to those not previously invested in its subjects and willing to readily believe in the delirious events transpiring on screen. Viewers not cheering by the time the gang of superheroes takes down a giant mechanical space worm probably knew a long time ago this movie wasn’t for them. As Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the agents of the secret military agency S.H.I.E.L.D. attempt to harness the power of the extraterrestrial energy source known as the Tesseract, the villainous exiled demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth to steal it. Along with the cube, Loki brainwashes and kidnaps assassin Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) to aid in his devious plot to conquer all of humanity. To combat this new threat, Fury reinstitutes his scrapped “Avengers” initiative and sets about gathering together the world’s greatest heroes – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The posing, evil grimacing to denote villainy, and arsenal of one-liners are at an all-time high in “The Avengers,” which works to assemble a group of superheroes that constantly compete for screen time, one-upmanship, and the last laugh. The humor is actually overdone, poking fun at all of the characters and situations to the point that audiences will probably question which absurdities they should be taking seriously. And that’s detrimental in a film overflowing with fantastical silliness, both visually and from dialogue. It’s bad enough that despite gods and alien worlds, the extremely advanced technology is still unbelievable – and that jargon like gamma signature, thermonuclear, quantum, fusion, and cognitive recalibration sound so ludicrously forced for the sake of convincing viewers that the Avengers’ instruments are beyond general comprehension. Although it’s not quite a sequel, it still only feels appropriate to measure it up to films like “Transformers 3,” “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,” “Iron Man 2,” “Superman Returns,” and the like. It’s not as mind-numbingly nonsensical as a few of the aforementioned titles, but it doesn’t look or feel original, and the abundance of special effects and overwhelming destruction create nonstop spectacle without substance. Never once is there any real peril; this is made upsettingly apparent with the inclusion of non-superheroes Black Widow and Hawkeye, who are just too drastically inferior to go up against global catastrophes initiated by intergalactic alien wargods. With a complete lack of definition for the various powers exhibited by the antagonists and protagonists alike, their massive demolition of Manhattan and battling one another for the title of “toughest superhero” means very little. They might as well all be invincible. No villain is formidable enough and no force threatening enough for these cartoonish CG-inundated extravagances to be sympathetic.

"Jun 11, 2020",positive," Film critics haven't been mincing words about The Avengers. From Hollywood Life and The Washington Times to the Dekalb County Times-Journal, pundits of the silver screen are not only praising Joss Whedon's take on the band of Marvel icons, but referring to his motion picture as the greatest superhero film ever made. While I don't quite agree with this superlative assessment, it hits very close to the truth.  A brief retrospective of recent cinematic history is necessary to fully understand why. The last dozen years have been something of a Golden Age in comic book movies. Ever since the success of Bryan Singer's X-Men in the summer of 2000, cineplexes have been bursting at the seams with narratives inspired by or ripped straight from the pulpy pages of graphic novels. Lucrative blockbusters like Spider-Man, Spider-Man 3, and The Dark Knight were the highest grossing films in their respective years of release (2002, 2007, and 2008), while especially acclaimed entries like Iron Man and The Dark Knight have netted prestigious Oscar nominations and spots on critical top ten lists. In the midst of this deluge, two categories have emerged. First there are the traditional superhero stories, characterized by the familiar tropes of likeable good guys, memorable baddies, and unapologetically melodramatic three-act story archs (the Spider-Man and Iron Man series are perhaps the most popular in this group). Alongside those have been the more existential pieces, defined by their topicality, thematic depth, and attempts to transcend normative genre strictures (more famous examples include Unbreakable, The Dark Knight, and Watchmen). Saying that The Avengers falls into the first category, though true, does it a bit of an injustice. While no single aspect of it stands out as unusually superb, every element that needs to fall into place does so beautifully. As these types of movies rise or fall based largely on the merits of the characters, it certainly helps that The Avengers has quite a range of compelling figures in its arsenal. Leading the pack of heroes are a pair of dueling archetypes (metaphorically and literally): Iron Man/Tony Stark, a blithely egomaniacal playboy and renaissance man, and Captain America/Steve Rogers, whose Boy Scoutish persona almost comes across like Marvel Comic's answer to DC's Superman. They are accompanied by the mild-mannered Dr. Bruce Banner, who when roused to anger transforms into the terrifying green behemoth known as the Hulk; Thor, the Norse god of thunder; Black Widow, a Russian superspy; and Hawkeye, a master archer and ""World's Greatest Marksman."" This eclectic crew is led by Nick Fury, director of a government military agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D that is responsible for assembling the titular Avengers to deal with crises once they become global in scale. Each of these characters is perfectly cast, from Robert Downey Jr. as the inimitably sharp-tongued Stark to Samuel L. Jackson as the sullen but gravitas-laden Fury. The standout here is almost certainly Mark Ruffalo as Banner, whose depiction of a man deftly controlling the tempest of his own emotions is memorable in its stirring poignance. Tying all of them together is a plot in which the heroes search for a MacGuffin known as the Tesseract that must be kept out of the hands of Loki, the Norse god of mischief and brother to Thor who aspires to use that device to (of course) rule the world. While the story itself is not particularly original, it is utilized to its fullest potential, keeping the narrative running at a smooth clip and causing its two-and-a-half hour running time to fly right by. All of this is spiced up by Whedon's distinctively intelligent and engaging writing style. From witty lines (Tony Stark introducing himself to Bruce Banner: ""Dr. Banner, your work is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."") to unexpected moments of physical comedy (such as a scene in which one character receives a surprising but richly deserved humiliating beating), the screenplay proves to be almost as much of a character as any of the protagonists themselves, adding levity to prevent the story from being bogged down in its own sturm und drang while maintaining the proper dramatic perspective throughout the proceedings. This isn't to say that The Avengers is without its weaknesses. While Loki is an adequately detestable villain, he hardly compares to comicdom's more legendary celluloid foes (Alfred Molina's Doctor Octavius, Heath Ledger's The Joker), and the story's intelligence is more surface than substantive, causing it to lack the thoughtfulness of The Dark Knight or philosophical layering of Watchmen. Nevertheless, The Avengers stands out as a practically perfect popcorn flick, thoroughly entertaining even the most disillusioned moviegoers (of which I am one) from the opening frame to the second post-credits scene (which I highly recommend audience members stick around to see). When it comes to the traditional type of superhero movie, it's hard to do any better."

"Feb 14, 2020",positive," For the past few years, every product of the Marvel Comics film portfolio has been building to this. Captain America’s big screen debut was subtitled prominently as ‘The First Avenger’, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), has been popping up in post-credits scenes for years. Looking to emulate the structure and crossovers of their comics, Avengers Assemble brings together the separate franchises of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the newly recast Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), as well as previous supporting characters. Does Avengers Assemble deliver, or collapse under the burden? It’s not without its flaws, but Joss Whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film, the best Marvel-based one to date, and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots. The film opens with Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. at a facility attempting to harness an immense source of power, the Tesseract. Everything is promptly and rudely interrupted by Loki (Tom Hiddlestone), the villainous brother last seen on the big screen having a bit of a siblings tiff with his brother Thor. Making off with the Tesseract, the situation quickly spirals out of the control of us conventional mortals, and Fury looks to assemble the title ensemble in order to save Earth, or at the very least ‘avenge it’ as Downey’s Stark puts it. The tone of the film has been pitched extremely well by writer/director Whedon, who isn’t afraid to have the film’s comic roots shine through. There are often what appear to be cheese-on-toast moments in the dialogue, but fortunately the film earns itself enough good will to allow this to sit nicely within the tonal framework. In addition, the fantasy elements of the likes of Thor have been married very well with the more ‘realistic’ tech-based world of Iron Man. Even if this wasn’t the case, the verbal ripostes between the various heroes, all with their own issues and egos, often sparkles with the sort of irreverent humour and wit one would expect from Joss Whedon. As good as Christopher Nolan’s take on DC Comics’ Batman has been, this Marvel ensemble is an entirely different and more light-hearted beast. Although everyone is on generally good thespian form, especially Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki, the film predictably strains a little under the weight of four established franchises. In the end, to set everyone up for the 3rd act requires a plot development that is dependent on a certain amount of familiarity with previous Marvel films, and could feel a little forced. Additionally, new or previously peripheral characters such as Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow have little time to develop as more than action fodder or eye candy. Having said this, it’s wrong to suggest it actively detracts from the film – but it is nonetheless disappointing given how Avengers Assemble exceeds elsewhere. With these minor criticisms in mind, it’s impressive that the majority of the film could work either as the distillation of the separate Marvel franchises or an introduction for the uninitiated. Certain sequences and references will feel more at home and appreciated by those who have seen the solo efforts, but the fast-paced and engaging plot keeps things bouncing along – just at the point the film could lose steam, the pace and action picks up for a truly superb closing battle. It is particularly admirable that Avengers Assemble is clearly the best big-screen depiction of the Incredible Hulk – a character that has arguably defeated a talented director in Ang Lee and (in a separate pseudo-reboot) an excellent actor in Edward Norton. Mark Ruffalo’s affable turn as the witty but uneasy Banner is underscored by edge-of-the-seat tension over his alter-ego’s eventual appearance (one close shave in his lab is especially well handled by Whedon). When the inevitable eventually happens, much improved special effects and an excellent fight sequence result in a terrific impact. Avengers Assemble is an excellent piece of blockbuster entertainment. Much has been made of the fact that blockbusters don’t need to be a brainless Michael Bay effort in order to attract an audience. Whilst ‘brainless’ is a pejorative that shouldn’t be applied to Whedon’s cornucopia of superheroes, the film certainly doesn’t aspire to PhDs in Psychology or Philosophy either. There is a lightness and wit to the character portraits presented. Whilst this means there maybe isn’t the same obvious thematic depth to the film (although there are broad strokes painted about the moral and immoral uses of technology) this is not something that it needs, or wants, to aspire to. When the characters themselves are drawn with enough depth, humour and self-awareness, and action scenes are choreographed engagingly the result is every bit as good. There are legs in the old-fashioned blockbuster yet. The superhero film doesn’t need to be a gritty reboot in order to feel fresh. With the phenomenal rise of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films, the Marvel stable had to deliver something excellent but genuinely different in Avengers Assemble and with Joss Whedon behind the camera they have done so. Thanks to the excellent combination of humour, characters, action and intensity Avengers Assemble is the best Marvel film yet."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive," “Marvel’s The Avengers” is a comic book lover’s ultimate fantasy: witnessing several favorite superheroes together, fighting evil and of course, all while saving mankind from destruction. Yes, it’s a superhero ‘all-star’ meet up, of sorts, starring Robert Downy Jr. as Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. All, thankfully, sharing equal screen time in a first rate, comical, non-stop action packed film with a bit of ‘Transformers’ scattered throughout. The former film franchises of four heroes provided their introduction to cinema fans who may not have been familiar with the comic books, thus delivering an extra punch – familiarity with their personas. Many know the Hulk from the 1978 TV series and other major films starring Eric Bana and Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk. I’m pleased to reveal that ‘Avengers’ take on the Hulk is my favorite so far; he’s the biggest Hulk yet, and overshadows all in size, scope and strength. Even though Black Widow and Hawkeye are less known, director and co/writer Joss Whedon (a self professed comic book fan) does a fine job of developing each. Whedon’s writing credits are impressive, “Toy Story,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Cabin in the Woods,” to name a few. His direction here is pitch perfect, as each superhero’s personality is developed not only through actions but also smart dialogue, something generally lacking in action films. The glib comedic tone is consistent throughout, never appearing silly or contrived. We believe all that is happening – these super heroes are essentially part of the world’s landscape. Even though we know they aren’t real, in this film they emphatically are, as so much care and detail have gone into their credibility. A grandiose storyline is deep-seated in humanity that’s ‘super cool’ and ‘super fun’ for action fans and the archetypal comic book fan. ‘Avengers’ covers both and, unquestionably, delivers. The balancing act of the characters and their distinctive personas is certainly a dubious feat here, requiring much perception and forethought to pull off. The premise centers on six super heroes who are fetched by S.H. I. E.L.D.’s director, Nick Fury, played convincingly by an eye-patched, Samuel L. Jackson. Fury gathers the heroes because Thor’s evil brother, the whiny god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who suffers from a ‘dad liked you best’ complex, has compremised the powerful cosmic cube, the Tesseract. Loki’s digs are the interstellar world of Asgard, making his only access to earth through a space wormhole. Frankly, the reason for the ‘all-star superhero’ meet-up doesn’t really matter so much; the interactions between the heroes themselves are at the heart of this tale. Comically, when the superheroes are assembled, they check each other out through dialogue and exhibiting their physical attributes. The match-up creates very silly scenes of who can out-do the other. Downey’s Iron Man states out of the gate: “I’m Iron Man and, no offense, but apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed and I don’t play well with others.” The banter and eye-popping special effects are what makes this film tick. All I can say is, “Hold on to your popcorn as you’re in for a rip-roaring, roller coaster of a ride in this spectacle that’s perfect for ages ten and above.” The film’s rating of PG-13 is due to the violence and somewhat frightening situations, which parents can ascertain for their own youngsters. Cast: Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts)."
"Dec 15, 2019",positive," (Welcome to Road to Endgame, where we revisit all 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ask, ""How did we get here?"" In this edition: The Avengers changed studio filmmaking, though not before ticking off The Pentagon.)The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. Few films before or since have resulted in such widespread global celebration, something even the film's third sequel, Avengers: Endgame, may or may not match. Only time will tell, but time has been kind to Marvel's first culmination, despite the series overall fabric favouring entertainment over meaning in the realm of political outlook.The film changed the way movies were made and watched, affecting everything from industry goals to the mainstream visibility of fandom and ""nerd culture."" Its lasting legacy isn't just the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe, which drops its twenty-second entry into theatres soon – its impact can also be felt in almost every other studio's failed shared-universes. It stands to reason that Marvel was ahead of the creative curve even before its purchase by Disney in 2009. Kevin Feige & co. have been doing it right before anyone else was doing it at all.While this plan understandably seemed in doubt during its buildup, Marvel Studios marked its arrival with unprecedented financial success, crystalizing on-screen during one specific moment... You know the one. You remember seeing the Avengers assemble for first time, as the camera circles around them and Alan Silvestri's musical theme reaches its crescendo. You may even remember cheering or applauding.The film was shot in a narrower (""taller"") aspect ratio — 1.85:1, compared to the other films' 2.39 and 2.35 — to accommodate the eight-foot-tall Hulk in group shots where in the team occupied the entire frame. Run a quick search on YouTube, and you're likely to find dozens of videos capturing live audience reactions to this climactic scene, from all over the globe and in more languages than you knew the film was even dubbed into.What's more, this now-iconic shot is sandwiched between two other major moments, each of which hits similar highs in quick succession. On one side, the Hulk's ""I'm always angry"" and his transformation before punching an enormous Leviathan. On the other, Captain America's order of ""Hulk? Smash!"" after which the Hulk lets loose on alien invaders. It was clear from this one-two-three punch, and the ensuing rapturous response, that the Marvel party wasn't going to stop.What's sometimes forgotten, however, is that this sequence arrives nearly two hours into the film.The Avengers is one of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character. The whole film is built around this rousing sequence, answering the looming question asked by both the film, and by the audience: after a six-year buildup, can these disparate elements come together to become greater than the sum of their parts? The answer was a resounding ""Yes,"" and what followed was Marvel's victory lap, an explosive payoff to an entire movie's worth of character dynamics and interwoven themes (a feat that was replicated in Avengers: Age of Ultron). The Avengers is also the first Marvel movie that takes place on an Earth significantly different from our own. The settings in prior entries felt distinctly familiar, from caves to factories to tiny towns. Here, the pretense that Marvel's superheroes exist in a ""realistic"" universe was finally done away with. The world of The Avengers is, unequivocally, the future of the series' fantasy World War II, where Nazi factions used an Infinity Stone to build weapons of mass destruction (Unfortunately, this through-line also results in its own complications, since the mal-formed politics of Captain America: The First Avenger carry over as well).In prior films, superheroes were unique elements in otherwise normal surroundings. In The Avengers, nearly an hour of the film takes place on an floating, invisible aircraft carrier transporting magically-powered weapons, the same weapons Captain America once tried to get out of the hands of H.Y.D.R.A. (Red Skull's Diet Nazis). This is a world where some far-off, unseen villain in space grants Loki mystical objects — we now know all about Thanos' plan — and it's a world where shadowy international councils have become necessary, now that monsters roam the streets and Gods fly through the skies.However, the film isn't as far removed from ""real world"" concerns as this setting suggests. If anything, The Avengers is about fantasy clashing with reality to see which one wins out. Late into the film's final act, after the Avengers have nearly fallen to alien invaders, the World Council makes an enormous decision. It chooses to sacrifice millions of lives in order to save billions, sending a nuclear warhead straight for New York. It's the kind of dark turn you'd expect from a story like Watchmen, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1986 comic classic that transplanted superheroes into a supposedly ""realistic"" setting. But the major difference between Watchmen and The Avengers — and thus, the difference in their outcomes — is the function of their characters.Watchmen sees our worst selves — violent, egomaniacal, detached — being granted untold powers. The fantasy of The Avengers however, isn't just that superheroes exist in concept, but rather, that these specific kinds of people exist. People like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who are willing to put everything on the line, going above-and-beyond to save everyone they can.The dilemma Captain America faced during World War II becomes a dilemma for all the Avengers to overcome. No matter the scenario, they aren't willing to trade lives. Not in this film, not in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and not in Avengers: Infinity War. While this unwillingness to compromise is put to the test in future films, it's presented in The Avengers as a bright alternative to the darkest parts of our reality, where men in the shadows order airstrikes without care for collateral damage, all for ""the greater good.""In depicting U.S. fighter planes being ordered to attack Manhattan, the film not only aligns The World Council's methods with that of H.Y.D.R.A. in Captain America: The First Avenger, but with the spectre of global terrorism in a post-9/11 word. A bold conflation, at least on the surface, though one muddled by the fact that this film, like Iron Man and Iron Man 2 before it (and Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel since), sought U.S. military funding.The Avengers was almost government propaganda, and it still retains some of this DNA. Marvel films like Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel were made with U.S. military assistance, and thus, with military-approved scripts, making them government propaganda. The Avengers however, was actually turned down during its production, because The Pentagon couldn't reconcile the idea of the U.S. military answering to a higher authority. Granted, the production was lent Humvees and other ground equipment regardless (the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets in the film were digitally rendered) so the conundrum here vis-à-vis The Avengers' place as propaganda is noteworthy.On one hand, the production most certainly set out to appease the powers that be. The World Council, a fictional consortium of international leaders, embodied authoritarian overreach despite American military equipment being employed to bomb American citizens. America itself is never really framed with any military outlook, let alone one that could be held accountable.On the other, one might argue that The Avengers is able to side-step the propaganda issue given that it eschews real-world militarism, unlike its Earth-bound predecessors. The fighter jet sent to bomb Manhattan, while representative of U.S. military equipment, is ordered by an organization whose reach supersedes America's (the council members aren't given national designations until later in the series), so it's enough of a fantasy that the propaganda question doesn't really matter.It's a double-edged sword, narratively speaking. The reluctance to contextualize America's place in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy turned the Pentagon off subsidizing the film; the U.S. military could not, given its relative absence in the story, be presented as heroic. And yet The World Council, a fictitious entity whose only real-world counterpart is the distinctly non-militaristic United Nations, is presented as villainous, without ever framing America's place in its ranks, despite S.H.I.E.L.D. being coded American through-and-through. In effect, the U.S. military can't be presented as having questionable motives either.At best, this incidental political apathy is an upgrade from prior entries like Iron Man, in which U.S. military occupation is the status-quo, but its ill-effects originate elsewhere. At worst, it's the series' continued failure to say anything of consequence, hinting at statements about power without ever daring to actually make them. The state of this world is two-fold, torn between reality and fantasy, and the Avengers must overcome this discrepancy in order to save the day. In other words, in order to make the film entertaining.On one hand, suited men with obscured faces order airstrikes to be carried out with familiar, grey military machinery, piloted by anonymous soldiers. On the other, our larger-than-life heroes, with all their strengths and smarts and colourful garb, have been locked out of the biggest scientific advancements of the 21st century. The Tesseract is a source of unlimited energy. In World War II, H.Y.D.R.A. used it to make weapons. In 2012, S.H.I.E.L.D. uses it for the same purpose, rather than bringing minds like Bruce Banner and Tony Stark on board to further their work in medicine and clean energy.""War isn't won by sentiment,"" the World Council tells Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who responds: ""No. It's won by soldiers"" before recruiting Steve Rogers. This exchange echoes Captain America: The First Avenger, wherein Col. Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) tells Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tuccy) that war isn't won by kindness, but by guts, before recruiting Rogers' more malleable peer, Private Gilmore Hodge (Lex Shrapnel). In this moment in The Avengers, all Fury seems to want is someone who'll follow orders. Rogers is told the Allies won World War II, but he knows something is amiss: ""They didn't say what we lost.""What was lost, it would seem, was conscience. S.H.I.E.L.D., now divorced from America in the narrative, recycles H.Y.D.R.A.'s plans. The U.S. government employing Nazi tactics would have made for a more challenging story (and a realistic one, given America's hiring of Nazi personnel after World War II, something Captain America: The Winter Soldier even touches on), though one can hardly blame four-quadrant entertainment for stepping into the realm of fantasy. However, despite the continued separation of H.Y.D.R.A. from Nazi ideology, this setup functions well enough from a character standpoint, especially in how it creates conflict between two of its leads. Fury & co. are working on bigger, more destructive devices than the ones dropped on Japan. Upon discovering these secret weapons, Steve ""We have orders, we should follow them"" Rogers decides he can no longer follow blindly. While questioning his own commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers also questions Tony Stark's commitment to the mission. Stark is a man who tries to think his way out of every situation, claiming he'd ""cut the wire"" rather than laying down on it for anyone else, the way Rogers would, and has in the past.Stark, at this point in the series, thinks mostly of himself. He builds monuments unto his own image, touching the skies with buildings bearing his name. In fact, he only figures out Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) plan once he has his narcissism reflected back to him by the murderous demigod, who plants his flag on Stark's skyscraper for all the world to see.While Steve Rogers' arc in this film forms a bridge between entries (The Winter Soldier builds on his newfound skepticism), The Avengers concludes a major part of Tony Stark's story, in which he finally attempts to fight for something greater than himself. It also sets into motion the next phase of his life, in which he fails, repeatedly, to figure out the path to doing so. Instead, Stark creates newer, bigger problems in the process, escalations that Rogers must eventually deal with.Despite the tensions between them, the two men also become linked by their experiences in a way few that other characters are. Stark's major turn in The Avengers involves flying through a wormhole. It's rather traumatic, something Iron Man 3 eventually tackles head on. In flying a weapon of mass destruction away from New York, Stark takes the same ""one-way trip"" Rogers was forced to decades earlier: a willing suicide mission, as he tries to contact the woman he loves (Stark survives, albeit barely).Rogers and Stark butting heads over loyalties is fun to watch, but the film's most enjoyable element, ironically, happens to be the character who mentions trying to kill himself while being cursed with the strength to survive: The Incredible Hulk. Something The Avengers understood about the Hulk, which neither of his prior solo outings managed to capture, is that he's fun. It seems so simple in retrospect: a big green monster smashing disposable villains is perfect popcorn entertainment. Both moments on either side of the Avengers assembling are Hulk-centric action beats, and regardless of whether the ""I'm always angry"" line fits his narrative, it became instantly iconic because of what followed.Is Bruce Banner always angry? Mark Ruffalo certainly brings a nervous energy to him, but his actual anger is never the focus of his story. It's unfortunate that no Marvel film has explored such a fundamental part of the character, but what we get in The Avengers is an arguably superior version of his arc in The Incredible Hulk, a story in which Banner, at least nominally, learns to embrace the monster within.Dr. Banner resents the Hulk. It prevents him from living a normal life, a regret he expresses to Natasha Romanoff while rocking an empty crib (a thread that continues in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Banner tries to steer clear of anything that might turn him mean and green. It's been a year since his last incident, so having his isolation intruded upon understandably upsets him. Tony Stark is fascinated by Banner, but the doctor believes no good can come of the Hulk, despite Stark's insistence on him having a higher purpose.When Banner first transforms in the film, it's out of his control. His face, mid-transition, is stamped with fear — specifically, the fear of what he might do to Romanoff. After this, the Hulk is presented much as he was in his The Incredible Hulk: in shadow, like a monster waiting to wreak havoc. He even chases Romanoff while knocking down walls, recalling the first appearance of Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger in Iron Man as he chases Pepper Potts.This Hulk ought to be a villain. He's trapped in a cage of Banner's making, and letting him out unwillingly has disastrous consequences. Letting him out intentionally, however, is a different story. It's Banner embracing everything he is on the inside, ""always angry"" or not. He uses this emotional momentum to take down a space serpent, before leaping up the side of a building and smacking aliens into walls. Banner doesn't just embrace the monster's anger; his smile before he leaps to cause more mayhem shows just how much he enjoys being the Hulk. By giving in to his baser instincts, the mayhem becomes fun for audiences too.By the end, the Hulk even saves Tony Stark from falling to his death. It's a moment that builds directly upon Banner's story, and it's the first time we see the Hulk use his powers for something other than destruction. A higher purpose indeed. At one end of the spectrum we have Thor and Loki, figures of myth and legend who have the powers of Gods. At the other, we have Hawkeye/Clint Barton and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, assassins who use guns and arrows. The latter duo ought to have no place within a cosmic sci-fi film. In fact, they replace superpowered heroes The Wasp and Ant-Man from the original Avengers comics. Yet it's this very dynamic, the contrast in the genres to which they belong, that makes all four characters — Thor, Loki, Hawkeye and Widow — feel narratively vital.They represent the extremes within which this world operates. The Asgardian princes embody the operatic grandeur of a story of armoured aliens and magical kingdoms. Barton and Romanoff however, ground the film in a human perspective, reflecting the real-world effects of super-powered battles.By this point in the series, Thor and Loki's arcs are, admittedly, at a standstill. Their story here, much like Captain America's story, is connective tissue between entries. Their main function however, is fleshing out what this mish-mash setting feels like, and their interactions with ""realistic"" elements like Hawkeye and Widow help dramatize this world's fabric.A spy working from the shadows, Romanoff is one of the team's most surprising members. She fights shoulder to shoulder with the Avengers, not only to escape her bloody past, but to atone for it. She's also a foil to Hawkeye, who's hasn't yet had to contend with the kind of guilt Romanoff lives with. If anything, Barton's conscience is clear, having rescued Romanoff when he was sent to kill her, but more recent events have forced him (literally, via Loki's mind control) to take innocent lives.""Don't do that to yourself,"" Romanoff tells Barton, when he asks how many people he's killed. Romanoff is familiar with the emotional consequences of being a killer — another element carried over into Avengers: Age of Ultron — her very reason for joining the Avengers. Neither Black Widow nor Hawkeye take narrative precedence by any means, but they flesh out the human stakes of this conflict in a way that endangering abstract billions no longer does at this point in blockbuster history.Some say these characters are wasted in the film; I disagree, and not just because they get their own stellar action beats. Thor, after a solo entry in which he faces up to his warmongering (at least in theory), finally accepts that Asgardians may not be much better than humans. He likens his brother, and thus himself, to mystical creatures that destroy everything in their path, a perspective that plays a vital role in the Avengers' sequel.Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye, much like Bruce Banner, see themselves as monsters with destructive capabilities. That's four out of the six Avengers, people who according to Loki ""lie and kill in the service of liars and killers."" He's not wrong, which is exactly why the camera circling around the team in their moment of heroism works as well as it does.It's the beginning of the Avengers becoming more than their pasts. 
In fighting the alien invasion, the Avengers are also out to prove they can be more than what they appear to be. More than a group of squabbling misfits in close proximity — something Loki sought to take full advantage of with his intentional capture — and more than just hired guns in service of two-faced regimes. It's after they're torn apart on the Helicarrier that they have to work towards being more, hesitating to lift their hammers and bows and shields, before doing what needs to be done.They need to prove they're more than just an archer forced to kill against his will, an assassin with red in her ledger, a monster who puts people in danger, an unruly brute with a hammer, a soldier following orders and a man who fights for himself. It's that shot of the Avengers assembling that tells us these characters may, in fact, be able to work together and become something more. Not long after, an unbroken, fluid take moving across New York City proves it definitively, a shot in which we see the Avengers working in tandem to take down the invading forces.The Avengers don't kill Loki, as he claims they're wont to do. Instead, they prove him wrong by capturing him again, despite this leading to their downfall earlier in the film. It's an old-fashioned notion, but as Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) puts it, ""People might just need a little old-fashioned.""The Avengers were brought together to transcend barriers of culture and language. The film's closing moments feature a montage of worldwide reactions to their antics; some are critical of the Avengers' role in society, while others celebrate these modern icons and their awe-inspiring spectacle.

"Dec 10, 2019",positive,"Overall, Marvel's Avengers Assemble is fun, funny and downright entertaining. Joss Whedon did good."
"Nov 8, 2019",negative," [xrr rating=1.75/5]My biggest fear going into The Avengers, the supposed culmination of the barrage of Marvel Universe comic book movies that have been bombarding us the past few summers, was that it would be a Frankenstein-pastiche of characters fighting for screen time and therefore reducing each superhero’s part into a mere cameo. While that preemptive fear was allayed by generous screen time for Iron Man, Captain America and company, writers Joss Whedon (who also directed) and Zak Penn have transgressed in a way I couldn’t have imagined before I witnessed it with my own eyes: they made The Avengers very, very boring. It is immaterial whether or not I read comics because as a film, The Avengers filled me with ennui, not a good sensation for a popcorn movie loaded with explosions, creatures from another dimension and a green behemoth determined to smash everything in sight. Sure, The Avengers accomplishes everything you would expect in a comics movie with the added spicy pizzazz of a Whedon script. But shouldn’t a movie that costs millions to make reach for the stars rather than be merely serviceable? That’s a huge letdown. Whedon and Penn decide to devote much of their script to the growing pains associated with the formation of the Avengers, wringing schmaltz from an age-old golden rule of team work. Egos clash, muscles ripple, rivals bristle but eventually the Avengers figure out that working together rather than against one another is the key. Pretty fucking stupid when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a cadre of inter-planetary goons are threatening to destroy the Earth. But hey, it gives Whedon an opportunity to drum up superhero on superhero fighting porn as Thor fights the Hulk and Iron Man fights Thor and Nick Fury fights Hawkeye. It’s the most expensive version of Marvel Vs. Capcom ever produced but even less exciting than watching your little brother play on your crappy 12” television. So what’s my problem? There is absolutely nothing at stake here. The Avengers picks up the threads from a handful of prior films and tries to create a reason to bring all these superhero together in one place (besides make a shit-ton of money for Marvel and Disney). We all know that Whedon is supremely talented when the sky’s the limit. Hell, look at The Cabin in the Woods or Serenity to see what the man can do when his imagination runs amuck. But with The Avengers he is hamstrung and leaves us with a story that lacks not only gravitas but no human element whatsoever. Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne (often) succeed in their filmic incarnations because there is something tragic and human in their narrative arcs. In this rancid amalgam we get nothing but explosions and long, boring passages filled with sermonizing and stale dialogue that makes the most recent Star Wars trilogy read like eloquent theater. So what is the gossamer of a story about? Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles the Avengers after the banished Loki steals the Tesseract, a glowing cube of energy that will allow him to open a portal and destroy the Earth. So Fury calls in Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the thawed-out Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, stepping in for Edward Norton) to join the fight against the banished Asgardian and his minions. While the action sequences are dull, the film’s extended sections where Whedon tries to explain each and every backstory without pandering to the demographic too much feels interminable. Whedon must walk a tightrope of not saying too much (and thus alienating the fan boys) and saying too little (wiping out the folks who don’t know the difference between Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner). Also, I hate to say it but Loki really isn’t a very interesting villain. With all of these factors working against him, Whedon turned out reams of dialogue that not only feels flat but sucks the living joy out of a picture that should be about thrilling its audience. However, I think the problem is inherent in the format. Can comic books really successfully translate into a film, especially one that packs in a lot of characters? Sure, you can count the good ones (Burton’s Batman, Nolan’s Dark Knight films, the second Spider-Man feature) but often times comic book movies are lifeless or downright silly. That is because comic book writers can suspend the drama and stretch it out over multiple issues, creating a story arc that can be both exciting and resonant. Think of the stories by Chris Claremont and Peter David and how they take multiple issues to sustain. In a movie like The Avengers, you have to cram everything into two hours, removing any sort of true peril to the characters or any real reason to care. It would have taken balls to end with a frozen Han Solo moment. But it didn’t. While researching for this article I found evidence of sequels to Thor, Captain America and Iron Man all in the works. Maybe there is one thing these films have in common with the comics industry. They keep going and going, no matter how shitty the story. As long as someone keeps paying for it, you can rest assured we will see superhero films during the summer. And if that doesn’t work, they will reboot the idea two years later. Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Oct 11, 2019",negative," The new CIA-rehab thriller, as a genre, is anticonspiracy. Unlike the domestic spy thriller of the 1970s, today’s CIA apologist thriller does not reveal how official truth is an illusion, an elaborate cover-up constructed to hide abuses of power. Instead, the newer, sunnier CIA thriller shows how failure in the intelligence community is merely the result of human error. Overthrowing the democratically elected Mosaddegh government in Iran in 1953, for instance, and installing a corrupt puppet government headed by an absolute ruler, is something that could have happened to anyone. Years later there’s a little blowback. Sadly, someone from the Agency has to pick up the pieces. Ben Affleck’s Argo shows that even movies that don’t exist are more fun, and possibly more real, than the struggle of a nation. Argo is more like a 1970s heist movie than a paranoid espionage film. If it were a Robert Redford ’70s movie, it would be The Hot Rock, not Three Days of the Condor. Disguising themselves as a film crew allows the cast of Argo to put one over on Iranians who are by turns wily and childish. Confronted by cartoon storyboards for the fake movie (supposedly drawn by Jack Kirby, they look more like the placemats in a Big Boy restaurant), Iranian guards react with delight when one member of the fake crew makes whooshing sounds and jet-plane hand motions. Since this is the exact post–Star Wars position American filmgoers have been put in for decades—in fact beginning around the same time as the Iranian hostage crisis—it’s a little unnerving to find Iranian soldiers standing in for the American audience like that. Argo puts into practice the cinema-meets-military theories of Paul Virilio in an unpredictable way. We see the CIA as a creator of fantasy here, but that’s all to the good: American lives are saved, no one gets hurt. Our enemies are fooled, not killed. The desire to believe in the movies, Affleck tells us, is universal. Happy endings depend on the success of the ruse, even when the ruse has geopolitical implications. Argo is a much better film than the previous two Affleck directed, and his performance in it is low-key and self-effacing. The entire cast is good, including Clea DuVall in black glasses and black hair, here at least doing something worthy of her talent, and Adrienne Barbeau, wandering through the Hollywood script-reading scene as a cheeseball actress and producer’s ex-wife. It’s noteworthy that the selection and reading of a film script plays such an important role in Argo, even if the whole point is that the script is derivative and lousy. That’s another comment on the era in which Argo takes place. The existence of Argo, which could not have been made back then because its story was classified by the CIA, is more proof that that era is over, historical. Part of the fascination in watching Argo is wondering whether this caper could work today. The friendlier, humanized CIA of the Carter Era this film asks us to trust relies on fake mustaches, not enhanced interrogation techniques. All Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty asks us to believe in is the brute presentation of facts. Whether or not the film is a torture film is therefore, the film implies, beside the point. Torture happened, the film says, and here’s how. So of course Zero Dark Thirty is a torture film, but we are expected to understand that now we are beyond the moral question of whether torture is right or wrong. The CIA got various kinds of information from torturing various people. Regardless of whether that information was good or bad, information is power. You sift, you put the pieces together, just like the Iranian schoolchildren in Argo put photographs back together from documents the US Embassy shredded in Tehran. Eventually you get a clear picture and if you’re lucky human error doesn’t enter into it and you are allowed to act on what you’ve learned and kill the guy you need to kill. The film is in three parts. Part One: Torture. Part Two: Intelligence. Part Three: Execution. Each is a separate film that struggles between being quality television and something more cinematic, defined by Jessica Chastain’s film-hero poker face and go-it-alone refusal to succumb to backstory, or do anything but work, grimly, at her job. Chastain’s Maya, we later learned from news stories about the film, is a composite character meant to represent the hard work done by many women in the CIA in its effort to find and kill bin Laden. At the same time, she stands for every American woman today, who can succeed if she works day and night, if she stares into her computer for as long as it takes, if she makes the mean face but doesn’t complain when her boss doesn’t understand she’s right, and is willing to relocate. Bigelow wrote a piece for the Los Angeles Times in which she explained that when it comes to torture in Zero Dark Thirty, “depiction is not endorsement.” But as always in the movies, the problem is not in the what but the how. How torture is depicted is more important than that it is depicted. Since Bigelow used to work for Semiotext(e) back in the day, maybe some French film criticism will come in handy here. In 1961, Jacques Rivette, writing on the 1959 Gillo Pontecorvo film Kapò, which is about the inmates of a concentration camp, singled out one shot that ended on the hand of a character played by Emmanuelle Riva (Emmanuelle Riva who stars in Amour) as she died on an electrified barbed-wire fence. To Rivette, the preciosity of this shot was contemptible. Earlier in the piece, Rivette noted that this mixture of easy “realism” and spectacle was inherently immoral, because “that which [the filmmaker] dares present as ‘reality’ is physically tolerable for the viewer . . . but ultimately not intolerable. . . . At the same time everyone unknowingly becomes accustomed to the horror, which little by little is accepted by morality, and will quickly become part of the mental landscape of modern man; who, the next time, will be able to be surprised or irritated at that which will in effect have ceased to be shocking?” (The translation is David Phelps’s and Jeremi Szaniawski’s.) This is the exact effect of the torture in Zero Dark Thirty. In 1983 Kathryn Bigelow played a feminist revolutionary working for a newspaper in Lizzie Borden’s film Born in Flames, which imagines a socialist America and ends with a bombing at the World Trade Center. Questions of depiction come down to whose side you are on. If that seems too simple, it is no simpler than saying that “depiction is not endorsement,” an evasive notion that lets any film director off the hook entirely, every time. After the “firsthand account” of torture in Zero Dark Thirty, it is hard not to conclude that Bigelow, like Maya, is working for the Man. James Bond has always been the Man, that is the whole point of James Bond movies. Skyfall is a movie for a confused era, a digital, data-driven era, where killing is done by remote control. At first the film seems to admit it no longer makes sense to keep Bond on the payroll in this new world. The film starts with a radical move: Bond is shot and killed by another agent who happens to be a black woman (Naomie Harris). The story of Skyfall is the story of this character. First she kills Bond. Later she seduces him but is thrown over for an Asian temptress. She comes back at the end as the new Miss Moneypenny, Bond’s boss’s secretary, whose role is to lust after Bond but never get him, an underling he constantly teases. She wears a tight dress and sits in an office looking at Bond with big eyes while admitting she wasn’t really cut out for fieldwork in the first place—she accidentally shot him, after all! So much for empowerment. The theme of Skyfall is that the world must remain safe for white Englishmen to run around shooting people who aren’t white and English. The film ends in Scotland, the ancestral home of Bond and the emotional heart of the upper-class Great Britain Orwell identified in “Such, Such Were the Joys,” a domain of shotgun blasts and heritage-brand hunting togs, where large stags still wander, imperiously and symbolically, like they did in The Queen, with Helen Mirren, in 2006. It is here that the film’s one good moment emerges, as Daniel Craig’s Bond and Javier Bardem’s pan-ethnic (but paradoxically ultra-pale) villain chase each other across the moors until Bardem, exasperated, needles him: “Do you see what comes of all this running around, Mr. Bond? All this jumping and fighting, it’s exhausting.” Recruited into the secret agent game by Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., American superheroes in The Avengers fight to protect New York from total destruction. It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it. This apocalypse comes in the form not of climate change, the real menace to New York we witnessed firsthand in 2012, but in the form of mechanized aliens who must be stand-ins for our new enemies, the Chinese, because when they attack it looks like the sky is shitting endless orders of steamed whole fish. Tom Hooper directs every scene and composes every shot in this bloated, reactionary musical as if he were trying to express a new idea every time any actor moves a fraction of an inch. At the same time, this version of Les Misérables depends on absolute familiarity with the songs from the stage musical to produce the tears that are its reason for existing. Hugh Jackman’s performance eventually moves even the uninitiated to cry, not because he is so moving—often he sounds like Walter Brennan singing “Old Rivers”—but because he had to endure so much just so two insufferable teenagers could get married. Hooper’s approach to revolution in the streets is to telegraph how doomed it is from the start, but also to show that it is completely justified—every character in the film is so exploited that he or she is a clear argument for immediate radical change. This sickly paradox puts the viewer on the side of getting the inevitable over with. Long before a little boy (Daniel Huttlestone), the mascot of the revolution, is killed by soldiers, his status as the most annoying Cockney urchin in the history of cinema made me want to see Russell Crowe’s Javert beat him to death with Leonardo DiCaprio’s hammer from Django Unchained. Daniel Day-Lewis’s animatronic performance in Spielberg’s film underscores how Abraham Lincoln is like E.T., appearing among human beings to make things right before going back to the mysterious place he came from. He is also the perfect contemporary dad, reading to his little son about bugs while Congress debates the Thirteenth Amendment. Lincoln performed the important function of getting Americans to think about the terrible legacy of slavery in this country, and to reevaluate the influence of the South on national affairs. It is a political movie in every way, and has a science-fiction aspect: it posits white people as alien oppressors. White people are so white in Lincoln, which photographs them as grayish and pale under a winter sun, that sometimes it testifies to the lack of tanning salons in Washington DC in 1865. Day-Lewis’s pronunciation of the word righteous as “right-ee-ous” left an indelible mark on me, and it is no doubt historically accurate. But as someone from a small town near Hartford, I resent the film for claiming that the abolitionist Congressional representatives from Connecticut voted against the amendment to end slavery. That bothered me when I saw the film, but I never bothered to check whether it was true, and when Maureen Dowd wrote in her Times column that it wasn’t, and that Tony Kushner dismissed his mistake by equating it to showing Lincoln wearing blue socks instead of green socks, I became doubly annoyed, because now I was in the position of defending a state I’d be happy never to see again and admitting I’d learned something from Maureen Dowd. There’s another thing Kushner left out of his screenplay that would have been good to include. When Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, a Native American colonel on Grant’s staff named Ely S. Parker was there, too. Parker, who is played in Lincoln by Asa-Luke Twocrow, drafted and wrote by hand the terms of surrender delivered to Lee, and in the film we see him on the porch with Grant as Lee approaches. This is not in the film, but when Lee saw Parker, he thought he was black, and made some remark to that effect, which he had to apologize for when told Parker was a Seneca Indian. “Well,” said Lee. “I am glad to see one real American here.” Parker responded by pointing out,  “We are all Americans, sir.” Not including this great moment implies that there was something Spielberg and Kushner thought was too corny for this film. Django Unchained is not so much the evil twin of the saintly Lincoln as its nasty, more clever kid brother, fighting the favorite for recognition, acting out. If I prefer it to Lincoln it’s because I prefer the Tarantinian project, flaws and all, to Steven Spielberg’s entire career. Lincoln may be the culmination of the Spielberg–Lucas reimagining of the American cinema as family entertainment, a transcendent work beyond the blockbuster form that reimagines the official national myth of an official national father for current and future generations. Tarantino is more interested in a pre-consolidated cinema that predates Spielberg, in which national myths were put to use in tawdry, violent, and grandiloquent ways, and myth was open to interpretation by genre filmmakers outside the US. So however Tarantino has failed the actual history of slavery in the United States, the way he has opened it up for discussion strikes me as far more remarkable than the storybook of Spielberg’s Lincoln, which closes with a thump and sends us off to bed. People forget how sick, not anemic but twisted and ugly, the cinema had become before Spielberg and Lucas made movie theaters safe for families again. Tarantino looks to the minor glories of that era, which were amoral and provocative and not designed to last forever on any storage medium other than film. Maybe if you were never dragged by an adult to see an end-of-Hollywood/end-of-America movie like Hustle, with Burt Reynolds and Catherine Deneuve, you can’t truly understand how warped it was. That film came out in 1975, the same year as Mandingo, a repellent, brutal film about slavery that is a touchstone for Tarantino. Spaghetti westerns questioned the underpinnings of civilization. They examined sick societies through the eyes of tight-lipped, one-dimensional antiheroes surrounded by manic, cruel, and jaded characters who played terminal games of cat-and-mouse and growled dubbed insults at each other. The tense dinner scene at the Candyland plantation in Django Unchained captures their tone. When Christoph Waltz, as Dr. King Schultz, demands that the harpist sitting behind him stop playing Beethoven, Tarantino shows us the hypocritical European elegance spaghetti westerns layered underneath their operatic gunfights. That scene, the one at the beginning with Schultz holding his lantern looking for an honest man, and the blood on the cotton, are as original as moments in Leone or Corbucci. Certain liberal-minded film critics judged Beasts of the Southern Wild harshly, were outraged by it, describing it as racist, shamelessly manipulative, and like advertising. That, putting it mildly, is a stretch. The film is such a convincing, fully realized, and overpowering achievement that begrudging its popular and artistic success is feckless. The film understands an America that is divorced from social services and beset by environmental collapse, but understands those things at the level of fable. It’s not a documentary of Katrina and Louisiana any more than The Wizard of Oz was a documentary of the Dust Bowl and Kansas, and expecting it to reflect the exact political reality of its time, or any kind of progressive politics, is like hating The Wizard of Oz because it’s not propaganda for the New Deal. Quvenzhané Wallis is Beasts’ Judy Garland, and her narration is as emotional and devastating as Garland singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Her hopes for the future and for the people in her community are no different from Garland’s at the end of The Wizard of Oz. That’s not a crime, and she’s not running for office. Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock convinces us that he is not Anthony Hopkins without convincing us that the lumpy man he is playing is Alfred Hitchcock. His portrayal lacks the sly charm of Hitchcock’s TV introductions and seems overly interested in telling us Hitchcock was sad and weird. It does succeed in reminding us that there was a time when film directors had different body types, weren’t all at least six-foot-three, didn’t go to the gym, and didn’t all wear sweaters with zippers. Hitchcock also does two other noteworthy disservices to the master. One is that it eliminates his daughter from his marriage to Alma Reville (Helen Mirren). Since Patricia Hitchcock has an acting part in Psycho, which this film details the making of, that is a pointed omission designed to further question Hitchcock’s marriage. The second is that every time Hitchcock takes a drink—and this film has him drinking wine and scotch frequently, including on the set—the soundtrack accompanies his imbibing with impolite slurping sounds. Hopkins’s prosthetic lips seem wine-stained throughout. I’ve read a few Hitchcock biographies, some of which impugn him mightily, but I don’t recall reading this fastidious man was a slurper. This low-key but agitated antiauthoritarian film often comes off like a buddy movie about two very different men who like to get together to drink paint thinner and antifreeze. The Master is puzzling at all times, ignoring our desire to decipher it as it’s unspooling (if you saw it on film). It creates a weird mood, as if in a dream The Shining got mixed in with Altman’s Popeye. It keeps verging on the horrible and the cartoonish without quite getting to either. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance successfully combines Marlon Brando with Moe Howard, while Philip Seymour Hoffman looks on, occasionally getting irritated but indulging him all the same. Amy Adams, as Hoffman’s Lady Macbeth-ish wife, puts the brakes on the Phoenix–Hoffman relationship by masturbating Hoffman in front of a bathroom sink and uttering threatening, nonexplanatory lines like, “This is something you do for a billion years or not at all.” When Hoffman sings the entirety of the song “Slow Boat to China” to Phoenix, it’s clear the film is ending and that Phoenix will now be free of his demons, but why “Slow Boat to China”? Because Phoenix was in the navy in World War II? Because they met on Hoffman’s boat? Because the intense, repetitive, ad hoc, and perhaps meaningless process Hoffman has put Phoenix through has “melted his heart of stone”? Flight is an excellent, hard-hitting, sleazy movie about an alcoholic airline pilot (Denzel Washington, really great here) who, hungover and right after surreptitiously downing three vodka nips, crash-lands a malfunctioning plane during a storm, saving everyone onboard except the flight attendant (Nadine Velazquez) he’d spent the night with. It is so good, except for the syrupy last ten minutes, that it is hard to believe Robert Zemeckis, who directed it, has spent the last twenty-five or so years since he made Back to the Future directing the things he’s directed. Flight contains many riveting scenes, but one, with Washington alone in a hotel room the night before he faces a hearing about the crash, is especially riveting, and does not sell out the film. Its climax comes on a shot of a nip bottle, the kind he drank on the plane, sitting on top of a mini-fridge, one of 2012’s best shots, so to speak. I went to the Sunday matinee of Life of Pi, in 3D, at the Regal Union Square Stadium 14 and paid my $18.50 to get in. Since it was Sunday morning I had stopped on the way and bought a large coffee to drink while I watched the movie. As I approached the escalator to get to the floor where the movie was playing, a ticket taker stopped me and told me I could not go in with coffee. If I wanted to see the movie, I would have to finish it before I went in or throw it out. I asked why. He said it was the theater’s policy. I suggested that since the cineplex was almost empty because it was eleven in the morning, he might just look the other way if I brought the coffee in. No way, he said, they watch me on cameras. So I went back downstairs and got my money back. Sorry, Ang Lee. That coffee was more important to me that morning than seeing a movie in 3D. Instead of seeing it, I walked over to the Strand, which is nearby, and looked at the discount books out front while I drank the coffee. I picked one up and opened it randomly, where I read something that seemed related to Life of Pi because the movie has a tiger in it. Reading it also had the virtue of being free and allowing me to drink the coffee while I read it: “Rapt/I dwell in this thorn and my claw alights/On the sweet breasts of poverty and crime.”Momentarily I considered stealing the book because it mentioned crime and I wanted to get back at the world for the movie theater’s absurd policy. I bought it, though, and that and the coffee together cost more than ten dollars less than seeing Life of Pi. Making a film featuring the music of Benjamin Britten and a biblical flood so you will get the chance to see a 12-year-old girl dancing in her underwear is a perfect example of going the long way around the barn. And the barn is the perfect color. The Impossible is too one- or two-note to succeed as a prestige film. It lacks subtext or metaphor, or any subtlety at all, and deals with climate change head on. It is a horror film about Western tourists, directed by a horror director (Juan Antonio Bayona), without any of the genre trappings of a horror film. Note one, the first half of the film, is the tsunami that struck countries on the Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea, including Thailand, where the film takes place at a pricey resort, in 2004. Note two is the aftermath of the tsunami, during which a family searches for one another across a vast, devastated landscape. Bayona’s staging of the tsunami without (seemingly without) digital effects is relentless, convincing, terrifying, non-stupid, and without Hollywood wonder. The second half features Naomi Watts, the mother, in a hospital bed, mostly unable to move, mostly unattended, and slowly dying. The film has a message: Welcome to the vacation of the future. Fans of Jacques Rivette, Carlos Saura, Robert Altman, and Alan Rudolph will appreciate Geraldine Chaplin’s out-of-nowhere appearance in The Impossible as an elegant older woman, also cast adrift by the tsunami, who briefly and somewhat enigmatically shows up to speak to one of the two lost sons. The Impossible is a more trenchant and realistic film about the future of English people in foreign countries than Skyfall. The two films should play as a double feature. The fate of African Americans in the South, the CIA, great floods, and immobilized bodies: these were the themes that got films nominated for Oscars in 2012. Michael Haneke’s crossover hit, Amour, begins with the corpse of Emmanuelle Riva, decomposing on her bed and surrounded by flowers. Through Riva, the star of Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, one of the French films from 1959 that changed everything, Haneke freezes the European art film in history, immobilizes it, while delivering a poignant film about aging and dying that will please a mainstream audience. Somehow this comes off as typical Hanekian perversity and slightly annoying “last modernist” pretentiousness. Jean-Louis Trintignant, who has worked with almost every great or even interesting European director, from Rohmer, Chabrol, and Truffaut to Kieślowski, Corbucci, and Costa-Gavras, ends the film, and with it, Haneke implies, a whole world of film, a whole era. He does it in a way that will ensure viewers unfamiliar with Haneke understand he didn’t make Amour for the Hallmark Channel. I was prepared to feel awkward while watching The Sessions, a noble film about a poet (John Hawkes) immobilized by polio who hires a sex therapist (Helen Hunt) to guide him through the first sexual encounters of his life. I was not prepared for the combination of Helen Hunt nude plus a Boston accent. The fact that the poet’s first name is Mark added to my discomfort. “Mock, Mock, it’s time to get stotted. Mock, we should stot.” It was the first time sex in a movie made me want to cover my ears. This shrill movie, which features lots of yelling, reinvents the screwball comedy for a post-collapse America by thoroughly deglamorizing its genre. Set in a lower-middle-class Philadelphia suburb, it is a Philadelphia Story in which the female lead (Jennifer Lawrence) dresses only in black, and the male lead (Bradley Cooper), no Cary Grant, works out in a garbage bag. The craziness of screwball is literalized in Silver Linings Playbook. Both characters are, to varying degrees, mentally ill, on meds, or in therapy. The story contains standard rom-com elements, but David O. Russell and cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi shoot the film in a self-consciously gritty, shaky, and underlit way that deflects any resemblance to, say, Friends with Benefits. Silver Linings Playbook is difficult to like, and too long, with a climactic dance scene that is filmically botched, which is fine with the movie because according to the plot it did not have to be good to succeed. The chatty, exasperating qualities of Cooper’s pathology, which Russell understood so well in The Fighter, are equally present here, but Cooper seems more violent and unhinged than Christian Bale did in that movie because he’s nicer and closer to normal. Just as this movie is closer to the romantic experiences of many, many people than the standard-issue Hollywood rom-coms it has stylistically left behind. n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year.

"Sep 18, 2019",negative," I didn't really have any desire to see The Avengers. Mainstream superhero movies aren't usually great, and the logistics of the team-up seemed likely to make this one even worse. But then everyone told me it was awesome, from my 10-year-old to movie critics. I've seen Buffy so I know that Joss Whedon is hideously overhyped, but I guessed he could make a superhero film that wasn’t entirely wretched. I'm a superhero expert of sorts (I wrote a book and everything). So with a sense of obligation and moderately high hopes, I paid my three bucks, and streamed the greatest superhero movie ever TM. And having seen it, I have to say—what? This is the greatest superhero movie ever? Seriously? Yes, there are enjoyable bits; Robert Downey, Jr. is pleasingly sardonic, and his screwball comedy moments with Gwyneth Paltrow are fun to watch. Mark Ruffalo brings a low-key, professorial charm to Bruce Banner/the Hulk. Scarlett Johansen in a form-fitting body suit is Scarlett Johansson in a form-fitting body suit, and her stunt double does a fantastic job with that chair scene. The special effects are fine; things blow up. The movie is not utterly worthless in every way. I'll grant that. But does that mean it's good? Or even adequate? No. The script is a farrago of pseudo-science gibberish stitched together with unmotivated interpersonal tension, as various superfolk engage in pointless swagger-offs using dialogue written by lobotomized chimpanzees, leavened with the occasional moderately amusing in-joke (""puny god!"") and Robert Downey Jr.'s ad libs (which mostly serve to make you wonder why they didn't just have him write the thing.) Chris Evans utters immortal tough guy lines like ""You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play"" with the emotive range of a stuffed herbivore; the best that can be said for Chris Hemsworth is that he's less awful. The usually reliable Samuel Jackson seems marooned behind his eye-patch and his hard-assed superspy ball-buster default; he occasionally gazes with weary, no-nonsense meaningfulness at the camera, clearly seeing visions of being transported to some other movie that does not suck. Tom Hiddleston has been much praised, and he does give Loki some sort of depth, but the by-the-numbers super-villain ranting is hard to overcome; he ends up switching between megalomania and mild whining. Nobody who is forced to lose in a battle of quips with Hemsworth can really be said to be lighting up the screen. I've seen claims that the movie makes some sort of stand for feminism, and the Black Widow does get to kick ass and is an integral part of saving the world. There's not much else to it, but, sure, it's better than all those films where the strong female hero doesn't actually get to do anything. On the other hand, the overall ideological message is typical superhero half-assed vigilante fascism. Democratic institutions can't be trusted to keep us safe because milksop administrators lack the nerve, so you need to rely on Ollie North types to make the tough decisions and deploy the violent overmen. You're supposed to give a super cheer at the end when Tony Stark dumps an atomic bomb on some distant city of twisted nightmarish alien others who attacked the homeland. Did he hit a military target? A civilian one? Are there noncombatants over there? Eh, who cares as long as Downey gets back safely for the next installment. Not that the film is morally noxious; unlike The Dark Knight Rises, little thought has gone into its ethics or its message. We replay Hiroshima just because no one could think of anything better, not because Whedon actually wants to make a plea for genocidal violence. The real emotional energy goes into the post-battle celebration, in which we see rows of screens, each filled with bedazzled witnesses trumpeting the superheroes' collective awesomeness.  The spectators watching in the theater or on their computer screens are clearly encouraged to join in, the film functioning as a naked advertisement for itself and its inevitable sequels. On that level, it’s marvelously effective. The hype is still roping in credulous viewers, however much they may regret it afterwards."
"Jun 8, 2019",positive,Tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences.
"May 8, 2019",positive,Gets everything right. So entertaining when our characters gather to fight Loki who is the best.
"Apr 18, 2019",positive," Loki wants to rule Earth.  There’s really no other way to put it.  After promising to turn over the Tesseract to the Chitauri, they will provide him with an army.  Oh Loki, don’t go making promises you can’t keep.  It probably will not end well. Back on Earth, Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is continuing his research at the Project Pegasus facility.  Before you know it, Loki has both him and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) under some sort of mind control.  While the Avengers Initiative had been discussed a few years earlier, it was placed on hold.  They don’t really go into details as to why this is.  This certainly doesn’t stop Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) or Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) from putting the Avengers together.  First, it’s putting in a call to Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson)–certainly one of the funniest bits in the film!  Natasha is ordered to retrieve Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo).  It takes some convincing after Banner’s previous troubles.  Finally, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) gets Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) while Fury gets Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). It’s not until the Avengers capture Loki that everything starts to fall apart.  Mischief is Loki’s way so this naturally makes sense.  The last thing anyone wants to see is Hulk running around on the Helicarrier but sure enough, it happens.  Again, Loki wants them to be in disarray.  What pushes everyone over the edge is the supposed death of Phil Coulson.  As we know now, he’s not really dead for good.  On the ground, everyone comes together to put a stop to Loki’s evil plan.  Seeing them gathered in the circle (above photo) is just one of those moments that one can only sit there and take in. The visual effects here are phenomenal to say the least.  It’s not just the character designs but the set pieces!  It’s awe-inspiring to actually get to see the Helicarrier on screen.  When you read the comics, you never know what will and will not be on screen.  But to see it on screen?  It’s really awesome. It’s not just this.  In seeing how S.H.I.E.LD. runs, we get our first look at the World Security Council, including Gideon Malick (Powers Boothe) and Hawley (Jenny Agutter).

"Apr 12, 2019",positive," A movie five films in the making, “The Avengers” finally brings together a plethora of popular comic book characters, pieced together with wit and style by writer/director Joss Whedon. “The Avengers” begins with the Earth threatened by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). This forces director of S.H.I.E.LD. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to assemble the only team of crime fighters that can possibly stop Loki, a team that includes Thor, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans). The film begins with a bang and builds from there, a thrill ride peppered with Whedon’s trademark self-aware humor. It’s fun to watch all these egos clash, especially Downey, who just owns the Tony Stark role. Evans has found his stride as well, and, in an added bonus, the script manages to milk some unexpected humor out of Hulk, which proves to be a pleasant surprise. The humor and witty dialogue are key elements to “The Avengers,” with the action being the other major portion. It doesn’t disappoint, especially two extended set pieces. The first takes place on a hover craft and the second, a great sequence depicting the climactic battle in New York City. Working on a script from Max Landis (son of John Landis), “Chronicle” follows three high school students who gain superpowers after finding a strange glowing substance deep inside a cave in the middle of the woods. The boys at first use their newfound gifts for jokes and fun, but things take a turn for the worse when Andrew (Dane DeHaan) – the bullied loner of the group – starts to use his powers for much more sinister purposes. This is where “Chronicle” separates itself from the rest of the superhero pack. This isn’t the nice and cuddly makings of a hero movie. “Chronicle” is more about the evolution of a villain – with Andrew’s back story, including an alcoholic and abusive father and lack of acceptance from most of the student body. DeHaan is really good at capturing Andrew’s slow descent into the dark side, while Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan are also good as the other two members of the teenage superpower trio. Trank keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace, with some clever ways of making the found footage more than just a one-camera perspective. And just when it looks like the film might start to lose a little steam, Trank introduces some pretty cool flying sequences that could have been cheesy, yet work really well. “Chronicle” is rated PG-13 for intense action and violence, thematic material, some language, sexual content and teen drinking and will be available Tuesday on DVD. — To get sportswriter/movie reviewer Micheal Compton’s up-to-the minute thoughts on all things movies, visit his blog at mcompton.wordpress.com or his Twitter page at twitter.com/mcompton428.

"Feb 2, 2019",positive," THE AVENGERS is spectacular in several senses of the word. It is literally a spectacle, with people flying up into the sky, monsters plummeting out of it, airships flying through it and so on. However, the real dynamism here is in the character interactions, not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie, let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully. Followers of Marvel Comics characters in the movies have already seen Robert Downey Jr. star in two IRON MAN films, Chris Evans as CAPTAIN AMERICA and Chris Hemsworth as THOR, the alien mistaken by the ancient Vikings as a god. Although Mark Ruffalo is new to the role, there have been two previous HULK movies in the last decade. (There have also been SPIDER-MAN, FANTASTIC FOUR and X-MEN movies, but those don’t come into play here.) Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and the essential Samuel L. Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features, so THE AVENGERS comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story. However, THE AVENGERS hits the ground running, more or less literally, and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything, without boring those who know. Director/writer Joss Whedon, working from a screen story co-crafted with Zak Penn, finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they can’t help finding even odder. The short version of the set-up here is that something is stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury reaches out to his operatives – some less enthusiastic than others – when it turns out that the Earth is imperiled by the object itself, the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons. We know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet – they are, after all, super heroes, not super-shirkers – but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun. Most films in this genre – the X-MEN series being the notable exception – have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison. AVENGERS can’t, shouldn’t and doesn’t do that. Here, everyone has a tactical function, but more, each one of the Avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can. Whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each character’s unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore that’s what he’s doing. There does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the Hulk, as well as some glorious physical stunt work by Johansson’s Black Widow and Cobie Smulders’ Agent Maria Hill. We get the sense that Downey’s Stark is first among equals here, perhaps because, of the main characters, he not only has the biggest arc, but is the most mercurial. His philosophical clashes with Evans’ straight-arrow Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) are wonderful to watch because of their differences, but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner/Hulk. There’s something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men, used to being misunderstood or not understood at all, finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around. A note of special appreciation about the Hulk here – not only does Ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times (the better to defuse his rage) and major self-imposed loneliness, but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the Hulk since Lou Ferrigno went green. We can still see Ruffalo’s performance within the Hulk, rather than having CGI trying to impose a version of an actor’s face on something that looks like a badly-proportioned videogame avatar (which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the Hulk). Hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game Thor and Tom Hiddleston is elegantly wounded as Thor’s spiteful stepbrother Loki. (One caveat – Loki’s horned helmet doesn’t look any less silly than it did in THOR. This bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well, but Hiddleston bears up under it nobly.) Johansson is coolly capable (and of course looks fantastic) as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow and Renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision. The entire cast is terrific. The 3D doesn’t distract from the film, although it seems unnecessary – the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down. In summation, THE AVENGERS will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It’s a pretty awesome assembly."
"Jan 19, 2019",positive," Have you ever imagined what it would be like if the iconic superheroes shared a universe?  “The Avengers” turns that fantasy into reality.  “The Avengers” astounds its way through the hearts and minds of the geeks around the globe and kicks off the 2012 summer blockbuster into high gear. Catching a flash of “The Avengers” logo and its star performers at the 2010 Comic-Con whet my appetite for a bigger treat.  While DC has lagged far behind with its superheroes ensemble, “Justice League,” clearly, we’re in for something extraordinary with Marvel.  A culmination of superhero movies, which started with “Iron Man,”  and continued with “The Hulk,” “Thor” and “Captain America.”  I was cautiously optimistic.  Director Joss Whedon (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Firefly”) would attempt to go where no man has gone before and he’s pulled it off with a superhero aplomb. Each of the main characters is unique in its own way and strong enough to carry a movie on its own, so pulling them all together, and bringing in more characters would be a gargantuan task.  A lot could have gone wrong.  Fortunately, a lot goes right. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the disturbed brother of Thor, makes his appearance past the galactic portal, steals the Tesseract, a source of infinite energy, from the S.H.I.E.LD base, an international peacekeeping agency, and leaves the ground crumble and destructions behind. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who may also have a hidden agenda to regain the cosmic cube, knows that it’s time to activate the Avengers Initiative, a remarkable team of superheroes uniting forces to save the world.  It’s hard to conjure up a villain who would pose a credible threat to the Avengers, but Loki is not to be dismissed.  He promises to unleash Chiaturi, an extraterrestrial army, to aid him in conquering the earth and carrying on his vengeance against Thor. The eclectic ensemble of superheroes is made up of brilliant industrialist in armored suit, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); recently thawed from ice WWII all-American patriot, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans); God of Thunder, Thor (Chris Hemsworth); Jekyll-and-Hyde scientist, Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); superspy and assassin Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); and master archer, Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).  They all gather inside a Helicarrier, an invisible, flying fortress lifting up from the sea. The team goes off to a rocky start.  Big egos and personalities, mixed with superpowers, clash.  These larger-than-life characters are used to the be the center of attention and don’t always play by the rules.  The interactions among the alpha characters are the highlight of the movie.  Plenty of dead-on, fantastically funny one-liners.  Eventually they realize that they need to set aside their differences and work together as a team. There are a number of memorable scenes.  RDJ is still a wisecrack standout and has the coolest entrance as Iron Man, lands on the Stark Tower and unzips into Tony Stark, and later skydives back into the suit.  Thor’s late appearance latching onto the aircraft amid thunders and lightning is pretty grand.  Captain America takes an integral role as a leader worthy of the captain title.  He’s more impressive here than in his own solo flick last summer.  Black Widow showcases her combat agility by managing to escape out of an impossibly tight situation, and toward the end utilizes Cap’s shield as a springboard, leaps into the air and pursues a flying alien.  Hawkeye falls down hundreds of feet, shoots an arrow, swings into a building and lands back on his feet. If there’s a surprising scene stealer, it’s the Hulk. Ruffalo, replacing Eric Bana (2003) and Edward Norton (2008), plays the role to the hilt, both as a nerdy human and monstrous beast. There are outrageously hilarious scenes, separately involving Loki, Thor, Iron Man, and all that smashing. As much as I’d love to see a deeper story, it’s typically reserved for a singular superhero film, “X-Men: First Class” notwithstanding.  “The Avengers” forgoes complexity for spectacle, by equally shining the spotlight on each character who serves a purpose, spectacular set pieces and special effects, amazing actions and rolling-on-the-floor humor.  It’s incredible to see all of these superheroes heroically banding together in one scene.  The final battle in Manhattan concludes with a selfless act from an unexpected character. At nearly 2.5 hours, it doesn’t feel like it.  And it’s originally longer.  It’s been said that a lot of Captain America’s scenes ended up on the cutting floor.  I’d be interested in seeing more of his scenes as initially filmed, coming to terms with his past, awakening and adjusting to the modern world.  Stay past the credits for two additional scenes, the first one as a spoiler for the geeks and the second appeals to the general audience.

"Jan 8, 2019",positive," Critics the world over will be scratching their heads and shaking nervously as they ponder their write-up of Marvel’s Avengers Assemble (2012) (previously titled The Avengers). Following an average set of trailers and a suspiciously low-key viral marketing campaign, only chronic liars and eternal optimists will claim they saw this coming. Not only is Avengers Assemble the best comic book adaptation to date, but also arguably one of the greatest action adventure blockbusters in cinema history, up there with the likes of Star Wars (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Ghostbusters (1984).High praise indeed, but in one fell swoop director Joss Whedon has not only reinvigorated the  Marvel comic movie franchise, but also thrown down the gauntlet at Christopher Nolan’s feet. The unstoppable juggernaut that is Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises (2012) might be destined for greatness, but it will have to be truly exceptional to better this take on the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. The balancing act Whedon has pulled off is nothing short of awe-inspiring. As both  screenwriter and director, he has brought together a bunch of iconic characters and created a film in which they shine not only as individuals, but also dazzle as part of the Avengers team. Fears that this would be the Iron Man show are quickly diminished. Robert Downey Jr.’s  effortlessly charismatic Tony Stark is at the centre of the action,  but as any avid reader of the comics will tell you, Iron Man and Captain America are the team’s prominent characters and their turbulent relationship is at the heart of most of the film’s best moments. Some critics will say Chris Evans’ that Captain America is over-shadowed by Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, but they would be missing the point. Iron Man is the wise-cracking millionaire playboy and Cap is the steady-boy scout soldier, with Evans underplaying the role perfectly despite his ridiculous costume. All the heroes are great with perhaps the exception of Samuel L Jackson’s Nick Fury, but it’s more a case of Jackson doing a good job with a fairly weak character. Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow all get some fabulous scenes and Tom Hiddleston is suitably impish and evil as main antagonist Loki, yet it’s Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk/Bruce Banner that really steals the show. The Eric Bana/Edward Norton angry, mindless versions of the jolly green giant pale in comparison – finally we have a Hulk we can all get behind. Whedon’s masterful Avengers Assemble deserves an essay, and no short review could ever do it justice, but if you’re in the market for one of the most wondrous and entertaining cinematic experience you could ever hope to have, book your tickets, buy your popcorn and prepare to be amazed."
"Jan 4, 2019",positive," It’s taken a long time — and a lot of money — to assemble “The Avengers.” Marvel Studios began developing the superhero superfilm seven years ago. A screenwriter began work in 2007. The stars who played the eponymous characters from “Captain America: The First Avenger,” “Thor” and the two “Iron Man” films — as well as a new “Hulk” — were brought together for the first time. Their salaries and, more importantly, the special effects that turn movies into spectacles led to a reported $220 million budget.
  The result? “The Avengers” is an engaging-enough film. But with that kind of treasure, talent and time, you’d expect more — a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers.
  Director Joss Whedon takes his time establishing the plot — which seems silly, given that it’s the same story we’ve seen in countless action films. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), “Thor’s” bad-sheep brother, steals the tesseract held by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The potential energy this cube holds makes it dangerous — and Loki plans to hand it over to the Other in exchange for an army of Chitauri with which Loki can conquer Earth.
  “Freedom is life’s great lie,” Loki declares in one of his frequent purple-prosed disquisitions. The survival of humanity Scarlett Johansson in every sense — is at stake. So Fury brings out the big guns: The Avengers.
  “You’re going to leave the future of the human race up to a handful of freaks?” someone asks Fury. It turns out to be a good question. Loki didn’t even need to come up with a plan to divide and conquer them; they do it on their own. What else would you expect when you put into a single room a huge egotist (Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man), an earnest patriot (Chris Evans’ Captain America), a demigod out of water (Chris Hemsworth’s Thor) and a genius with an anger-management problem (Mark Ruffalo, the new Hulk)?
  Oh, wait: Marvel realized there wasn’t any eye candy in that group. So they’ve thrown into the mix the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), an agent, not a superhero.
  You can predict how this by-the-books flick will go: Bad guy possesses item that will bring him immense power, good guys are assembled to stop him, good guys fight amongst themselves until a loss makes them realize who the real enemy is, right before a final fight that uses most of the film’s big budget.
  Don’t expect it all to make sense, though. When Bruce Banner first turns into the Hulk here, he goes after the Black Widow, who’s been sympathetic to his plight. The next time he becomes big and green, he’s totally on Team Avenger, smashing only members of the alien army — with no indication of how he was tamed.
  That showdown takes forever to unfold, too. Why did they bother? There’s nothing here we haven’t seen in any of the big summer flicks of the last few years. How many shots do we need of Thor taking his hammer to a collection of computer-generated creations?
  At first, it seems like Downey is going to get all the great lines. But every character is given his chance to shine. Let’s face it, this is a bizarre group of people to assemble. Of course there’d be rough-and-tumble hilarity. Thor wants a chance to talk Loki out of his delusions of grandeur and tells the team his brother can be redeemed. Black Widow points out how many people Loki has killed in just two days. “He’s adopted,” Thor deadpans in response.
"
"Dec 7, 2018",neutral," As I continue down the #RoadToInfinityWar, I come to the pinnacle of Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase One, the culmination of five films and the foundational world-building that led to The Avengers. In 2012, we had never seen anything like it. Sure, there were those old Universal Monster movies that paired up Frankenstein, Dracula, and company, but never did we see such a wide range collection of disparate properties, tied together into a cohesive narrative. I remember much talk then of if something like this could even work from a storytelling perspective, let alone into a crowd-pleasing blockbuster. To be honest, when the first trailer dropped for The Avengers, I didn’t know if it would all come together. Boy, did this film prove itself to me and the world! Tasked with the job of making the film was Joss Whedon as director. Love him or hate him, he has made a career off of writing and envisioning ensemble productions, making him a no-brainer at least from a writing perspective. Handing him the keys to the kingdom as a film director was a creative risk in the eyes of many, as he had only directed one theatrical-release film prior (2005’s Serenity, a fan-pleasing conclusion of sorts to his abruptly canceled “space western”, Firefly). Still, his credits on television as the creative lead run numerous and popular. Fans knew he could handle the storytelling demands of unique individuals, working even begrudgingly together toward a common goal. He had even written comics and wrote scripts for unmade comic-book movies, like his much-storied take on Wonder Woman, years prior to it actually being made. With this, he had his work cut out for him, taking Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and supporting characters into a believable threat scenario and make them “gel” as a cohesive team, as a survey of those films creates a list of similarities and differences. The good news was that everyone was pretty impeccably cast coming in; the reality, though, was that it all lives or dies by his script. In this film, we see the Avengers Initiative, only hinted at and talked around prior to now, coming into the time of greatest need. The director of SHIELD, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), enlists the assistance of Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton), in supplement to the vast resources and agents he leads. He knows that at a time when the Earth is in supernatural and life-threatening peril, that an ordinary solution can’t fix extraordinary problems. Each of these men is incredibly unique and gifted in their own ways: Stark patrols the world as Iron Man, his technological marvel of a suit, Rogers is Captain America, a super-soldier military strategist brought back to life after decades frozen with impeccable character and the ability to lead others, and Banner is one of Earth’s brightest scientific mind, even if his rage brings about a destructive monster, the Hulk. They, as well as special-agent Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson), must work together, alongside the Asgardian demi-god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), to stop Loki from bringing an alien force to Earth and destroying everything we know and love. It’s a fairly simple concept that required every bit of the five preceding films to set up properly. With all the pieces put in place, this film gets to be the playground we get to watch our toys used to their fullest potential. With Whedon accompanied by Zak Penn, who was well versed in writing comic-book films, I can say that the script is what keeps us coming back over the years. Of all the MCU Phase One films, this is undoubtedly the most fun, and I watch it often even after all these years. You can tell Whedon had a ball making this, and surely he felt the amazement writing it that audiences got while watching it all play out. The mere mortal, SHIELD Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the connective glue of a character that appeared in almost all of the preceding films, acts as an avatar-of-sorts for the audience here, showing the amazement we are all feeling by seeing the events take place. He plays an incredibly important role in everything here, from a storytelling perspective as well as making it all relatable. Is the film the most “comic-book”-ey of them all? Of course, but why wouldn’t it be? It’s that aspect that it nails so well. If you go back and re-read the original Avengers comic debut, you’ll see that we could have gotten something far “hokier” than what they wrote. Those original characters are mostly here, but the threat is more credible here and, post-9/11, the New York City setting resonated without feeling exploitative. The threat faced here is one that can be understood globally, and that’s likely the reason the film was embraced worldwide. With many countries rebranding the Captain America film to only “The First Avenger” for political reasons, it was good to see this film embraced, as the threat is not from Earth, but against us from the Chitauri, an invading alien force brought here by Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Was it necessary that we have a deep understanding of who the Chitauri were to enjoy this film? Not at all. They are cannon-fodder at the behest of Loki, and it’s probably for the best that we only get shrieks and grunts from them. It cements that them as a force rather than characters we need to fully understand. It isn’t a bad thing, per se, but with this compulsion to understand villains we feel in modern times, it is a critique I have heard. For any wanting to dig into understanding a villain, they need only to look to Loki. Arguably, he is the central piece that makes this whole thing work as well as it does. Sure, audiences (myself included) love to hear Stark’s banter and the like, but without a believable and investable villain, it all fails. Hiddleston returns to his role in even finer form than he did originally. It’s hard to put into words the entertainment that is experienced seeing this film play out, even after multiple times of seeing it. The incredibly crowd-pleasing moments this film has in spades still hold their charm, and that’s rare for any film to do. The comedy and exhilaration that comes from the perfectly peppered jokes and action set-pieces are amazing to experience and even more so to ponder that it all works so well. The film is supplemented by an incredible hero theme from Alan Silvestri. The look and feel of the film feels an appropriate extension to each of the preceding films, while still maintaining an identity of its own. Honestly, this is the first of the films to cement an identity as a Marvel style that really carries through to the most recent films: crisp, clean, and colorful with zippy dialogue and a sense of fun throughout. Does it begin to feel derivative? To many, yes, but here, we see the reason for its appeal. There is little darkness on display here, with the lighting of the above picture showing about as dark as it gets. The use of color is dramatic here, and it keeps everything light and approachable. This film’s box-office receipts prove just how approachable the final film turned out being. Perhaps the biggest strength of the film is witnessing the Hulk truly come into his own as a star. His films never seemed to fully resonate with all people, but I have yet to find a person who didn’t love everything about him here. He quite possibly steals the show whenever he is on screen, due to a much more relatable Banner from Ruffalo and his ability here to actually grin from time to time (who knew?). The swagger that Robert Downey, Jr. brings clashes head-on with the old-school heroics of Chris Evans. The seeds of conflict are planted here, as we know they eventually come to blows later down the line. While it’s necessary to the story for Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be featured as a villain first, it does feel weird to see him as mindless before we get to see him as full-on heroic. Still, don’t take that as serious critique; all of the casting is so well done and natural that the strength of the cast is mind-blowing. Visually, there are so many set-piece moments, and the live-action Helicarrier still takes my breath away every time. Much has been written about the sheer amount of destruction that takes place in the film, and while we could debate the effectiveness of our heroes in “saving” the day, it’s undeniably a thrill to watch the last hour or so transpire. Some of the film’s best comedy, funny enough, comes amidst the bombast of explosions and fighting that takes place. All of the strength of these moments stems from the firm establishment of characters we know and love, and it comes naturally and all just feels right. It all results in an exhilarating mix of emotion that is like riding a thrill ride. Seeing it all in 3D back in the day was a highlight of that medium for me, and the fun translates, regardless of the format you watch it on. Content-wise, there is mild language and action galore, but I find it impossible to keep this movie away from kids. There is so much fun to be had in enjoying it. It is the wish-fulfillment of kids everywhere, regardless of their age. I never thought I’d see the day that these heroes would share the screen, but honestly, it brought tears to my eyes in 2012, not because of anything deeply moving in the film, but just in seeing how incredibly well-done the final product was. I can think of nothing that would improve what we got. It’s not perfect, because what film is, but it is likely the pinnacle of what the MCU can be for the broadest of audiences. On the topic of spiritual matters, there is little, other than that great line from Captain America about God. It’s just a fun and character appropriate moment that felt good to see. That being said, I don’t see anything here that is spiritually troubling. All-in-all, the film is about as good of a time one can have at the movies."
"Nov 21, 2018",positive," Let me just start off by saying I did not have high hopes for this film. It was going to be a box office smash regardless. Next, you’ve got six superheroes, four of whom are used to having the spotlight all to themselves. Then you’ve got screen time issues, character development and the challenge to develop a story with heart—all while demolishing a city or two. Oh, and let’s not forget establishing that no one superhero is better or stronger than any other. It seemed an impossible task. Well, against all odds, they pulled it off, thanks in large part to writer/director Joss Whedon. Our story begins, or rather continues, in the labs of S.H.I.E.L.D., where Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) receives an unwelcome visit from the god Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Loki is back for revenge after his brother, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), humiliated him the last time he tried to takeover Earth. Loki steals a top-secret sustainable power source and hypnotizes Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to assist him in his evil doings. The mischievous god plans on unleashing an alien army to take over earth. It’s up to Nick Fury to resurrect the scrapped Avengers Initiative. He must unite Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Hawkeye and Thor if there is any hope of saving the planet. Make no mistake. This is an incredible action movie. From special effects to fights to explosions, it hits every marker. But the movie is so much more. It’s hysterically funny, charming and smart. That was the first time in years I have been in a movie theater when the crowd, on multiple occasions, erupted in spontaneous applause. I predict Avengers 2 is in the works, not to mention 3 and 4. You know what? Bring them on."
"Nov 18, 2018",positive," Synopsis: Exiled Asgard prince, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), with the help of a sinister alien race, is able to worm-hole his way to Earth by latching on to the Tesseract energy source there. Loki’s plan is to rule over Earth, but spy agent, S.H.I.E.L.D., contacts round all the known superheroes to combat Loki and retrieve the Tesseract. Review: Avengers Assemble does exactly what it says on the tin: the Avengers assemble and proceed to smash things up – a lot! Don’t get me wrong, it’s all highly enjoyable, with Joss Whedon’s vision for the Avengers coming very much in the lineage of J.J. Abrams’ recent Star Trek reboot: they’re both highly literate, have a pleasing self-awareness and lightness of touch, while always honouring the fanboy, action-heavy element to the genre."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive,"The Avengers shatters the last barrier separating the printed page and the celluloid image, fully wresting the superhero genre away from the medium that birthed it."
"Oct 31, 2018",negative,"Sounds kind of corny, you say? Oh, that's nothing. Massive corn-shucking in this film, corn piled everywhere, cornpone, corn fritters, corn syrup, corn as high as an elephant's eye, the Feast of Our Great God Corn!"
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), has come into possession of the Tesseract, a mysterious cube that could be a source of unlimited energy. The Tesseract activates a portal that allows the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to step into Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and plans use it to summon an army of the alien Chitauri to help him conquer the planet. Fury assembles the only team that may have a chance of stopping him: the Avengers, Earth’s “mightiest heroes.” Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) join with Loki’s brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in defense of the Earth. Four years has all led up to this, The Avengers, the pinnacle of Marvel Studio‘s output and a showcase for their biggest heroes who aren’t currently licensed to other studios (like the X-Men and Spider-Man). Marvel’s taken great care to set up their cinematic universe, and a massive amount of time and effort have gone into bringing the Avengers to the big screen. To further up the stakes, Marvel turned the film over to Joss Whedon, who has tremendous amounts of talent and fanboy good will, but little experience in blockbuster spectacles of this size. The gamble pays off, however, as The Avengers is simply pure, unadulterated comic book thrills, a four-color, 3D rush of adrenaline, heart and wit. The amount of talent in front of and behind the camera that Marvel’s assembled is no less than staggering. As writer and director, Whedon has a clear love for the characters, as well as an eye for both crowd-pleasing spectacle and visual beauty. The script never panders to the audience, nor does it try to deny or belittle its origins. A story about characters who can fly, hurl cars and fire energy beams can’t take itself too seriously, after all. However, Whedon never tries to make the film too serious, always maintaining a careful balance of light and dark. Dramatic monologues are broken up by witty asides or genuinely humorous moments that give the film depth and humanity. Whedon’s only feature film credit as a director prior to The Avengers is Serenity, which proved he was more than capable of staging huge action sequences and juggling a full cast of oversized characters. He certainly has his hands full here, but he handles everything beautifully. Each character is given an opportunity to shine, in heroics and in dialogue, with particular attention paid to how they all interact as a unit. One of Whedon’s biggest strengths, as he demonstrated on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is showing how highly dysfunctional and damaged individuals can come together to form a coherent, functional whole that benefits from both the flaws and the strengths of each unit. The scenes of the Avengers arguing about what to do next are just as interesting as seeing them take down a flight of alien bio-ships or seeing Iron Man and Thor literally butting heads. Superhero films live and die on the strength of their action sequences, and time and again Whedon delivers them with flair and style. His super-fights are lessons in physics, where impossibly strong characters hurl near-indestructible opponents back and forth, uprooting trees, smashing glass and digging trenches into the ground. Each bout is edited with very careful precision, detailing the meticulous choreography and mastery of space present in each. During one battle, perspectives are constantly shifted between the heroes, but it’s done in a confident, assured manner that reminds us how all of these individual melees are connected and how the team is working for a singular purpose greater than their own personal aims. It’s character depth through fisticuffs that avoids the “things go boom” mentality common in most summer action films. Likewise, each character is treated as a fully-fleshed individual and not reduced to a single personality trait or to their individual abilities. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers get the most screen time, their personalities near total opposites in most ways, with Stark being the self-proclaimed “billionaire genius playboy philanthropist” and Rogers being the good soldier struggling to maintain order. Downey has Tony Stark down perfect at this point, and Whedon hands him the majority of the film’s funniest lines, all of them delivered in a self-satisfied smirk that clearly hides Stark’s own fears and doubts. Evans, on the other hand, portrays the good Captain as more than just a “soldier out of time.” His old-fashioned virtues are at odds with both Stark’s freewheeling independence and modern warfare’s shades of gray, and it’s how he handles the conflict between doing what needs to be done and following orders that makes Rogers the heart of the team. Evans’ calm, balanced portrayal makes him the most sympathetic of the team and the most dynamic. Rogers is never a blustering super-soldier or a Boy Scout with a shield. Evans also happens to have one of the finest rear ends in modern cinema history, which is just extra spangles on the jump suit. Hemsworth and Hiddleston continue the Shakespearean dueling that made Thor so compelling. Loki isn’t a cartoonish, maniacal laugh type of villain, and Hiddleston approaches the role as a genuine character and not a two-dimensional image. Loki is a highly fallible creature, just like his brother Thor. Both Asgardians wear masks of bravado, Thor to shield himself from emotional involvement, and Loki to hide an inferiority complex that drives almost every action. The brothers are more alike than either one would care to admit, and this comes out in the tense, love-hate interactions between the two. The Avengers is a team, however, and the three biggest personalities don’t get all the spotlight. Johansson gets much more to do here than look good and kick ass, although she does both effortlessly. At first glance, the Black Widow seems an odd partner for characters like Thor and Iron Man, but her true strengths lie in the fact that she can’t simply pick up a city bus with one hand or blast a warship out of the sky. She has to rely on skill and wit more than perhaps any other character, and watching her rough-and-tumble, up-close-and-personal, lucha-libre-inspired fighting style is a genuine highlight of the film. Renner has perhaps the hardest job in establishing Hawkeye in the universe’s firmament, having only had a brief cameo in Thor prior to this. He’s the least developed of the Avengers, but he’s still a compelling personality, and like the Widow, his strength lies in his relatively frail humanity. Mark Ruffalo takes over for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, and he fully inhabits the role both figuratively and literally. As Banner, he’s a world-weary man constantly walking on eggshells with his own thoughts and plagued with self-hatred for his inability to contain his alter ego. Ruffalo also portrays the Hulk through motion capture, and he gives this Hulk a distinct physicality and human connection that pure CGI could never match. It’s a shame, though, that Samuel L. Jackson doesn’t give more life to Nick Fury, although he’s still perfect to play the role, and Whedon wisely reigns in Jackson’s inherent cool-guy vibe; Fury is not the kind to spout obscenities about snakes on a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier. You may notice that I’ve not devoted a lot of time to mentioning specific scenes or moments in the film. This is entirely deliberate. There are so many great moments that it would be hard to list them all, and it would be cruel to ruin the fun of seeing them for the first time. There’s more than one piece of action or line of dialogue that caused laughter so loud during my screening that I decided I would have to go see the film again just to catch the bits I couldn’t hear. There’s a moment toward the end of the film’s climactic battle that not only ranks among one of Whedon’s best visual gags ever, but quite possibly one of the best visual gags in superhero films period. It’s the Avengers themselves who make the film as dynamic as it is. It’s not their powers or their battles, but them as individuals and as a family, even if it’s a family not of their own choosing. Whedon’s signature is showing how outsiders and “freaks” are perhaps the most heroic of us all. His characters all battle personal demons as well as literal ones, and nobody has an easy time doing it. Still, what makes Whedon’s work so appealing is seeing how these jagged pieces can fit together in a way so seamless that it’s impossible to imagine them as separate parts. Buffy could never do what she does without the Scoobies’ help, and that show’s fourth season quite literally showed them becoming one to battle an opponent that would be impossible to defeat without a bond that strong. Likewise, the Avengers may fight amongst each other, and they might fall down more than once (and quite spectacularly), but they always succeed in the end by relying on each other. Much like how the X-Men can inspire the outcasts to fight for themselves and the future, the true strength of the Avengers is their reminder that the world exists outside of ourselves, and nothing is impossible if your friends and family are beside you. Will there be a sequel? Is the Hulk green? (Spoiler alert: yes.) Let’s just say that the post-credit scene had multiple people in my audience (myself included) shouting “Holy shit!” and desperate for 2015 to arrive. The Avengers is on track to be one of the biggest films of the year, and it’s by far the best superhero film in nearly a decade. This is what a comic book movie should be: thrilling, exciting and surprisingly, almost shockingly, human."

"Aug 23, 2018",positive," There has already been a great deal of praise for writer/director Joss Whedon’s handling of the epic Marvel mash-up Avengers Assemble (2012), and it’s easy to see why. Drawing together a group of impressive Marvel heroes – most of whom have had their own film(s) over the past five years – is no easy task, especially if you are also trying to appeal to a bigger market than simply comic book geeks. Thankfully, Whedon has successfully achieved this feat with humour, action and sheer spectacle.Banished god of Asgaard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has come to earth in order to rain down terror with the aid of an incredible powerful artefact, the Tesseract, which will allow him to open a portal for an invading alien race.  Fortunately, the steely mind of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) has a plan to bring together Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), in order to thwart Loki’s evil master plan. The problem is that heroes have big egos and they don’t always play nice – but will they finally come together to save (or avenge) the Earth? Central to the success of this Hollywood blockbuster is its sheer simplicity. Whedon might be a self-confessed comic book geek of epic proportions (sometimes it isn’t good to get what you want) but the real reason he was brought in is that he understands characters, a fact demonstrated in the much underrated Firefly, it’s big-screen spin-off Serenity (2005) and of course Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Understanding characters means that he understands what makes for a tremendously enjoyable film, jam-packed with heroes that millions know and love.  Perhaps most satisfying of all is the way Whedon has crafted the definitive Bruce Banner/Hulk character, expertly portrayed by Ruffalo (with the help of ILM motion capture), who does well to bounce off the playboy wit of Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark. The action in Avengers Assemble is simply breathtaking. The final action scene, which runs for over half-an-hour, is awe-inspiring in its proportions, with audiences able to witness Manhattan brought to its knees as the half-dozen heroes desperately fight to save it. These impressive final scenes, along with some fantastic comic moments as the heroes squabble in the way only superheroes can, make for a great popcorn action film. Avengers Assemble is neither hugely sophisticated nor subtle, but is all the better for it. This is a back-to-basics, purist’s action movie that should leave audiences fully satisfied, something that none of the previous Marvel films has ever truly achieved.  Make sure you also stay in your seats for a mouth-watering post-credits surprise."
"Mar 5, 2018",positive,For an action movie there are a lot of genuinely funny lines. There were parts of this movie that had my laughing out loud.
"Nov 11, 2017",positive,Probably the best superhero/comics movie of all time. [Full review in Spanish]
"Oct 23, 2017",positive," If you’re sitting there going, “I don’t like comic book/superhero movies, so I don’t care about The Avengers,” well fine, but just know you’re passing up the most fun that can be had at the movies this year. The Avengers, written and directed by Whedon, is not flawless. There are some trouble spots. But when stacked against the sheer pleasure derived in watching, those issues ultimately don’t matter. Because even with a couple squiffy points, The Avengers is not a mess. It should be, but it isn’t. It works on nearly every level and is a testament to a great director working with a great group of actors and a studio that knew when to get out of the way and let the creatives be creative. We already know 99% of the characters in The Avengers. We know Tony Stark/Iron Man, we know Thor and Steve Rogers/Captain America and Bruce Banner/the Hulk (even if we are getting a new take on Banner, courtesy Mark Ruffalo). We got an idea of Natasha Romanov/Black Widow in Iron Man 2, who here has a much-expanded role (and you won’t hate Scarlett Johansson!). The only new Avenger is Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton/Hawkeye, of whom we only got the barest of glimpses in last summer’s Thor. So the movie assumes that we know these people and doesn’t waste time with re-introducing them. In Renner’s case this is slightly problematic as we really do not know Barton as a person, and he spends the first half of the movie as Loki’s bitch, so there’s never a strong connection with him. Like, if he never came back I don’t think we’d miss him. Still, if you’ve missed any of the previous character movies, you won’t be left adrift by The Avengers. Whedon’s script handles characterization in very compact increments so that we get a clear picture of each person and their relationships very quickly and with minimal fuss. It’s a real accomplishment of writing. The plot is similarly compartmentalized, centering around the Tesseract, that glowy cube from Captain America, which if you didn’t see it doesn’t matter because one line establishes that this an Important Thing That Everyone Wants, and a responding one-liner from Rogers conveys that it is also Very Bad News. The plot in barest form is that SHIELD is trying to use the Tesseract as a new energy source but they accidentally summon Loki (Tom Hiddleston, War Horse), Thor’s half-demented little brother, from whatever space-pocket he fell into at the end of Thor. Loki immediately destroys everything, mind-controls Hawkeye into being his bitch, and absconds with the Tesseract. So Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his Avengers and then proceeds two hours of straight ass kicking. Acts one and two are basically Avenger-on-Avenger violence and act three is Loki and his space army vs. the Avengers, leveling most of mid and lower Manhattan in the process. IT WILL ROCK YOUR FACE OFF. What isn’t working in this movie is the story structure of acts one and two. It plays out more like a series of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative, although I really don’t know how you do any better, given that you have to get six different people in the same place. Whedon uses Loki as his means of bringing out each Avenger, giving them all a scene opposite Hiddleston, who plays Loki with a scary mix of confidence, aloofness and insanity. He’s a great villain and Hiddleston is clearly having a ball playing him, which makes him incredibly fun to watch. His best scene is easily the confrontation between Loki and the Black Widow, and damn if Johansson doesn’t really deliver as the uber-spy Natasha. They’re clearly sowing seeds for a potential Black Widow movie, and while I don’t think we need it, I’d watch it if Whedon was in charge. Things even out in act three, though, as the Avengers get to New York to try and stop Loki’s space army. I cannot stress enough how amazing the assault on New York is. Each Avenger has a chance to shine and everyone, even the ridiculous bow-and-arrow-wielding Hawkeye, contributes in a meaningful way. And for all the chaos that is raining down, the action is executed clearly—it isn’t a headache-inducing mess like Transformers. Act three is also when the two Avengers who struggle most with characterization get their shit together and deliver, that being Chris Evans as Captain America and Renner as Hawkeye. Captain America is a challenge because he’s so boring and such a do-gooder that there’s no internal conflict from which to derive drama. Evans does his level best through the first half of the movie but it’s only when Cap begins clicking along with Stark that he feels like a fully realized character. There’s just a hint of sarcasm in Evans’ delivery when he deals with Stark that serves Cap well and should be remembered for Captain America 2. Letting the inner cranky old man out of Cap makes him more interesting. As for Hawkeye, when he is finally back in his right mind, Renner delivers as a stone-cold assassin fueled by a well of cold rage. I don’t think I’d want to see a Hawkeye movie, but as a dude who lurks on the periphery he’s very effective. But, as is always the case with RDJ, it’s Tony Stark who rules the roost. He is at his sarcastic, bitchy best, and even manages a little character arc that sets up Iron Man 3 without being obnoxious. And RDJ was right—bringing in Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a good call as she humanizes Stark and makes him more relatable. Without her he’d be an insufferable know-it-all but at key moments Stark turns to Pepper and reveals the traumatized man underneath the armor both real and emotional. His storyline is easily the most satisfying of the movie, mostly because Stark is one of those internal-conflict characters that is capable of creating his own drama. He doesn’t need Loki or anyone else to propel his actions. Stealing the show, though, is Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Like Hawkeye and Widow, I don’t think I need a Ruffalo/Hulk movie (although I’m sure we’ll get one anyway), but as an ensemble player Ruffalo is a stand-out. The Avengers is awesome. It’s not perfect but it is damn good and is hella fun. That this movie works at all is a testament to Joss Whedon’s skill, but that it is also genuinely funny, sincerely heartfelt and some of the best ass-kickery you’ll see on screen is what makes it more than just a superhero movie. It is THE superhero movie."
"Sep 11, 2017",positive,"[The Avengers] is fast-paced, funny, thrilling and well-crafted."
"Sep 8, 2017",positive,"The comedic timing, coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters, is worthy of praise. The Avengers delivers a popcorn feast that's the perfect summer kickoff."
"Aug 30, 2017",positive," A primo example of the variety-pack approach to summer block-busters, “The Avengers” lumps together a half-dozen super-heroes, in much the same way cereal companies stack grocery shelves with snack-packs of Sugar Pops, Special K, Cheerios, Coco Puffs, Raisin Bran and Fruit Loops. Well, “The Avengers” does not lack for action. In fact, New York gets smashed up pretty damn good as Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) pool their respective powers to defeat Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a badass from Asgaard, where the Norse gods hang out. To try to explain what each of these folks do (I’m still not sure about Black Widow, aside from Johansson — surprise! — looking great in black leather) would take up half the review. And I’m trying to make a point. Namely, the banter is, in its way, as impressive as the CGI budget. Now, I don’t mean Tennessee Williams or Tom Stoppard have anything to worry about. I’m just saying that director Joss Whedon — who seems to have been born with dweeby fanboy DNA — understands the crux of super-hero aggregations like X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Metal Men, Justice League of America and, yes, the Avengers. Like, what would Thor say to Ironman if they were teamed up against the same villain? Can the Incredible Hulk be a team player? (Mostly not, to hilarious effect). In its way, “The Avengers” is about as “character-driven” as a huge summer comic-book movie can be. And in just the right combination of affection and silliness.

"Dec 11, 2016",positive,"  Nothing like The Avengers has ever been attempted in Hollywood history.  No major motion picture has ever been the culmination of four different blockbuster franchises, each with its own protagonist, and crossing them over into one gigantic film.  It's bigger than a sequel or even a planned trilogy.  Marvel had to take pieces from their previous superhero films to assemble The Avengers.  The studio wedged set-up into Iron Man 2, wove the covert government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. into Thor, and tacked bookends to Captain America: The First Avenger.  The plan for The Avengers was audacious to the point of near-hubris, but writer-director Joss Whedon has managed to deliver an absolute powerhouse of a payoff that's truly worthy of Marvel's astonishing ambition.   After being exiled from Asgard, the villainous demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes a bargain with a shadowy, malevolent entity.  Loki must go to Earth, capture the fabled Tesseract (a cosmic cube of immense power), and use it to open a portal that will allow the alien Chitauri army to invade our planet and make Loki our ruler.  S.H.I.E.L.D. has the cube, but Loki quickly takes it along with agent Clint Barton aka ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) by using a mind-controlling scepter.  Barton has access to S.H.I.E.L.D. resources, Selvig has the science to open the portal, and the only ones who can stop Loki's plan are Earth's mightiest heroes: Tony Stark aka ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka ""Black Widow"" (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo), and Steve Rogers aka ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans).   Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America all provided an essential ingredient in helping the plot of The Avengers by allowing it to skip character introductions.  Thor and Captain America get a couple brief moments to recap the key events of their movies, but The Avengers doesn't waste time with exposition.  Instead, the film devotes most of its energy to bringing a bunch of superheroes together and expanding their individual stories.   Writer-director Joss Whedon does a wonderful job of taking the characters other people built, staying true to their personalities, and then adding his unmistakable spin.  Captain America in The Avengers is essentially the same pure-hearted, unflappable do-gooder from Captain America: The First Avenger, but through Whedon, we get a character emotionally struggling to adjust to being ripped out of 1944 and awakening over sixty years later.  At the same time, Whedon still has the good comic sense to let the character get giddy at recognizing a pop culture reference.   Almost every character gets this strong blend of comedy and drama.  Thor provides the emotional grounding for Loki, who would simply be a moustache-twirling supervillain without his superhero half-brother.  Black Widow gets plenty of screentime to expand her individual story to the point where it feels like a heavy prep for a great spin-off.  As for Hulk, The Avengers manages to deliver the best on-screen adaptation of the character.  In addition to having the Hulk kind of look like Mark Ruffalo, this is the first time the Hulk is actually fun.    Whedon and Ruffalo turn Banner away from the brooding loner, and turn him into a bashful, nerdy guy who will only acknowledge the Hulk as ""The Other Guy.""  In The Avengers, The Hulk is Chekhov's Gun if Chekhov's Gun were a howitzer tank.  When that blast finally goes off, we see the Hulk realized in the best way possible.   However, Whedon can't quite shower everyone with this lavish attention and development.  Robert Downey Jr. has so thoroughly defined the character of Tony Stark that no one, not even a writing master like Whedon, can leave an imprint.  S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has been a presence in all the previous Marvel movies, but he still doesn't get to be the all-out badass we've been itching to see.  As for Hawkeye, he spends half the movie being Loki's slave, so there's not much room to build a character.   Despite the varying levels of development, The Avengers succeeds on a character level because the story is about bringing these superheroes together.  It's an absolute joy to see these distinct personalities play off each other.  When Iron Man fights Thor, it's not just a geeky thrill to watch the showdown, but to also see how each hero retains their noble intentions while having a genuine conflict.  Whedon operates with an understanding of how someone with the unshakable morality of Steve Rogers is going to handle a wild card like Tony Stark, or how Thor's arrogance hasn't completely diminished since his solo movie.  However, one of the film's few flaws is jumping into some of the conflicts without providing an adequate set-up to the scene.  The second act of the film lacks the flow to move from conflict to conflict so the arguments feel slightly manufactured even though Whedon has stayed true to the characters.   The movie may stutter a bit in the middle, but when The Avengers swings into the third act, it becomes a blockbuster picture at its finest.  Joss Whedon has absolutely realized the geek dream we've been waiting for since Nick Fury introduced himself to Tony Stark after the credits of Iron Man.  The scope of the final battle makes it perfectly clear that no individual superhero could handle this challenge solo.  More importantly, the battle had to be constructed so each superhero was a valuable addition.  The film's climax needs Iron Man's speed, Captain America's on-the-fly tactics, and Hulk as the unstoppable weapon.  Every superpower is an instrument in Whedon's grand symphony of delightful destruction.   The opening set piece raises doubts about Whedon's ability to direct action since it's difficult to tell where characters are in relation to each other, but after this initial misstep, the action scenes are an absolute blast.  Whedon swooshes his camera around the battlefield, embraces the magnitude of the situation, and makes the audience feel every hit.  The 3D provides a little bit of depth to the climactic finish, but the effect doesn't add much to the overall picture.  The third act of The Avengers bears a resemblance to Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and while Michael Bay has a greater mastery of 3D, Whedon has mastery over creating a coherent narrative featuring characters you care about.   I'll always take the latter over the former.   Leading up to The Avengers, every director had left a stamp on their Marvel movie, but not to the point where he was inseparable from the material.  Kenneth Branagh provided a fantastical grandeur to Thor (along with superfluous canted angles) and Joe Johnston imbued Captain America with an old-fashioned, patriotic vibe.  These are styles, and they can be recreated.  But there is only one Joss Whedon, and The Avengers wouldn't be as strong without him.  He understands how to develop meaningful relationships between his characters, has a surprising talent for crafting epic action scenes (a welcome surprise considering his only feature film before Avengers was the modestly budgeted Serenity), and his humor is second-to-none.  There are some one-liners and visual gags that still have me giggling when I think about them.   The Avengers is why we go to the movies.  The film will work fine on a big-screen TV, but it's the kind of gigantic blockbuster fare that sends us back to every summer we went to the theater and were absolutely wowed.  By crafting a winning combination of wonderful characters, brilliant comedy, and spectacular set pieces, Whedon hasn't simply created the biggest superhero movie; he's created one of the best.

"Dec 11, 2016",positive," At my screening of Marvel’s The Avengers, the audience couldn’t wait until the end of the film before erupting in applause. In the midst of a massive action sequence in the third act of the story, the entire Avengers team, including Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, assembled on screen and seeing them together was too amazing to ignore. It was a tribute to how entertaining the film truly was; a reaction to a wonderful payoff moment built up by well-crafted characters, witty dialogue and a thoroughly thrilling script. And I won’t be surprised if happens again and again once the movie is released worldwide. A direct sequel that follows the events of the previous Marvel Universe movies, the film begins when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) finds his way back to Earth and steals the Tesseract – an alien source of pure energy – and threatens to enslave the human race with the help of his extraterrestrial army (called the Chitauri). Seeing no other option, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the leader of the covert government outfit known as S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles the team of superheroes known as The Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner) to stop Loki’s plans. Rather than creating an uneven mix or trying to focus more heavily on any one specific character, writer/director Joss Whedon has constructed The Avengers as a balanced ensemble. In addition to everyone getting at least one great action sequence, all of the characters are fully fleshed out and given an arc to work with, whether it’s Captain America’s struggle to adjust in the modern world, Thor’s guilt about his brother, Iron Man’s ego and single-mindedness, or Hulk’s fear of his own power. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, who were largely minimized in their previous appearances, are fully fleshed out and provided with backstories that give us a better understanding of their characters. As fun as the other Marvel movies have been to this point, the action sequences have operated on a small scale, and The Avengers does more than compensate. Seemingly taking on a philosophy of “go big or go home,” the action is not only pure spectacle, but perfectly paced and shot by Whedon, who makes frequent cuts so that we can see everything that’s going on with the different heroes. The final battle sequence between the superhero team and Loki’s army is better than all of the action in the other Marvel movies combined and multiplied by ten. It earns the buildup from all the preceding films by being the most epic title we’ve seen with these characters yet. Over the course of his career, Whedon has become well known for his smart characters, quick wit, and emotional gut punches, and this film will only serve to bolster that reputation. Though never even coming close to spoof territory, the movie is actually very funny, both in dialogue (such as Captain America actually recognizing a pop culture reference from The Wizard of Oz) and physical humor (most notably a confrontation between Hulk and Loki). Though a tiny bit off towards the beginning, the pacing of the film quickly comes together as the writer/director is able to both tell the story he wants to tell and mix in multiple high-tension fight and action sequences. As a lifelong comic book fan, I walked into The Avengers with the highest hopes and deepest fears. A little over two hours later, as the credits began to roll, I turned to the friend sitting next to me, smiled and exclaimed, “They actually did it!” What Whedon and Marvel have created here is not just extraordinary, but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet.

"Jul 7, 2015",positive," Joss Whedon triumphs in Marvel’s Avengers Assemble, the superhero team up of Iron Man, Thor,  Captain America and The Incredible Hulk is in cinemas 26 April 2012. Hollywood has turned into a bizarrely egalitarian place. By yesterday’s rules genre favourite Joss Whedonshould have had to slog through some well-received C and B-list pictures before he was allowed anywhere near Marvel’s flagship blockbuster. Yet here we are. Despite his sole big screen, feature-length directing credit being Serenity, he’s turned his knack for writing and directing wise-cracking ensembles – honed on Buffy, Angel and Firefly – onto the stars of some of Marvel’s biggest movie franchises, all formidable toylines in their own right. Even with a movie universe created specifically to this end like Marvel’s, there are cracks where the slightly different worlds in which the characters operate don’t quite line up. The variation in tone and Top Trumps power level between the major players of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr’s vainglorious armoured billionaire), Thor (Chris Hemsworth’s overly-literal thunder god), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo’s bemused Doctor Jekyll, turned big green indestructible Hyde) and Captain America (Chris Evans’ sincere super-patriot) – without even getting onto slinky secret agent Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), steely-eyed marksman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and no-nonsense spymaster Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) – are too extreme for any reasonable fix. As there is no reasonable fix, Avengers Assemble just gets on with it, and in doing so is perhaps the most faithful comic-book movie of all time. Not faithful in terms of box-ticking its way through the canon, particularly, but in terms of being a big, brilliant, multicoloured romp that breathes life into the garish absurdity and silliness that endears us so gleefully to the world of superheroes. There’s a clunky opening sequence with Tom Hiddleston’s brattish Loki that kicks the plot off the starting blocks with a thump, leading into a series of pitch-perfect introductions in which every player presents themselves to the viewer and the plot – from Black Widow kicking seven shades of slayer out of some villains like Buffy reborn, to Steve Rogers pounding a punchbag and worrying about his place in this brave new world before Nick Fury turns up to offer him one. Like the very basic comic-book crossover, Avengers Assemble sets our heroes against each other at the machinations of a common enemy (Loki and mind-controlled minions, plus some rasping, ringwraith-like baddies from another dimension… or something like that), have a face-off guaranteed to make fanboys squeal and seal-clap, bicker and trade Whedonesque, genre-savvy punchlines before finding their place within the team and, through teamwork, defeat the big bad. With this many characters – and even supporting characters, as Thor’s Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), the sardonic Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Iron Man’s Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) all feature – to even get between that relatively unpretentious a-to-b narrative would be near impossible to pull off. Compare this to Bryan Singer’s slickly ponderous first X-Men movie, in which there’s a whole lot of scene setting and not much else. Whedon does it, although that the DVD/Blu-ray will come with 30 minutes of deleted scenes proves that this is anything but effortless. Avengers Assemble is big, but it isn’t bloated. It’s just over two hours long, but it doesn’t feel like it, as energy levels are ramped up and remain so for the duration. There’s an amazing economy of dialogue and motion, with every line or gesture intended to bring us joy, and not just drive the plot mechanically forward like the failed super team-ups of old. Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man is obviously the stitch to this social fabric, sparking the back and forth and setting the tone, but everyone gets their moment – Captain America gets to be more the moral and cultural conservative of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch’s The Ultimates, but without the xenophobia and self-righteousness, and the CGI Hulk – voiced by the iconic TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno and mo-capped by Ruffalo – is a gloriously funny and emotionally diverse brute, capable of playful aggression and relish as much as the mindless rage that reduced entire segments of his solo outings into set-smashing tedium. You could be forgiven for the merciless mocking of Hawkeye – whose inclusion in 2011’s Thor was deeply contrived – in the run-up, but even he finds his place in the narrative, and is sort of endearing, with the exception of the way he flicks his collapsible bow out, which he does far too often, and a bit of pointless rappelling from a girder (presumably Renner invested in his own kit after Mission: Impossible, and insisted on getting some use out of it). Surprisingly, Captain America is next up in the uselessness stakes. He gets some moving scenes that anchor his character to this new world, but the power differential between him and three guys who can destroy buildings with their big green fists, their repulsor blasts, and their magic hammer is so great that come the climatic final battle he’s reduced to being the leader of a redundant second tier of Avengers with Black Widow and Hawkeye. It’s a brief lapse, though, and Cap subsequently proves his worth – directing the battle and mustering civvies like the star-spangled icon we want him to be. The level of comic-book cheese and overwhelming nature of the cast and premise might confuse those unfamiliar with the earlier movies or source material. For those who’ve been pressing the air out of acid-free bags since childhood, or find themselves hiding the price tag on that impulse purchase of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller’s 1982 Wolverine miniseries from their spouse, Avengers Assemble is such a pure and unadulterated comic-book movie that it will bring you to tears."

"Jul 7, 2015",positive,"  Joss Whedon's The Avengers — not to be confused with Jeremiah Chechik's film of the same name, where Ralph Fiennes wielded an umbrella and saved the world from evildoers in candy-coloured teddy bear suits — is a mix of everything: of superheroes, of action and emotion and comedy, of staging that careens between prestige theatre and vaudeville, and of acting styles that span the spectrum from silent cinema to the modern day.  To get an idea of the overall mood, you have to imagine something starring Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, Sylvester Stallone and Marlon Brando, and directed by Michael Bay and Sidney Lumet on a bank of giant green screens. That gleaming cube at the centre of the screen could well be the kitchen sink — though it's really the Tesseract, a fearsome energy source, which Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wastes no time stealing, after which he proclaims, “I am burdened with glorious purpose.” For an instant there, the film itself seems freighted with glorious purpose.  Is there a better conductor of electricity up the spine than plummy villainy played with a British accent? Hiddleston, last seen in War Horse vanishing into a puff of smoke, creates such a devilishly theatrical character that we wonder not, as we usually do in these movies, whether the superheroes will be called upon to engage with a worthwhile supervillain, but whether this supervillain will be dispatched by superheroes worthy of him.  And those heroes come in all shapes and sizes. There's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the master archer, and Black Widow, whose prime power appears to be that she comes in the form of Scarlett Johansson. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who'd retreated to Kolkata to lead a stress-free existence (this is how we know we're in the comic-book universe), returns with greying hair and a rumpled suit. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) reappears with his hammer, and Captain America (Chris Evans) shows up with his shield and a demeanour that could only come from being raised on a diet of apple pie. Then there's Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), the magnetic core of the entire enterprise. Not since Harrison Ford slipped into Indiana Jones has an actor so memorably ingratiated himself with a playful part — he is introduced alongside Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and their banter has a screwball-comedy vibe that sets the tone for the rest of his scenes. Downey, Jr. reminds us that special effects mean nothing unless the character inside the suit is a character, a fully formed human entity distinguished not just by a formidable superpower but by, say, the Black Sabbath T-shirt on his person (and, of course, Black Sabbath recorded a song named Iron Man). Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man has the distinct attitude that most other superheroes lack, and it's tempting to imagine a movie-long contest between him and Loki, the winner being the actor who scarfs down the most scenery. He even punctures the pompousness of other superheroes, dismissing, for instance, Thor's grandiloquence as “Shakespeare in the Park.” Even as he soars, Iron Man keeps The Avengers grounded. Whedon takes a leaf from Iron Man's manual and infects his film with a sense of mischief. Where Eric Bana and Edward Norton played glumly into the bifurcated angst of Hulk, Ruffalo locates a vein of slapstick comedy. There may even be a splash of unintended humour in watching Cobie Smulders (from the sitcom How I Met Your Mother) as a secret agent on what looks like the deck of the Starship Enterprise. It's too drastic a change of image — we expect her to trip over Thor's cape and rush red-faced to Johansson's side to whine about the embarrassment over a glass of Canadian red. But Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, is left with little to do. We're promised an inscrutable character (“even his secrets have secrets”), but he's content to blend into the wallpaper as the Avengers save the world from Loki's minions, who arrive from outer space on ships that snake through Manhattan's airspace like sluggish alligators after a noonday meal.  Captain American wonders, at one point, if his stars-and-stripes costume isn't old-fashioned. He's told that, sometimes, “People might just need a little old-fashioned.” That The Avengers certainly is, resisting the modern impulse to peel back tormented layers of superhero psyche.

"Jul 7, 2015",positive," Director: Joss WhedonCast: Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L JacksonQuick take: Blockbuster of the yearIt’s that time of the year when air conditioning and pop corn assume a larger role in our lives. Come summer cometh the time for blockbusters. The Avengers is easily as epic in anticipation as Avatar was two years ago. And just like the James Cameron magnum opus this ensemble superhero saga packs a big mean punch on visuals and setup but is as thin as hot air in its story.Marvel superheroes have gained steam over the past few years. The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have all made successful movie debuts. The culmination of all their success is one big movie franchise and it’s called The Avengers. To a comic book geek that’s the equivalent of drinking from the Holy Grail. To an action movie buff that’s like Arnold Schwarzenegger teaming up with Sylvester Stallone. For everybody else it’s a chance to experience $200 million well spent. Whatever is your calling, fact is The Avengers is a film a large part of the movie going populace would want to watch. It has all the trappings of a feature that entertains. It’s got heroes by the dozen. It’s got a wealth of comic book wit and punchy one-liners. And most importantly 75 per cent of its runtime is big booming action.Why does the world need four superheroes and two heroes teaming up? Because the problem at hand is cataclysmic. Aliens are opening a portal and planning a hostile takeover and they are being led by a demi-God. That is the number one and only problem with this mammoth of a film. The core idea of the story is not very novel. What makes up for that is some fine dialogue. Apart from super powers, sexy girlfriends and other miscellaneous benefits, the other reason we loved superheroes in comic books was for their wonderful sense of humour and ability to charm with witty dialogue. The Avengers is a winner on the front. The writers also do well to weave in continuity as they compile parallel storylines from different superhero sagas.The first half of the film is all build up and you’ll find yourself either amused with the juvenile humour or clutching your fist in elation at the various comic world references. And then in the second half the film gets a big green vaccine of chaotic energy. The Hulk makes an angry entrance and throws the proceedings into a state of maddening frenzy. The relentless action mixed with some potent 3D makes for some jaw dropping viewing.  By the end you’d have enough endorphins kicking in your system to make you jump with joy. When the superhero dust settles you’d have long forgotten any subconscious need for story. The film will sweep you off into a world where you’d be wishing for muscles and a cape. That’s a win win situation. We tailor your experience and understand how you and other visitors use this website by using cookies and other technologies.

"Aug 24, 2014",positive," Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America come together for the greatest gathering of superheroes of all time. Or, rather, the greatest gathering since the last X-Men movie. And with this many Marvel crimefighters on the same screen, it’s little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience – one that’ll please both fanboys and the public at large. Following on from last year’s Thor flick, the demi-god’s evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is now intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that’ll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), the head of the peacekeeping Shield who sets about uniting the world’s superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the arrow-slinging Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the catsuit-clad spy Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Given how most of the characters have had their own movies over the past few years, Avengers avoids the usual superhero trap of spending too much time on back stories, instead throwing us straight into the action. That initiative involves bringing together a team of superheroes - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), as well as human heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who must find a way to work together to save the planet. The first two films impressed fans, which was pretty hard to do given that the mutant team are real cult favourites. The third X-Man film was less than impressive while X-Men Origins: Wolverine offered occasional entertainment. A new Wolverine film is set to film in Australia. Christopher Nolan’s re-boot of career of the caped crusader proved to be a massive hit, with sequel The Dark Knight proving even more popular (mainly thanks to Heath Ledger’s version of The Joker). His trilogy ends with The Dark Knight Rises, which opens this summer. I have a sneaking fondness for Tim Burton’s Batman – which controversially starred Michael Keaton in the role – though the less said about George Clooney’s stint of Batman the better. The first in the series (which started in 1978 and ran through the 1980s) starring Christopher Reeve showed that superhero films could be popular. They got less and less impressive as the years went on and the fourth Reeve outing was pretty awful. The 2006 reboot Superman Returns was a modest success, and Zac Snyder (who made 300 and alternative superhero movie Watchmen) is having another go at the concept, with Henry Cavill slipping on the tights for Man of Steel, which opens next year. A smart and clever bit of Disney animation that really get the super-hero mythology spot on as well as having a whole lot of fun along the way. Cult hero Spider-Man (aka mild-mannered photographer Peter Parker) arrived on the big screen in 2002 in the first of three fantastically popular films, though the character will be re-launched this year in The Amazing Spider-Man, starring Brit Andrew Garfield in the lead role. A wonderful bit of dark and dangerous superhero action, with Ron Perlman spot-on as the demonic superhero Hellboy, who has appeared in two films directed by Guillermo del Toro. Other strong contenders might include Iron Man, Blade, The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, The Crow, Darkman and even the wonderfully camp Swamp Thing. Likely bottom on any list, though, will be the likes of Green Lantern, Constantine and Daredevil…all of which failed to set fan-boy hearts racing."
"Aug 24, 2014",negative,"This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done."
"Aug 24, 2014",positive," AVENGERS Assemble is the long awaited big screen team-up of Marvel superheroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). AVENGERS Assemble is the long awaited big screen team-up of Marvel superheroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Our heroes are brought together by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) when the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army threaten to bring about the end of the entire human race. Since the first Iron Man movie in 2008 this is what Marvel Studios have been building towards and I’m delighted to report that this film has been more than worth the wait. Buffy the Vampire Slayer director Joss Whedon is the brave man to take on this colossal project and the creative visionary strikes a perfect balance between action, storytelling and tugging at various emotions. Downey Jr. is hilarious but also shows his heart when the going gets tough, Evans’ Captain impressively takes charge of the team, third big screen Hulk Ruffalo is the best yet, and the charismatic Hemsworth picks up where he left off in Thor. Johansson is as good as she’s been in a long while and Hiddleston’s villain is deliciously chilling, particularly in a verbal assault of Black Widow. Whedon’s action sequences are first rate. It’s hard to pick out a highlight as there are so many; Loki’s early attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. The assault on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The nearly half-hour long Manhattan set finale. Hulk v Thor!! Nice extra touches include classical music playing over Loki’s strike on a high society ball in Stuttgart and Whedon’s swooping camera during the climactic battle showcasing every Avenger in action, one after the other. The film is quite action-heavy, and the climax a bit Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but we’ve had the build-up in previous individual character movies. If you haven’t seen those films then you might struggle to follow certain story elements but, let’s face it, why wouldn't you have treated yourself to watching them? (sorry, that may just be my comic book head being all presumptuous). Whedon also wrote the story in collaboration with Zak Penn and fantastical it may be, but they never lose sight of the threat posed (lots of use of the word “war”). Is Avengers Assemble the best comic book film ever? That’s a tough call but it’s certainly the most exciting, and a true epic moment in cinematic history. The comic book movie has definitely reached dizzying new heights and nothing can possibly... wait, hang on, The Dark Knight Rises is out on July 20."
"Aug 24, 2014",positive," That's why ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is so immensely satisfying. We want our heroes to be smart, quick-witted and saying interesting things. We want them to be courageous and confident and complicated, a balance of internal conflict and external bravado. We want to see them test the limits of their extraordinary abilities and save the world in spite of their flaws. Whedon, a longtime reader and writer of comics, gets all this right. Giving him a $220 million budget and the freedom to direct and write (Zak Penn also gets story credit) this megablockbuster conglomeration of Marvel Comics superheroes was a wise move. Four of his heroes – Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk – were previously established by directors who generally know what they’re doing behind the camera, but only Whedon has truly demonstrated what tickles a legion of funnybook readers. Not that “Avengers” is for diehards only. Whedon’s ability to pen sharp dialogue, develop character and construct clear, consequential action sequences (including one doozy of a third-act battlemageddon) assures inclusivity. The cult of Whedonites who have for years worshiped his whip-smart TV work - “Buffy the Vampire Slayer, “Firefly,” etc. - will surely gloat that they expected cinematic greatness from the guy all along, given the opportunity and the right project. “Avengers” feels perfect for him. It’s a lively, vibrant, colorful and wildly entertaining piece of pop filmmaking. Yes, he brings the action hard, fast, heavy and often. But he manages to prove that an abundance of personalities on screen need not be the cluttered messes of “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” and “Batman” features past. Whedon gives each Avenger a convincing character convolution: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., ever the sparkplug) learns to set aside ego to work with a team. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a man lost in this era, a former World War II hero recently thawed from a block of Antarctic ice after decades of stasis. Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton from 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk”) constantly contends with his doozy of a Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome, and calls the big green beast inside him “the other guy.” Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is more compelling here than in his headlining feature, dealing with the guilt of unwittingly leading his power-hungry brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Earth. Loki, who’s dastardly and cackling and as arrogant as 1,000 housecats, warps to Earth from Asgard and steals the tesseract, an artifact that will facilitate the delivery of an alien army across the universe to conquer and/or destroy, like, everything. His plan dovetails with that of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who, as established in the preceding Marvel films, intends to bring together the aforementioned superdudes, hoping they’ll be greater than the sum of their parts. Fury is the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the world’s most powerful and covert collaboration of spies, headquartered on, of course, a flying, invisible aircraft carrier. Whatever. Plot contrivances matter not, as long as the Avengers assemble, right? Problem is, they’re a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a very big, green loose cannon. Complicating the dynamic are two skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agents: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a dead-eye archer who’s initially brain-zapped and made one of Loki’s drones. And Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), despite seeming puny in comparison to the laser guns and unbreakable shields and sacred hammers and raging ids of her teammates, is an espionage artist, as skilled at interrogation as she is at filling a tight outfit. But years of skullduggery and assassination mean she and Hawkeye have more blood on their hands than their brightly costumed compadres. Fury is the Whedon analog here – it’s a monumental task to bring many disparate elements together into a cohesive and functional whole, and that’s why “Avengers” feels like such a victory. Is it perfect? No. The first act finds Whedon struggling to find his tonal footing, and a couple of plot holes are, shall we say, hulking. But when revved up, the film is an exhilarating blend of comedy, thrills and wonderment to meet the demands and slake the desires of millions of fanboys. Of all the comic-book movies in the modern era, “Avengers” is the comic-bookiest. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Aug 24, 2014",negative," ""Unhappy the land that has no heroes!"" someone remarks to Bertolt Brecht's Galileo. ""No. Unhappy the land that needs heroes,"" Galileo replies. And if superheroes are multiples of the ordinary variety, the world as perceived by Hollywood is currently in as dire straits as it was during the great depression when the comic-strip masked avengers were first created. Joss Whedon, a major hero to Tinseltown's accountants, and Marvel Comics' movie division have come up with the wheeze of bringing together six of Marvel's superheroes (Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America and the lesser-known Hawkeye and Black Widow) to confront Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the evil trickster of Norse folklore. He's slipped through a crack in the universe and stolen the all-powerful Cosmic Cube. In the course of defeating his megalomaniac schemes, much of midtown Manhattan is destroyed along with several thousand people, though happily the Chrysler building survives. The special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative, and the film is unduly protracted. The superheroes and supervillain Loki get all the jokes, which pop out of their heads like bubbles in a comic strip. This leaves Stellan Skarsgård, the inventor of the Cosmic Cube and Samuel L Jackson, head of the international peacekeeping agency Shield, to do solemn and serious, which they deliver in a suitably straight-faced manner. Karl Marx could have been anticipating 9/11 and this movie when he said that history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce."

"Aug 2, 2013",positive," Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" joins the rarefied company of ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Superman 2,"" ""Iron Man"" and even Tim Burton's ""Batman"" as contenders for the title of Greatest Movie Ever Based on Comic Book Superheroes. Six superheroes, their one-eyed boss and a super villain vie for our attentions in ""The Avengers,"" and uber-director/writer Joss Whedon never allows them to pile up in a muddled mess. Here comes the first movie since Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to begin where many movies end, and to move with such alacrity that there's no time for restroom stops and concession counter visits. I caught ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (the proprietary title is to distinguish it from the 1998 British spy bomb ""The Avengers"" with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes) Monday in a packed house of franchise-friendly fans burbling with euphoric joy at every comic put-down and triumphant act, and those are legion in this movie. Remember that blue energy box found in the ocean at the end of last year's ""Captain America""? (Of course, you do. It's called the Tesseract.) Thor's megalomaniac half-brother god Loki (Tom Hiddleston, recalling too much of Alan Rickman's Euro-trash villain from ""Die Hard"") steals the Tesseract as part of his plan to lead an invasion of Earth to subjugate all humans. The story's real conflict involves S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) struggling to get six superheroes to work together and save Earth as part of his controversial ""Avengers Initiative."" These guys fight each other so often, we almost forget about Loki lurking around. They're a bunch of suspicious, infighting misfits ruled by ego, resentment and good, old-fashioned American individualism. Iron Man, aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is the sassiest Avenger, quick with an insult (he refers to Thor as ""Shakespeare in the park"") and proud that he ""doesn't play well with others."" Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, superb as a control freak) is a key member because of his experience with gamma rays - the same ones that turn him into the raging Hulk when agitated. Curvy Russian assassin Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, the single fem in the bunch), moves like a leopard, although she appears to be the only superhero here who, like Batman, has no discernible super powers. The sixth Avenger, the archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), has fallen under the control of Loki and his mystical spear. (This handy weapon works not only as a blade, but as a rocket-launcher, machine gun, truth serum and stylish personal accessory.) ""The Avengers"" jets along with a zippy 142-minute running time with Whedon in complete control of this impressive movie, a worthy payoff for Marvel fans who've patiently waited through mediocre films (""Thor,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" ""Hulk"") for a truly super superhero experience. Just as a diverse and divided American populace became a unified force following the assault on New York City more than a decade ago, the six Avengers likewise drop their petty differences when faced with a deadly attack against the Big Apple. That's why the movie's most emotional moment occurs not during the final battle, but just before, when the divided superheroes come together to fight for a cause more important than themselves."

"Jun 30, 2013",positive," After a series of films that introduced many of the Marvel characters to moviegoers worldwide, search  the long-awaited blockbuster that brings the crew together is in theaters now. Featuring beloved comic book characters like Thor, check  Captain America, Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the new film brings the super-powered team together to battle Thor’s evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army. The movie begins where many of the other films end: with the individual heroes living their own separate lives but on the brink of coming together to form one unit. Fate and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jacskon), the director of a secret agency known as SHIELD, eventually bring this disparate team of do-gooders together. Thor’s evil brother Loki is planning to use a cube of energy for his diabolical plan for world nomination and Fury is eager to stop him. As the story’s menacing monster, Loki speaks like a super-villain in waiting. “I am burdened with glorious purpose,” he says followed by “Freedom is life’s greatest lie.” Fury knows that such a nemesis is more than just what one superhero can face so he recruits a team known as “The Avengers.” This alliance includes several characters who have previously been introduced in their own individual films. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Downey Jr.) are here along with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and newcomer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Also on the crew is The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) whose story was introduced in two previous films which featured different actors in the main role. There’s a lot to enjoy about this new film, including the invaluable input of Joss Whedon. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator directed The Avengers and the screenplay with the help of Zak Penn(X-Men: The Last Stand) . For fans of Whedon’s work—he’s the creator behind Angel, Firefly and others– his touch is evident throughout the story. From witty one-liners to the great climactic action sequence, viewers will recognize Whedon’s strengths throughout the film’s nearly two and a half hour running time. But The Avengers, despite its many positive attributes, never achieves greatness. Loki, for one, often feels like an unworthy opponent. This sour sibling simply seems to want revenge against his brother and despite some of his memorable never really stands out as a memorable opponent. He’s more fleshed-out here than he was in Thor but the character still leaves a bit to be desired despite a few great scenes showing him locked in capitivity. Admittedly, The Avengers never offers a great plot or a strong story. The cube of energy at the center of the fighting leaves a lot to the imagination. What it does offer though will appease fans of summer films. Many of the action scenes are great and the main characters—especially Iron Man—are fun to watch. Plus, there’s a sheer joy in seeing these Marvel characters join forces to defeat a bad guy. When the team stops destroying itself, they inevitably come together as one and the scene where they stand as one unit on the street almost gave me chills. That’s more than I can say for most summer blockbusters but I did expect more from The Avengers. Despite a noble and noteworthy effort, this film never fulfills all of its potential and never achieves the status that superhero classics like The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 have already achieved."

"Jun 20, 2013",negative," A superhero movie for the Super PAC era, the Marvel Comics all-star revue, The Avengers, reminds us that there’s still strength in numbers, at least where the fortunes of the Walt Disney Company (which is distributing the film as part of a long-term deal with Marvel) are concerned. Even before opening in the U.S., The Avengers has already racked up an impressive $300 million—or roughly $30 million more than the beleaguered John Carter earned in its entire release—and far be it from me to begrudge this superhero smorgasbord its success. It also arrives on a tide of enormous fanboy expectation and enthusiasm, and the early reviews have suggested that the fans are indeed pleased. But is that the sound of genuine excitement or merely relief? Co-written and directed by Joss Whedon, the wunderkind behind TV’s Buffy: The Vampire Slayer and Firefly, The Avengers is a slickly entertaining package that manages to keep a lot of balls in the air—mini-sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, plus yet another reboot of The Incredible Hulk—with agility (if not exactly flair), occasional flashes of wit, and a modicum of charm. After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind. As Hulk-sized “tentpole” movies go—those that have all of Hollywood’s resources at their disposal and the fates of entire studios in their hands—you could certainly do worse. Maybe I’m just being overly nostalgic for the bygone days of summer movies past. Like the summers of 2008 and 2011, when the first Iron Man and Captain America pictures surprised with their genuine comic-book panache and—dare I say—lyricism. Though more modestly scaled than The Avengers, both were supremely enjoyable pop entertainments featuring a lot of old-fashioned movie craftsmanship (bold primary colors; action delineated into crisp, clean widescreen panels) courtesy of directors Jon Favreau and Joe Johnston—and, moreover, characters you could actually care about. The Marvel universe has always been rich in superheroes who remain decidedly flawed, vulnerable humans beneath the fancy get-ups and genetically enhanced musculature, and those movies managed to translate them to the screen along with a lot of high-tech wizardry and lo-fi genre love.  You didn’t have to be a comics fan per se to share in Tony Stark’s euphoria (and faint terror) as he tried to get the hang of his rocket-powered super suit for the first time, or to mourn with Steve Rogers over the death of his best friend. In The Avengers, the characters are the same, as are the actors playing them, but you don’t care about them as much because the movie itself doesn’t. It doesn’t reveal new layers to the characters or deepen our understanding of them in the way of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Superman II, and The Dark Knight. This time, it’s mostly all business. The tesseract—that all-powerful glowing cube last seen nearly winning WWII for the Nazis in Captain America—has resurfaced in present-day New York, where none other than Loki (the nefarious “frost giant” last seen falling into an interstellar abyss at the end of last summer’s execrable Thor) hopes to harness its energy to amass a drone army and open a portal between our world and his. Meanwhile, that suave superhero headhunter Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets about rounding up his elite troops and briefing them on their mission. Of the lot, only The Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) needs any real convincing, and it’s Ruffalo—stepping into the shoes vacated most recently by Edward Norton—who gives the The Avengers what personality it has. Perhaps because he’s new to the role, Ruffalo is the only actor in the film who’s allowed any significant scenes that don’t serve simply to keep the plot chugging along, and he makes the most of them to create an endearingly awkward Banner who seems perpetually uncomfortable in his own skin, whether white or green. The rest of the movie cries out for some quiet, character-building moments—or at least more crazy cameos on par with the great Polish auteur Jerzy Skolimowski as a Russian heavy who meets up with the wrong side of Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow. What, for example, does Captain America, who has recently awoken from a decades-long slumber, make of this whole big, crazy, mixed-up modern world? Television has always been hailed as a writer’s medium, driven by storytelling as opposed to visual grandeur, with the director on hand mainly to execute the writer’s wishes, never deviating too much from the established style of a successful series. Even in recent years, as television screens—and budgets—have grown larger, the writer has generally remained the master of this domain. And as audiences have found these series more consistently intelligent and entertaining than most of the movie studios’ commercial product, it’s no surprise that their creators—J.J. Abrams, Judd Apatow, Whedon—have been courted to write and direct movies. (Next up: David Chase.) This may ultimately prove to be a good thing, but for now it is bringing us a lot of movies that look and feel like big-screen television. (It was only with his third feature, last summer’s Super 8, that Abrams finally seemed fully in command of the new medium.) The Avengers is rife with scenes that can be deemed “spectacular”—not least the climactic superhero rumble on the streets of Midtown Manhattan, during which that aforementioned portal in the sky opens up and unleashes enormous winged serpents that look like the love children of the alien from Alien and the spaceship from Alien. Hell appears to have quite literally broken loose, and yet for all his technical skill as a director (or at least his skill in surrounding himself with top-tier artisans) Whedon never really thinks in terms of images—the visuals are secondary to the story, and since the story itself is subpar, you notice this all the more. The Avengers has the polished, professional, but completely flat, anonymous look of a mid-Eighties James Bond picture. Throughout, I couldn’t stop wondering what an inspired creative force like Brad Bird might have done with this material. Then I remembered that he’d already done it: it’s called The Incredibles. In one of those stranger-than-fiction tales from the Hollywood front lines, the legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray once wrote a script for Columbia Pictures entitled The Alien, about a gentle extraterrestrial who strikes up a friendship with a  young boy in a rural Bengali village after his spaceship crashes there. Although the film was never produced, Ray himself saw more than a few lipstick traces of his scenario in Steven Spielberg’s E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (a movie that began life as a Columbia production), though he declined to press any formal charges. There are no aliens in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, only Indians, but judging from the reaction of a cadre of British pensioners newly arrived in Jaipur, there isn’t much difference. An Avengers for the Cocoon generation, this postcolonial, culture-clash burlesque stars Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and assorted other acting treasures of the Realm as the latest tenants of the titular B&B, a family-run resort whose reality turns out to be considerably less than the sum of its carefully photoshopped parts. They include Dame Judi as a widow forced to sell her London apartment to pay off her husband’s debts, a couple (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) whose daughter invested their retirement nest egg in an Internet start-up that never started up, an old playboy (Ronald Pickup) looking for one more fling, and a retired High Court judge (Tom Wilkinson) searching for the India he knew as a young man. “Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses?” Dench asks in one of her character’s narrated diary entries. Well, definitely not in the eyes of screenwriter Ol Parker (adapting Deborah Moggach’s novel These Foolish Things) and director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love). Their India is a nonstop barrage of blaring sitar music, screeching horns, chattering street urchins, blinding sunlight, and enveloping dust—to say nothing of the obligatory spotty plumbing and electricity, and stomach-churning cuisine. At the center of it all is none other than the Slumdog Millionaire himself, Dev Patel, shucking and jiving his way through a truly embarrassing performance as the hotel’s harried, quixotic proprietor (who comes complete with a domineering mother and an unwanted arranged marriage). By the time the resident racist spinster (Smith) makes friends with an untouchable servant girl, I felt certain that the esteemed Mr. Ray was spinning in his grave. Like a lot of movies that pitch themselves to supposedly “underserved” audiences—blacks, women, the elderly—The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel traffics in the very hoary stereotypes it ostensibly sets out to debunk. It’s a movie about finding purpose in life, late in life, that makes its point by first subjecting its characters to the most reductive grumpy-old-men/women shenanigans. These characters aren’t just old—they’re defined by their age, imprisoned by it, seemingly unable to talk or think about anything else. And yet the actors on screen are themselves vibrant evidence that life doesn’t end at 60, 70, or even 80. They—and India—deserve better."

"Jan 8, 2013",positive," Yesterday was a red-letter day in my mailbox. Next to an invite from American Express and a copy of Leslie Feinberg's Drag King Dreams (ordered from swapabook.com) lay a Netflix red-and-white envelope that I quickly ripped open. Inside: The Avengers DVD that I had forgotten I'd requested. Eureka! My evening had unexpectedly become free an hour before, and here was a cinematic event I had missed out on. What true joy! From what I had heard, on this 4-1/2-inch silver platter was imprinted the Super Heroes event of the decade. Well, at least the best one not helmed by Christopher Nolan. After all, it had a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, beating out Fellini's Amacord by two points and Pasolini's Teorema by six. I immediately elevatored upstairs, then prepared a major salad and a huge Teeccino. Settling in front of my 24-inch MAC along with my edibles, I inserted the disc, and mentally prepared myself to be transported by Marvel Marvelousness to a realm where good conquers bad, where there are copious amounts of inventive destruction, and where the visuals will employ the latest developments in special effects wizardry. All will be laced together by an unbridled intelligence, witty dialogue, and some sort of underlying philosophy that will set ten-year-old viewers on the path to becoming forty-year-old peacemongers. For example, John F. Kennedy's ""Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind."" Well, after five minutes of irksome ads for Marvel goodies, the feature began. . .with a limp. Over some ominous music by Alan Silvestri, The Other (Alexis Denisof) announces, like a Darth-Vader wannabe, ""The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world, a human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri, will follow. A world will be his. The universe, yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"" Not forewarned, I had no notion that The Avengers was ""the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"" and I, or any viewer, really should have viewed the previous five to be up to snuff, plus read a few dozen of the comics on which they were based. But I was up to snuff, having seen all previous entries and, most importantly Thor (2011), to which The Avengers is basically a sequel -- and I was still discombobulated. You see, in Thor, Prince Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the ""brother"" of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), discovers he is adopted, a revelation that aggravates him to no end and causes the young man to commit patricide. Then when he doesn't become king of Asgard, ""apoplectic""would really best describe his demeanor, especially after his sibling defeats him in an epic battle. To prevent this from occurring, Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor, and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will have to join forces under the leadership of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and coordinator of the ""Avenger Initiative."" Of course, we all know there will be a happy ending, but why does getting there have to be so generic? There's nothing basically new in The Avengers, nothing that hasn't been done much better elsewhere. Take the early car chase scenes where the villains are escaping with the Tesseract. If you want to see thrilling highway escapades, check out the Terminator series or any Jason Bourne offering. ""Is this not simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."" Angela Merkel might start bristling when she views this scene, but have no fear, gnadige Frau, Neo-Nazi supervillains have nothing on Captain America and Iron Man, and German honor is revenged. But one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs after Thor grabs Loki out of a plane from the clutches of our heroes. Iron Man immediately pursues, and Captain America gets ready, but is warned by Black Widow to be cautious. Ah, monotheism versus paganism. Can they exist side by side? Clearly, Thor is a god, which proves Cap'n America wrong. Or can we have an existence where both gods and a God rule side by side? Metaphysics aside, is The Avengers a great film or just one more pea in the comic-book-industry pod? And why have Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger all seemed so slight to me when I've watched them over the past year on my computer? Quite possibly these ""event"" pictures need a huge screen and a pounding sound system to convince viewers of their worth. After all, the folks at Marvel would hardly deny that these movies are basically products created to sell more Marvel products. But some films work really quite well on a screen of diminished proportions including last year's Arbitrage with Richard Gere and even the more visual Moonrise Kingdom. They hold the viewer because there is more meat to chew on their bones. Even Dustin's Hoffman's Quartet, which could use a tiny bit more bite, warms the cockles of one's heart because the grand foursome of Maggie Smith, Tom Courtney, Billy Connoly, and Pauline Collins let loose from beginning to end with their well-seasoned actors' chops. And a masterpiece such as Chantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles works sublimely on even an iPhone. All of which comes down the fact that with in the next few weeks, I'm purchasing my first really humongous flat screen TV. I'm going to be prepared for Iron Man III. "

"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"  Marvel's The Avengers is not just a film - it's a cinematic event. The culmination of half a decade of movie-making, five different films introducing us to characters, stories and worlds of Marvel's shared movie universe - not to mention, the life-long hopes of fanboys and fangirls all over the world, who have been dreaming to see their favorite superheroes onscreen together long before Marvel Studios began making it a reality.   Now that the Avengers is here, the question is: Does writer/director Joss Whedon (Serenity) deliver a film that lives up to fans' massive expectations and functions as a great summer blockbuster for causal moviegoers?   We are thrust right into the story at the point where the respective lead-in films - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America - left off, by learning just what has befallen Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) after his plunge into the abyss at the end of Thor. We find Loki holed up in a strange netherworld (or ""realm""), hosted by a dark and mysterious ""ally"" who promises him re-entry to Earth and an alien army in exchange for securing the ""Tesseract"" (the cosmic cube seen in Captain America) from the humans who have claimed it (i.e., the covert peacekeeping organization, S.H.I.E.L.D.). Armed with a new weapon that can fire energy and brainwash unwilling subjects, Loki heads for Earth.    The only thing standing in the trickster god's way? S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the various superheroes included in his ""Avengers Initiative."" Fury manages to gather Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and super spies Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Through otherworldly machinations, even Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is able to return to Earth, charged with capturing his sibling and the Tesseract for return to Asgard.   But Loki isn't called ""the god of mischief"" for nothing. Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sewing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet - or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?   The Avengers is very much a Joss Whedon product - and is much better off for being so. If you're not familiar with the geek-centric writer/filmmaker, he was the mind behind the '90s Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, the short-lived (but much-loved) sci-fi show Firefly, its movie spinoff, Serenity, famous Internet musicals (Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) and even some acclaimed comic book series (Astonishing X-Men).   Whedon was chosen to head this project primarily for his love of comic book culture and its characters. Speaking as a comic book fan, it's clear from watching Avengers that Whedon is in tune with every single one of the superheroes (and villains) in Marvel's stables, and knows how to arrange those personalities into a well-balanced ensemble - like a perfectly assembled puzzle (no pun). He also accomplishes the impressive feat of tying all of the plot-threads of the solo films together into a (semi-)coherent story, while briefly acknowledging various dangling threads (whereabouts of certain supporting characters, etc.) without allowing them to strangle this team-based story.   Through those various solo films we've gotten to know smarmy Tony Stark, old-fashioned idealist Captain America, arrogant Thor, sultry Black Widow and the uncontrollable Hulk.  Avengers takes things a step further by showing us how these characters are growing and evolving - and better yet, growing and evolving because of their interactions with one another.   For all of the impressive action (more on that later), the best moments in Avengers are arguably the slower, character-driven scenes. Whedon's penchant for snappy dialogue is on full display, and it's a great experience to see, (for example) Tony Stark and Dr. Banner talking in high-science dialect no one else in the room understands - or debating the value of the traumas that made them both into tragic heroes. Small touches, but moments that feel true, interesting, and rewarding in a way that few people (fan or non-fan) will likely expect.   Equally unexpected (but just as rewarding) is the humor in the film. We get the usual smattering of one-liners and overly-dramatic monologues and dialogue that can only come from a comic book - but there is also sharp wit and total self-awareness woven into Whedon's script. Avengers strikes a tonal balance similar to that of Iron Man - i.e., light and fun for the most part, understatedly serious in the heavy moments (and Avengers does have some heavy moments, rest assured).   The best humor comes out of well-timed tongue-in-cheek winks  - i.e., how strong certain characters are, how these characters behave, the context in which we find them (ex: Cap and Thor being fish-out-of-water types in the modern world), acknowledgement of how the 'real world' is juxtaposed to the concept of superheroes - and other great insights that work as sly winks to comic book fans and generally fun moments for casual viewers to enjoy in between action sequences.   Speaking of action: Avengers has some pretty impressive sequences - especially the climatic final battle against Loki's invading army, which is definitely the best ""boss battle"" that has been featured in any Marvel movie since Incredible Hulk. Those worried about Marvel's track record for underwhelming climaxes need not: by the time the battle is won, you will have been exhausted by the combination of iconic comic book imagery (The Avengers Assembled or working together in battle) and impressive big-screen eye-candy. The film has about four big set pieces (it's still somewhat rigid and obvious in its structuring), but all of them deliver the goods and keep the movie exciting from start to finish.   As far as characters go, Avengers is the best rendering of Marvel superheroes on the big screen since RDJ let his charisma carry Iron Man to success. What's surprising about the film is who ends up standing out the most: Black Widow and Hulk are the characters best served by Avengers, and audiences will almost certainly walk away with greater appreciation for both. (Johansson even gets a few chances to mock her detractors.) Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark schtick is as entertaining as ever (if not overly familiar by now) and he handles the difficult task of keeping things fun whenever they threaten to get too serious or comic book silly; without that cog in the machine (no pun), Avengers wouldn't function nearly as well. Captain America and Thor are given moments to shine, but their presence is much more reserved and understated in this film - though we do finally get to see the power that makes Thor worthy of being called a god.   Supporting players like Nick Fury and his assistants Agent Coulson (Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) are just that: support. Jackson and Gregg are well-experienced with making the most out of a little in these Marvel films, but Smulders is mostly just window dressing. Hawkeye (Renner) is the one member of the actual Avengers team who is somewhat underserved - though that is something of a necessary evil, given how he factors into the story. As a villain, Tom Hiddleston makes Loki even more compelling than he was in Thor, this time infusing him with psychotic rage hidden behind a veneer of charm, smooth words and dimpled smiles (think Hannibal Lector with super villain aspirations). Of course, as a physical threat Loki isn't that intimidating - hence the endless leagues of indistinguishable aliens who are thrown into the third act for The Avengers to beat on.   Now for the downsides (because there are a few): the story is very flimsy and predictable in terms of its overarching plot, and the big ""reveals"" in the film are likely to confuse those who haven't read a ton of comic books (NOTE: there are two extra scenes during and after the credits - make sure to stay for both). For all the satisfying action, Avengers demonstrates that Whedon still has something to learn about space and angles when it comes to movie direction. A lot of the sequences still have a very ""TV"" feel to them - and on the whole, Avengers plays like several episodes of a very well-built TV series, rather than a feature film that has truly ""cinematic"" moments in it. There are a few, but only a few.   However, the few drawbacks and criticisms aren't enough to stop The Avengers from delivering a fun and satisfying time at the movies. Whedon leaves the characters in some great places for their upcoming second (or third) round of solo adventures - with the door to the larger Marvel movie universe left wide open for some interesting (and risky) developments down the road. I'm sure fans will be debating those points all along the way.   The Avengers is now playing in theaters everywhere. It is Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, and a mild drug reference.

"Sep 27, 2012",neutral," When it comes to superheroes, cinema spent several decades playing catch-up to the boundless imaginations of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the other legends of the comic book universe. The film studios could buy up the rights to all the characters and storylines that they wanted but technology often let them down. What could be inked on the page by the artists at Marvel and DC could not always be matched on the movie screen. However good the resulting film turned out to be (and there were a few winners) it would normally entail some poor actor looking faintly ridiculous in a costume whilst hanging from wires or lying on their belly in front of a back projection. The leaps and bounds in computer technology changed all that and has meant regular raids on the comic book back catalogue over the last fifteen years or so. Caped crusaders of all forms became increasingly important weapons in Hollywood’s summer arsenal. If you were to continue this analogy, then The Avengers is a WMD of a movie. From an FX perspective, this ultimate hero team-up represents some of the best work done by WETA since they breathed life into Middle Earth at the turn of the twenty-first century. The effects in The Avengers are simply astounding. This is not just a case of believing that a man can fly but that he can don a suit of mechanical armour whilst plummeting from the top of a skyscraper or level a forest with one blow of a mighty hammer. All this magic is rendered so real that even the hardened cynics out there would find it hard not to be impressed. The Avenger had little choice but to be great. The build-up to it has been immense since the release of the first Iron Man in 2008. Since then, each of the core Avengers has stepped up to the plate with The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America each taking their turn. Their eponymous adventures all had varying degrees of merit but for audience members who risked the withering looks of cinema staff by staying behind to watch the post-credit teasers, there was a hint of things to come. The Avengers is not strictly a sequel but having had the back stories of several characters already established allows director Joss Whedon to plough straight into the action. Believe me; we are talking about some serious action. Barely ten minutes into the film and the headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D – the military organisation run by monocular bad-ass Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) – is obliterated by the power of a device called the Tesseract. This is the cosmic cube which cropped up in both Thor and Captain America. Depending on which side of the good guy/bad guy divide you happen to be on, the Tesseract either represents a new source of sustainable energy or a key to unlocking a door to the other end of the universe and letting in alien nasties. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the grinning wicked brother of Thor, falls firmly in the latter camp. He plans to use the Tesseract to take over the world with the assistance of an extra-terrestrial army. With Loki on the rise, it is time for Fury to roll out the Avengers Initiative and bring together the greatest heroes on Earth (subject to contractual obligations) in order to save the human race. “How desperate are you?” enquires Loki of his opponent. “You have made me very desperate,” growls Fury in response. The talent roster is impressive. There is the Norse God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), wartime poster boy Captain America (Chris Evans), human shaped shrapnel Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) aka The Incredible Hulk. But that’s not all, they are joined by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who does not really have any super powers other than looking amazing in a LBD. She can kick butt with the best of them though and plays a pivotal part in saving the day. There is also the super slick bowman Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who makes for another great character. This is a mission movie without the need for a training montage as the team members are already match fit. What they do need to learn though is how to get along with each other after initial meetings result in a clash of enormous egos as well as fists. In an act of fidelity to the source material, the Avengers do not just fight the enemy, they also battle each other. The dust-up between Iron Man and Thor is especially impressive. Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark (the man within the iron) takes particular pleasure in needling his fellow heroes and only really clicks with like-minded technical whizz Banner. The placid, mumbling doctor who normally looks like he has slept in late, or perhaps that is just Mark Ruffalo, is the big green elephant in the room. Wind him up just that bit too much and you might unleash the Hulk, and then you have real problems. The generally strong cast helps to install human hearts in the supernatural bodies. These are tough guys but they also experience guilt, grief and even fear. Admittedly, Downey Jr. gets to steal the show a bit as the smart-talking Stark but each actor does well with what they are given. Thor is a trickier role to make believable thanks to his “Shakespeare in the park” dialogue but this allows the opportunity for some fish out of water humour. The real danger of the film, that there would not be enough room for each character to make an impact, is happily avoided. Plus, there are welcome returns for Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark’s long suffering lady friend and Clark Gregg as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson. Look out too for nice cameos from a couple of older but familiar faces from other fantasy classics. The race to find the Tesseract is the chord on which to hang some superb action set-pieces, including an attack on S.H.I.E.L.D’s flying fortress and a climatic showdown on and above the streets of Manhattan. This gloriously destructive mayhem, in which our heroes seem severely outgunned by a legion of terrors from outer space, is deftly handled by Whedon and is hugely exciting stuff. The smirk on the Hulk’s face when he is finally given permission to “smash” is a moment to savour. Needless to say he does not have to be told twice. The Avengers also has some very funny moments, several playing on the slightly absurd predicament of being a super being on an ordinary planet. Yet, though everyone here is clearly having a lot of fun, the film never stoops to cheap mockery or camp silliness thanks to an overall respect for spirit of the original comics. If you are a committed hater of all things comic book then this film may do nothing to change your mind. If you like comics then you will no doubt love this, unless you are one of those types who arrive at a film with a detailed check list of expectations and consider any deviation to be a crime against the genre. Anyone else, even if you have never read a comic in your life, should really enjoy The Avengers. The film certainly sets a challenge for The Dark Knight Rises later this year, although that will be much more down and dirty of course. The big question now is what the Avengers could possibly do for an encore? There is a suggestion mid-way through the credits of who their next opponent might be but in the meantime, The Avengers is terrific stuff and should be seen by anyone who loves a good time at the movies."

Lt. Garry Scott heads the fair and impartial policing program for the Vermont State Police, which is one of several agencies with a renewed focus on investigating bias cases in the state. “In Vermont, we have a collaborative approach now,” Scott said, explaining that a new reporting system through the attorney general’s office is enabling cases of bias to be better identified and documented, and for multi-agency resources to be better directed toward responding. Since the posters struck fear in groups that often feel vulnerable, Scott said he hopes tips to the Burlington Police Department or to Vermont State Police will help identify a suspect. “We want to be able to at least communicate with them, understand what the motivation is, why this is occurring, and what we can do better to stop it,” Lt. Scott said.

"Jun 23, 2012",positive," Yeah, it’s all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, “The Avengers” comes at you as the first true “summer movie spectacular” of the 2012 season. Through the individual films focusing on the characters here, fans have watched and waited until they could see all the characters assembled. They won’t be disappointed. To top it off, screenwriter and director is Joss Whedon of “Buffy” and “Firefly” renown, whose instant cult favorite “Cabin in the Woods” still is drawing in crowds. The first issue that the Avengers must address is the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who reprises his role of “Thor” and whom you may recognize from “War Horse”), the jealous adopted brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth, straight from “The Cabin in the Woods” and from his first portrayal of “Thor”). Loki breaks into SHIELD headquarters to steal the Tesseract, a hub of extreme power, and he also takes with him Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) can’t stop Loki by himself, so he calls in the troops: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, the successor to the role after Edward Norton in the 2008 movie and Eric Bana in the woefully underseen “Hulk” from 2003) and of course Thor. But Loki has a major trick up his sleeve, and it makes Loki himself look puny in comparison to the destruction that is to follow. Iron Man and Thor don’t exactly hit it off. Most of the crew members are just plain leery of Banner, whose Hulk persona is dangerous and unpredictable. Captain America continues to try to find his place in contemporary times. And egos continue to clash. The action is pulse-pounding, and all the more so if you see it in 3D. This is the stuff for which well-developed 3D is made: In-your-face movement and amazing battles. And there are two “extra” scenes, one during the early credit roll and another at the very, very end that’s a nod to something Iron Man says earlier in the movie."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive," And if Dr Bruce Banner can come out of self-imposed exile to join Marvel's THE AVENGERS, than I really ought to be able to review some movies again. Let's go. After roughly four years of movie-length commercials for The Avengers (formerly known as: Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger) ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" have finally assembled. To fans of the superhero genre, this probably feels like an impossible dream realized. To non-fans of the superhero genre this might play like the perfect time for a showstopping climax -take a bow and give mere mortals some movies again! The latter group should brace themselves. This particular blockbuster is lively enough to greenlight an even bigger movie family of men (and hopefully some women) in tights. MORE AFTER THE JUMP... Marvel wisely handed the reigns over to writer/director Joss Whedon who is still best known for creating one of the greatest TV shows of all time (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and who has only directed one previous feature (Serenity). Though I'm a big Whedon believer, the opening moments worried me.  The film starts with a brief but dull outerspace prologue designed to tell us that the Earth will soon be threatened (Duh! The superheroes have to protect the world from something). Without context this unfortunately brings Green Lantern's information overload opening to mind though it's happily the last completely useless scene in the film. Once Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals the glowing cube of power known as the Tesseract from Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) at S.H.I.E.L.D., the story is jolted to life. (Loki also steals Jeremy Renner but who wouldn't?) I don't want to spoil any plot details but let's just say that Joss Whedon is basically the world's greatest fanfic writer. He finds numerous clever ways to pit the superheroes against one another throughout the course of the action even though they're on the same side. Hero vs. Hero has always been a staple, however convoluted in the details, of both comic book narratives and fan fiction but we rarely get to see it onscreen. Like most modern blockbusters that supersize themselves The Avengers, at 142 minutes long, has its duller patches. The heroes spend an awful lot of time on minor bickering and self doubt on an invisible floating ship that doesn't have quite enough character to sustain a third of the movie. Loki's outsourced alien army is also depressingly personality-free and derivative but that's a minor quibble as there's plenty of big personas around waiting for their turn to shine. The Avengers' multiple character introductions aren't as gracefully swift as Serenity's remarkable opening scene, but Whedon's dependable talent for finding the humor and fissures and alliances within group dynamics is put to fine use. Somehow they made an Avengers movie without any of Earth's Mightiest Egos demanding the spotlight. Even the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), merely extraneous eye candy in Iron Man 2, is used about as well as you could possibly hope for. Whedon's bravest gambit in the storytelling might be the way he handles The Hulk (Eric Bana Ed Norton Mark Ruffalo). He pins much anticipatory weight on the where and the when and the how quickly Bruce Banner might Hulk out, confidently assuming the audience will beg for it, ignoring the fact that Hulk has a reputation for boring them on the big screen. Mark Ruffalo's wonderfully mellow screen vibe makes for a nice bit of counterintuitive casting yet you still believe him when he says he's angry all the time. Whedon and Ruffalo (through motion-capture acting) make the Hulk so entertaining, in fact, that he gets the single biggest laugh in the movie. It's a blink and you'll miss it comic beat in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem. Though The Avengers never reaches the pop iconography heights of Spider-Man 2 (my choice for Best Superhero Film) and it doesn't even attempt the majestic gravitas of The Dark Knight (most people's choice for Best Superhero Film) preferring to keep it light and quippy, its final act is so big and crazy and super-powered that you leave on a true high. I'm still thinking of its most eye-popping moments: Thor's hammer meeting Captain America's shield; Iron Man's unusually vertiginous costume change; A billion dollar complex sinking into the earth; Loki's sorcery and Tom Hiddleston's equally magic acting; The Hulk sliding down skyscrapers; Chris Evans' ass in sweatpants. That sound you hear exiting the theater is not just the aftershocks of multiple geek orgasms, but the crying jags of Warner Bros executives. They famously gave Joss Whedon the boot on the still languishing Wonder Woman movie. Damn, but she would have lassoed the world anew with Whedon guiding her.  Grade: B/B+Oscar Hopeful?: Given the cold shoulder the Academy gave Hulk, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America (0 nominations between the four of them) I'd say it's unlikely even in the craft categories. Unless they like the team as much as the Iron Man movies in which case, they've got an outside shot at Visual Effects and Sound categories. I basically agree with all of this. It was nice for all the heroes to have such distinguished personality traits without making them seeming flat. And it really does amaze me how much more stuff Scarlett had to work with here, really does redeem her just standing around looking hot in Iron Man 2. Totally agree with so much of this. The first hour kind of drags in places, but I guess that's to be expected when you're waiting for the big scenes. Really enjoyed Ruffalo but I always do. But why was Evans covered in so much make-up? He looked so waxy you could practically mistake his entire performance as a CGI effect. I felt bad for Johansson. Everyone has magic powers except her and Renner, but at least Renner gets that cool bow. She just gets what, a little gun? Lame. Omg, how did I never hear this Wonder Woman thing? Joss Whedon doing that would be fantastic! Buffy is amazing, spectacular, legendary, etc., so I'm sure he'd do great with another female hero. Thank you for articulating my feelings on the opening scene with Loki and the aliens; It really did remind me of Green Lantern. Anyway, I gave the movie a B+ also. It's not on the level of Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight or X2 (My favorite Superhero Movie) but it's good fun and the Best Marvel Studio Film yet. I haven't seen Thor or Captain America or The Hulk or Iron Man, but I'm interested in watching this one for some reason. To I have to watch those first or can I go in without watching them and still 'get it'/enjoy it? You used to be an observant reviewer.Portraying Bruce Banner as (in)capable of controlling what's inside him and The Hulk as an ugly gorilla is a ""gambit"" indeed.Thor is certainly not demanding the spotlight. Robbed of the moods and shades he showed in his own film, he basically only shows up for fighting. And you don't even dare to mention the desaster that Hawkeye was: zombified, played by a baby-faced midget, and armed with a bow that's apparently coming from kmart.Worst of all though was the man you call ""threatening and magical"". Loki is barely recognizable as the comparatively complex character from Thor. By abandoning Loki's more complicated character traits, Whedon has flattened him into the stereotype power-seeking Hollywood sociopath with supernatural powers. And to make matters even worse, Joss foists way too many oafish moments on Loki and therefore undermines the threat that the character is (not?) supposed to be.You don't spoil any plot details by saying that ""Whedon is basically the world's greatest fanfic writer"". In fact, he has a peculiar tendency to reduce major plot points to simple throwaway lines. And I guess we have different takes on Thor which I think is a much weaker film than this... though obviously with the entire movie to flesh it out it does have a slightly more complex  brother vs brother psychology. Alex -- i don't think you need to have seen the other ones. You'll miss a few things but they were basically commercials for this one. Man, this movie was awesome. I can understand to a certain extent some of the reasons why people dont think its that good. But since I have been a comic book fan since 1981, this is a moment I have dreamed of for decades. And I think The Avengers got it right. Everything you could want in an entertaining movie busting with visuals, action, dialogue, humor,...could go on and on. I for one didnt think it was too long. Say when you compared to the length of freaking Transformers 3 which was like 2 hours and 40 minutes..overkill. Avengers is right on the mark. Can't wait for the sequel. Great write-up Nathaniel! Enjoyed reading this. LOVED the movie. This is what I want from my popcorn films - humor, action, fun, very few times I want to cringe. Whedon is finally being noticed on a huge scale. This is definitely a fluff film - The Dark Knight and X2 are doing something entirely different. Comparing them would be like comparing a tasty main course to cotton candy, and honestly, why not have both? B+ suggests a near-masterpiece. But now it's a B/B+.You even said ""bravest"" gambit, and I don't know if people don't like the Hulk in general. Both recent Hulk movies have ardent supporters. Actually, I thought that the casting of a new and well-respected actor as Banner was a natural advantage for Whedon; one that he totally ruined by making it all about Banner's inability to control the transformation and the way he behaves as the Hulk, only to finally turn things upside down with ""I'm always angry"" (or whatever it was. I can't remember all those throwaway lines). I don't have distaste for Renner but for Renner's desperate desire to become an action star. He simply does not look it.But I admit that The Avengers promoted Thor from a movie I could live with to a movie I kinda like. The scale of these epic Marvel movies always seem kind of pathetic to me: Loki marshals an interdimensional force barely big enough to destroy 5th Avenue. Ho hum. People, if you're not going to give Spidey a cameo just stay out of Manhattan. Nevertheless, the superstar enable animates the snappy dialog, Marvel-ous plot contrivances and animation into a solid A blockbuster.  However, given Whedon's penchant for strong women characters, The Black Widow intro and backstory was a letdownt; instead of Johansen delivering an Oscar-trite monologue, they should have just left her mysterious and kick-ass (e.g. Ruffalo's Hulk) and it would have been a better film. Having now seen Renner's five biggest hits, I still don't get it. He's being groomed for Cruise, Damon and Wahlberg caliber assignments, but at his best he seems like a barely memorable supporting character. Case in point: Hawkeye. Willy and Vern -- it's interesting to me that willy thinks B+ means ""near masterpiece"" while Vern thinks B means ""middling"" while I think B and B+ mean solid to quite good and C is middling. Grading is such a werid practice with art and always has been. I usually adjust back and forth with grades between one small step. Only rarely does something jump or plummet a lot in grading. I agree with you Nat, it was a solid spandex-buster. But when I started thinking about why it wasn't masterful I figured it needed a bit more umph in the character and plot development-- plus all the baggage Willy trots out. Or, better yet, for me to suddenly be 20 years younger. Vern: Well the comic's great. Can't give the movie anything close to an A, though. Too hermetically sealed and Malin Akerman is TERRIBLE. Overall B-. It's better than 300, but that's not a high compliment. Next superhero film I'm looking forward, aside from the two in this year's crop, is Edgar Wright's Ant-Man film. I remember the idea was to make a film about the Ant-Men (Hank Pym and Scott Lang). I'm unsure yet whether he'll try to incorporate Eric O'Grady as well, but I'd hope so, considering we've waited this long. I thought the movie was very enjoyable, I liked it. The audience I saw it with seemed to like it a lot too, there was a lot of laughing and clapping and applause at the end of the movie.  You definitely don't need to see the previous movies to get anything that's going on in this one, though you may have a better understanding of the Loki/Thor relationship if you see Thor, and what the deal is with Tony Stark if you see Iron Man. I haven't seen Iron Man 2 or Captain America myself, and while there was clearly a background to Captain America that I wasn't up on, I didn't need that background to get the gist of what was going on with him in The Avengers. I haven't seen The Avengers yet because I was unable to get to the movies this weekend. I will see it, but I'm not happy about it. I'm sure it's good, and I liked the Iron Man movies, Thor, and Captain America,and really applaud the choice of directors and cast for all of them, but the law of diminishing returns with all these superhero movies has been in full effect, and it's not necessarily due to their quality. It's overload. I just can't work up the excitement for these movies anymore, because it's just constant. It feels like there isn't a month that goes by without a new superhero/comic book/franchise movie coming out. Sigh. I'll see it. I'm sure I'll like it. I'm sure I'll forget about it the next day. I don't really care about all that. I just wish I could feel the excitement that everyone else seems to feeling about it. Another thing: did anyone else notice that, despite the budget and impressive effects, random things here and there looked cheap? I'm think specifically of Loki's kind of ridiculous dual-horned costume and even during the final Manhattan battle the close-ups of the streets and stores looked strangely cheap and cheesy. Very articulate review Nathaniel; both gushing in joy and knowledgeable of the movies handful of flaws. Agree with you on Spidey 2 as the reigning king of superheroes still, a fact that seemingly everyone tends to forget. I've seen all the movies and each one lasted better than the other especially The Hulk Films. Seen the Avengers 5 times already and it never gets old in my opinion. The storyline was good but yet it had great one-liners especially from RDJ and Mark Ruffalo brought a new light to being Dr. Banner but with all seriousness, It's not the greatest Visual Effects movie but if it doesn't get nominated on at least the costumes than the acedemy should be ashamed, if they could nominate Avatar than The Avengers should have a shot at it. I think that this movie was super awesome for the most part, but like someone said it did kinda drag in some places. I just wonder if it will be better than the New Batman movie. I made a comparison between the two in this article I've written, and would like you to check it out. Let me know your thoughts. Thank you."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive," Caution: The following review was written by a moviegoer who has been suffering from superhero-movie fatigue since X-Men 3 back in 2006. You have been warned. Don’t worry — I get it. My review of The Avengers won’t make a dollar’s difference in the box office results. The best stunt you’ll see now that the film has opened is its rocket-blast rush toward breaking all records and busting all blocks. It’s faster than Iron Man in a hurry. And I’m not going to bother with a detailed plot summary. About a thousand plot summaries are being posted today, and you are welcome to read as many as you like. Besides, the cards in the superhero deck are so easy to shuffle, you could have told pretty much the same story with a completely different cast of characters. (No doubt, we will see the same movie with different characters soon.) So why bother with particulars? Suffice it to say: There’s a magic cube, and it’s a portal, and there’s a bunch of nasty aliens on the other side. What can save the world. God? Love? No… a bunch of guys who, once they’re done fighting each other, will join forces and demonstrate that they’re better at violence than the villains. In the name of goodness and America and old-fashioned something-or-other. I’m also not inclined to spend more than a few lines considering the themes of the movie. Why bother? It would be like writing an essay on the nutrition you will glean from a box of Oreo cookies, or telling the crowd at a monster-truck-and-tractor pull that the guys behind the wheels are patriots who really love their families, and that 10% of the profits will go to charity. How inspiring! And besides, if you’re really interested in what The Avengers selects from the five or six basic flavors of comic book superhero movie themes, what honorable notions it pins like accessories to its flamboyant costumes, I can point you to plenty of reviews like that. Those reviews will applaud the movie’s simplistic stories of undisciplined egomaniacs who humble themselves to become a team; who get over themselves and put aside their differences for the greater good; who risk their lives to save others; who overcome fear and set aside grudges, etc. It’s like a cage-fighting tournament for peace. It will serve up sermon-illustrations for man-centric pastors across the country for the next several months. But it would feel like a waste of time to rationalize my enjoyment of what is, essentially, a two-and-a-half-hour demolition derby. Let’s face it: While The Avengers gives good lip service to such American virtues as democracy, teamwork, courage, and sacrifice, ultimately it exists to fulfill the fantasies of adolescents — adolescents of all ages. For every admirable alliance established between temperamental champions, several city blocks will be destroyed. Don’t worry, the movie won’t stop to shed any tears over human casualties (unless we happen to lose a member of the team — this is a Joss Whedon film, after all) or consider the consequences of urban devastation. Everything has been carefully calculated to restore the fun we used to have watching terrorists destroy skyscrapers before we were taught what such a thing really costs. Bored of movies in which a superhero, seemingly outmatched by a supervillain, manages to come through like Rocky and The Karate Kid in the end, saving the world with violence that the movie has carefully prepared us to embrace as justified and reasonable? Well… boy do I have the movie for you. The Avengers brings not one, not two, but a crowd of superheroes together. And, before they’re drawn into war with their Supervillain of the Month, they have to fight each other so we can see their powers going off like fireworks on the Fourth of July. Once we’re convinced that they’re all pretty much equally invincible, and we’re feeling exhausted from the time and energy spent in such collisions, then we can watch them coordinate their efforts against a madman who is clearly in over his head. And we’re right back in the thick of the melee we came to see: an exquisitely complicated and violent ballet that will save the world from a familiar mayhem made of aliens and guns and sharp pointy things and lasers and fast flying vehicles and big nasty teeth. But, believe it or not, it is not my intention to condemn the affair. I enjoy a good superhero movie the way I enjoy a bowl of ice cream, and this is a six-scoop sundae covered in toppings. I’m just here to point out that it’s not a particularly healthy form of entertainment, it is calculated to give us what we want rather than what we need; and it’s full of artificial ingredients. To put it another way: It’s basically history’s most expensive Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. And it so focused on fulfilling adolescent fanboy fantasies that it makes X-Men: First Class seem like Shakespeare in the Park. Still, while I may be 41, I’m also 14. I’ve always enjoyed ice cream sundaes just as I’ve always been thrilled by blockbuster Fourth of July fireworks shows. Since the movie isn’t so much a work of storytelling as it’s a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts — punches peppered with punchlines — here it comes: A movie review made of comic-book style exclamations from my inner 14-year-old, which should easily fit into dialogue balloons. I’ve even put quotation marks around a bunch of outbursts for your convenience. And I’ve included exclamation points, since no movie has ever made them so necessary. Like I said, you can find a few nuggets of meaning in the melee. But I’m more concerned about what moviegoers will learn from entertainment like this, as opposed to what we might hope they learn. Read the comments section for any Avengers review that dares to point out the movie’s weaknesses, and you’ll see that hordes of devoted Marvel fans will Hulk-out at the slightest provocation. (Even Samuel Jackson is throwing fuel on the outrage: “#Avengers fans, NY Times critic AO Scott needs a new job! Let’s help him find one! One he can ACTUALLY do!”) The target audience for this movie is wired to react with thoughtless rage, spectacular violence, and barely any evidence of the restraint that Bruce Banner would do anything to regain. And why not? They’ve just been cheering for a movie that treats the Hulk’s temper tantrums as if they’re a religious experience. Hulk thrills audiences by unleashing relentless destruction, and makes us look forward to moments when his curse is at its worst. And his superfriends are a bunch of overly aggressive egomaniacs who, like five-year-olds, act like it’s some kind of Herculean feat to quiet down and cooperate on a task. Isn’t it fair to say that what these heroes might yearn to be, what they might learn to be, gets drowned out in the thrills of the supremely impressive violent spectacles that they’re assigned to provide for our pleasure? So, with all of that in mind: Yes, I enjoyed these fireworks. I enjoyed this super sundae. But now I have an ice cream headache, and I think I’ll stick to salads for a while. For better or worse, The Avengers is the biggest, funniest, most relentlessly entertaining superhero movie so far. Only God can save us now."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive," Review
The era of the Fanboy-as-Director has produced some of the finest genre pieces in recent memory. For years, it took stylists like Tim Burton to wring anything remotely watchable out of comic book adventures, but today you just have to point one of a handful of hip helmers at any property they love and you’ll end up with a film that is as satisfying as you could have imagined. The Avengers is the perfect example of this. A culmination of four years of setup and bravado, The Avengers has an above-average pedigree of precursor films setting up this ultimate teaming of some of Marvel’s most acclaimed stars. Beginning in 2008, an ambitious studio decided to take a new approach to setting up its blockbuster franchise by taking the parts of the future-planned Avengers and turning them into individual features. X-Men took the opposite approach to mixed effect by spinning off an origin film for its popular Wolverine character. Marvel and Disney started out with Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr and proceeded to The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton, Thor with Chris Hemsworth and Captain America with Chris Evans (who’d already made a name for himself in the genre by playing the goofoff playboy in the Fantastic Four films). Bringing these four characters together with Mark Ruffalo replacing Norton as Bruce Banner and his alter-ego Hulk, the idea was that getting setup and origins out of the way would make for a more interesting and action-packed film. That’s almost what they got. Director Joss Whedon who made a name for himself on television with his highly popular, long-running genre series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, would have seemed like an odd choice to rein in the monstrous responsibilities of big screen spectacle if he hadn’t already proven his capabilities with Serenity six years ago. Serenity, based on his popular, but short-season cancelled Fox series Firefly displayed a cool sense of perspective in his feature film adaptation. Serenity was witty, fresh and energetic, showing he was more than capable of balancing performance, plot and action without relegating any of them to the periphery. Whedon didn’t rest on his laurels with The Avengers. Sure, he had five films (Iron Man 2 included) to establish his characters for him, but knowing who they were wasn’t enough. Whedon’s film introduces the interpersonal dynamics these four headstrong superheroes engender, devoting as much time to getting the characters in focus and working together as it does exploring the winding plot of Thor’s brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has hatched on behalf of a conquest-minded alien species, with rulership of Earth as his reward. Whedon has seen from the failures of a number of other films, most notably the servicable, but forgettable Green Lantern, that focusing on a galactic mob-like villain without a focus for the audience’s ire creates problems on the viewer-engagement front. With Loki as the front-and-center threat, you have a chance to jeer the most visible threat while having a larger mass of enemies on the doorstep. Opting to drop Norton for Ruffalo was an unusual choice, but Hulk’s uneasiness at his own powers and his inability to control them, comes through crystal clear with Ruffalo behind them. He may not have the badboy charm Norton could bring to the role, but with Downey Jr. more than cornering that market, having a meeker, more respectable Bruce Banner helped leverage the film’s cast into a more cohesive and believable group. Downey Jr., Hemsworth and Evans carry over the same appeal they generated in their first (and in Downey Jr.’s case second) outings that their performances seem almost stagnant, but work rather well wholly within the framework of this unified film. Our primary quartet isn’t alone, several prominent actors fill out the large ensemble in roles that are frequently pivotal and no less important to the film. Foremost of these is Scarlett Johansson who plays the interrogation master Black Widow. She was first introduced to the franchise in Iron Man 2 and, to an extent was far more interesting in that film. But being the sole woman in the cast forces her to stand more effectively against her male counterparts and when it comes to physical chutzpah, she is more than their equal. Yet, from a performance perspective, some of her scenes come off a bit flat. That’s not to say that she doesn’t mostly nail the performance, but she is certainly one of the more inferior elements to the film. Not more so than Jeremy Renner who plays eagle-eyed archer Hawkeye. Most of his scenes seem mired in his dual-natured role in the film. Renner is a very talented thespian, so seeing the end result here is disheartening. This may largely be attributed to Hawkeye being only tangentialy introduced in Thor where he had no backstory or creative development. The same goes for Johansson’s Black Widow. Had either character being highlighted more significantly or in their own films, we might be talking in more detail about where they succeeded or went wrong, but as mostly-periphery characters, it’s all supposition that they would have otherwise been better. That leaves two characters who didn’t get much development in prior films, but have been featured more frequently in the lead-up films. The most frequently seen of these is Samuel L. Jackson who, as Nick Fury, has been present in each film, even if only in the bumper at the end of the film, giving him a unique development strategy. His personality was well defined by the time of The Avengers, though a background story is still forthcoming (the film on Nick Fury is still in development, but has been for a number of years, which may mean it never gets made). Jackson hasn’t changed a bit since his first appearance as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the U.S.’s leading protection authority. One of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s agents, Phil Colson (Clark Gregg), is the other character. Showing up in both Iron Man films and Thor, Gregg has been one of the true emotional centers of the franchise. His is the kind of character that sews the entire quilt together. And as The Avengers plays out, we come to know just how integral he is to the film and to the franchise and this is thanks to Gregg’s natural charm and wit. He may not have the history nor the paycheck of his co-stars, but he is the MVP of the production. The Avengers will no doubt appeal to the fanboys who have made the previous films varying degrees of successful, but it’s how it plays to non-fans of the franchise that will be most central to its success. As of the writing of this review, the film has already passed the $400 million mark in the U.S., a number once thought reserved only for wide-appeal films and franchises. After all, even The Lord of the Rings films and Harry Potter films never managed to reach that number. Is it a broad appeal or are there other factors at work here? The film’s success is equal parts both. Without knowing much about these characters, it’s not hard to relate to them for even when they don their spandex and battle armor, they remain humanistic characters evincing frailty and emotion we frequently explore and understand in ourselves. Superheroes represent that dynamic in all of us, wanting to leap beyond our terrestrial bodies to save the world. We desire to live vicariously through these adventurers in hopes that we will learn more about ourselves and our ability to accept those who are different than we are. While the film is bound to be compared financially to The Dark Knight, the more fantastic elements of The Avengers make that comparison a tad tenuous. Christopher Nolan’s film is far more rooted in the realistic nature of humanity, after all, its protagonist is physically and emotionally human. With The Avengers, there is a superhumanity to the characters that make its success all the more interesting. Both are heavily driven by comic book fans, but there’s a measure of non-fan, general public in those mixtures that explains a good deal of both films’ successes. In the end, the quality of the entertainment and the writing is what makes The Avengers and even The Dark Knight successes. They may be mass appeal movies on the level of Transformers, but they have bucketsful of the qualities that have prevented Michael Bay’s films and their ilk monumental successes. They are heartfelt, richly written character pieces with boatloads of action and adventure in support instead of as foreground distraction. Do you think this movie has a chance of getting the Best Picture nomination nod at the Academy Awards? In my opinion it should, just wanted to hear what you have to say about it. I doubt it. The Dark Knight Rises is far more likely to land in the Best Picture race than The Avengers and Academy voters aren’t likely to make room for two “comic book” movies in their Top 6 to 10."
"Jun 1, 2012",positive,It's the humor that's The Avengers' strength.
"May 31, 2012",negative," The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, screenplay by Whedon and Zak Penn, based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby; Dark Shadows, directed by Tim Burton, screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith, based on the television series by Dan Curtis. Since its release in the US in early May The Avengers has brought in nearly $500 million at the domestic box office, setting a record for the speed with which that mark was reached. Worldwide the movie has exceeded the $1.2 billion mark. Joss Whedon’s effort, based on the Marvel Comics original, is one of Hollywood’s biggest spectacles to date (at a cost of $220,000,000). It involves a group of superheroes, The Avengers, combining to help save the earth—Manhattan in particular—from an alien supervillain, his demonic agent and an army of mechanized gargoyles. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of the global “peace-keeping” agency S.H.I.E.L.D., is charged with retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source and potential weapon of mass destruction that has opened a portal to outer space. It has been taken by the Asgardian demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a Lucifer-like figure, on behalf of his alien overlord in order to subjugate the human race. Fury gathers his superhero squadron that eventually includes Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.); Captain America (Chris Evans); The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); Thor (Chris Hemsworth); Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). “If we can’t protect the world, we’ll avenge it,” becomes their motto. Marvel Comics’ rise to prominence had a certain association with the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. Marvel prided itself on presenting the characters’ complexities and even serious failings, in opposition to the more stolid, one-dimensional Superman and Batman of DC Comics. Thus each Avenger in Whedon’s film has his or her individual dilemma. The Black Widow wants to make up for past misdeeds; Thor has to settle accounts with his fallen, evil brother, Loki; after being encased in ice for decades, Captain America wonders whether there is a place in the 21st century for him and his old-fashioned patriotic gung-ho; Iron Man Tony Stark needs to prove that he is more than a selfish billionaire playboy; Dr. Bruce Banner, who when angry becomes The Hulk, is ministering to the poor in India when we first meet him, an undertaking he reluctantly abandons for the planet-saving mission. And so on. None of this character development, however, goes beyond a few introductory lines of dialogue or bits of action. The audience quickly learns what to expect from each and every character, even taking into account the plot’s inevitable twists and turns. The Avengers also have their internal conflicts as a group. The revelation that Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. were developing their own weapons of mass destruction creates divisions. The team members also differ and bicker over what strategy to pursue against Loki. Moreover, one of their number, Hawkeye, initially falls under the sway of Loki and threatens to help enslave the planet. Will the Avengers come together in the end, with all their strengths and weaknesses, to save humanity? The film, primarily a series of individual and large-scale combats, is a spectacle of contemporary film technology and special effects. One impossible feat follows rapidly on another, separated by interludes of largely clichéd dialogue, pieces of plot exposition and rather labored attempts at humor. One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience. The filmmakers make certain that the viewer has as little time or space as possible for reflection and critical thought. The story and characters flow inevitably toward an all-out war with Loki and the aliens as the only alternative to the destruction of the human race. The creatures with whom the superheroes do battle are the embodiment of pure unreasoning evil. Negotiations are out of the question and if Loki engages in conversation it is only for the purpose of manipulating one Avenger or another, or malignantly stalling for time. The movie’s final segments are saturated with 9/11 imagery—firefighters and policemen to the rescue of wounded and soot-covered civilians, followed by collective mourning. Captain America, a World War II veteran, brings “a little old-fashioned stars and stripes” to the party and tycoon Tony Stark demonstrates that the top one-hundredth of one percent can be a force for good. Whedon’s film omits the fact that Stark Industries is a weapons manufacturer and Stark’s past nemeses have included Arabs and Persians arranged in West-versus-East combat. In the wake of 9/11 and the proclamation of the “war on terror,” and in the midst of a relentless drive to war with Iran, what is the overall message and impact here? There is no reason to impute to the filmmakers deliberately retrograde political motives, but have they thought at all about the implications of their work? The Avengers does contain an elegant, seductive performance by Hiddleston (The Deep Blue Sea), a very talented performer, and a few comic, though increasingly stale quips from Downey. Unquestionably, Whedon is more gifted than some of the other blockbuster directors. As foolish as it often is, the story in The Avengers has a certain coherence and many of the effects are eye-catching marvels. Those who maintain that the population gets “what it wants” self-servingly forget that audiences have no say in the production of the mass entertainment inflicted on them. Giant conglomerates make all those decisions, and work at every point within the framework of their financial and ideological interests. The resurgence of superhero films in particular is the result of various factors and really deserves its own special study. Economic, social and artistic issues come together here. If it could, presumably each Hollywood studio would make one or two colossal films a year that would earn billions. Intriguing human stories and artistic presentations of life are inconveniences for studio executives, which they dispense with as much as possible in an effort to get to the business of emptying their customers’ pockets. As numerous commentators have pointed out, film adaptations of comic books have the advantage of built-in popular familiarity and bases of support. In addition, a successful adaptation may generate a vast amount of cash in terms of product tie-ins (clothing, games, fast food restaurant items, toys) and so forth for the fortunate entertainment giant in question. Taking no chances, the filmmakers have made sure that The Avengers is star-packed, and in numerous cases (Johansson, Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Jackson and even Gwyneth Paltrow in a small part, Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders) the performers have a genuine following or popular appeal. Again, a number of critics have pointed to the manner in which superhero films dress up American reality, brutal American imperialist reality in particular. A 2008 article, for example, at the Cleveland Indy Media Center, opines that “[t]hese superheroes have been harnessed in support of our dying imperial project, promising a renaissance through which our superior strength, and unrivaled human wisdom, are finally and fully unveiled for the world’s adoration and humble acquiescence.” Along these lines, a blog by Tom Hiddleston on the Guardian web site is highly suggestive. “[S]uperhero films,” he writes, “offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.” We have no desire to pick on Hiddleston, as noted, an excellent actor. In any event, one suspects that the comment reflects the thinking of the filmmakers and sections of the film industry, insofar as they care to articulate their thoughts. However, this is a terribly wrongheaded conception. How can significant truths be explored through comic book-based films, cartoons, childish dreams? If someone thinks about this for an instant, surely it must produce misgivings. The very nature of the form operates against, although it does not make impossible, the working through of the intensely complicated problems of modern life in a mass society. Why is it not possible to present an accurate picture of the world and its complexities without legends, superheroes and superheroines? This genre is not working through any serious issues in an honest way. It mythologizes in dishonest ways. Moreover, Hiddleston makes no reference to the social and class issues. But The Avengers, so to speak, does. Its view of humanity—at a time when wide layers of the population are beginning to return to the global political arena—is that of a helpless, faceless horde. Clearly, film industry executives in general and the political-media establishment have a less than selfless interest in skewing social reality and diverting people’s attention from it. Decades ago, superhero movies and television shows were tongue-in-cheek. Today’s films present their comic book characters with a high degree of self-seriousness. They have a different tone and mood than their cartoonish ancestors. Even though it has a certain playfulness, and allows all sorts of physical mauling to go on, The Avengers still treats its characters with undue reverence. The rise to prominence of the superhero comic book trend in film, putting aside for the moment the question of its artistic value, has an objective significance. It coincides with the global economic decline of the US and the deteriorating social conditions of the population. Unwilling and intellectually too impoverished to look reality in the face, Hollywood increasingly resorts to “solving” America’s and the world’s problems through simplistic fantasy. It makes up for the military fiascos and social disasters it can’t and won’t represent by inventing cartoonish successes and triumphs that should convince no one. Such films, insofar as they have a major impact, which is questionable, tend to reinforce and exacerbate the wishful thinking and illusions of a somewhat stunned population that has not yet for the most part consciously grasped the real causes of its predicament. “And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth’s mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born—to fight the foes no single hero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then—for now, the Avengers Assemble!”—from the prologue to the Marvel comic book. Based on the gothic television soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971, Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows is an erratic movie without core or conviction. Although the film is not as poor as Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) or Alice in Wonderful (2010), Burton is largely going through the motions here as well. Almost entirely lost are the humanism and sympathy that made Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Ed Wood (1994) endearing. Dark Shadows relies heavily on the talents of Johnny Depp, as well as a soundtrack of familiar 1970s songs, to cover over the identity crisis of its lackluster screenplay. Confusion about whether it’s a comedy-horror, or horror-drama with a bit of comedy, produces a few casualties, among whom Michelle Pfeiffer is the most prominent. Depp plays Barnabas Collins, born in Liverpool in the 18th century, whose family moved to New England and became rich in the fishing industry. A jilted lover and witch, Angelique (Eva Green), turns him into a vampire and buries him. In 1972, his coffin is uncovered by a group of construction workers and Barnabas is set free. The film’s quasi-comedy stems from Barnabas’s encounter with the 1970s, including a discussion about the Vietnam War with a vanload of hippies, who soon after become the victims of his bloodlust (not amusing). While Burton can resurrect Barnabas, no amount of dark Burton-type visuals can resurrect the cheesy but enjoyable original Barnabas (Jonathan Frid who died in April) and the silly television series."
