Mar 18 2024,positive,war of the worlds initially had a cool reception which is very unfair its a cracking thriller delivered with spielbergs practised panache echoes of past spielbergian works like close encounters jurassic park even empire of the sun but with a darker post 911 tone cruise for the most part reins in his tendency to overact tim robbins is oddly cast as a paranoid survivalist but the best performance is dakota fannings the conscience of the threatened family special fx are of course excellent even if the martians are designed to be a bit cutiepie
Mar 6 2024,positive,movie is great and definitely worth seeing everything from sound effects cgi and action was amazing not to mention the actors
Feb 26 2024,negative,too slow for this genre
Feb 14 2024,positive,some of the characters just get on your nerves overall it is satisfying
Jan 31 2024,positive,i love this film till just passed the ferry scene  it begins to degrade after that a little but its still worth a watch to the end  one of the films i like to watch every year
Jan 16 2024,positive,this was a terrific modern reinterpretation of a classic film and book tons of character coupled with solid action i have seen it at least four times and enjoy it every time
Jan 15 2024,negative,wish humanity would have gotten annihilated in this movie stupid how people crown around alien ships and dont think to maybe hide
Jan 13 2024,neutral,any 2 hr movie that i can make it through is a good movie that said this is not a great movie the kid characters were annoying af the dumb scene of robbie trying to run off and fight with the military and refusing to go back to his dad and sister the sister maggie good lord basically she just screams randomly and looks bug eyed throughout the movie its unclear where she wanders off to when they finally leave the basement and why she cant hear ray calling for her the ending and explanation of what was happening to the aliens was rushed and lazy all of that said it was still mostly entertaining and the alien scenes where the tripods were just blasting everyone was fun my son and i enjoyed it
Jan 7 2024,neutral,much like minority report this movie works in spite of spielbergs direction  once you get past the first 15 minutes it turns into a total roller coaster ride with barely any dialog to carry the next hour and a half despite the thrill ride along the way the ending is a bit of a let down but that is keeping in tradition of the source material  my biggest complaint is the over reliance on cgi  sure technology has come a long way since jurassic park but it still doesnt look as good as the practical effects of raiders of the lost ark
Jan 5 2024,negative,i liked dakota fanning in it  she was the only good actor in this movie  otherwise it was pretty much a tom cruise fail
Jan 4 2024,positive,it was goodidk why ppl gave it bad reviews
Jan 4 2024,positive,this movie has amazing visuals for its day the cinematography was good and it has some fun elements what i wouldve done is not show the creatures and keep them as hidden and as unknown figures but still a great movie to watch on a friday night
Jan 2 2024,positive,great movie underrated
Dec 11 2023,negative,dumb remake especially the scene where cruises son insists he needs to see what is going on while his sister rachel is being pulled away with some strangers and she who has been screaming many time prior just struggles and says nothing cruise in the meantime is more concerned with his teenage son than he is about his 10 year old daughter
Dec 10 2023,positive,ill never understand why people dont like this movie to me it hits every mark on the checklist of a great film not only myself but my kids loved watching this every scene with the tripods is incredibly tense and thrilling  i could understand why maybe some dont like the major twist at the end but i think its quite brilliant  regardless the psychological aspect of this film is what makes its so good you truly feel the fear of these extraterrestrial beings transcend through the movie as a viewer  which you cant ask for more  if youre thinking about this movie give it a shot
Dec 4 2023,positive,great movie besides tom cruse off screen antics great story and special effects and action packed rotten tomatoes is 80 wrong so watch this movie and enjoy an action packed science fiction movie
Dec 2 2023,positive,annoying kids screaming
Nov 25 2023,positive,probably the only tom cruise film i have been disappointed with just a poor film overall tom couldnt help it
Nov 10 2023,neutral,it was an ok watch i felt it could have been better and the young girl seemed to scream a lot
Nov 10 2023,negative,cruise played ray ferrier well but spielberg let us down this time the climax of the story was letting his son leave which sounds ridiculuous to say out loud given the content of the film the story seemed to stagnate after running into tim robbins bunker and became boring and unnecessarily eerie to the point of cringing as realisitic as this films plot was they couldnt have produced anything less convincing
Nov 5 2023,neutral,i cant speak on how it compares to the book though now its on my reading list visually impressive i loved the action and thrill the reason i give it 255 is they dont explain in the slightest what the aliens want why they want blood and how the ships buried were never detected by technology at all i found the ending unsatisfying how did robbie get all the way to his moms safely when he ran into what turned into literal hellfire and to have all the invaders and what came with them the vines just die off so fast with no explanation other than basically they couldnt handle earths bacteria and stuff im sorry but what i enjoyed the entire movie until the in my opinion unsatisfying ending felt like there was no wrapup
Nov 1 2023,positive,i loved it have watched it like 4 times already and am about to watch it again tonight its a downer about his kids and all but the scifi action is awesome
Oct 16 2023,positive,i thought it was down to earth
Oct 15 2023,positive,not a bad flick the tension and horror is more cosmic or doom related which is executed well by scenes that feel overpowering almost like a disaster movie where the disaster is actively targetting you how the elements and setting change overtime is done very well too by making the world overtime look more and more alien acting by dakota fanning while definitely is a lot of screaming i find matches the horror as well tom cruse does well in this role as a distant and struggling father trying to save his kids     the movies strengths are the acting set building cosmic horror vibe music and hopeless tone i especially love how the story slowly builds back up hope and the imagery of the birds and other elements like birds always being a sign of death coming is a brilliant way to show horror     some of its flaws is the son character the acting for him was done well its more the character himself it feels like speilberg wanted the fatherson fued but didnt want to pledge the movie towards it so he kills him off in a very dumb way but he also doesnt want to actually leave it so hopless so the kid comes back at the tail end     but overall good movie definitely one of the better in the alien horror films of the early 2000s
Oct 7 2023,positive,tom cruise is a rock star
Sep 21 2023,positive,a great film one of the last great ones from an era of now underappreciated blockbuster hits it still holds up pretty well the action is intense there are many anxietyinducing moments and tom cruise is fascinating to watch as always the director had fanning screaming a bunch and that was annoying the ending is weird and imperfect overall not a perfect film but fun to watch even after all these years
Sep 13 2023,negative,plot is really annoying and stupid too much superman style added to the movie
Sep 13 2023,positive,woooo yeah baby this is a greateast movie
Sep 4 2023,negative,was fucking shit their lives are in danger and he can even kill a dickhead with poor acting that skitzs out there was more lilelihood of a trans female alien coming and raping is arse while he flaided hos arms for no reason
Aug 20 2023,positive,wow the story of this movie is surreal especially with regard to the theme where a family father does everything possible and impossible to protect his children the films engaging dramaturgy makes cinephiles appreciate it much more recommended movie
Aug 14 2023,positive,the only odd is cruise daughter the rest is perfect  cruise is epic the vfx are great the cinematography is fantastic and morgan freeman deserves an oscar for all his vocal works
Aug 10 2023,positive,its quite entertaining but also its terrifying the cgi is better than most new marvel projects but that isnt the best part tom cruise is golden on this film you feel real sympathy for his character and understand his motivations i rooted for him the whole movie and i was constantly entertained
Aug 2 2023,positive,although its seriously flawed war of the worlds is an underrated gem from the legendary filmmaker steven spielberg that deserves to be higher on the pedestal because of its amazing cgi work magnificent performance from cruise and the gripping first two acts
Aug 1 2023,positive,the greatest 01 hour and 56 minutes ever
Jul 26 2023,positive,this one i need to write about because what the movie is trying to accomplish is apparently lost on a lot of viewers who dont know or dont well remember the source material and go into the experience with the wrong expectations given the parallel premise it seems most people were hoping for independence day with a spielberg overcoat and some of the early scenes probably reinforced this but lets try to set the record straight first and foremost the muchmaligned conclusion down to its narration is lifted straight from the original story could it have been tweaked a little sure in its current form it detracts a little from the overall experience but any large overhaul would have jeopardized the intended resolution so im mostly okay with the safe approach secondly despite its title the book is not about a mass military conflict in which the plucky humans bring down the martians rather it follows a lone wolf protagonist as he first witnesses the horrors of the invasion and then has to navigate a devastated alienpatrolled countryside and the panic of its surviving inhabitants the movie not only faithfully follows this formula it vastly improves on it by giving tom cruises protagonist some loved ones to protect in the process finally while this is one of the films that kicked off the unfortunate spielberg era of overprocessed cgheavy visuals its still an example of his utter mastery of filmbased scenesetting and storytelling notwithstanding a couple of cliche elements several of the character moments in this are phenomenally powerful and while one of the bookinspired alien scenes should almost certainly have been cut the remainder are incredibly tense and wellcrafted if suffering just slightly from mid2000s cg in the end this may be a more flawed film than it needed to be but i maintain its an outstanding piece of science fiction disasterhorror
Jul 26 2023,positive,one of my absolute favorites so yes im biased this is more than a movie its a real experience of paranoia and fear some of the visuals are pulled right out of nightmares one of the scariest sequences to me is when tom cruise opens the window in the basement and sees the tripods using their tentacles to dig up the ground its a short sequence but is truly unnerving and nightmarish i understand people have their qualms with this movie but the sound design and lighting make this one of the most atmospheric films ive ever seen  the cgi is top notch and looks better than most modern movies today truly the first time i actually couldnt tell what was practical and what was cg tom cruise gives a good performance as usual and dakota fanning blows hippo dick
Jul 25 2023,positive,spielberg brought us a great invasion story that was very enjoyable cruise was awesome as usual
Jul 19 2023,negative,id forgotten how terrible this movie is horribly annoying kids  no idea why they had the little girl scream so much or why the son was such a worthless little creep but at some point you just give up on the movie because who cares if those awful kids die tomd be better off without em also stupid predictable and overlong
Jul 18 2023,positive,tom is just magnificent good movie 
Jul 17 2023,positive,awesome movie cruise is great
Jul 15 2023,positive,its 2023 and i still watch the 2005 remake   war  of the world with tom cruise it is one of the best movies ive ever seen its put together very smart and the acting was superb i dont get the audience rating of a low 42 i assume they were probably on some sort of drugs at the time and the critics should have marked it much higher than a 75 perhaps the critics were sitting next to the audience too closely
Jun 27 2023,positive,i think this is one of the better spielberg films tom hanks is great in this and i love plots about aliens coming to earth and destroying everything 9010
Jun 20 2023,negative,this is one boring action flick and one of spielbergs worst efforts throw in the wooden cruise and this is a movie not worth investing your time in
Jun 14 2023,positive,its a prove that you can actually make good exciting and tensing movie from just an alien invasion
Jun 6 2023,positive,this movie is fantastic af wont believe me try watching it for yourself
Jun 4 2023,positive,have watched this a number of times over the years lots of suspense and fulfilling ending
Jun 1 2023,positive,its not very realistic and cool werird movie
May 30 2023,positive,the greatest 01 hour and 56 minutes ever
May 29 2023,positive,love it such a good movie
May 25 2023,neutral,difficult to understand its end although the trajectory of the film keeps you hooked it should be noted that its end was not very understandable since the reason for the death of the guests outside the earth was not very clear
May 21 2023,positive,i loved this movie it was never boring it kept me interested pacing was amazing  it was thrilling and intense and just overall great one of my few questions are how were the shields disabled i entirely understand how they all started dying especially because i read the book but i dont get how them getting infected with bacteria leads to the shields being disabled still the scene where the military brought down a tripod was really enjoyable in conclusion i highly recommend this movie for sciphy enjoyers
May 15 2023,positive,a great reimagining of hg wells iconic story this film really captures the scale of the fighting machines and makes us look so small the only problem i have with it is tom cruise he didnt do anything wrong its just bad casting
Apr 29 2023,positive,yeahhhh kinda forgettable but watchable
Apr 15 2023,positive,good beginning and second act really horrible build up to the ending not bad for a 2005 movie
Apr 5 2023,negative,i never created an account on anything in my life but when i saw rotten tomatoes gave this movie a 75 liking  i had to create an account and call their bluff this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen stupid all the way through 75 come on like i said ive never created an account on anything before i saw rotten tomatoes gave war of worlds a 75 liking lol 
Mar 22 2023,neutral,uhhhthis is a disappointment the acting is half decent its nice to see cruises ego kept in check cruise  fanning actually are not bad but their really isnt any chemistry between his son  rachael the humor does work in this pretty well actually but its offset with surprisingly very clunkyinconsistentbad dialogue everyone else is just kind of ok the cinematography isnt bad either the special effects are surprisingly good along with the action scenes which are consistently solid however this is offset with hit or miss lighting which gives a very dull lifeless feel to everything unmemorable locations and questionable scenes including the aliens which are as generic looking as you can get the camerawork is good in this though the music overall is ok its decent in the first half and kind of forgetfulboring in the second the editing and pacing isnt that good the first half of this film starts out pretty entertaining actually the story of nick and his daughter actually works pretty well with the invasion and it stays pretty focused actually until the second half when they meet tim robbins and lose his son there is about 30 minutes while its ok enough doesnt really contribute anything to the plot and just generates tension with no real payoff robbins character feels completely unneeded the ending is the worst spoilers part how did the microbes shut their shields down and how did this crazy advanced life forms from another world forget miss that oversight after millions of years of having their ships lying dormant if they were here before when they planted the ships how did they miss that or not monitor it once or twice over millions of years it makes no sense his son appearing without any explanation feels lazy and tacked on also its really the slow descent of quality in the second with the final scene being the nail in the coffin honestlyi cant recommend this its not worth the investment because of the crappy ending despite the decent job of the first half very disappointed
Mar 18 2023,negative,so bad i couldnt believe this was directed by ss jeez that was horrible but dont believe me find out for yourself
Feb 28 2023,neutral,epic scale by steven spielberg my 2 12 star rating does not reflect the fact that its interpretation of the original book is loose at best it is entertaining but there are some parts that just feel so overdone the motivations for justin chatwins character robbie seem so confusing and without spoiling the movie his character path seems random and out of nowhere overall it is a popcorn smacker that does not require the audience to think much about
Feb 19 2023,positive,love this movie  watch at least 2 or 3 times a year  brilliant  makes me think that it doesnt have to   be attacks from other worlds   it would be same if from your own planet  kinda scary  its happened before  in my top 10 favs
Feb 13 2023,negative,is this a spielberg movie its really bad
Feb 12 2023,positive,the overall sound mixing throughout the entire film was outstanding and there were moments where the sublow end simply filled the entire theater with the feeling of complete destruction point in case where the first alien ship becomes completely unearthed near the church and slowly charges up to its peak where it then releases its full charge from both of its open claws  the low end of the audio frequency spectrum could not be ignored during this release of massive energy from the aliens main weapon you immediately realize there is no manmade weapon on earth that would be able to overpower one of these tripodded ships  it was an absolutely brilliant design in sound modeling for this movie and i was in awe of the effect it had on the mindset of the people in the audience
Feb 12 2023,negative,decent setup second half totally blows cant believe this was spielberg 
Feb 5 2023,positive,loved this movie as a kid and still do everything production wise in this movie is amazing the tripod design the sounds everything is just perfect still gives me occasional nightmares from time to time really wish wed get more high quality wotw films since its in the public domain but instead we get lackluster low budget b movie versions of personally one of my favorite science fiction novels
Jan 29 2023,negative,not even a shadow of the 1953 version with gene barry  from the pointless complexity of why aliens would bury war machines and then wait thousands of years to activate them and do really think that with all massive building in new york no one would have found one the constant ear piercing screaming of dakota fanning rapidly becomes annoying    the most annoying scene and thats saying something is why in hell would a bunch of unarmed refugees fleeing the aliens deliberately run towards a battle its just plain dumb
Jan 4 2023,positive,i really enjoyed this movie man first of all those sets and production design holyy with all those extras on set thats just crazy to me steven spielberg knows how to use its technology because yeah some vfx shots are outdated but at least 95 still holds up really well tom cruise was incredible in this movie the sister and the brother are not that interested in my opinion i thought it was kinda annoying that she was screaming all the time the opening of this movie is one of the best disaster openings ever put on film the anticipation is sky high and it all pays of i thought that the 3rd act was pretty dam good but the ending overall felt a little rushed it didnt really pushed me into the feelings of the characters on screen the aliens felt a little undeveloped but i guess they looked cool so who cares that scene in the basement of a broken house is so good straight up small horror vibes but again those vfx shots combined with practical miniatures looks so good still cant believe it there are a lot of long takes in this movie and is just makes you feel like you are in that world there was one scene where they were driving away and it was all one take if you dont count the hidding cuts and it was so sick to see steven spielberg is still the best director ever in my opinion
Jan 2 2023,positive,tom cruise does it again and spielbergs movie is spellbinding pretty much par for the course special effects are fantastic and its a thrill a minute
Dec 12 2022,positive,awesome movie so much fun and intriguing well done and great acting 
Nov 23 2022,positive,this movie has aged like fine wine  a modern take on the classic hg wells story involving alien invaders from mars this film is sure to create tension dread and excitement in the viewers  one of the best things i like about this movie is the lack of cliches tom cruise plays an average bluecollar worker who has found himself and his children in the midst of an alien extermination of humanity we dont see him try to fight back against the aliens the military stands no chance against the fighting machines the aliens themselves are obscured and mysterious and we never find out what the true goal of the aliens are we only see just a father and his children trying to survive in such a hopeless situation
Oct 24 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie tom cruise did a great job
Oct 12 2022,positive,no clue why the audience score doesnt like this movie it never feels dated and continues to shine and remain watchable year in and year out
Oct 2 2022,positive,an opening narration explains that earth was being observed by extraterrestrials with immense intelligence and no compassion as man dominated the world without doubt much in the way microorganisms swarm in a drop of water these beings plotted to take it all from them divorced longshoreman ray ferrier tom cruise works as a crane operator at a dock in brooklyn new york and is estranged from his children 10yearold daughter rachel dakota fanning and teenage son robbie justin chatwin rays pregnant former wife mary ann drops the two off at his house in bayonne new jersey on her way to visit her parents in boston later a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a nearby intersection causing an emp that instantly fries almost all electronic devices ray reluctantly joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts where a massive tripod war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey ash ray collects his children steals the only working van and drives to mary anns empty home in suburban new jersey to take refuge that night they take shelter in the basement but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion which destroys the house the next morning ray and robbie discover that a boeing 747 had crashed into the neighborhood ray meets a wandering news team scavenging the wreckage for food who explain to him that multiple tripods have attacked major cities around the world adding that the tripods have force shields to protect them from most of humanitys defenses and the tripods pilots traveled to earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines which are assumed to have been buried underground for thousands of years    rotten tomatoes critical consensus states steven spielbergs adaptation of war of the worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of hg wells classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences james berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective but described the ending as weak even though spielberg does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic total films review gave war of the worlds four out of five stars considering that spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film tv stage radio and record and describing the film as having many startling images comparing the first tripod attack to the omaha beach landing from saving private ryan broomfield enterprises dan marcucci and nancy serougi felt that morgan freemans narration was unnecessary and that the first half was great but the second half became filled with clichés riddled with holes and tainted by tim robbins michael wilmington of the chicago tribune gave the film threeandahalf stars out of four writing war of the worlds definitely wins its battle but not the war wilmington stated that the film takes on a wild journey through two sides of spielberg the dark and the light he also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of spielbergs et the extraterrestrial    this is spielbergs take on h g wells 1898 classic novel the war of the worlds with a plot based on an invasion of earth by extraterrestrials spielberg has set the story in the present and the film becomes a bit more of a tom cruise vehicle than a scary science fiction story despite the fact that ilm has done a pretty good job when if comes to that specific part with the extraterrestrials and their war machines for being shot in 2005 yes its about family survival and what you need to do to protect your loved ones which is clear but the invasion itself is unclear i think and at times its mostly cruise running and saving the day throughout the running time with a lot of bangs and explosions and theres less substance for the mind and i agree that tim robbins strange cameo is not functional and it hampers the story theres moments in war of the worlds that is quite impressive but in the end it leaves you unsatisfied     trivia the film received generally positive reviews from critics with many praising the performances spielbergs direction the screenplay the dark and realistic tone the action sequences the sound design and the visual effects the film achieved massive success grossing over 603 million worldwide making it the fourth most successful film of 2005 the film also earned three academy awards nominations best visual effects best sound mixing and best sound editing all three categories were won by king kong
Sep 27 2022,negative,75 rating on the tomato meter from the experts did they watch the same movie i did oh right cant give steven spielberg bad marks in hollywood the chosen people wouldnt like it  easily the most disappointing remake of a movie i was so looking forward to this and was bitterly disillusioned  i did enjoy the special effects and some plot lines however why they chose to put in annoying millennial children to distract is beyond me dakota fanning who is usually adorable comes off as another whiny brat and the son is twice as bad you wind up hoping the aliens kill both of them   this movie alone was a clear warning about the useless generation we were raising and now both that generation and this movie are completely pointless
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 7 2022,positive,i am not a tom cruse fan having read the book this is a surprisingly great adaptation its absolutely got the earlymid 2000s pro military syndrome in a few scenes and references to terrorists which do date the movie the plot with the older son is dismissible the scenes of terror and tension are fantastic absolutely making up for the shortcomings
Sep 4 2022,positive,spiegbergs own take on war of the worlds honors the book with its dark horror and emotional impact that can keep an audience entertained in their seats
Sep 2 2022,positive,i found really interesting and cool
Aug 1 2022,positive,i do like this movie it is definitely not spielbergs greatest film but it is not his worst by any means there are some great sequences in it that prove spielbergs absolute mastery of the camera
Jul 28 2022,positive,the movie was good but the kids were so damn annoying and dumb especially the girl i wish that the girl went with ray in the beggining to investigate then got evaporated by the robot
Jul 12 2022,negative,cant express how much i hate his children why they gotta make them so dumb couldnt watch it
Jun 28 2022,positive,im a fan i think it was well casted and acted story wasnt overly done and the effects were great
Jun 27 2022,positive,this movie so intense i was actually relieved when all of the action stopped its a pretty suspenseful movie but i just wish there was more character development
Jun 24 2022,positive,idk what everybody thinks this movie is an awesome mustwatch
Jun 7 2022,positive,war of the worlds has some things going for it  killer visuals and a mystery surrounding this whole invasion the human side marred by an annoying child and gunho teen dont do anything except distract from the things it does well at
May 28 2022,neutral,this movie freaks me out and i felt scared
May 22 2022,positive,tom cruise plays a man on a mission in this film to keep his family alive with some cringe worthy content scattered around in the film it doesnt put the movie down too much with excellent cgi and noise the film is definitely one of my favourites
May 18 2022,negative,third time seeing this movie and cant believe how stupid the people are supposed to be int he move who sits there and watches alien ships rise out of the ground while they all look up in awe come on now everyone would be running like hell
May 15 2022,positive,the entire film was captivating  great special effects writing and acting  one ill see every few years
May 13 2022,neutral,i liked the beginning and the set up of the movie however from the middle to the end stuff felt unnecessary tacked on and nonsensical it ends very abruptly and out of the blue as well and it doesnt feel like a steven spielberg production more like michael bay i wish it was written better and included more heart
May 13 2022,positive,there are a few things i found extremely annoying  one was the whining voice and screaming of his daughter and how poorly they listened to their father  other than that i liked the movie and the special effects
May 10 2022,negative,some of the special effects are nice but otherwise below avg movie a bit boring at times 
May 3 2022,positive,war of the worlds is an exciting adaptation that packs all the action and thrill that youd expect cgi is pretty good for its time and the story is pretty good acting was alright and there were a number of plot conveniences and cliches however it was still very enjoyable especially for the extremely welldone action throughout the worldbuilding is also very good overall despite the flaws that i am able to recognize with this film i ended up really enjoying it in the end despite all the negativity that surrounds this movie
May 2 2022,positive,i was invested the whole time only some of the robbie scenes took me out of the movie and confused me but overall solid movie
May 2 2022,positive,another ok speilberg movie that could have been excellent with better story editing some of the the lead characters choices dont make sense and the ending is very abrupt good suspense great acting especially by tim robbins a few tweaks and this could have been an excellent movie 
Apr 28 2022,positive,sonic and king evil lord lord king evil lord king lord lord of north
Mar 25 2022,neutral,war of the worlds had a lot going for it considering the story that it was directed by steven spielberg and a decent cast on paper it turned however to be a frustratingly uneven film with a good first half and a pretty lousy second half    starting with whats good the film looks fabulous the atmosphere that the cinematography and lighting evoked is just incredible and the special effects are without complaint too john williams can be relied upon to compose a good score and he does here being both rousing and spooky spielberg does an impeccable job directing the first half of the film giving a lot of the first half thrills suspense and genuine scares    tom cruise does a good job in the lead and tim robbins is eerily eccentric as said the first half has many great moments and is filled with unnerving suspense and scary chills truly imaginative details like the burning train the birdstripod scene and the river of the dead bodies burn in the memory for a long while after    however the human drama was not as transfixing as it should have been being hurt by the dysfunctional family subplot being rammed down the throat with no subtlety at all with nothing relatable at all and especially by the kids    spielberg has demonstrated before that he is capable of directing great child performances prime examples being haley joel osment in ai and christian bale in empire of the sun but the performances of both dakota fanning and justin chatwin are incredibly irritating not sure which is more so fannings constant screaming or brattiness or chatwin made to act throughout the film but especially the second half like an indecisively written character who makes stupid decisions and acts rebellious in the most insufferable of ways the dialogue is often insipid    after a lot of promise in the first half war of the worlds is let down significantly by the second half where the pace slackens a notable example being that overlong scene in the basement and the suspense dramatically wilts such as when the aliens are introduced and they are not menacing in the slightest and is replaced by ridiculousness frustrating character decisions and sentimentality the hollywood schmaltz kicks in and keeps assaulting the viewer at full throttle while the ending is up there as one of films most false cloying and anticlimactic    in conclusion a frustratingly uneven film that starts off quite well and then completely falls apart 510 bethany cox
Mar 17 2022,positive,loved the first half the second half is confusing and rather stupid
Mar 17 2022,positive,war of the worlds is a passable movie though the storyline seemed tedious and drawn out in order to fill some length necessity the action and suspense keeps you enthralled in only a way that spielberg could   dakota fanning though if overacting in a movie was a guiness world record she would smash it the overthetop childlike fear was silly and portrayed in a way that made it an annoyance rather than a sense of the characters emotion   if youre trying to decide whether to watch this or not the simplest summary would be itll do
Feb 2 2022,positive,i have never seen the original so only seen it as its own stand alone film and i must say this film is one of the far better alien invasion films there is theres a surprising level of horror elements that makes it feel a bit deeper than it probably is and say what you will about tom cruise but he has such a likeable screen presence
Jan 26 2022,positive,honestly an underrated project from industry giant spielberg as a scifi thriller it does more than succeed spielberg actually makes the human characters and their plights both familial and otherworldly the center of this whole experience
Dec 30 2021,positive,war of the worlds is a thrilling scifi film but theres a lot of issues the cast the cinematography and the writing are a bit off but at spielberg brings back the terror since jaws and duel and i wished steven spielberg brings back the terror and horror film with john williams
Dec 22 2021,negative,in my opinion  great special effects crap movie  original way better
Oct 15 2021,negative,far too neat and tidy for a movie that should have been about an apocalypse  the tripods were excellent but the movie reeked of an la sound stage and a director that twisted the plot with a ww2 holocaust styling that didnt work  cruise was strange the little girl was odd the brother was throw away
Oct 4 2021,positive,film of a devastating slowness and with a fairly banal plot but with the action scenes and special effects it is saved an honorable mention is to be made to the tense parts that are masterfully rendered in this film
Sep 13 2021,positive,typical tom cruise movie at the time non stop action and running away from aliens the cgi for this movie was second to none at the time and i still think it was more fun than the tv series that came out on epix channel the tv series was more dark but also more boring and the aliens were robot dogs that shoot metal pins i mean come on thats a far cry from these huge aliens in the actual movie
Sep 3 2021,positive,the first half of this movie is an intense fantastic thrill ride the middle gets a bit dull and then its pretty good near the end overall its just really good with welldone effects a solid story cool scenes and a bit too much military admiration
Aug 30 2021,positive,i love this film this is the only alien invasion film where i felt the cold dread and scary threat of the aliens its really always a good choice to put the perspective of the leads to the civilians instead on the military i just wish that theyve made a separate mini storyline through the film where we will follow the teenage boys character named robbie after he got sperated from the two leads and see his adventures to the ruins of the alien invasion and add a young boy character that he will meet along the way who will also gonna have a crush on him i just really wonder how justin chatwins teenage character here will gonna react on that confession how an angsty teenager of the mid 2000s will gonna react if he found out that this young boy that hes travelling with had a crush on him
Aug 22 2021,positive,oddly underrated spielberg film creepy vibe several scenes that stick with you loved the over saturated filming tom has some skills right
Aug 17 2021,negative,great in the first third or half with nice suspense and visuals then the story starts to stall and go downhill  three things drags the movie down for me  1 dakota fanning damn she takes the price for annoying child acting i almost wanted to slap her  2 why is everybody so stupid they all act like headless chicken  3 the end dont get me wrong hg wells story is a classic the most important in sci fi history but the aliens dying of a virus its not a satisfying end from a cinematic pov and its pretty dumb from a modern perspective advanced aliens would be prepared for this
Jul 21 2021,positive,beginning was good storyline between characters
Jul 6 2021,positive,i like this alien movie apparently some people dont
Jun 25 2021,positive,an underrated spielberg film that has nice effects a great story and well done acting from the cast
Jun 16 2021,positive,war of the worlds is an honest classic to me a wellproduced intriguing edgeofyourseat movie for people to watch stephen spielberg never disappoints when it comes to creating wellmade scifi classics the only kicker to giving this movie a 5star review is the acting although the movie wouldnt be the same without tom cruise his acting skills are mediocre at best overall a mustsee classic from 2005 and a creepy movie from the start
Jun 8 2021,positive,entertaining but somehow unconvincing end  great tom acting
Jun 4 2021,negative,wellexecuted bunk  good special effects including tom cruises acting vacillating between whispering and yelling   the script is like highschoollevel writing
May 27 2021,positive,im betting five out of five stars its a very good movie the first time i watched it when i was a kid and every time i watch it i never cease to admire it i remember him for a long time one of the best movies ive ever seen interesting plot good acting unexpected twists and turns of events i advise everyone to watch it you will definitely not regret it ill watch it right now
May 25 2021,neutral,perhaps im being a bit mean to this movie with my score it probably deserves a 3 but this movie is ultimately on the higher end of the mediocre margins  it features some pretty good performances for the most part some good technical aspects and a few genuinely effective scenes  like this movie should it does give a good sense of dread and misery for goodsized chunks and i actually think it was smart for this movie to focus solely on the perspective of those who are stuck in the middle of the invasion rather than the original movie or id4 which focused on the scientists and military individuals at the top making the movie a confusing mess but in a good way  however much of the movie is also rather stilted including a few moments in regards to spielbergs direction  the prime example was what was for me the pinnacle of the movie in terms of entertainment the sole military vs aliens bit where the protagonists are dangerclose but having rewatched it recently its very awkwardly paced almost outright static this might be the fault of the editor but its shockingly lifeless during bits of it and while on the subject of that scene it seemed odd that the military would have waited this long to see if guns and missiles have any effect  overall the movie is perfectly serviceable but honestly its not particularly memorable for the most part and is only genuinely effective from time to time  there was plenty for scary movie 4 to sink its teeth into when they spoofed it
May 20 2021,negative,this movie sucks because its not funny original or romantic
May 19 2021,positive,loved it mostly i could have done without the tension between the tom cruise character and his children but i suppose it did give a bit of depth to the story the film is set in modern times so is very different from the setting in the book however many of the elements of the original story are in the film albeit changed around quite a bit for example if i heard it right ogilvy the astronomer in the book becomes in film the equivalent of the artillery man character in the book who plans to begin again underground some of my favourite parts of the book arent in the film though the landing of the cylinders the unscrewing of the lid of the first cylinder and the scene of the hideous martian coming out of the cylinder i would love to have seen those the film looks amazing and there are some great action scenes i know some of my friends dont like the ending and the way the martians are defeated but that is how it was written and it would have been ludicrous to have any other ending overall a great film and easily the best of all of the war of the worlds movies in my opinion what i would really like to see though is a movie which is entirely faithful to the book with all the scenes and characters portrayed as they are in the book
May 17 2021,positive,war of the worlds  910 steven spielbergs career is one of the most illustrious in the histroy of cinema he has tackled the genre of scifi many time directing two of the most notable alien films in history close encounters of the third kind and et the extraterrestrial so when spielberg wanted to make an alien invasion in the early 2000s he delivered what could be his most underrated film in his career its a little ironic that in the same year this film came out another highly underrated spielberg film released as well munich spielberg reteamed with his minority report star tom cruise to make this film and along with this reteaming came a lot of hype the movie was shrouded in so much secrecy that even the stars had no idea what the aliens looked like till near the release date what spielberg accomplished with this film was deviate from the alien invasion just enough to make the human side of things matter independence day which is my all time favourite invasion film focused on the action and spectacle of an invasion whereas spielberg went the route of showing its effects on society and human pysche the film is surprisingly terrifying when the story focuses on how people will do whatever it takes to survive or gain an upper hand the movie borderlines horror without crossing the line the way the scenes of panic are filmed by legend janusz kaminski brings an unflinching anxiety they feel believable with the scene of people trying to flee via a ferry delivering more scares and tension than most horror films the film also features a really underrated performance from tom cruise who plays a flawed father figure who just wants to get himself and his kids out of the situation alive tim robbins as the mentally unstable man who provides shelter is a standout with a really good performance from dakota fanning who plays cruises petrified daughter what makes this film so great and seem to get better as the years go by is the fact how its relentless in creating tension it isnt as action packed as other alien movies and that might be a reason why people overlook this movie give it a shot and watch this great movie
May 15 2021,negative,pretty much as boring as you could imagine a endoftheworld alien invasion action film to be
May 14 2021,positive,huge fan of the original because of the new ground it broke but for some of the armchair critics to state that spielberg brings nothing new to this  seriously  apart from the stunning cgi the audio enhancements are very haunting it brings a completely different dimension to the tripods that was never there before did anyone notice the cops and civilians moving towards the drain cover  from the bone collector   the panic on the ferry is edge of the seat stuff its easily a sci fi classic ps samuel l wouldnt know a good movie if it bit him on the ass
May 13 2021,negative,a silly bland plot mixed with irritating characters and dated visual effects make this worth a skip although im sure the book makes for an enjoyable read there was nothing unique or memorable about this story there were also plenty of repetitive unrealistic action scenes to make matters worse the two children were moronic and annoying throughout with rachel constantly screaming and robbie having a death wish for no logical reason none of the characters were really likeable there was basically no character development and i couldnt have cared less about anyone shown on screen considering the world was being destroyed youd expect to feel some emotion but it completely failed on that front as for the acting it was mediocre at best and terrible at worst with tom cruise playing tom cruise dakota fanning resorting to screaming every ten seconds and justin chatwin behaving irrationally the pacing was a bit uneven cgi was overused and the lighting film grain and lens flares were awful the soundtrack wasnt memorable
Apr 30 2021,neutral,brilliant effects and scoring by williams but unnatural character development and a few other deficiencies plague this one tom cruise does tom cruise not really giving one of his best performances but competent dakota fanning does well despite being annoying at times she at least makes up for her brother robbie being one of the most lazily written characters around i expected miranda otto to have a greater role given that this saw her fresh out of lotr but apparently she was pregnant and needed accommodation for a less physically demanding project one musnt forget that this is based off of the book by wells and is a remake of at least one other adaptation mucking about somewhere without pretending to have seen the predecessors i can probably assume that spielberg mutilated the classic book to allow for the familybased drama elements that he seemed keen to throw in the climax and ending come from nowhere and the entire plotline feels inorganically crammed together in order to fit runtime and have as much bigbudget action as possible astar visuals do not a good film make
Apr 28 2021,positive,i have read the original novel by h g wells at least four times considering it the seminal story of interplanetary warfare wells demonstrated that he was a science fiction writer of the first magnitude portraying a human victory at great cost    i have also watched the movie starring gene barry several times it was an incredible special effects marvel for the time the martian warships looked menacing and their action of their weaponry was believable    this version of the classic tale is a worthy addition to the saga of the original wells story the acting is superb and of course the special effects are dazzling the human interest of a man that was not much of a father transporting his children through dangers both martian and human made this a great human tale    some of the scenes such as the burning train and humvee are classic war scenes adapted to the fight with the martians however nothing can top the clothes falling from the sky this is a great movie a worthy extension of one of the best science fiction stories of all time
Apr 27 2021,positive,the movie is great to be a scary
Apr 18 2021,positive,an stier alist bmovie the things out of space are not meant for this place and the things out of place must be returned to close the space between us
Mar 31 2021,negative,what could have been a really nice scifi is ruined by the character of rachel who will release chilling screams from the top of her lungs throughout the movie  you will root for a father abandoning his daughter and the aliens munching her up when you see this    everything else aged well and makes for a great experience  although the movie is too heavy on bloom and film grain
Mar 27 2021,positive,the new version of spielbergs vision of war of the worlds is very dark and suspenseful scifi thriller with chilling musical score by john williams great performance and good vfx
Mar 22 2021,negative,a story that has been told over 30000000000 times and this does not have the sense of wonder that spielberg is know for  and this just look like some crap michael bay would do
Mar 6 2021,positive,watched when first came out and never watched again so glad i didnt it was amazing in 2021 spectacular sets and scenes one after another winning too much cgi in the way 
Feb 4 2021,positive,the little girl should of been fed to the aliens her screaming was very annoying  otherwise the movie was well done
Feb 4 2021,positive,spielbergs adaptation of war of the worlds is an impressive retelling of the classic hg wells tale it certainly delivers spectacular action sequences and impressive visuals with customary spielbergian grandeur what makes the plot engaging is that its told from an every man perspective there are no generals in dark rooms moving units around  this is alien invasion in microcosm  one man and his familys struggle to survive as a result the movie successfully avoids many of the usual clichés associated with the genre despite plenty of entertainment and thrilling set piece moments the lack of likeability of the main characters combined with a weak ending probably means it falls slightly short of being among spielbergs best
Jan 20 2021,positive,memorable its tenacity in creating the atmospheric tension fans of the stories wanted but forgettable in most of its execution
Jan 8 2021,positive,personally i find this movie entertaining and one of spielbergs most underrated films tom cruise is great in this movie and its a good enough modern take on the hg wells classic from the 1800s
Jan 2 2021,positive,have always loved this movie had no idea its received so much hate from audience members its premise was simple and brilliant and executed wonderfully
Dec 11 2020,negative,i have no clue what i have just seen
Dec 8 2020,positive,super great post apocalyptic movie dont listen to the haters spot on great movie with a great performance from tom cruise for once i actually agree with the critic reviews
Dec 7 2020,negative,full of special effects does nothing better than the original war of the worlds which is considered a classic movie thus my 1  12 stars  answer me these questions 1  all electrical run machines collapse but strangely we see the war machine on a strangely dropped cam corder but it too runs on electricity  2 the war machine come out of the ground as if they had been planted many decades ago  3  the worlds being attacked by nanoprobes eating all of the bad stuff for the martians  etc  the physics shown are impossible for a mission  4 the people are acting crazy over one of the few working cars everybody who gains control is shot by another etc  5 tom cruise saves the day by just lucky having 2 grenades which he allows to be sucked up by the war machine and naturally it explodes miraculously freeing everybody with no harm to anybody
Nov 21 2020,positive,i would rate it higher if the son wasnt so freaking annoying and dumb and if the guy in the basement near the end of the movie wasnt such a straight up idiot  minus that its a good movie
Nov 19 2020,positive,wasnt what i expected but the movie has a good story and likable characters i would definitely watch this again
Nov 7 2020,negative,i was hoping the loud annoying irritating family would die and the movie would end specially the little girl    could the screenwriter suck any worse this is an absolute disaster of a movie with 1 likable characterthe woman reporter how the producers can sign off on a script and move to production when the entire dialog was written by a damn fool is beyond me    forgettable movie all around
Oct 16 2020,positive,this film is incredible and has stood the test of time
Oct 11 2020,positive,tom cruise is always there to offer a good entertaining movie however this and the mummy are the only two tom cruise movies that didnt even entertain
Sep 25 2020,positive,storyscreenplay 25 if a worldwide invasion were underway and i had kids as obnoxious as the ones in this film my first priority would be to put them up for adoption    durationtempo 45 at 1 hour and 56 minutes its a longer than average movie that felt short to average  putting aside the awful direction as it pertained to the kids the action scenes were decent and moved things along nicely    cast  crew 35 tom cruise was good and the cast on the whole wasnt bad but the kids were given roles that could not be redeemed through acting alone  i rest their flawed performances at the feet of steven spielberg    summary 355 the screenplay was poor and the cast was middling but the film was paced well and felt shorter than it actually was  the visual effects were excellent and earned this film a half point bump  overall a borderline thumbs up
Sep 15 2020,positive,the first hour was great a content but then the 2nd hour was so bad also justin chatwin is really bad     b
Sep 12 2020,positive,war of the worlds was enjoyable but it had a lot of potential movie was not upto the mark and there were many plot holes    other things were also not upto the mark like storyline and emotions were seriously lacking this movie could have been a blockbuster like independence day but that didnt happen    but even after so much mistakes you will enjoy this movie mainly due to pacing and alien attack story
Sep 10 2020,positive,a decent adaptation of hg wells classic novel with thrilling action impressive visuals and steven spielbergs signature directorial style but its uneven performances and underwhelming ending diminish its emotional impact
Sep 7 2020,positive,the movie is good and all its just the character robbie people are saying the little girl is annoying and she is but robbie just acts like nothing goes his way throughout this whole movie he bitches and moans about everything and he wants to run away and join the army during all this and leave family behind on top of that the dudes acting is god awful seriously who wrote the character of robbie 
Aug 19 2020,positive,special effects 10sound effects 05acting 05story 10
Aug 13 2020,negative,starting with such a great source as the book missing the point meticulously and entirely is a great feat i have to give them that good job one of the most stupid and cliche movies i have ever watched 16 this movie should have a reverse warning dont watch it if you are more than 5 years old
Aug 9 2020,negative,one of the dumbest movies ive seen and that little girl is freaking annoying
Jul 22 2020,positive,most of the bad reviews are based on not liking the type of movie it isthe genre even in some cases i thought the father and daughter roles were well acted and the movie flies fairly fast and is packed with action with horror elements special effects are excellent
Jul 21 2020,positive,it is only loosely based on the novel which h g wells wrote it is fun to watch but it really doesnt make a whole lot of sense the visuals are great overall the movie is ok but not the best work from tom and stephen
Jul 15 2020,positive,this was a pretty good adaptation of wellss novel about a martian invasion not too deep but very entertaining
Jul 13 2020,positive,okay time for a hot take i love this movie its one of the best from spielberg period it updates a classic with great effects and tense thrilling sequences throughout its got great acting across board especially from fanning shes really impressive here these are very human characters with honest reactions to the situation sure theres a few contrivances throughout and the ending wraps up a little too sweetly for my liking but otherwise this is one of my favorite remakes
Jul 11 2020,positive,watched this again last night  a 75 critics  42 audience score  why the difference  we both found it this second time around to be rather welldone a bit too much of the tom cruise saves the world business too much bickering families and some predictable cinematic moments but given the date it was released 2005 the mass chaos it depicts and the theme of alone we fail together we triumph i can now see this as spielbergs attempt to create a post 911 metaphor  worth revisiting if you have not
Jul 5 2020,positive,its not stevens best work but i like it its not raiders but its fun also probably my favorite tom cruise movie this are a few good men great special effects and a good time
Jul 2 2020,positive,one of the best movies of this genre tense to watch all the time
Jun 28 2020,negative,just a bad movie  so so disappointing
Jun 27 2020,negative,mindless action with an interesting ending which comes from the source material a real bad adaptation
Jun 22 2020,positive,a remake done very well spielberg modernizes the classic 50s epic effectively
Jun 19 2020,negative,morgan freemens narration lured me in on a friday night the film however is an atrocity from the acting the plot the visual effects and all the cliches two hours of my life that ill never get back
Jun 18 2020,positive,rating 710 78100
Jun 10 2020,positive,this was a fun movie definitely enjoyable 
Jun 8 2020,positive,has a big problem regarding the depth of his characters but it still manages to be a decent and modern adaptation of a classic of literature
Jun 7 2020,neutral,ill be completely honest the designs of the tripods were an interesting take on the original however if youre going to to make a movie based on a book stick to the original story 100 or not at all movies that are loosely based on books are never that great im not sure but it was most of the little details that couldve made this movie amazing but due to a lack of it wasnt great
Jun 6 2020,positive,outstanding special effects and the sufficient amount of screentime of the titular characters the narrative deteriorates as the film progresses and the ending is highly questionnable and abrupt
May 26 2020,negative,this film has so many stupid narrative decisions that it is still in my top 5 worst films ive ever seen massive disappointment regarding a steven spielberg vehicle
May 18 2020,positive,this isnt a bad remake and i really enjoyed it for what it is dont get why it is rated low
May 13 2020,positive,the final its so bad simply spielberg did not know how to give it a good ending
May 12 2020,positive,war of the worlds is a movie that might not sit well with some viewers and i can understand their reasoning  even though this movie is very depressing it still boasts a powerful performance from tom cruise and a very realistic take on an alien invasion
May 11 2020,positive,this is a good movie typical great performance by cruise in an action film crazy how the audience score is so low
May 10 2020,neutral,this rendition of war of the worlds boasts impressive cgi and great spectacle beyond that the narrative is mediocre and other than competent direction from spielberg it represents a very average film for a director of his caliber
Apr 28 2020,neutral,it was everything i wanted a scifi movie to be like giant robots which are not called aliens since a few movies make it look like aliens are some huge giant robot which is not really something that goes through my mind yes i am looking at you optimus prime  but it has aliens and the tripods are just something which was planned by them this movie was one of the best for me until the ending came which just kind of made me shook i wont spoil the ending but it does actually make sense but is something i found really not satisfying for such a great movie i mean a sequel which is very never gona happen sequel with humans partnering with some other species and then killing off the invading ones i know this sort of a sequel thing is nevwr going to happen but i just very much wished there was more to the ending
Apr 21 2020,positive,a modern take on wellss classic story combined with spielbergs direction koepp and friedmans script the performances of the cast williams score kaminskis cinematography kahns editing carters production design kuljians set decoration johnstons costume design action sequences and visual effects spielbergs interpretation of the classic story amps up the action and visuals
Apr 19 2020,neutral,once the novelty of seeing the aliens and their machines wears off all that is left is watching a depiction of mankind descending into its baser and more horrifying natural state of selfishness and disregard for others which is both the scariest and most realistic aspect of this movie  really  two aliens are going to take the time during a planetary invasion to search the basement of some rundown farmhouse where are family is hiding  finally the ending while probably a legitimate threat to the aliens is still anticlimactic
Mar 31 2020,positive,okishfirst 20 mins were too slow and boring after that felt entertaining john williams score was amazingacting and screenplay was good but the way the aliens were stopped felt like what the hell
Mar 25 2020,positive,war of the worlds is a really great scifi thriller about a familys journey through a war between another world and earth it contains a lot of thrills and heartbreak throughout the movie and keeps the audiences entertained with alot of action and close calls
Mar 19 2020,positive,adaptation that really understood the main idea of the masterpiece that h g wells wrote taking it to the next level with some adjustments a good film for almost every kind of tastes
Mar 15 2020,positive,never gets old dakota is fantastic
Mar 4 2020,positive,yeah he was a good father and that son was a trip but wouldnt mind a son ike that doe the bond that evolves with the kids was nice yeah that too and the end yeah
Feb 22 2020,positive,i really love that tom cruises character isnt a hero hes self involved jerk whose kind of a crappy dad when faced with catastrophic events he doesnt rise up and kick alien butt he runs he panics he makes mistakes he does his best trying to hold it together for his family i like that more realistic look at a character   its certainly not the greatest movie rendition of the hg wells classic but it does have good suspenseful moments and i find it enjoyable
Feb 22 2020,positive,it doesnt leave a lasting impression the way that most spielberg films do but it still has all of the fastpaced action sequences and undeniable dread that the source material portrayed this is after all a story that has been done to death and this film is still easily above average b
Feb 17 2020,negative,poor story it doesnt begin before it ends stupid ideas absolutely not absorbing a bad film undeserving 5
Feb 12 2020,positive,not sure why the low score this isnt some cheap cash grab of a scifi action film i enjoy the personal and emotional journey of cruise and his kids surviving what is a truly frightening hostile
Feb 5 2020,positive,this was a fun movie from spielberg but it couldve been better without justin chatwin
Dec 30 2019,positive,an effective adaptation of the h g wells alien invasion story the scene involving a tripod burrowing its way out of the earth in the middle of a neighbourhood is iconic ive seen audience reviewers complain that visual effects of a 2005 movie arent as good as for example a 2018 avengers movie it shouldnt need to be pointed out how ridiculous that is the alien tripods are menacing unstoppable weapons of mass destruction theres no battle people simply have to flee to have a small chance to avoid being exterminated the acting is pretty good although dakota fannings shrill screaming could be a bit wearing at times the ending is pretty lame these worldconquering aliens somehow never came up with the idea of inoculation shots but this owes to the source material not any new creative decision of the filmmakers
Dec 26 2019,positive,very entertaining i loved it definitely a realistic take on an alien invasion
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movie was dog shit it deserves one star for the acting and visual effects
Dec 23 2019,positive,one of the only alien invasion films where the aliens are a true threat the sight of the tripods invoke fear everytime they appear onscreen the third act suffers from pacing issues but it doesnt ruin the ebtire experience
Dec 8 2019,positive,tom cruise is so gorgeous in this film  every shot is dedicated to his beauty  he is so beautiful in fact you forget there are aliens in the movie and the characters are in immediate danger from losing their lives i hate to point out cruises handsomeness but every single shot you just want to love him he is much too beautiful for his exwife who is pregnant with another mans baby he is a failed father because he is ridiculously goodlooking he should have had a love interest too because a simple  man like ray would need some loving and not be okay being a bachelor anyway cruise is so darn cute you get distracted all you think about him is wanting him he is definitely a rock star in the film where the ladies scream for him hes in the building now watching it almost fifteen years later it reminds you of what was going on in cruises personal life unfortunately all that energy from his life was evident in each frame i personally love tom cruise but this film needed more of an ensemble a community of survivors fighting these alien not centered on a broken family it just seemed too tired and cliche dakota fanning is annoying and also is a distraction again i love spielberg and all the actors but i could not get pulled in and give a care i needed that suspension of disbelief to give a damn for these characters when instead i am just planning my wedding with tom cruise the end 
Nov 20 2019,positive,despite war of the worlds having somewhat of a deus ex machina ending steven spielberg brings hg wells classic invasion story to life performances by tom cruise and the young dakota fanning are particularly applaudable an excellent and modernized version of the story
Nov 8 2019,negative,it would have been a good film if dakota fanning would just shut the fuck up fuck you
Nov 5 2019,positive,i loved the movie i have not seen this in a few years
Oct 28 2019,positive,this was actually not a bad reboot effects were great overall it was very entertaining
Oct 17 2019,positive,awesome movie tom cruise gives a great performance here and the tripods look and sound awesome i also love the family dynamic that this movie has
Oct 16 2019,positive,so good good acting nice cgi and a suspense that would let you in your chair during all the movie absolutely must to watch
Oct 11 2019,negative,worst movie ever 2 hrs of stress and suspense which fizzle out in the last 10 minutes with no story line no climax and no real resolution 1 star cos 0 isnt an option 120 minutes ill never get back 
Oct 1 2019,neutral,it has a lot of problems in its writing some things work like the basement scene majority of the rest is just kinda sloppy
Sep 28 2019,positive,probably one of his best
Sep 4 2019,negative,even tom cruise held his tongue in his cheek the entire movie the rest of the characters were barely believable
Aug 15 2019,positive,i liked this movie the acting was first rate especially dakota fanning  tom cruise the script was excellent as were the special effects it was amazingly believable 
Aug 9 2019,positive,melancholic yet you would feel the power of the aliens  
Aug 5 2019,positive,tom cruise carries this film to the end what would hollywood do without the man
Jul 30 2019,positive,war of the worlds delivers an entertaining cat and mouse sci fi epic way better than the appalling minority report war of the worlds is the best film of 2005 
Jul 21 2019,positive,im stunned at the 42 percent rating here you people been to the theater in the last few years to watch sci fi movies only gripe i had was the 2 kids got on my nerves allot but the special effects were good cruise in his usual solid acting nice touch with the original war of the worlds actors doing a cameo at the end 
Jul 13 2019,positive,tom cruise did the best he could do in this movie and he was successful it is a really good movie
Jul 5 2019,positive,great special effects but a let down overall
Jun 24 2019,positive,awesome one of my all time favorite scigiflicks
Jun 22 2019,negative,a few good special effects but the writing is horrific if you can get past the obnoxious piercing screams of the little obnoxious girl you probably cant get past all the stupid people in this movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,i liked this film hands up i am a tom cruise fan film was good all the way through but i felt the ending was a bit too simple
Mar 10 2019,positive,action packed fun thrill ride
Feb 23 2019,positive,an amazing and underrated science fiction movie which steven spielberg did a great directing job tom cruise who plays a deadbeat irresponsible dad puts a really good performance in and if youre a fan of the original 1953 movie then this is highly worth a watch
Feb 10 2019,positive,energetic heart pounding and absolutely amazing war of the worlds succeeds as a classic disaster film
Jan 30 2019,positive,a solid contemporary reimagining thats grounded and intense
Jan 24 2019,positive,war of the worlds is controversial for all the right reasons but its a gripping take on the close encounters trope brought to you by spielberg with a shoutout to dakota fanning
Jan 19 2019,positive,remake of a classic originated from a novel extra terrestrials are here to harvest and humanity are the crop
Jan 14 2019,positive,im not sure why this movie gets such bad reviews from people the visuals are on point the performances are great and the story is very interesting just because a little girl acts the way a little girl would act in an alien attack doesnt mean its a bad movie spielberg does it again
Jan 14 2019,positive,emotional scary i loved this one pretty suspense
Jan 10 2019,positive,such an underrated movie spielberg creates an immersive thriller that grips you and doesnt let go sure the ending is slightly anticlimactic but the film is more than rewarding a noughties classic
Jan 3 2019,negative,the original its better way better
Dec 27 2018,negative,worst acted movie of tom cruise pathetic storyline girl is only screaming screaming and screamingtrying to create nervousness but ending up creating feelin in everyone slapping her wen she does thatthey are dyeing just like that steven what shit u have made
Dec 26 2018,positive,for a couple of hours i was convinced tom cruise was a real person
Dec 4 2018,positive,suspenseful and terrifying with some awesome looking machines in the mixture steven spielberg managed to get me to come back to this film so many times that counting is just not possible simply put steven spielbergâtms war of the worlds is one of my utmost favorites
Nov 12 2018,positive,the film was horrifying and it felt like i was inside of a nightmare it mastered the feeling of being surrounded by monsters the biggest problem i had was the screaming little girl who screamed 90 percent of the time like willy on indiana jones and the temple of doom
Nov 2 2018,positive,interesting story great cast and visuals
Sep 16 2018,negative,good story ruined by everything except fanning  one star for story and one for fannings acting  not worth watching
Sep 14 2018,positive,this is a great movie based on the famed hg wells novel of the same name a list actor teams up with a list director to make a good entertaining film that needs to be appreciated the effects of the alien tripods are amazing especially the sound design they evoke fear the plotting and pacing is efficient which should be expected from spielberg and the acting is good you know how the film ends and yet this film keeps you engrossed if you havent read the famous novel i suggest you read it before seeing this film
Aug 31 2018,positive,this is the second collaboration between tom cruise and steven spielberg after minority report i think most of you would be aware of the source hg wells famous book and this is a worthy addition to the many adaptations the famed book has had featuring typical spielberg traits war of the world is a big budget adaptation with enough scenes to whet your alien appetite if there is one thing i wish theyd have done is theyd tone dakota fanning down a few notches the pacing is excellent as are the special effects this is a great science fiction film by a master filmmaker a must watch

Aug 27 2018,negative,boring with a typical ending from a perfectly predictable director
Aug 24 2018,positive,like its visually thrilling tripods steven spielbergs war of the worlds manages to stand steady on its own and in some aspects much stronger than its previous adaptation even though it could have played out more focus over its actual source material

Jul 17 2018,positive,i dont think legendary director steven spielberg has made an unapologetic grim film since jaws 1975 and his take on the classic hg wells novel is very cool the movie is good at showing the characters emotions as well as human nature with also a touch of global paranoia without forgetting giant alien tripods blowing everything in sight into pieces the special effects are extremely especially for the mid 2000s impressive and are by far the most impressive aspect of this suspenseful alien invasion film one of the best extraterrestrial flicks to have come out since the 2000s and it deserves more between three and a half and four stars recommended 
Jul 4 2018,positive,a thrilling take on alien invasion    director steven spielberg thrusts tom cruise into fatherhood during an alien invasion spielberg comes up with endless cool shots pans and scenarios to scare the life out of the audience cruise is quite compelling as an unwilling father unfortunately the children are really annoying dakota fanning is a good little actress but her incessant screams are heinously overdone the son played by justin chatwin is too stubborn to the point of being ridiculous his whole character is unnecessary as we get cruise has to be a dad just from fannings character    the run time is a little long the special effects are a bit dated the practical effects look great the writing is passable the action is terrifying the music is scary and the movie is entertaining    war of the worlds is no close encounters of the third kind et the extraterrestrial or minority report but it is still fun
Jun 20 2018,positive,a surprise since nobody speaks of this film and its directed by spielberg not to mention hated for the wrong reasons  for starters the special effects  holy shit did this look great  never did i think it was a studio or green screen and it was made in 04 people  an 04 film looks better than most of the stuff out today im glad spielberg always puts passion into his projects cuz it shows here every shot is aligned beautifully and gives a sense of dread with a hint of hope that van scene that was done in one take needs to be taught in future film courses its that brilliant   the tripods themselves are menacing in their own way  the sound effects used when they appear are terrifying and im amazed nobody uses them in memes as for tom cruise man does he play his character well he gives fear and bravery in every scene and you believe that this man is really just trying his best to survive with his children  my only complaint with the film would have to be the ending  there is no way what happens makes any sense considering what we see happen early on  with a character and the aliens i was left confused as to how they were easily defeated but its a happy ending so yea ok spielberg im going to need more than that  overall a solid alien invasion film that is overlooked and one of spielberg greats
May 28 2018,positive,anyone who doesnt give this 1010 doesnt know life  this film is life
Mar 26 2018,negative,boring lazy no 3rd act ending is abysmal rushed terrible pacing no heart one of john williams worst scores unimaginative for a spielbergian film and above all and quite sad as well forgettable how do you make one of the most epic novels of all time come to life on the big screen while combining it with steven spielberg and somehow screw it up ask paramount
Mar 15 2018,positive,very fast paced first hour but the basement act severely slows the film but besides that the action and aliens make this a very intriguing film
Feb 12 2018,positive,a good update of the story
Jan 27 2018,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen there is no plot
Jan 27 2018,positive,one of my favourite films
Dec 28 2017,positive,despite impressive visuals it somehow wasnt as good as it should have been
Dec 21 2017,positive,childhood memories
Dec 10 2017,positive,a very good movie for steven spielberg and tom cruise 
Nov 26 2017,negative,if i hear dakota fanning scream one more time im going to stab myself in the ears
Oct 25 2017,positive,i remember liking this movie in the theaters i havent seen it since im giving it 4 stars from what i remember of it i liked it at the time i wonder if ill still like it upon rewatching it
Oct 18 2017,negative,disappointing that spielberg would take this hg wells classic and turn it into little more than a tom cruise flick why not just call it mission impossible 7 war of the worlds starring tom cruise i think spielberg was focused on making a buck and not a good movie
Sep 25 2017,negative,easily one of both spielberg  cruises worst films bad acting  storyline throughout with possibly one of the most anticlimatic endings ive ever seen
Sep 8 2017,positive,war of the worlds is a great tom cruise actionscifi movie with impressive direction by steven spielberg the story is scary interesting and really suspenseful spectacular special and visual effects add to the excitement of the movie overall as an adaption of the book and original film steven spielberg recreated it well
Aug 21 2017,positive,not my scene with scifi but exciting nonetheless good effects
Aug 15 2017,positive,this film to me was more real than the original 50s version from my youth the visceral nature of the sets  effects the details of the invasion of our cities and the nearmisses of being caught vs barely escaping are all tooreal spielberg is an undisputed master at bringing out the edge of realism  terror in the attacks on humanity i was disturbed by the use of the blood as it gave me the creeps additionally the threat of our probable demise was so welldone that i felt the threat within myself plus fear for my children  grandchildren that it could have happened like that so dreadful in fact that i was glad it was not a long drawnout affair thank you to the cache of actors  production crew who pulled this off so realistically and to mr spielberg for pulling this off so well kudos
Aug 10 2017,positive,war of the worlds may not be the best steven spielberg movie but it might be the best hg wells movie  using the knowledge gained from the mistakes of their 2002 film the time machine dreamworks skg has figured out the proper way to americanize an hg wells novel instead of dropping key plot points and replacing them with romances or characters portrayed differently from the book war of the worlds hits almost all of the points on a checklist for a movie based on the century old novel tripods reveal themselves on earth  check  a large group of people goes to check them out leading to the beginning of the chaos  check  a man must leave everything behind and hang all hopes on reaching a destination  check  a crazy man has the idea of starting again underground and taking out the martians that way  check  and lastly the man makes it to his destination to discover that the easiest way to defeat the martians is to simply just survive because they die due to bacteria  tom cruise is always a wonderful and charismatic star but in this film we get to see him play a vulnerable and scared father which is awesome dakota fanning gives a fantastic performance as rachel and justin chatwin well hes justin chatwin however he is better in this than he is in most films this is a truly thrilling feature adaptation of a classic novel that has everything you could ask for steven spielberg at the helm fantastic and truly frightening sequences that are memorable in every sense of the word some really great character moments amidst the chaos a score by john williams hes the man narration by none other than morgan freeman and every good moment from the book including the ferry and the basement scene and none of the bad ones as i said to compare this to other spielberg films is unfair as this one isnt even close to his best but it is a fantastic adaptation those who loved the thrill of not knowing what will happen next in the novel will find the same feelings here it is not to be missed
Aug 3 2017,positive,intelligent and exciting adaption of the classic h g well novel very much a tom cruise movie with added undercurrents of watching a society disintegrate under pressure possible the ending lacks the power of the rest of the movie but fans of the genre will not be disappointed
Jul 27 2017,positive,even though i have read of seen the same story a few times before i really enjoyed sitting throuhg this one
Jul 22 2017,positive,it is a very interesting movieit kept my atention all the movievery good action and drama it use very well the idea of alliens invading earth
Jul 12 2017,positive,dakota fanning makes this film its action packed while a bit scary at times even though steven spielberg tried his best there was something missing in the film
Jul 11 2017,positive,it may not be one of spielbergs best but war of the worlds is a rare remake that is faithful to both the original film and its source material despite the same deus ex machina ending it arguably features tom cruises acting performance in a movie the cgi may not be fantastic by todays standards but by 2005 standards its topnotch best of all it actually has the martians use tripods instead of the hovercraft from the original movie honestly the only part of the movie i didnt like is when a certain character who i wont name to avoid spoiling it shows up at the very end even though there is a 0 chance they actually survived as a result instead of a ballsy clichedodging semidark ending the movie settles for a very cliched happy ending that aside this is a very very wellmade movie that helped redefine the alien invasion genre
Jun 18 2017,neutral,um what i love tom cruise but what the heck is this its really weird and barely a plot
Jun 15 2017,positive,the intensity and thrills are undone by one of the most anticlimatic endings ever
Jun 9 2017,positive,i literally do not care what people say about this film i absolutely love it slightly underwhelming ending only in the way this film did it but no matter how much i watch it i cannot get sick of it
Jun 1 2017,positive,an incredibly tense and thrilling film anchored by tom cruises performance war of the worlds is a thrill ride with a rather ambiguous ending that you wont understand until looking it up later
May 3 2017,positive,when one of the greatest filmmakers in history makes a science fiction film which is one of his biggest strengths you have no choice but to check it out    war of the worlds is loosely based on the hg wells novel of the same name about a father and his children trying to cope with a global alien invasion  there have been so many of these alien invasion films over the years so its difficult for any of them to feel fresh and stick out to me  i think the one thing that separates this film from others is that tom cruise or any of the other actors arent playing characters that fight the aliens or tripods as they call them  it only makes up a matter of a few days following the first attack and the immediate aftermath    because of that cruise is given more to do dramatically than per usual  he gets a few stunts and an action scene or two because why wouldnt you take advantage of his talent but its much more about family than it is about anything else  in that regard the film works most of the time  cruise plays ray ferrier father to both rachel and robbie  not to intentionally quote another cruise movie but its really knight and day with these kids  dakota fanning is perfectly cast as rachel a preteen who is terrified of the apocalyptic world she now lives in  however i just couldnt get behind justin chatwins performance and the character of robbie  there were too many times in which i either felt the character was entirely unnecessary to the plot or he kept the plot from moving forward in frustrating ways  why does he all of a sudden feel the need to leave his family and join the armys fight against the tripods  makes no sense whatsoever    unsurprisingly spielbergs visual flare is probably the films biggest asset  whether its the endless amount of long takes explosive and visceral alien action or the impressive cgi and green screen work war of the worlds is a gorgeous film to look at  if every aspect of the film was as good as the visuals this could have been quite the adaptation  bottom line i like everything visually and some of the performances very much but the last 20 minutes is a bit of a letdown as is the constant annoyance of the robbie character    visuals    dakota is magnificent    annoying older brother    7710
Apr 8 2017,positive,an amazing film i would highly recommend i was on the edge of my seat the entire time
Mar 14 2017,negative,steven spielbergs war of the worlds210
Feb 7 2017,positive,the first half of this latest remake of this classic story is pretty good but the second half lets it down if the second half had been better this would have easily been a 35 star film
Jan 11 2017,positive,watchable but it probably wouldve been better without cruise
Jan 8 2017,positive,great special effects
Dec 30 2016,positive,its good movie to watch
Dec 26 2016,positive,this is one of my favorite steven spielbergs movies
Nov 27 2016,negative,horrible remake i expected so much more from steven spielberg bad acting from tom cruise was expected the original was far more entertaining
Oct 31 2016,positive,great direction great performance from cruise
Oct 22 2016,positive,a pretty decent adaptation
Sep 18 2016,negative,in my opinion this is the worst film tom cruise ever made  the 1953 original is much much better  i would not recommend this movie to anyone
Aug 27 2016,positive,i cant understand why this film has received such a bad rap from audiences here on rt i havent read the book but regardless its well shot and directed it is spielberg after all with great specials effects and the cinematography is nice once you get used to the grainy washed out pallete theres some nice action and suspenseful moments and besides the the mildly annoying screaming girl part spielberg shows roland emerich that its possible to shoot a more focused character driven disaster movie 45
Aug 22 2016,positive,full of tension and spectacle spielbergs remake of the old story is successfully modernized and thoroughly gripping though what can get disappointing is the lack of human effect on or interaction with the aliens which kind of makes a well what did we even watch this for kind of feeling in the end
Jul 31 2016,positive,mesmo não tendo a influencia do clássicowar of the worlds é uma transição perfeita do livro do hg wells e com o carisma de tom cruise e  dakota fanning
Jul 19 2016,neutral,war of the worlds directer genius steven spielberg who directed et close encounters of the third kind the indiana jones franchise lincoln bridge of spies jaws catch me if you can minority report and much more sadly this is not one of my favorite steven spielberg films coming from a classic radio play written by the late and great orson welles coming from a play like that gift wrapped into an incredible movie and steven spielberg did not have the right touch to this story coming from tom cruise the king of stunt acting and with two nonsense actors i cant even act yes i am talking about the kids in the film they are just simply bland as it was so good moments in the film and yet a lot of irritating scenes in film i would love to see a perfect war the worlds film thats steven spielberg wouldve attended in the first place this film was just bland and lazy hurts coming from one of my favorite directors of all time doing that for his franchise of his films its just feels like that he was not behind the camera 24 seven sadly it hurts me but the effects are very good but the writing and the story of the whole movie is just bland     grade   610
Jun 26 2016,positive,the special fx were good the acting is quite okay but still you cant go wrong with spielberg except from hook
Jun 16 2016,positive,obvious deus ex machina aside war of the worlds is an extremely heavy and human disaster film fueled by very real emotion poignancy and fear
Jun 10 2016,negative,its ok until the end
May 19 2016,positive,maybe not one of spielbergs bests but war of the worlds serves up an intense thrilling ride all together
May 7 2016,positive,i cant seem to understand why audiences didnt like this excellent adaptation by spielberg with brilliant special effects even by todays standards and good performances all round war of the worlds will be remembered is one of the last great robot apocalypse movies  verdict b
May 4 2016,positive,amazing film loved it
May 1 2016,positive,a powerful sound mixing and a creative and inspired spielberg
Apr 24 2016,positive,at times this movie is a little slow but its an alien invasion story told in a captivating way tom cruise is excellent and there are some memorably suspenseful moments however what lets the movie down is its ubrupt finish which leaves a sour taste in the mouth and is totally unsatisfying and the annoying son with his unrealistic actions overall its still an entertaining movie and a solid action scifi
Apr 11 2016,positive,in many ways a rather typical tom cruise vehicle but the scifi elements are done well and the action scenes are on the whole enjoyable
Mar 31 2016,positive,this movie is awesome pushing the limit of m and having an awesome story does not mean that it would only 42
Mar 27 2016,positive,spielberg successfully adapts hg wells classic sciencefiction novel into a more intimate and human tale of survival for modern audiences and though the films infamous ending may indeed be worthy of all the infamy it has accrued over the years war of the worlds is still a pretty fantastic film the thrilling set piece design engrossing performances and surprisingly enduring visual effects all add up to an incredibly memorable and occasionally horrifying experience that shouldnt go unnoticed
Mar 22 2016,positive,though more of a remake of the 1953 film than an adaptation of the novel war of the worlds succeeds in the same way signs does  its focus on its panicky and startlingly realistic characters who run like ants around the monstrous alien menace everything feels genuine even if it ultimately does fail as an adaptation
Mar 10 2016,negative,they just stole the name of one of the best scifi books and turned it into a very thin film which was nothing like the story just a seies of props for tom cruise to run around or jump over things dreadful film
Feb 17 2016,positive,an amazing movie which is totally worth watching 3 loved it
Feb 7 2016,positive,spielberg is a great director and he continues to show that in this amazing scifi film i think it should be a classic it has great visual effects great acting and is very suspensful war of the worlds is another unforgettable movie by mastermind steven spielberg
Jan 28 2016,negative,speilbergs 2nd worst movie but i blame the writing  not him i love the 1953 version a hundred times better wish they just remade that version with the scientist instead of rooting for a deadbeat dad
Jan 11 2016,positive,one of my favorite movies fascinating and terrifying at the same time
Jan 1 2016,positive,great visuals and supoorting cast however this newer edition cant quite find the footing he desires and a weaker ending doesnt hold up
Dec 24 2015,positive,tom cruise plays ray farrier a character with a distant relationship with children who finds himself in a middle of an alien invasion we are told the aliens have been planning this for a million years why wait so long did they just want to see us suffer     the tripods looked a little out of place as the film appears to be set in the 70s in such a time the alien machines would look a little rudimentary also the aliens alternated between zapping humans to harvesting them and this inconsistency is never touched upon the young characters particularly the son were not particularly well written why did the boy suddenly decide to join the army    there are individual moments which are good the sense of dread and destruction as human society falls apart is clearly apparent particularly when the tripods are not on screen the underground shelter scene heavily borrowed from signs but was still tense the final scene and explanation is also interesting and unique    it remained faithful to the original work but you get the impression this is largely to the films detriment
Nov 14 2015,positive,awesome movie brilliant performance by dakota fanning and amazing sound effects
Nov 9 2015,positive,disappointing for a spielbergcruise movie delivers the shock and awe for the most part but lacks any true emotion
Nov 3 2015,positive,war of the worlds is a fun intense and scary prediction of what would happen if aliens lived among us
Oct 23 2015,negative,wotw is incredibly familiar feeling more like a runofthemill actiondisaster than a spielberg movie not that its terrible the action is good and authentic feeling and theres some cool stuff about the brutality of humanity within a crisis but the family dynamic is abrasive and inconsistent and i hate in movies when sciencey stuff happens for no real reason except to be mysterious the wind blows toward the storm the ground isnt hot its cold just a forgettable adaptation of an overrated story
Oct 20 2015,positive,an often terrifying and well acted action film with great creature design
Oct 19 2015,positive,fantastic movie full of action
Oct 18 2015,negative,this movie was entirely unnecessary and added nothing of value to the older movie or the original novel the action and actor interactions are not particularly believable my recommendation  if you havent seen it give it a miss
Oct 14 2015,neutral,the war of the world is a good movie but the act of tom cruise is so bad i dont see any kind of emotions in cruise act
Oct 4 2015,negative,this remake was unnecessary and insulting to the original do yourself a favour stick with the classic
Sep 12 2015,positive,definitely one of spielbergs weakest efforts the characters werent welldeveloped plus the ending was all of a sudden and wasnt build for that moment tom cruise felt like he didnt have much to play with he was just there also theres s lot of plot holes when it came to the arrivals of the aliens so we didnt knew those huge tripod robots were on the ground come on we couldnt detect them with our present technology and why would the aliens invade this planet when they should known that the bacteria on this planet will kill them    again spielberg delivers the intensity that the film tries to offer but its not enough to make it more interesting than lets say independence day oof
Sep 6 2015,positive,one of my favorite allien invasion movie its a shame the sequels suck tremendously
Sep 6 2015,positive,i remember as a young adult despite hearing the negative critiques of the remake of war of the worlds my friends and word of mouth was tremendously positive i even remember sitting down and watching this for the first time i was in awe i genuinely thought this was a cracking slice of cinema however time has since passed and although spielbergs remake does still hold a special place in my heart and commit quite a number of promising premises into the mainstream cinematic canon war of the worlds ultimately is not only a let down but an extremely dated one at that ray is a very typical single parent who actually has very little in the way of time and devotion for both his children we will get to that in a minute however he loves them and when the 2 come to stay for the weekend the family are forced to put their differences aside as a bizarre storm unleashes an alien rampage across the globe meaning ray and his 2 children must flee their home in search of their mother although hg wells material is sound enough spielberg seems to miss the boat just a little i love the idea of seeing the carnage through the eyes of the protagonists rather than on the bigger scale but it brushes over so many things in a hoaky manner that by the final act you cant help but feel what the hell was the point reverting back your expected to care for ray and his 2 children as they struggle to keep it together both in and out of harms way the problem is that cruise is the only one really doing anything worth a dam here and his character is forced by the writer to be a stereotype of what a blockbuster deems a slacking father to be like you are suppose to grow with ray feel his pain and eventually believe he has changed for the better this however is impossible to do mainly because of his 2 children rachel and robbie yes the writer managed to line 3 bland names up all beginning with r dakota fanning is a loud and needy mess she plays it well and in fairness a young child in that circumstance would be terrified so you cant blame her too much however robbie played by justin chatwin is the biggest shit deficated on the planet it is impossible to sympathize or route for the terribly written and performed character you can feel your blood boil as he continues to just utter the most stupid and aggrivating ideas on the planet for example he feels that his father is an asshole for wanting to keep him and his family safe rather than go back and fight 50 foot tall alien crafts armed with lasers yeah robbie go figure this whole process makes you wish tom cruise would actually stop the car and boot both children out and drive off to a remote area and drink cocktails it would honestly make for a more compelling story that aside and some terrible dialogue main offender robbie once again in reference to the alien craft are they european are played soley for rigid timely laughs and come off as unwanted and out of place in a film trying so desperately to be bleak and show the sadistic side to man in fact that is actually the best moment in war of the worlds when spielberg explores the darker side the entire section leading up to and including a trip on a boat is tremendous proof of that where ray has the general public literally clawing through glass to obtain his car its a pungent moment and one i wish the film took more time to explore it does try again 20 minutes later with a off the wall recluse played by tim robbins but the whole section is so hoaky its true punch is lacking throughout this film does have some pretty spectacular moments in it however the darker moments of bodies floating down the river people shooting one another for a car are played brilliantly but the film also has time for some adrenaline fuelled if slightly computer animated set pieces the introduction of the alien craft being the definative moment still to this day the entire concept and handling of that sequence still sends chills down my spine and its one that the film struggles to recreate it comes close near the end but we are so caught up in nonsense by that point the true punch is lost the film does boast some extremely high production values and cruise is as charismatic as ever even the perception of the aliens is the right way to go the film however tries to appeal to a huge demographic while trying to be tonally pitch black and it just doesnt work war of the worlds is not a shockingly bad film and looking back i may have over praised the movie somewhat in my youth for all its short comings however it is memorable and does have some excellent ideas at its core you just need to bury pretty far in order to enjoy them
Sep 6 2015,positive,this movie is the evidence that critics will rate a film based on its director before even seeing the film
Sep 4 2015,positive,i had some doubt about it before watching it but it convinced me while the ending is a bit weak a common problem with many sci fi or fantasy movies id say i really loved how the movie creates a sense of  general paranoia and desperation some moment of it didnt convince me but globally i liked it a lot and reminded me of the road movie for the fathersons travel in a postapocalyptic world theme tom cruise performance is believable and not too much hero style some scenes are visually very beautiful and the almost horror mood of the last part of the movie adds more charm to it 
Sep 4 2015,positive,this was a pleasant surprise and seemingly underrated by many critics tom cruise was not tom cruise as he takes on the persona of a real character showing us he really can act when he is cast in a role which requires it yes its all hollywood but spielberg does manage to integrate a great deal of the original orson wells tale well done
Sep 1 2015,positive,despite cruises son in this movie being a terrible actor hence him being left off every piece of promotional material war of the worlds is an entertaining piece of thrill that delivers in almost every scene
Aug 30 2015,negative,its a boring remake
Aug 30 2015,positive,i had forgotten how good this is great super special effects story etc   just saw it on tv in 2017 agin really liked it  dakota fanning

Aug 17 2015,positive,i imagine it was rather melancholy filming this apocalyptic semicreepy movie because of all the death and grave situations while watching war of the worlds i found this creative story to be pretty realistic with universals visionary special effects and eerie sets     in case aliens do invade sometime in the future i now know some beneficial survival skills such as basements are good shelters to hide in in addition i thought it was amusing when the characters acted stupidly for example a lot of them stood around and waited for the aliens to kill them and even worse there was a scene where robbie runs to the aliens       screeningmoviesweeblycom
Aug 11 2015,neutral,i remember a time when spielberg could do no wrongseems like hes lost some of that magicgreat visuals and special effects but a tiresomebloated script
Aug 10 2015,negative,i hate unbelievably forced happy endings
Aug 7 2015,neutral,  war of the worlds
Aug 1 2015,positive,couldnt sleep after watching it the first time in the theater 
Jul 29 2015,positive,definitely has a disappointing ending but overall its a pretty good alien invasion movie
Jul 28 2015,positive,the majority of war of the worlds was exciting and fun to watch with steven spielbergs outstanding visual effects sound effects and brilliantly bringing mean bad human bloodsucking aliens to life on the screen as he did ironically with friendly humanloving aliens back in et     still theres some major flaws with the movie such as dakota fannings screaming dakota fannings bitching and yelling and panic attacks  and the anticlimactic ending of the movie where the almighty powerful aliens just quickly die out from tiny bacteria
Jul 19 2015,positive,the third act does a terrible job at bringing the film to its conclusion and runs out of steam before the end but the first two acts are pretty darn entertaining
Jul 19 2015,positive,rating 98  a sweeping spectacle of destruction and action as well as thrills beyond belief make war of the worlds tom cruises best film to date with greatly done visuals and interesting characters
Jul 5 2015,positive,a classic scifi film that has a lot of thrilling action
Jul 3 2015,positive,love this movie this is my favorite movie of all time great story very believable
Jun 27 2015,positive,when steven spielberg makes a remake of a popular 50s scifi film 52 years after the original your probably expecting it to be good since its coming from the guy who directed jaws et and jurassic park then you know this film is going to be good and we were not let down 455
May 31 2015,positive,i think tom cruise and steven spielberg have a talent for making great and amazing films the best alien film ive seen in quite some time
May 24 2015,positive,a decent movie with a lot of suspense and action it is a okay movie but this movie didnt turn out so long plus the ending was part of the reason this movie was good there were good scenes with the blood and the invasion attacks and there bad scenes featuring scenes that they still stay at and some boring conversations overall its decent
May 23 2015,positive,a great story and awesome effects this is why war of the worlds 2005 one of my favorite movies of all time
May 16 2015,negative,onedimensional and annoying characters especially the screaming daughter the family drama that they tried to put in the movie was just bad the aliens were not interesting the little part of the story that could be interesting was just ruined by the rest boring movie
May 16 2015,positive,war of the worlds is a brilliant film for the first 2 acts its focus on character development and plot build up are great but what really stands out is the fact that the scenes of human extermination arent glorified and dont try to be entertaining theyre disturbing you can tell the filmmakers main goal wasnt to make this a summer blockbuster but to make it an eerie and at times depressing movie that being said im not even sure this movie even has a third act  the last act of of the movie couldnt be any more anticlimactic its almost as if the filmmakers were worried theyd run out of money and decided to speed through the last act of the movie as quickly as possible as youre watching the movie you really get excited because you fell like its really building to something spectacular but in the end what it amounts to is an ending that feels rushed and unfinished
May 16 2015,negative,a lousy adaptation of the novel acted out by unlikable characters
May 1 2015,positive,a solid movie from start to finish
Apr 17 2015,neutral,after the lightning strikes tom cruise walks into town which clearly shouldnt be that far away because hes walking there with everyone to see what happened chaos ensues a tripod comes out of the ground and destroys everything its a loud scene tom cruise goes back to his house which let me say again clearly isnt far away the kids have no idea what happened    so they didnt hear the mass destruction going on a few blocks down like what how what steven spielbergs summer blockbuster struggles from painfully unrealistic farfetched moments dont get me started about the end its sometimes fun but overall underwhelming
Apr 13 2015,negative,war of the worlds is a spectacular movie with a very very disappointing plot why would any director settle for such a heartbreaking anticlimax i also did not enjoy the whole childrens theme that was annoyingly put into the movie until it made me sick
Apr 12 2015,neutral,war of the worlds is an average scifi film the story isnt anything special aliens attacking the earth but the way it shows how humans would react in such a frightening time was really good the smaller scenes in this movie are what work best particularly a hiding in the basement scene the effects are quite good as is the sound editing the characters unfortunetly are bland and uninteresting the son is annoying and the daughter just screams the movie is never too slow and the action is certainly impressive but spielbergs direction is not as strong as many of his works the movie delivers in the thrilling action and intense premise but the very flawed story one dimensional characters and underwhelming and convenient ending are major set backs war of the worlds gets 255 stars c
Mar 28 2015,positive,come for the aliendisaster porn  pay no mind to the forced redeemed father story
Mar 26 2015,positive,it may not be among steven spielbergs most critically acclaimed films but war of the worlds is a great example of why the man steven is still a hell of a director the tripods make a hell of an entrance you get spielbergs tendency to to use broken familiesdivorced parentsto add emotional depth john williams provides a pounding score that sounds more like the output of post2010 composers except that williams can make an average score like this listenable and work perfectly inout of context of the film theres certainly some intense moments spielberg nails the scope and scale from the tripods to the plane crash much like gareth edwards would do much later in godzilla tom cruise does a fine job here andhumanfertilizer yeah watch out out for that one haha even if you find the younger actors to be annoying theres still plenty to appreciate on a more technical level the one thing thats making me scratch my head is trying to figure out whether or not i saw this in theaters when it came out
Mar 25 2015,positive,an intense and suspenseful film from the great steven spielberg
Mar 12 2015,positive,a special effects giant with a little lack luster of a script for a remake
Mar 8 2015,positive,i liked how speilberg twisted this up to make it more modern and more believable im not generally a tom cruise fan but he did this well as did lil ms fanning i was genuinely scared at times which is hard for movies to do to me these days
Mar 2 2015,positive,a beautifully directed scifi epic with a strong performance by tom cruise and phenomenal direction from steven spielberg that capitalizes on the sense of claustrophobia and chaos that hg wells created
Feb 27 2015,positive,scary awesome and  sad and a great movie
Feb 25 2015,positive,spielberg does a good job at bringing war of the worlds to the modern audience overcoming a weak final act with intense visuals and a feel of terror throughout
Feb 20 2015,positive,amazing the special effects were top notch and the acting was amazing not to mention the tripods were horrifying the only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the ending but otherwise its a spectacular film
Feb 18 2015,positive,war of the worlds shocked me with the suspense it had to offer this is a lot better than i thought it was going to be even though it is directed by steven spielberg the last 34 of war of the worlds was extremely suspenseful and seriously fun to watch the special effects and settings are pure eye candy even if the cinematography does seem kind of tinted the story follows tom cruise as ray a divorced dad who has lost touch with his kids and during the weekend he has them the world starts to crumble and their lives are in serious danger the story kind of takes a turn in terms of what it wants to be about what starts out as a family bonding situation goes into a fight for your life scenario and doesnt balance out as well as i thought it could in the end i felt like there could have been more development between ray and his kids and their relationship because they never really got the chemistry they needed to make them feel like they really were attached to each other the family does have their moments for sure but with all the exciting alien action its hard to focus on one plot line adding this element into the film didnt ruin anything i just feel like there shouldve been more character development the acting was pretty good tom cruise was great which was to be expected and dakota fanning was pretty good too but she got on my nerves sometimes there was this recurring thing that the characters would say to get another characters attention theyd say hey then a bit louder and then louder and normally i dont care if they do that like twice but they did this a lot it got obnoxious actually the highlights of this film however were the amazing visual effects and the great action scenes these combined together made for some really intense and suspenseful scenes and was a lot of fun to watch as for the ending it was pretty bittersweet but i thought that it was really the right way to handle the relationship between ray and his kids war of the worlds was a lot of fun although it did have kind of a flip flop story and weak character development it still is a great time and an above average disaster film b
Feb 18 2015,negative,of all the remakes of older films hollywood has ever made this one is by far one of the most pointless remakes ever made everything about that movie seemed artificial and out of place no matter what the context mainly because the film tries to mix scifi thrills with human drama a mix that frequently proves disastrous thanks to the abundance of dakota fannings terrible screaming speaking of bad acting every character in this film acts far too panicky to the point that their paranoia seems almost completely insincere what also doesnt help is tom cruise a lead so poor for this movie that its almost as though he was picked just for the sake of him being in the lead role which is odd because i know he can play a lead role far better in other films the special effects arent too bad but the whole film looks empty and lifeless and thats mainly because most of the colours appear to have been muted to me the film felt so empty that its blatant selfindulgence overshadowed whatever message the filmmakers intended it to have and anything good about the film will easily be overshadowed by the overall poor quality ultimately these traits are typical of a film that was made in vain
Feb 14 2015,positive,the scariest giant monsteralien movie ive seen
Feb 10 2015,negative,no way is this movie any where near as good as the original
Feb 6 2015,negative,so a highly intelligent alien species lies dormant on our planet waiting to harvest us only it forgot one crucial  and crippling scientific flaw in their strategy sounds suspiciously like human error instead
Jan 28 2015,negative,the worst spielberg movie ive watched uninteresting characters predictable story and a soon to be forgotten movie
Jan 19 2015,negative,wouldnt feel the need to watch it again
Jan 13 2015,negative,story not logical typical hollywood crap where the hero saves the day and everyone around him survives pretty much  i wish there is an everything wrong with war of the worlds video on youtube  2hour long piece of crap
Jan 12 2015,positive,10  acting  7  writing  7  dialogue  75  plot  characterization  75  cinematography  editing  85  soundtrackscore  set design  8  how much i enjoyed it personally  7
Jan 11 2015,positive,offering some of steven spielbergs best directing war of the worlds updates the classic novel to almost flawless results thanks to masterful suspense and entertaining sequences and brilliant performances from tom cruise and dakota fanning 
Jan 3 2015,positive,a great director in spielberg will always deliver an impressive remake of what many people say a classic story of the alien invasion the acting to my suprise was very good as i expected it to focus more on special effects which it did also tom cruise impresses me the father son daughter story was very believable and the encounters with the aliens were eye catching stuff
Dec 31 2014,neutral,so promising and yet it doesnt work as well as you want it too the kids in particular are poorly written and the worst thing about this is that it had potential   what in gods name were they thinking with the design of the aliens independence day ring a bell stick to the book by hg wells
Dec 28 2014,negative,out of all the tom cruise films this and minority report were the two that i disliked oh and mi iii
Dec 13 2014,positive,seriously this movie could have been nominated for an oscar if it were not tom cruises annoying chilidren
Nov 23 2014,positive,this was a fun ride
Nov 18 2014,negative,tom cruise sucked major ass in this movie
Nov 17 2014,positive,gritty interesting and realistic about as real as you can get for an alien movie i really like this movie especially for a remake 76100
Nov 1 2014,positive,an exciting and satisfying alien invasion flick  the kind that ive waited a long time to see the cheap jokes in all the other ones were not missed here
Oct 24 2014,positive,based on the story of the same name and the subsequent panicinducing radio broadcast performance by actor orson welles by acclaimed science fiction writer hg wells and once already made for the silver screen by paramount pictures in 1953 steven spielbergs 2005 war of the worlds is an excellent companion piece to the original novel and film its a remake that works in large part because spielberg takes the time to update the picture without sacrificing the integrity of the story audiences might be disappointed with the pictures rather abrupt ending but it stays true to wells vision and works well within the context of the film with extraordinary special effects fine characterization and several underlying themes war of the worlds is an excellent genre film and another winner from steven spielberg
Oct 23 2014,positive,i give this film a near perfect rating because it is the essence of an alien destruction movie its fantastic please go watch it
Oct 2 2014,positive,besides its unfocused narrative and awful ending war of the worlds is a thrilling and intense visual treat that packs both paranoia and fun even if cruise gives a performance worthy of trash
Sep 22 2014,neutral,while tom cruise and dakota fanning boast amazing performances you cant help but feel bored with an incredibly slow and dull middle this film falls apart very quickly after it begins spielberg is usually topnotch with films but this is one of those that he didnt quite get the grasp of
Sep 20 2014,positive,my all time favourite story is war of the worlds and this doesnt dissapoint amazing intense and creepy story with some beleveble things to the film my only problem is that this is an english story and this film americanises it but tom cruises performance was truly amazing overall a remarkable film
Sep 11 2014,negative,boring remake of a cult classic starring tom cruise and directed by the former best director ever steven spielberg just everything about this movie for me was just not entertaining i already knew the ending its pretty predictable tom cruise was just bad it felt like he didnt try hard enough and only did this movie for the money because its all about the money watch jerry maguire to get that joke i already forgot about this movie so thats it pretty forgettable
Sep 7 2014,positive,first time seeing it since it came out in 2005 and it really doesnt seem to make much sense logically for example if the aliens are so smart why didnt they build up an immunity to the microbes before attacking but my god spielberg filmed it damn near superbly and it is an extremely well crafted piece of entertainment
Sep 7 2014,positive,brill film amazing film love the scenes and the quality of the image
Sep 5 2014,positive,good movie but the ending is a bit confusing as i will never really know what killed the aliens
Sep 3 2014,negative,43  spielberg tries to go for a modern aesthetic in this hg wells adaptation but the result is a cold drab and disturbing scifi adventure flick despite some fine moments from its cast
Sep 3 2014,neutral,for an action film decent but the ending left a lot to be desired
Aug 31 2014,negative,because dakota fanning was so good  otherwise one star
Aug 27 2014,positive,the most intense sci fi film of the 2000s
Aug 21 2014,positive,simply put not a very great steven spielberg film that being said war of the worlds has its enjoyable and exciting moments but also has some really dull moments and it starts becoming repetitive
Aug 20 2014,negative,this film is pretty good until the last third of it tom cruise gives an empathetic performance as a divorced father trying save his children from the alien invasion then the angstfilled teenage son goes missing and the aliens appear on screen in the basement of a farmhouse and the movie dies right there slowly and painfully
Aug 19 2014,negative,seriously just terrible
Aug 10 2014,positive,dont understand why this movie isnt more popular i actually like tom cruise here which is rare the tripods are awesome they are really cool and frightening i saw this when i was young so theres probably a nostalgia factor but this is to me a very good science fiction movie definitely watch it
Aug 7 2014,positive,nope not feeling it
Aug 4 2014,positive,great movie worth a watch cause its directed by the best and only steven spielberg
Aug 2 2014,positive,great movie it gives you that feeling of what people would do just to survive
Jul 31 2014,positive,what makes this film such a successful remake is spielbergs attention for detail you can tell he genuinely has an interest in the whole scifi genre what could of made this film better is if spielberg didnt make it a remake its so creative and original that it feels like it can stand on its own
Jul 30 2014,positive,great film and adaption special effects are excellent and appropriate another underrated cruise film and performance
Jul 26 2014,positive,first off the orson wells radio play is far more horrifying  frightening than this movie could ever hope to be lets get that straightened out with that said it is entertaining end of the world by aliens from outer space scenarios i like the panic by the people thats shown because thats exactly what would happen
Jul 21 2014,positive,paranoid smart and scary a great hit
Jul 20 2014,negative,definitely my least favorite spielberg movie a very onesided war unlike other alien invasion movies its less about defeating the aliens as just surviving focusing on the story of a divorced dad with custody over the weekend trying to live through the invasion with his two kids the idea of looking at an alien invasion through the survival of just one family rather than the world defeating them isnt bad in itself but when the characters of that one family are generic and boring it makes for a mediocre movie
Jul 18 2014,positive,i dont understand peoples huge beef with this movie its got a few flaws but its so masterful its beautifully filmed the special effects are sleek and both the sense of hopelessness in the narrative as well as underlying themes creates a very unsettling atmosphere a sense of urgency
Jul 13 2014,positive,the bar has been raised  this is a smart solid and intense film  koepps script spielbergs overall vision and cruises emotional performance create  a trifectta that will allow war to dwarf its many invasion counterparts that have yet to come out
Jul 7 2014,negative,this was a cool movieuntil the ending ruined it for everyone including myself
Jul 7 2014,positive,well this was okay for a sci fi movie nice story good robot alien spaceship villain monster and thats all 
Jul 5 2014,positive,tom cruise may be one of my favorite actors this is the kind of movie that grabs you and pulls taught snapping your attention and holding on to your cushion only complaint the writing for the little girl jeez shes annoying lol but the little actress done well
Jul 4 2014,positive,even with the ending war of the worlds is a visually stunning and thrilling epic with great performances
Jul 1 2014,positive,dead set on living    i liked this this was a good psychological movie with an excellent cast
Jun 20 2014,negative,are they going to explain anything like at all
Jun 20 2014,negative,i really disliked this movie the only thing that saved this movie was the animation and tom the kids were soooo annoying
Jun 20 2014,negative,nice graphic effects dopey story  dysfunctional family runs around as aliens attack  inconsistencies and distracting cgi effect scenes disrupt story flow  ending was completely idiotic  i felt my money and time were wasted  hg wells book is better reading that this film is viewing
Jun 19 2014,positive,a good alien invasion
Jun 19 2014,negative,tom cruise can wince and wail all he wants but he cant make up for dakota fannings endless screaming or justin chatwins very existence
Jun 16 2014,neutral,to boring for what it should be
Jun 14 2014,negative,now now it wasnt that bad
Jun 10 2014,positive,this is do doubt spielberg most underrated movie
Jun 5 2014,positive,an enjoyable throwback to the scifi horrors of the past even if its third act is all too conveniently wrapped up in a perfect bow
Jun 4 2014,positive,compared to spielbergs previous works this is nothing youd shake a stick at but that doesnt mean its a bad film its an alien movie told from the perspective of the people instead of the government it is even a pretty accurate perception of how people might act not to mention the action and acting is pretty well done but it doesnt have the majesty and magic of his previous alien films et and close encounters of the 3rd kind but still its worth a watch
Jun 2 2014,positive,a fantastic depiction of the tripod machines from hg wells classic novel by spielberg is lost for most of the 2 hour run time
Jun 2 2014,positive,they took a classic and turned it darker and more twisted and the story is somewhat moee appealing still cant beat the classic though
May 31 2014,neutral,i really hate dakota fanning in this movie
May 26 2014,positive,this movie was good had a fun time watching it really loved the part where humans finally rise up
May 26 2014,positive,awesome adaptation of the hg wells war of the worlds book all the actors do a fantastic job and as always steven spielbergs direction is phenomenal
May 25 2014,positive,those tripods though they scare the living crap out of mespeilberg is pure genius
May 24 2014,positive,i cant figure out why this movie got rated so poorly by majority of the audience but this was an actionpacked suspenseful wellwritten and superbly acted film  from superstar tom cruise and legendary director steven spielberg
May 21 2014,positive,surprisingly dark and twisted so unlike your typical steven spielberg film and i love it
May 18 2014,positive,one of the only good tom cruise movies
May 18 2014,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen absolutely pointless and a complete mess the basement scene ruined it once and for all
May 15 2014,positive,although the machines do stunningly the human contribution to the film lacks though not so terribly that this is a bad film the detail to the family this film follows couldve been greater and thus made the film greater chatwins character is not wellperformed and is lacking in explanation for the characters actions cruise does well as well as fanning but the direction in the familys interaction could have bettered this film so that the visuals set pieces and all things technological would not have needed to carry the film
May 9 2014,positive,narrated by morgan freeman steven spielbergs modern version of hg wells is perhaps one of the most suspenseful movies of the scifi genre tim robbins is brilliant on his cameo appearance
Apr 26 2014,positive,not the best but tom cruise is really good in it
Apr 22 2014,neutral,a movie that will make you wonder if there is really other life out there and whether or not it wants to kill us
Apr 14 2014,neutral,were it not for the little girl screaming   throughout what seems like half the movie it might have been great
Apr 12 2014,negative,wow that was aweful
Apr 4 2014,positive,amazing story line  a young man called ray tom cruise has not had a very good relationship with his wife so when he needs to take care of them for a week something comes out the ground an alien tripod  ray must run jump sneak sprint and hide to not be killed by the alien heat ray but when rachael rays daughter gets abducted by the aliens and taken into a cage attached to the tripod ray has no other choice just to follow her
Mar 29 2014,positive,great update   strong performances match the special effects
Mar 24 2014,negative,end ruins the entire experience
Mar 24 2014,positive,dont know why people hated the ending its the exact same ending from the book
Mar 24 2014,positive,dont know why people hated the ending its the exact same ending from the book
Mar 23 2014,positive,a technically impressive but anticlimactic scifi disaster flick
Mar 4 2014,positive,not as good as it could have been spielberg and cruise try to do their best with the lazy script but the visuals eclipse them
Mar 2 2014,positive,the film that got me into films at a young age
Mar 1 2014,positive,recommend it to everyone
Feb 24 2014,neutral,i found the first 20 or so minutes of the movie entertaining but after that it was downhill  there was some notable scenes with robbins though
Feb 23 2014,positive,per usual spielberg creates a wonderful environmentbut unfortunately the film lacks any acceptable writing to compliment it
Feb 19 2014,positive,this extraordinary work of spielberg and your teamever remember that great movie
Feb 16 2014,positive,this is one of the best alien invasion films since independence day but my main problem is chatwins character can get really annoying
Feb 14 2014,positive,by far an uncompromised filmmaking achievement spielberg at his best
Feb 11 2014,positive,this modern rendition of hg wellss classic story presents an intriguing twist on the classic story that focuses on one mans goal to get his children to boston this takes a wild turn away from the normal aspect of stopping the aliens and more on the survival aspect while the plot is decent most of the characters are developed and the special effects are great the acting is sub par the plot works with the characters to demonstrate the relations between the characters well the fathersondaughter relationship is clearly shown through tom cruises characters caring for his childrens well being the special effects definitely demonstrate steven spielbergs style with many explosions it is all very well done the acting is another story while tom cruise does a good job justin chatwin does a decent job while dakota fanning nearly ruined the movie fannings character is always screaming or whining she is the reason the movie is rarely seen much less enjoyed however the movie is still a good film with the special fx and acting it is definitely worth seeing if one can stand the incessant screaming of a dakota fanning
Feb 4 2014,positive,didnt get why people didnt like this movie i thought it was perfect and my favorite end the world movie to me it had everything i like in a movie  scifi check  great acting check   great director check  end of the world movie check  i could go on and on with this but i get board writing long reviews clearly the best movie from this generation loved it 9810
Feb 3 2014,positive,pretty good flick about an alien invasion based on the classic wells novel the direction is awesomeness and the special effects just breathe classic speilberg very tense moments here especially a scene involving tim robbins i cant really point out too much that is wrong with this movie maybe the fact its predictable but the execution is top notch
Feb 2 2014,positive,war of the worlds is a very underrated scifi thriller that is a genuine adaptation of the classic novel by hg wells war of the worlds is not only very intense but also incredibly well filmed all while delivering a very fun thrill ride
Feb 2 2014,positive,ending is shitty but still damn good action flick
Jan 23 2014,positive,one of the best science fiction movie
Jan 22 2014,positive,while the ending was stupid and laughable not as bad as signs which was stupid and terrible and justin chatwins god awful performance that drag the film down a few stars i think that there is a lot to like with this film  the direction is good again trying to make justin chatwin act the acting is okay and the visual affects are really good epically the aliens  i liked this film in the theaters and i still stand by it today  if you like a good action syifi films that dont have to have explosions in every frame
Jan 11 2014,negative,hmmmabout half way through it now and wondering why tom has his 38 i changed my rating this movie is not very goodive seen enough still gonna finish watching though
Jan 10 2014,negative,the official better than juno seal    okay alien invasion reviews are going on again with steven spielbergs war of the worlds  war of the worlds is based off the classic book by hg wells back in the 1900s  ive read the book and i can personally say that it is very interesting on the take of what an alien invasion on earth would be like  it was so realistic in fact that when orsen welles read it on the radio people believed that it was really happening  mind you that this around the time when orsen welles was still alive so it happened long ago  so nearly a century afterward and steven spielberg brings us his take on hg wells book  spielberg is an already accomplished director  he brought us classics like schindlers list raiders of the lost ark saving private ryan and close encounters with the third kind  and he has tom cruise as the main character  tom cruise  whats not to like about cruise  hes short crazy and believes in aliens  yeah this guy is the definition of awesome  unfortunately this all closes in on them and were given a disappointing cinematic experience    war of the worlds is as i said in the first paragraph based on hg wells book of the same name  basically after a heated divorce from his wife ray played by the cruise has lost custody of his kids but can see them every weekend  so for the first 20 minutes of this film were given the exciting sequences of ray arguing with his emo and possibly homosexual son rob played by that dick who ruined dragonball  then we see him and his daughter have very boring sequences of talking which reveal nothing about their characters that we already know  finally after a weird storm ray travels to the middle of his city  everyone surrounds town unaware of the attack  finally after breaking from the ground giant aliens are zapping everyone to death missing ray by inches  so he returns and takes his kids away packing food of course  they are set across a journey around the us   then we have our movie    elitists of the book will be disappointed by the films change of location  rather than in the streets of london this film is in america  thats a nitpick but as a fan of the book it disappointed me  anyways a real problem is that nothing happens in the first 20 minutes  its just tom cruises life as a parent  he does nothing that enhances his character or anyone else  hes just boring  it doesnt help that dakota fanning is in this just looking as stupid as ever  god i hate child actors  they have whiny voices and just cry and complain and ruin films  its no different here  dakota fanning just cries to tom and complains how hes such a bad dad  so does the emohomo son who is practically the worst thing in this film  he isnt likable at all  the characters are just so annoying  well except tom cruise    the action scenes are the only decent thing in this film because theyre pretty fun and hectic  too bad they are too far apart forcing us to sit through tom and friends crying  also this film is horribly unrealistic at a point  one scene in particular is when the group stumbles upon a plane that crashed in a neighborhood  okay that could happen but heres where it gets stupid  first off there are no bodies and then there are survivors  are you serious  maybe if the crash didnt look that bad i could believe it but no way am i gonna believe that someone survived this crash  its just too hollywood  also the film is just too predictable  just when we think emo boy dies even though we know he wont he comes back  oh and the aliens all die  now this really did happen in the book but it was one of the worst parts of the book  there are no bacteria in mars so they all get taken out by a bacteria  thats such a copout  okay that is so stupid  if there was life on mars there should have been some form of bacteriayou know i wont even start    also the aliens had alienware planted underneath earths surface thousands of years ago to prepare for the attack  that alone is enough to warrant a bad score  so no one ever noticed the 90 foot tall alien tech when they dug up the roads huh  also why wait so long to overtake earth  it would have been much easier if they did back in the 1500s but apparently they felt it necessary to overtake earth when the humans have become more advanced  also this is a nitpick but if those machines were thousands of years old shouldnt they have much more advanced tech now  i mean it would be much easier to take earth  also if they planted the alienware in earth that means they were on earth meaning that they should have came into contact with the bacteria that killed them  so either the aliens never thought to mention it to their future generations that there is some dangerous bacteria that could wipe them out or they are immune to the disease  also cruise seemed very okay with his son running into war  he didnt even attempt to stop him  the more i think about it the more i hate it    overall war of the worlds is a visceral film mainly cause of the action scenes  however it is ruined by various plot inconsistencies and pure gaps of logic  it makes no sense why aliens waited thousands of years to conquer earth  also if i remember correctly i dont recall seeing any spaceships land  therefore they were on earth the entire time meaning that they definitely should have came into contact with the bacteria  that means they had to have died from something other than bacteria but the film said they diedfrom bacteria  uh  it makes my head hurt to try and come up with some reasoning within this film  the  characters are all annoying except for tom cruise of course  the plot is idiotic and the aliens are the very same aliens from independence day  also word from the wise if you see dakota fanning getting pulled into the alien ship its not worth it    alien invasionathon is killing me  310
Jan 7 2014,positive,awesome remake of the original  at least this version didnt put me to sleep
Jan 5 2014,positive,great scifi the end of the world film set up an example of this type of films for decades to come
Jan 3 2014,positive,theres a scene in the middle that drags out a bit and i hate some element in ending but otherwise id say its a great remake
Jan 2 2014,positive,i like these kinds of movies there so interesting but the movie was okay there were some things i dislike but overall is a good movie
Dec 30 2013,positive,a spectacular special effects extravaganza that doesnt lack a human touch it intelligently updates the story of invasion and destruction by centering it around our modern post911 fear of terrorism and total annihilation  fave film
Dec 25 2013,positive,it scared the hell out of me but if it scares me that means its great
Dec 16 2013,positive,an amazing rendition of one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written but still competent cruise is decent and the direction is sturdy fairly good
Dec 15 2013,negative,why must tom cruise destroy everything he touches
Dec 14 2013,positive,aside from the disappointing ending war of the worlds is tense suspenseful thrilling atmospheric dark and emotional dont quite get the audience tomatometer
Dec 12 2013,positive,war of the worlds is the most biggest summer movie of 2005  the special effects were awesome and brilliant the people like this movie and i like it too    sometimes it gets scary but still a great movie and gets better and better     steven spielberg is the best director out there and he is always best on his movie     spielberg and cruise did a good job on this movie for now
Dec 8 2013,positive,over all i liked the movie but to be honest cruise doesnt fit this movie he played his part well but he just isnt the right personality for ray
Dec 7 2013,positive,an awesome and fastpaced thrill ride
Dec 1 2013,positive,you almost couldnt tell it was tom cruise with that baseball cap
Nov 30 2013,positive,ending ruined it a bit but i cant fault the first 1 hr 20 min it was pretty awesome
Nov 29 2013,positive,wow this is awesome another epic movie made by spielberg and one thing i also liked about the movie is that it was very realistic
Nov 27 2013,positive,i really enjoyed this film and even though im not much of a tom cruise fan i actually enjoyed his performance a lot watched 3 times now and its entertained me every time
Nov 23 2013,positive,the best disaster film ever made for the first time they finally got the tone right as opposed to cheesy popcorn roland emmerich flicks suspenseful gripping and tense spielbergs update on the classic novel captures the spirit of the book while also making it feel refreshing and original the whole cast gives very natural performances with cruise knocking it out of the park this is a vastly underrated film and is one of my all time favorites
Nov 21 2013,negative,awesome special effects notwithstanding ten minutes into this movie youre presented with the continuing problem that is no foundation of a story or worthy characters to sustain it
Nov 16 2013,positive,good film and decent story
Nov 15 2013,positive,spielbergs war of the worlds falls short because of lack of mystery and it ends up being another blockbuster
Nov 12 2013,positive,an overall solid adaptation of wells classic novel  although this was the film that introduced everyone to justin chatwin aka geeko from dragonball evolution
Nov 8 2013,positive,this movie was good or atleast decent but i had one major problem could dakota fanning be more annoying in this film i know she was a lot younger but my god that shrieking and screaming just made you have very vivid fantasies of just taking your hands and wrapping it around her neck and tight that alone again the movie was decent for me cgi could have been 1000 times better but the storyline wasnt scrappy but not the greatest decent film worth the watch bit also very forgettable
Nov 8 2013,positive,annoying child and bullet proof son notwithstanding this turns out as expected
Nov 5 2013,positive,the original scared me as a kid this is not a bad remake
Nov 3 2013,neutral,a not so bad adaption of the original  it wouldnt of hurt to keep tim robbins in it a little longer though
Oct 30 2013,negative,dakota fanning screams throughout the movie an thats all i remember
Oct 24 2013,positive,this movie always blows my mind
Oct 24 2013,positive,the movie was quite enjoyable a bit of a drag and sometimes lacking of character build up but still enjoyable although unaware of how the 1958 version or the hg wells storyline goes due to its confusing old english language i had to decipher every five sentences this was quite a thrilling movie to watch and did have its suspenseful moments especially its ending which at first i was like most people saying huh however watching it a couple more times did get me understand how the end became what it was and grew to appreciate it to an extent the acting was good at some partsthe effects were good and the design of the alien tripods were not quite too original but did show how threatening it can be however the movies faults begin with tom cruises character and his kids at first their anger towards their neglecting father was justifiable but even during a freaking apocalypse they start getting annoying by the fact that although their father is trying his best to protect them and trying to redeem himself they still blame him or just argue with them over giving up a car while being threatened this just gets me to hate the kids more then the father even at the end not any real good relationship is built up between them that shows if they finally accepted their father this also brings me to the point where i believe that this is not dakota fannings best let alone good work she is a very talented actress especially when she was young and im glad she is still acting but this is not her best i would say her worst but not her best her character is always in trouble and fails to move out the way unless her brother or dad pulled her out she was never given any memorable strengths no good development and making her character just annoying or boring at points i dont know if i blame her completely because of its just the character than i would blame the writing but i think she should have put more effort into it tom cruise was sometimes boring even in the beginning but thats his character a father who is just separated from his kids literally and figuratively and is just a broke down loser with nothing to lose until the invasion happens however when the suspense scenes happen like the basement and stream scene the two can make it believable and eerie for the audience or for me at least by the way am i the only one who found the scene where the father and son playing catch as both wear some interesting hats funny but nonetheless the action was good the settings were good the premise was great the moral was okay and the suspense was awesome and chilling thats why im giving it at the least three stars
Oct 17 2013,positive,spielberg has crafted an overall fun and gritty popcorn flick that is levitated by magnificent cg and action but is drawn back by some poor storytelling and cruises terrible acting
Oct 10 2013,positive,im never shocked that a spieldberg movie is awesome though i am always shocked to see tom cruise in a movie hes bland and not likable good movie though it wouldve been better without cruise
Oct 10 2013,positive,war of the worlds isnt as good as youd hope from steven spielberg but its mostly good  the whole intro scene in war of the worlds seems really twodimensional because the setting for the family based drama doesnt feel that convincing for some reason and next comes characters which appear to he clearly staring off into a green screen as the visual effects in the background dont blend in with the setting but rather they form a line between the sky and the land which separates the visual effects from the real world it does this consistently and the visual effects seem always to be too behind the characters to blend into the atmosphere  plus war of the worlds is a lot more about the survival of martians attack as opposed to the climactic science fiction disaster movie it was advertised as although it does succeed in capturing the essence of its humane drama it never captures the essence of the science fiction disaster instead of leaving it sit there and seem hollow and so as a science fiction film war of the worlds is subpar which is a shame considering its a steven spielberg effort  and the lead actor tom cruise attempts to pass off a routine effort for his lead role but tom cruise is an actor that can never succeed on a routine he is expressionless the whole time with his only signs of emotion being the scenes in which is voice gets louder and more high pitched as usual but by this point in his career its too lowbrow to be doing that he doesnt succeed in his portrayal of a family man he doesnt succeed in his portrayal of a man of action he doesnt succeed at all and for his character to be leading this kind of story he has many responsibilities none of which he bothers to follow up on he is more beneficial to the success of war of the worlds for his name than he is for being an actor    however although war of the worlds isnt that good as a science fiction movie as a characterdriven disaster movie it is ok   the intensity in the situations that the ferrier family faces is fairly strong and surprisingly effective with the disaster theme being brought down to a humane level and succeeding well because of the atmosphere having a real apocalypse feel i mean in the first earthquake scene its easy to feel like the world is actually shaking steven spielberg again proves that he can bring deep drama to such a big scale story and he succeeds this time at that more than achieving the big scale  and war of the worlds is mostly successful from a technical perspective because of mainly how the cinematography gets easily up close and personal with the dynamics going on so its easy to get sucked into them and for the viewer to embrace the approach of the drama  and dakota fanning is incredible her ability a line deliver and facial expressions is immensely ecstatic  with talent that its easy to forget that shes just a little girl instead of a very experienced actress but she reminds us that she is just a little girl by doing the same thing and showing the brutal stare of a young girls shattered innocence as her family drives away from an explosion dakota fanning id absolutely magnificent in war of the worlds and she shows promise of being one of the greatest actresses that the youth of america has to offer who could even win an academy award one day i wouldnt be surprised if she did  tim robbins was also good in his small role because of how he unhinged himself and showed off his deepest self the kind one only sees when a persons life is in jeopardy tim robbins succeeds in convincing that and so he does a good job    so war of the worlds doesnt complete what it sets out to achieve and it ends rather abruptly but overall its fairly successful
Oct 1 2013,positive,although spielberg and co do a fine job with this adaptation the modern setting saps the originality from wells story leaving us with an alien invasion that is both routine and somewhat confusing on what planet does it make sense to bury your warmachines beneath the very feet of the species youre planning to exterminate millions of years before you actually pick them up and i still do not understand the whole riding the lightning malarky    credit must be given to spielbergs design team for what i believe to be the most astonishing rendition of the tripods i have ever seen in any medium the machines are both frightening and beautiful obviously artificial yet smoothly organic just as wells described them    in the end spielberg has given us an entertaining if imperfect invasion flick and the performances of cruise and fanning inject that all important human element which i find lacking in most films of this genre
Sep 29 2013,positive,spielbergs war of the worlds is much nosier and explosionfilled than the 1950s classic  nevertheless it is still a fun disaster film
Sep 29 2013,positive,americans panicked screaming and getting killed nay getting slaughtered how wonderful  the cgi in this mainly psychological horror movie pushes the story along well  the music is haunting and the script at times is typically american in its shallowness  well filmed and acted with sharp direction and editing nibbles cheese toasties
Sep 28 2013,positive,better than the original
Sep 23 2013,neutral,warning  spoiler alert    when you talk about steven spielberg you imagine jaws et poltergeist indian jones germlins the goonies the color purple jurassic park  schindlers list amistad saving private ryan artificial intelligence minority report  movies which captured the imagination of millions and drove them repeatedly to the theatres watching them once wasnt just enough at times you wanted to own these movies in your private collection   and in these movies he also played multiple roles  most of them he directed and produced and in others he took the role of an actor or screenwriter     so when the name steven spielberg is associated in the remake of hg wells war of the worlds along with talent like tom cruise and dakota fanning you expect it to be big bold bad and even better than before    but somehow this time spielberg wasnt able to cast his magic spell     the graphics the look and feel of the movie were pretty real and organic   the action was pretty gripping and authentic   the cast was pretty strong and there was good chemistry between the actors  though i felt justin chatwin  who played tom cruises son  didnt mesh properly into the character   the production set crew and set up was brilliant   however the drawback finally came down to the script there were many loopholes and unanswered questions that simply didnt make sense   for instance   1i couldnt figure out the purpose of having tim robbins in the movie  that too in the end and then to add to it his death in the hands of tom cruise reminded me of the movie saving private ryan where steven spielberg tried to make it dark and demonic when personifying how war can make good and normal people do evil things   2tom cruises son played by justin chatwin didnt die even though he ran right into a massive explosion  didnt make sense at all and in the end he is at the right place at the right time and bonding with his father  3the alien use the latest technology though they were buried under the earth millions of years ago which confuses me why use outdated technology and also how comes no scientist was able to locate these massive metal structure buried under the earth and if that wasnt bad enough  wonder why the aliens with all their modern humanvaporizing technology couldnt spot tim robbins tom cruise and his kid when they were hiding in the basement  though they were only a few inches away    moment of truth  not a bad movie but not a great one either just good enough for a one time watch     overall rating  5 out of 10    loy machedo  loymachedo dot com  whoisloymachedo dot com
Sep 22 2013,neutral,could of been much more better
Sep 22 2013,positive,this film was chronicled by god or morgan freeman either way with his awesomely fantastic voice narrating what more could you possibly want well theres actually lots of other good things about this movie clearly one of spielbergs best let it be said though that close encounters of the third kind and et the extraterrestrial this is not get ready for a thrillride
Sep 11 2013,positive,a modern and terryfing version of the old classic plus dakota fanning delivers a better performance than tom cruise
Sep 10 2013,neutral,prefer some of the previous attempts  and they were done a long time before with less special effects found cruise to be quite whiny and not at all relatable     if youre looking for an update of h g wells book  dont look here if youre happy with an unrelated alien film look here but i preferred independence day
Sep 9 2013,positive,soooo overdone tom cruise defies death way too easily especially while half the time holding the real star of the movie dakota fanning who outacts everyone the fx start so big and out of sync with the small sections of the world that they occupy its a bit disorienting its like two different movies the acting and the fx until about halfway through
Sep 7 2013,positive,tom cruise at his best
Sep 7 2013,positive,its alright not great not bad just alright
Sep 4 2013,negative,war of the worlds is a movie that gets worse the more i think about it everyone is a cliche archetype and it lacks what makes the book scarily intriguing tom cruise and justin chatwin are horribly miscast and it doesnt help that tom cruise is a good actor the special effects are great and so is the sense of adventure and survival but its all ruined mostly by cliches and a horribly inconsistent tone it ranges from fun to cliche to overly serious all too often either way its not recommendable    410 potential down the drain
Sep 1 2013,positive,though more of a remake of the 1953 film than an adaptation of the novel war of the worlds succeeds in the same way signs does  its focus on its panicky and startlingly realistic characters who run like ants around the monstrous alien menace everything feels genuine even if it ultimately does fail as an adaptation
Sep 1 2013,negative,below average remake
Aug 28 2013,positive,full review coming soon
Aug 28 2013,positive,it was all going so well until the end  perhaps steve crossed his thoughts to munich a little too quickly  astounding special effects and a morethandecent plotline  it terrorises and captivates very well  solid effort
Aug 27 2013,positive,i didnt buy the final twist but otherwise war of the worlds is a fairly solid film
Aug 26 2013,negative,i love action movies
Aug 24 2013,neutral,while the effects are impressive we only see the tripods for 15 minutes in its entire length instead we are left with a pointless and uninterresting family struggle straight from a roland emmerich film pointless visual exposition and wasteful and unneccessary heroism
Aug 18 2013,positive,war of the worlds has action excitement and an undeniable feeling of underlying fear the cast works together very well and cruise is the main driving force spielbergs direction is excellent and the story plays out like an enthralling nightmare war of the worlds is incredibly entertaining
Aug 16 2013,positive,with an overused plot aliens invading earth it is nice to see a good one for a change in war of the worlds
Aug 14 2013,positive,although one of spielbergs weaker films war of the worlds still managed to entertain by being actionpacked and with the help of cruises tense performance
Aug 12 2013,positive,its nearly two hours of tm cruise hiding in a basement the first time i saw it it was really scary but now im not too impressed
Aug 9 2013,positive,great movie with tons of action and thrilling the only thing bad about it is there is little to no backstory on any of the characters and dakota fannings acting is god awful shes more of an annoying child then a scared one
Aug 9 2013,positive,the film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonder
Aug 6 2013,positive,spielbergs war of the worlds is blessed with a keen eye for shot composition atmosphere and a very terrifying portrayal of the infamous invasion on the backdrop of a chilling music score the problem is that it lacks any real interest in the invasion itself in favour of the affect on the human condition not a bad idea just not fleshed out enough despite its recurring issues war of the worlds is a frightening blockbuster worthy of a place on spielbergs filmography of great movies
Aug 5 2013,positive,good movie but dakota fanning was very annoying
Jul 29 2013,positive,a thrilling and somewhat unique take on a rehashed story too bad its almost ruined by spielbergs typical insistence on a happy ending
Jul 29 2013,positive,pretty much a movie about parenting during an alien attack decent performances from tom and dakota good movie well made with styles still copied by action flicks of today
Jul 28 2013,positive,my favorite movie when i was little like 7 to 9 probably at that age because war of the worlds delivers a strong performance by tom cruise tense direction by director steven spielberg and surprising and jaw dropping moments
Jul 20 2013,positive,tom cruise actually does a reasonable job at acting like an emotive and fearful father in this adaptation i appreciated that the end of the aliens remained true to the original  the military is shown to be useless against superior technology this bitchslaps independence day in the face reworking much of that plot into the wells original story respect
Jul 17 2013,positive,one of my favorite movies great story and special effects
Jul 15 2013,positive,it was all good concept but i hate the daughter character she shouts unnecessarily 
Jul 14 2013,positive,why does everyone hate this movie
Jul 12 2013,positive,decently thrilling with a scifi disasteradventure tone along with a sense of paranoia and chaos pretty impressive effects and a not terrible job by tom cruise
Jul 9 2013,positive,if anyone can make an amazing blockbuster it is spielberg and he has proven this once again overall this is a rather good film technically  simply stunning great visual effects sound and cinematography make it a pleasure to watch it is one of the rare blockbusters that are actually decent when it comes to the plot also ironically enough the screenplay is also its weakest point i was especially annoyed with the ending and the happy family crap the demise of the aliens also came a bit too suddenly and spielberg could have made the transition more subtle more intense nonetheless war of the worlds is going to be definitely one of the many blockbusters of spielbergs that is going to be remembered as a good entertaining and thrilling film
Jul 6 2013,negative,sad and depressing movie ashamed to see tom cruise would make act in this movie
Jul 3 2013,positive,review coming soon

Jun 19 2013,positive,a spectacular and unsettling film
Jun 17 2013,positive,waching this movie rigth now by my self poor me jajajajja
Jun 17 2013,neutral,this movie could have been a hell of a lot better spielberg helps to make it spooky as it should be but didnt get creative enough within the story and happenings i mean other than having the understanding of cruises character and his relationship with his kids and family which was setup nicely you dont get much else for an actual story or script  just aliens evaporating the planet   i think spielberg has become a little lazy over the past decade or so with his filmmaking hes become another film maker who is relying more and more on cgi to capture the audience than creating a great story to go with everything else im dissapointed in wow because it could have been great and scary
Jun 16 2013,positive,good overall but i would have done it a bit differently
Jun 14 2013,positive,add a review optional
Jun 9 2013,positive,omgomgomg this movie is righteous

May 22 2013,negative,have always liked this story but have always hated that scientology peddling cretin cruise
May 21 2013,positive,i liked how speilberg twisted this up to make it more modern and more believeable im not generally a tom cruise fan but he did this well as did lil ms fanning i was genuinely scared at times which is hard for movies to do to me these days
May 21 2013,positive,end of the world looks fun

May 9 2013,positive,lets face it  hollywood blockbusters are usually bloated and soulless disappointments we keep going along in the hope that well see something worth seeing well this is one of those rare occasions when our persistence pays off by most rationale judgements war of the worlds is superior entertainment it is also a remarkably faithful adaptation of hg wells novel
May 8 2013,positive,son and i read book together and saw movie

May 1 2013,negative,i really didnt like it
May 1 2013,negative,the war of the worlds is a pioneer alien invation story a lot of movies have being inspired by this story and that is what makes it predictable and cliche i feel like ive already seen a lot of the scenes in other movies only with less action and less heroism

Apr 20 2013,neutral,it was kinda creepy an the kids both drove me nuts  so disrespectful and rude they made my brother and i wanna punch them both just so they would shut up
Apr 18 2013,positive,it would almost be worth throwing your expensive a tv out the window just to shut dakota fanning up    otherwise the movie is pretty well balanced along the way action mystery horror suspense and even a little pride creeps in when the tide turns
Apr 18 2013,positive,i hate disaster movies unless they are done well war of the worlds is
Apr 17 2013,positive,good movie worth seeing and i think did justice to the orgi
Apr 17 2013,positive,great until the cheesy famlily reunion ending
Apr 17 2013,negative,not a patch on the original this is more like a tv movie
Apr 17 2013,positive,loved this film tense gripping with a great family drama binding the sci fi shows steven spielberg at the top of his game
Apr 17 2013,positive,great movie to see in a theatre
Apr 16 2013,positive,not as good as the original but loved this
Apr 15 2013,positive,as a fan of the hg wells book the war of the worlds i have mixed feelings about this movie tom cruise does a reasonable job and like the book it is done from a normal persons perspective rather than from the war against the alien machine perspective but it just doesnt successfully grab you the way it intended the reworking of the battle machines was done quite well and some of the way that the general public react to the crisis i think is done quite realistically and for me is the scariest aspect of the movie it has some successful awe moments and a few suspenseful parts but overall i was left with the feeling of what could of been while i am still hoping for a war of the worlds adaption based in the turn of the last century like the original story  for now this will have to suffice i recommend seeing this film if you havent already done so but purchasing it to add to your dvd collection will have to be decided by the individual viewer
Apr 15 2013,neutral,good film  rubbish ending spoilt it for me
Apr 14 2013,positive,incredible movie and lots of action
Apr 14 2013,positive,wow very good film too bad it didnt have any of the original music

Apr 13 2013,positive,wotw is an invasion movie that lingers in everyones memories it might not be your favorite but theres no way to forget about it
Apr 13 2013,positive,very good special effects
Apr 12 2013,positive,the hg wells classic war of the worlds is remade yet again this time by steven spielberg  unfortunately spielberg brings nothing to the table offering no new insight or perspective on the material  the special effects and battle sequences are amazing but the storytelling is weak and does a poor job at capturing the impact and tragedy of this epic tale of survival  the characters are also poorly written and are rather unsympathetic  dakota fanning manages to deliver a strong performance while tom cruise is serviceable  though the action and special effects are impressive spielbergs war of the worlds is a superficial film with no depth or meaning
Apr 9 2013,positive,beautiful movie so well directed its epic
Apr 9 2013,positive,flawed americanised but a good film in its own right
Apr 9 2013,positive,a harrowing vision of apocalyptic disaster in which humanity is scarier than the alien invaders although they are scary too there are sequences lifted nearly wholesale from other spielberg classics and it gets bogged down in the middle with its episodic structure but tom cruise is great and forms meaningful relationships with the two lead kids nicely played by dakota fanning and justin chatwin tim robbins delivers an intense and memorable performance and there are some powerful visual images particularly the fiery train    yes the ending pushes the sentiment a bit too hard but this is less a problem with the ending than it is with an earlier war zone sequence ambiguity is not part of spielbergs skill set he always shows you exactly what he means in the moment he means it and this was a scene that required a bit of chaos and uncertainty which the director could not properly convey regardless the whole film still works great and two sequences in particular the first appearance of the tripod and its merciless heat ray and a van slowly making its way through an angry mob are among the most heart pounding ive seen in some time
Apr 8 2013,positive,so much potential but tom cruise is an unbearably bad actor and the movie suddenly grinds to a halt at the end and relies on spoken narration too many convenient moments too
Apr 8 2013,positive,not sure if i prefer this or the original great sfx tho
Apr 8 2013,negative,i wasnt too keen on this when i saw it up in oxford altho the fx were good in my opinion tom cruise ruins the whole experince i kept hoping he was gonna get killed lol
Apr 8 2013,positive,it was long and i hated dakota fanning too much screaming
Apr 7 2013,negative,alright movie but sometimes a bit ridiculous like all these people running to nowhere its even funnier when they are on a boat and they start running where are they running who knowsbut the movie does have decent acting and a good cast i just wish there was like a goal we need to get here because of this the movie fails in offering anything but effects and destruction and oh yea lots of running
Apr 7 2013,positive,good movie now i want to see the original
Apr 7 2013,positive,scary and amazing almost as good as the originally
Apr 6 2013,positive,what a thrilling movie definitely tom cruises best role one of the creepiest scifis ever it keeps your heart rate up until the final tripod falls and itll definitely stay in your memory sadly the ending was a liiiitle anticlimactic   92 out of 10
Apr 6 2013,negative,a film with zero redeeming qualities
Apr 6 2013,positive,this movie is very cool and has alot of actionbut id prefer if it were set in the late 1800s like the book
Apr 5 2013,negative,although it features new levels of darkness for spielberg and the special effects are infuriatingly brilliant the whole thing fails to succeed due to a few terrible writing choices who was the idiot who suggested that raining clothing would work every scene featuring the aliens blowing stuff up is horrifying and effective the family drama is forced and awkward to watch
Apr 5 2013,negative,tom cruis is fucking insane but the movie is ok for a remake
Apr 4 2013,negative,tom cruise sucks as does speilberg but some effects are cool
Apr 4 2013,negative,sorry but i cant stand dakota fanning screaming like shes auditioning for a raptor in jurassic park but even if shes tolerable war of the worlds is just a tedious alien invasion movie that doesnt add anything new to this tired subgenre of science fiction oh sure its focused on a dad and two kids which is different but theyre not important characters comparing to what you normally see in alien invasion movies or end of the world movies an army or national guard fighting alien forces    this movie was trying to be deep on life or something like it but its buried underneath with the over use of special effects people acting like idiots the lack of suspense dakota fanning the velociraptor and overall bad writing
Apr 4 2013,positive,depends on which one i guess new ones ok but the old one no way
Apr 3 2013,positive,good movie even tho cruise is in it
Apr 3 2013,positive,one of the greatest alien invasion movies ever made the alien tripods coming from the ground was a fresh and great idea
Apr 3 2013,positive,the best it was amazng
Apr 2 2013,positive,one of spielbergs best
Apr 2 2013,positive,i enjoyed this film immensely  it has superb acting from all actors its packed out with special effects tom cruise plays a part time dad who protects his kids from the doom they are about to discover the world is being taken over by robototic machines who are being functioned by outer space aliens its his job to get them to safety its a gritty thriller but with the sense of syfy genre moments in the film brought tears to my eyes i found all scenes edge of your seat entertainment all round thrilling
Apr 2 2013,neutral,i laughed through the whole thing
Mar 30 2013,positive,have it but didnt watch it yet

Mar 25 2013,positive,ccccccoooooooooooooooooollllll and u will be at the end of ur seat
Mar 24 2013,positive,steven spielbergs gritty and sometimes realistic version of the hg wells scifi novel the whole atmosphere of the film is gloomy but in a good way tom cruise is great alongside dakota fanning who plays a believable role
Mar 24 2013,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies of all time
Mar 23 2013,negative,awfulreplace tom cruise and it couldve had some potential
Mar 23 2013,positive,only saw part of it since my neighbor knocked on the door about 14 of the way through and scared me half to death
Mar 23 2013,positive,very scary i nearly pooed myselfp
Mar 23 2013,positive,tom cruise is in it i like dakotta fanning and justin chatwin thats why i liked it
Mar 22 2013,positive,a thrilling opening two thirds tapers off to a soft conclusion but until then its one of the most dazzling and entertaining alien invasion movies out there
Mar 22 2013,negative,awful movielots of unnecessary gore
Mar 22 2013,positive,underrated remake even with cruise
Mar 22 2013,negative,well paced special effects extravaganza in short another cruise feature film even spielberg couldnt reign in that ego just a shame hgs superior story couldnt be told more faithfully
Mar 21 2013,negative,sucked tom cruise should stick to becoming the master of scientology now
Mar 20 2013,negative,pocket change for tom
Mar 20 2013,negative,not bad it was filled with suspense and i thought the aliens were cool
Mar 19 2013,positive,a frieghtening dark gritty movie to remember
Mar 19 2013,negative,doesnt even deserve what i gave it
Mar 19 2013,negative,spielberg who is at least a competent filmmaker and has even a few times put out some pretty good movies fails miserably here  the casting the dialogue and the plot are reminiscent of the worst michael bay schlock  avoid like the plague
Mar 19 2013,positive,great movie and great actors dakota fanning and tom cruiz you couldnt get a better pair for such a movie they are such opposites which is great for their roles nowi took off half a star becasue of the gross ending but i was glad that the bleams only vaporized the people
Mar 18 2013,neutral,not bad but not good either
Mar 18 2013,negative,half a star because fanning was awesome in this  the rest of them sucked  cruise has no unique talent and speilberg is hollywoods whore
Mar 18 2013,positive,wow aliens get sick and diedint see that one but then again there were no scientology commercials
Mar 18 2013,positive,tom cruise another good one
Mar 17 2013,positive,no robbie not like europe  tom cruise is tolerable he and julia roberts are two of the most overrated actors of our generation  the sound is amazing
Mar 17 2013,positive,a little strange at the start but it was a very good movie i wonder if this movie is what made tom cruise become so eccentric and odd
Mar 16 2013,positive,love this movie they are out there
Mar 15 2013,positive,its good if u watch it the first time
Mar 15 2013,positive,i liked this film the special fx are brilliant and the sets are glorious i found it way better than the george pal original one thing i disliked was tom cruise overacting in a few scenes but he still did well overall a good flick even if spielberg does just play it safe every time
Mar 12 2013,positive,one of tom cruises best
Mar 10 2013,negative,not as good as the original
Mar 9 2013,negative,the 1950s version is so much better

Mar 5 2013,positive,best scifi action movie
Mar 3 2013,negative,it was alright maybe its because i hate dakota fanning
Mar 3 2013,positive,i was a little disappointed the end was very anticlimatic
Mar 2 2013,positive,it was alright movie but tom cruise was garbage in it
Mar 2 2013,positive,better than i thought love the antiselfishhero cruise in this
Mar 2 2013,negative,love the alien loud siren noise and the way jst the clothes of the dead are left to float in the air like ash
Mar 1 2013,positive,good kind of weird
Mar 1 2013,positive,nah that good talking too much dont show that much action
Feb 28 2013,positive,kinda corny and sometimes the aliens are so smart while in other times theyre like ultra stupid
Feb 28 2013,positive,tom cruise ruined it
Feb 28 2013,neutral,not bad pretty good 
Feb 28 2013,positive,scaryi dont knowl
Feb 27 2013,positive,saw this one twice too
Feb 27 2013,positive,spielberg goes dark with the aliens and the results are ok

Feb 25 2013,positive,that was sooooo awesome
Feb 25 2013,positive,pretty weird love it
Feb 24 2013,positive,better than i thought it would be dakota fanning was great and tom cruise didnt overshadow as much as he usually does
Feb 24 2013,positive,one fo the most amaxing films ever read the book its great
Feb 24 2013,positive,i didnt expect to like it even though im a fan of the story and the infamous orson wells radio version but this really scared the crap out of me highly entertaining and a great adaptation
Feb 23 2013,positive,great movie through the end seemed like they just wanted to end it
Feb 22 2013,positive,very realistic looking
Feb 22 2013,positive,i like the way scary movie makes fun of it
Feb 22 2013,positive,great movie to watch once some corny family issues that got in the way of the plot
Feb 22 2013,positive,wotw 05 has its ups and downs  its extremely enjoyable for those who cant find the hokey elements  pros  1  acting  really good  dakota fanning was fantastic  2  suspense  loud noises and heavy doses of suspense are enough to make this a summer blockbuster  3  score  creepy and wellfitting  45    cons  1  there are elements overlooked in the movie  ex a  when cruise and other people are stuck in a cage right under the tripods head and cruise puts a grenade in the tripods head causing the tripod to fall over destroyed how is it that nobody got injured in the fall  thats a tall tripod    ex b  all the electricity is supposed to be sucked into the tripods but a reporters camera still worked  how  2  the ending sucked  its the same ending as the book but it sucked  whether you enjoy this movie or not is your choice
Feb 21 2013,negative,tom cruise cant act spielburgs movies are generally pretty formulaic or at the very least the way his shots come together is so overly choreographed that it jars the whole thing overall its not the best mix a hollywood movie about aliens who invade
Feb 21 2013,positive,if this is the one im thinking i loved this one
Feb 21 2013,positive,good acting and story
Feb 20 2013,positive,intense loved it top 5 alien movie in my book
Feb 20 2013,positive,if its the original  good movie if its the remake what the hell were you thinking
Feb 20 2013,positive,good but a bit stupid
Feb 19 2013,positive,pretty good even though tom cruse is a psycho
Feb 19 2013,positive,great movie it kind of got me scared the best part was that part of it was filmed in newark
Feb 19 2013,positive,the story can be only investing at the start and it has no real climax the impressive cgi acting except fannings and a good moral for unity
Feb 15 2013,positive,a good movie in spite of tom cruise
Feb 14 2013,positive,seen the old one and i thought it was better
Feb 14 2013,positive,a visually stunning and fantastic thrill ride with an atrocious ending
Feb 14 2013,negative,what the heck did you do to this movie tom
Feb 13 2013,positive,its spielberg whats not to like ss loves aliens and his uber budget remake of the likeable original is a visual spectacle to say the least i loved the movie but to be honest i really dont like tom cruise his ego stands in the way of his movies however as  a fun disposable action movie its great for a spielberg film its short the movie clocks in a just over 90 mins but because its short it fells fast paced and that helps the movie for pure brainless entertainment this is one of the best of 2005
Feb 13 2013,negative,it kept me interested but for a tom cruise flick it was pretty bad
Feb 12 2013,positive,i still enjoy tom cruise movies
Feb 11 2013,positive,one of the best scifi movies ive seen in a while but it still wasnt great
Feb 11 2013,positive,great movie but i can do without tom
Feb 11 2013,positive,oh i liked this one
Feb 10 2013,positive,speilberg heads into dark scifi territory again but its a mixed bag tom cruise is miscast as a reluctant father figure doing battle with evil aliens and an increasingly over the top tim robbins the third act will infuriate some
Feb 10 2013,positive,absolutely brilliant  up until the last 20 minutes that is    this film is easily one of the best for pure entertainment in my opinion its nonstop bulletspeed action with likeable characters and literally mindblowing scenes for a large portion of time for the majority of the movie i was thinking about the high possibilities of naming it a spielberg favourite but then the final 20 minutes happened and i have never  ever  been so annoyed at a film in my entire life the film builds upandup but then just throws it all away through an incredibly lazy third act that is so generic and predictable that you just dont want it    at the end of the film i actually yelled why  spielberg messed up a twoact masterpiece
Feb 9 2013,positive,loved it and the oreganal
Feb 8 2013,neutral,dragged some and wasnt particularly interesting
Feb 8 2013,positive,ending could have been done better  but a cool flick
Feb 8 2013,negative,so so bad they need to ban this movie
Feb 7 2013,positive,only cuz i like sifi
Feb 7 2013,negative,original was better
Feb 7 2013,positive,i need to watch every time and a while
Feb 6 2013,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how well it followed the book
Feb 6 2013,negative,i hate tom nowadays heh
Feb 5 2013,negative,sfx were dandy cruise randy sorry had no other ryhme
Feb 5 2013,positive,good movie want to see it again
Feb 5 2013,positive,within a few minutes we see news channels showing the freakish weather and a visualy spectacullar storm in the distance  i cant praise enough the visual detail its such entertainment cinemtatically for all the amazing destruction has to be well put together and we also have some amazing camera angles when the aliens appear from the ground the camera is in amongst the fleaing people then theres a moment of silence with a loud trumpet like sound then the onslaught begins  yes there are some corny aspects such as when ray and the kids head to the car and get there just as the mechaninc walks away and then when they lock the doors as ray tells him he is going to die if he dosent get in he gets vapourized then if that wasnt enough just as they drive away the whole bridge collapses behind them  by now the characters are setablished robbie is a disobidient and forever questioning teen and rachel is a screaming little girl who acts asif she has always had things her way  there is a lot of super zoom shots as the noise gets louder the camera also zooms right up to their face  what i love about the film is how it relates to real life obviously the graphics of the aliens are a bonus but for me ideas are powerful and what a great story the fact that there is machines buried in the earth and the aliens come to destroy us because of our complacacency towards other species and i think is very true  the plot of the film is for ray to take his kids to boston where the mother is but reaching it is not going to be a pic nic asif having a fully working car wasnt enough for them they had a screaming little girl which ray refuses for her to see what is happening around her and a selfish teenager wanting to fight the aliens im sorry but im around the same age as robbie and i woudnt dream of confronting the aliens i would be wanting to escape as far away as possible  as far as acting goes tom cruise is brilliant he ephasises so much emotion and holds the screen so well in second would be the general public because they all act in unity when they was intriged they would hesitantly walk towards the source if they was scared they would all panick  overall the film has you on the edge of your seat most parts of the film and lives up to the spectacular visuals
Feb 5 2013,negative,freaking dakota fanning  i dont think any character ever has annoyed me as much as she does in this movie
Feb 5 2013,neutral,easily the worst film spielberg has ever made  far and away worse than 1941 for me 1941 at least had john belushi  it would appear that steven should stick to nice friendly aliens who mean us no harm  having said this i wanted to hate this flick  i love the original 50s version and the book is just amazing never mind the radio call by orsen welles which is legendary and truly frightening  this movie just didnt need to be made  you want to see spielberg and cruise together you rent minority report  you want aliens killing the planet take your pick personally v with all its thinly veiled nazi references would be my pick  this is not amazing for any reason save maybe the cg stuff in the background  and tim robbins makes a good crazy guy
Feb 4 2013,positive,quite scary but the science fiction takes out the realism of it good movie
Feb 4 2013,positive,thought it would be crap but genuinely suprised
Feb 4 2013,positive,crazy dude with the axe was the best
Feb 4 2013,positive,great specticle respectable performance from cruise surprisingly but it is really a series of set pieces but very good ones anticlimax end i know its like the book but nothing else is in the film
Feb 3 2013,positive,director steven spielbergs take on hg wells novel war of the worlds is a dark and realistic film that convinces that this is what it could be like if we were indeed invaded by extraterrestrials this film is akin to a horror film in which the movie features several horrific moments that echoes 911 and the holocaust and people going beyond desperation like an event witnessed from a diner while dakota fannings performance seems to relegated to looking scared and screaming tom cruise delivers an effective performance as he is playing a more human role compared to the action and charismatic roles he has played now and in the past he is flawed human being who is not a good father but as the movie progresses he becomes a man who is willing to do anythingsometimes murder to protect his famiy the special effects and the designs of the war machines from the walking gait to the heat ray as the martians weaponofchoice is quite impressive the movie is far from perfect as it has a weak final act that includes the first appearance of the aliens badly designed and unimaginative and cruise fighting a tripod
Feb 2 2013,positive,this was so so close to becoming another spielberg masterpiece all the acting is great in this film particularly dakota fanning and tom cruise i never got annoyed by them like some people during the destruction scenes but then again i loved cloverfield so take that for what you will the first half of this film  is just mindblowingly breathtakingly amazing it really captures the feel of a sudden invasion and all the paranoia and destruction surround it no joke this first half literally contains some of the best movie moments ive seen in forever and i got chills sent down my spine everytime i heard the low baritone call of the tripods but then there comes the last 45 or so minutes of the movie and instead of heightening these stakes and providing a satisfying conclusion it falls back on conventionality cliches and gimmicks weve seen all before i can see how you would like the ending considering spoiler how toms character gets rewarded unexpectedly for his courage and bravery end spoiler but it just feels all clicheridden and for lack of a better description a cop out and i left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth which is unfortunate really because this movie was so close to becoming another excellent film from steven spielberg
Feb 2 2013,positive,great actionsmoviealso touching momentslovable
Feb 1 2013,positive,different movies than any other
Feb 1 2013,negative,its a terrible movie our hero spends most of the movie hiding in basements
Feb 1 2013,negative,i dont think the facebook servers are large enough for me to detail exactly how shite this film was ill continue to seeth and will forever regret the fact that i spent â5 going to watch this utter cack
Jan 31 2013,neutral,its tom cruise run
Jan 30 2013,positive,reasonably accurate
Jan 30 2013,neutral,didnt even come close to living up to the hype
Jan 30 2013,positive,i really liked parts of it the basement scene at least until the shovel scene bored the fuck out of me though and there were some other scenes i didnt really care for
Jan 30 2013,negative,so sucked what the fuck was with toms character he didnt even want to care for his kids all he wanted to do was get them to there mother
Jan 29 2013,positive,not to good of a movie
Jan 27 2013,positive,best end of the world movie ever this is the one of only movie that i believe the critics over the audience       been a long time since ive seen this and wrote this review but this films still hold up i love it and its spielberg most underrated film from cruises acting to the terrifying imagery 2005 wotw is the king
Jan 27 2013,positive,the rare film that improves upon its literary source material spielberg remains astonishingly and satisfyingly faithful to the overarching concepts the martians the futility of mans defense the extermination the heat ray the bleak warnings against human pride while improving and adding the sorely lacking human element of the story the result is a wellcrafted tale where a self obsessed man discovers what it truly means to father and love his children only when his world literally crumbles around him remarkably underrated
Jan 27 2013,negative,original was way better
Jan 27 2013,positive,surprised me positively great story and 3dimensional characters steven spielberg managed to make the characters remain 3dimensinal when there also was a lot of big cgimonsters ravaging evryone and everything still a pretty silly idea made surprisingly badass tom cruise also convinced me that he can do a fine job with this film
Jan 25 2013,positive,with great visual effects and spielberg clever direction this is a very entertaining blockbuster film
Jan 25 2013,positive,wow the graphics were amazing and really believable
Jan 24 2013,neutral,255   though it has some thrilling chase scenes and atmosphere war of the worlds doesnt quite sell for spielbergs lack of energy
Jan 23 2013,positive,i liked it but it had tom cruse int it dont get me wrong i like tom cruse a little but he is kind of a 
Jan 23 2013,positive,it was ok for a horror movie
Jan 22 2013,positive,best part was watching the jersey turnpike die
Jan 22 2013,positive,you know i love this movie the effects are awesome and the acting is genuine and its not about aliens which is shocking i know the only negative is that in a home viewing you lose the sound effects the tripods make but in the theatre this movie was the first film to really terrify me and despite its flawed ending kid should have died it proves that it wasnt about aliens at all
Jan 22 2013,positive,interesting angle on the classic alien invasion story  spielberg took the human drama angle and it worked  luckily
Jan 22 2013,positive,okay better than what the whiner babies will have you believe but pales in comparison to the original now the original dubbed by morgan freeman thats cause for celebration
Jan 22 2013,positive,wish i could see it again  dammm it

Jan 16 2013,positive,steven spielbergs adaptation of war of the worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of hg wells classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences

Jan 13 2013,negative,tom cruise is an ass
Jan 13 2013,negative,jeff wayne should sue them 
Jan 12 2013,positive,spielbergs attempt at remaking a classic is resulted in a mixed bag of writing and direction the performances are fantastic cruise is brilliant and works well with the script his struggles and dynamics with both his children is felt well throughout fanning acts way above her age and puts chatwin to shame in a few sequences with the latter poorly written and his character direction is incredibly poor the cgi has aged in places with truly subpar effects and looks utterly ridiculous and the ending is typical spielberg with everyone and everything coming together for the better
Jan 11 2013,positive,good special effects but lame storyendind
Jan 11 2013,positive,ok fx  not great on any level
Jan 10 2013,positive,there out there all round us
Jan 7 2013,neutral,this movie is soo odd for me i watch the first half all the way until the celler act then skip to when ray and rachel leave then i finish it tim robbins is good as a man who lost it all and snapsthe drag is too long and not equal to the action
Jan 7 2013,positive,a very good film makes you jump once or twice
Jan 7 2013,positive,great start shit end seems like they got bored
Jan 7 2013,positive,nainvade ng aliens ang earth
Jan 7 2013,negative,43  war of the worlds was a huge disappointment thanks to its completely useless climax i normally like tom cruise movies but this the cgi was cool so was spielberg direction i think this film is just like signs and happening where these aliens and disasters come and disappear just like nothing there is no cause to why it came and to why it died out
Jan 6 2013,positive,a successful take on a modern form of hg wells novel its a good read i recommend the book and this film adaptation

Dec 29 2012,positive,amazing absolutely love it 
Dec 29 2012,positive,i think this movie is awesome  i cant even justify why im not a big fan of tom cruise steven spielberg aliens or even ottblockbusters but this movie was such a fun ride huge intense action on a mental scale combined with an eerie scifi vibe i love how this film had no stereotypical savetheworldhero it was mother nature we have to thank which is what a lot of people think is corny  ruined the film but i thought it was excellent  when you think about it  actually makes a shtload of sense
Dec 29 2012,positive,original is much better
Dec 29 2012,positive,actually an ok movie aside from the sheer cast of insane liberals  and dakota fannings non stop yelling
Dec 28 2012,negative,wasnt horrible but wasnt overly impressive either
Dec 28 2012,negative,not what i was expecting updating the story has problems were more savvy now than when the idea first came out to balance that they give us a loser of a lead character and show him slowly becoming a hero sorta the punchline is that mom is base and they are all safe when they finally reach her a sad and completely different commentary about american society than the original author intended which was that we take for granted the smallest things in life
Dec 28 2012,positive,pretty good eventhough  tom cruise was in it   lol
Dec 28 2012,negative,typical american endingthey know how kill a filmwankers

Dec 27 2012,positive,my favorite film is thisquality
Dec 26 2012,positive,its really cool all the drama and the aliens and the destruction but i hate the end
Dec 26 2012,positive,very suspenseful and entertaining film but not without its flaws some of the dialogue sounds thrown together and cheesy the ending is rather ridiculous and can be seen as a cop out but the areas where this film lacks is made up for by its strengths the basement scene with tim robbins easily one of the best characters in the film is particularly good and very very tense classic spielberg spielberg does a great job of portraying the aliens as dominant overbearing and completely terrifying enemies to the human race the portrayal of human conflict and emotion in the face of extinction is well done good film overall but not great recommend
Dec 26 2012,positive,good remake spielberg does it all the time
Dec 26 2012,negative,not tom cs best movieor anyone else for that matter haha
Dec 26 2012,positive,this would have received a full 5 stars if it wasnt for that bs feelgood ending

Dec 25 2012,positive,yeah it was really good but the ending was a lil weird
Dec 24 2012,positive,long but well thought out played out well
Dec 24 2012,neutral,the special effects took over the movie and the plot was fairly well done but the reason this movie sinks is that there are no memorable moments in the film and is almost nothing like the classic story it came from
Dec 24 2012,neutral,i didnt like this one that much not one of tom cruises better movies
Dec 23 2012,positive,the ending was stupid

Dec 22 2012,negative,the soldiers at the end are real 10th mtn soldiers from ft drum

Dec 14 2012,positive,ok but when will they make a period war of the worlds
Dec 14 2012,positive,tense  gripping dakota fanning  tom cruise did a fine job i just dont understand why this movie is so grossly underrated by audience
Dec 13 2012,positive,its scary the first time u see it but then itgets better every time u watch it
Dec 13 2012,negative,tim robbins plays a child molestor on the movie
Dec 13 2012,positive,this was an excellent movie  i watched this twice and it had me at the edge of my seat both times  the swearing didnt really need to be included though  it was so scary for me mainly because i always watched it at night when it was terribly windy outside  and every noise i heard made me jump  it didnt help that my sister watched it with me and scares me all the time  tom cruises acting was amazing and when he cried i did  i love this movie  yet i hate it for scaring me  eh

Dec 12 2012,positive,started out good disney ending thanks steven
Dec 12 2012,positive,the horrifying power in the beginning and cruises performance throughout is what made this film a 4 star for me one scene in particular where cruises character ray uncomfortable in his own skin when it comes to being a responsible father has sought refuge in his ex wifes house with his kids hes desperately trying to return to order and keep his kids calm by making his daughter a peanut butter sandwich in spite of being horrified and confused while outside explosions chaos and pending doom surrounds the house definitely one of my favorite scenes in any movie

Dec 1 2012,positive,awesome effects     its  wow   moviebut it did not need tom der
Nov 30 2012,positive,img     wow if there is one director who can deliver an epic scale popcorn movie its spielberg i think he is consistently at his best when hes delivering us these massive overwhelming blockbusters that genuinely display his intricate skill for the camerawork lighting and atmospherics simply the best of hollywood film making i believe his adaptation of hg wells deeply profound novel is one of the most under rated films of the 2000s i dont really need to point out that this version changes a lot from its source material but i think that war is a partly unfilmable book in my opinion the real genius in what made the book work in literal terms cannot be faithfully replicated onto the screen theres a whole lot of underlying politics in the paranoid obsessive book but theres an incredible amount of awe inspiring spectacle that touches your imagination too in the film theres a lot of the monumentally captivating flare and a little bit of the deeper meanings the thing thats made fans of the novel rant on how much they hate this film is the change in setting among countless other things for film fans its dismissed for the apparant cop out ending but thats how its supposed to end for cinema that ending for a lot of people doesnt work but the focus on action doesnt work for hardcore fanatics of the source now personally i saw some real darkness in that ending resultingly spielberg delivered a solid action packed light hearted popcorn flick but also stayed faithful to the novel in some fashion he successfully positioned this disaster epic on the fine line of appreciating the complexities of the novel but also gave us a return to sci fi horror b movie form for that hats off to him and his writers terrfying aliens an under stated performance by lead tom cruise who is as engaging as ever a good script its cut to the chase easy well polished fun putting the annoying hollywood cliches and moments of poor storytelling aside i am a proud fan of the new war of the worlds
Nov 30 2012,positive,thrilling and captivating just wish they remained more loyal to the actual book
Nov 29 2012,negative,i expected more out this one
Nov 29 2012,positive,92perfect visual effectsawesome cast and directing from spielberg

Nov 26 2012,negative,bahtom cruise is nutso
Nov 25 2012,negative,expected so much more tom cruise was out acted by a 12 yr old great
Nov 25 2012,positive,leaves alot to the imagination but very enjoyable and well shot what do you expect with spielberg
Nov 25 2012,positive,not bad pretty good
Nov 24 2012,positive,still cant get the sound out of my head
Nov 24 2012,positive,great movie that is also weird to think about the world being taken over by aliens or something
Nov 24 2012,positive,i liked itbut the first time i saw it i didnt get why the aliens diedunitl someone told me
Nov 23 2012,neutral,its alright its not bad
Nov 23 2012,positive,cruise is still a knob though
Nov 23 2012,positive,like ive said in the past i like to read the book before watching a film adaptation and watch the original film before watching a remake but hey my college tutor waits for no man as this was useful for one of our units but maybe i should stop that way of thinking because this film is awesome     the film starts off pretty good at establishing the characters and i thought the alien invasion happened quite quickly the film had a good pace but slows down for good suspenseful moments and overall i think it was crafted very well the direction by spielberg is amazing he has done an excellent job here and i was solidly engaged in what was going on and its bereft of clichés besides one but this ends his alien trilogy as some call it with a dark turn after taking the time to look at all of the extras on the dvd they really did go out of their way to make sure not to make mistakes when it comes to clichés and it shows tom cruise also says you cant handle the truth and that was pretty funny i wouldnt have expected spielberg to do something like this and i know hes made alien invasion films before but this is really dark and it just surprised me much like the cast tom cruise as well as everyone else now that i think about it certainly does seem like an odd choice but saying that he did an excellent job but it is tom cruise when has he not done an excellent job and they explain why they cast him and it makes sense tim robbins was also a strange choice but played his character excellently as usual everyone else does a good job but these two are really the main ones to talk about and ill get onto some other characters later there is also a pretty awesome reveal at the end with the two lead actors from the original     this film has an excellent tone and the tripods are honestly quite terrifying their design was intimidating and the noise they make is always something that gets to me they never scared me or anything but for something thats supposed to be threatening the filmmakers accomplish it excellently i know this game wasnt released until many years later but these aliens and their sound effects reminded me a lot of journey maybe they got some inspiration from this film speaking of games the front cover as well as some of its themes and events reminds me of the last of us too they honestly kind of annoyed me too i always seem to get annoyed when aliens come out of nowhere and start killing everyone but hey thats just me and i know there is a deeper theme to it all but just on a basic level it annoys me the visual effects for this film are excellent and some of the imagery in this film is absolutely amazing after all these years they still stand out the soundtrack is perfect and has such a powerful sense of dread the cinematography was a little odd though it seems to have this grainy filter over it the whole time but besides that everything at the start at least looks really shiny i dont know if it had to be that way because of what the effects were going to look like later but its strange the film also has some light comedy moments that fit really well     whilst watching the film i was pleased that i had no idea where it was going and that i had seen no clichés all except for one the family issue plot point is really over played and really annoying like really its the end of the world and youre still arguing about things that do not even matter at a time like this you dont just run off because he was never around and he was working and i dont care how distant you are from someone when a situation like this happens you stick with together as a group you dont wander off alone the children characters are annoying justin chatwin does a good job but his character doesnt really make a lot of sense and something happens right at the end that really doesnt make sense but he calls him dad and that shows the character growth but that scene was strange dakota fanning does what she always does or at least at that age and plays characters that dont act her age at all she goes from being that child that talks like an adult to screaming her lungs off every five seconds shes an excellent actress but its just her dialogue and it got too much after a while     i turned to a friend of mine and said something about wondering how something like this can end satisfyingly and within 5 minutes it had ended and it really felt odd i understand that was the ending of the book and i understand what the ending means but like ive said things that work in one medium dont always work in another he joked about how this movie went from a 7 right to a 2 or 3 and while i didnt hate it to that extremity it does explain why the audience reviews are so low i always did question why the audience score just kept going down but it makes sense now or maybe there is something else i am missing but it really does wrap up too quickly it feels like an episode of star trek voyager where everything gets resolved hastily in the last 5 minutes with a deus ex machina and it just abruptly ends the ending of the book at least had a build up to it here it felt like he was rushing to meet a deadline i understood the ending and the theme it was trying to convey like i said but even so it happens quite fast and looking back on it i think it works this way i was just looking blank at the credits and wondering what just happened however after it all wrapped up and i went away to think about it it all fell into place it could be compared to signs because of the nature of ending but this story was written way before that film was the odd narration by morgan freeman was an interesting choice but it was again a little odd    it has its plot issues more than what ive mentioned but it never took me out of the experience and the ending really didnt bother me or again ruin the experience even if like i have said the book ending has more of a build up than it does here but its an excellent conversation starter its a tense entertaining and dark film that really felt like something new ive said the words odd and excellent many times but its just a fascinating film to me and i originally said that i would go back to watch it again in the near future but i actually went back to watch it again the day after he showed us and i cant remember the last time i did that or even want to do that and that made my rating go from 4 to 5 the original story is excellent and way beyond its years and this is a remake that actually has a reason to exist not only are the technical advancements greater because of how long it has been since the original and a lot can be done with them but it shows the story and its themes in a modern light and its just a really good invasion film with complex characters and smart themes the likes of which havent been seen a long time im glad i saw it because who knows how long it would have been until i saw it otherwise and its another film off of the list
Nov 23 2012,negative,some cool sfx but not enough to make up for tom disapointed really
Nov 23 2012,positive,deriving most of its power from its magical source material spielbergs adaptation of hg wellss classic novel is both emotionally affecting and visually arresting with a strong cast to match
Nov 23 2012,positive,tom cruise is believable and enjoyable to watch dakota fanning and justin chatwin are too annoying to care about if only hailee steinfeld and logan lerman were an option
Nov 22 2012,positive,when it comes right down to it we really didnt need a war of the worlds but tom cruise is good and the movie gets pretty intense and suspenseful when spielberg is trying to make crap edible he does a better job than when he tries to make gold out of well gold
Nov 19 2012,positive,another great tom cruse movie
Nov 19 2012,positive,brilliant despite the tom cruise thing lol
Nov 19 2012,positive,the role was just perfect for tom cruise
Nov 19 2012,negative,no matter how cool those alien robots look war of the worlds is still a muddled boring alien invasion tale

Nov 11 2012,positive,this was a really good movie it really did a good job with the storyline and everything very creepy at times
Nov 10 2012,positive,i expected more but it was entertaining
Nov 10 2012,positive,a prolific cast stunning special effects and unearthly sound design deliver war of the worlds into a strong summer blockbuster even if when you break it all down its just another invasion movie
Nov 10 2012,positive,even if not at times impeccably plausible war of the worlds is still a tense and wellpaced film
Nov 9 2012,neutral,i never really felt a connection with any aspect of this at any moment aliens didnt scare me action didnt thrilled me jesus i wonder what went wrong
Nov 8 2012,positive,it was good that boy in there was cute
Nov 8 2012,positive,well done very enjoyable
Nov 8 2012,positive,inconsistent effects and weak social commentary get in the way of some great invasion setpieces not bad but could have been much better

Nov 6 2012,negative,tom cruise sucks and so does this movie
Nov 6 2012,positive,i know its not great but purely for the fact there was a blackout during the first time i watched this i kinda like it that was weird
Nov 5 2012,neutral,its good up until the end i feel like spielberg was just like eh im bored
Nov 5 2012,positive,war of the worlds is a visionary and pacy thriller it fails to raise questions on the issue and does not try to mediate any emotional reckoning after but it is still a pleasing picture
Nov 4 2012,positive,liked it but liked more the original although this movie was more action
Nov 4 2012,positive,i love this movie i love alien movies i couldnt sleep with my door closed for a while plus big thunderstorms freaked me out
Nov 4 2012,positive,and im being generous only because the mighty 10th mtn is in it

Oct 29 2012,negative,a big let down got org sound track much better
Oct 26 2012,positive,good movie even if tom cruise is in it
Oct 26 2012,positive,material wise a down grade from the novel execution still spielberg in top game  though the origin of the aliens is nonsensical their arrival was suspenseful  america or the uk 19th or 21st century the portrayal of masses was entirely beliveable  even though the story was tied down to just the family i didnt like there were still splendid moments of visceral destruction and spinetingling suspense littered through out to keep you interested
Oct 26 2012,positive,this movie was scary as hell
Oct 26 2012,positive,the ending could b much btr
Oct 23 2012,negative,they needed to spend some more money on lighting too dark and was kinda slow moving
Oct 23 2012,positive,an interesting film certainly not among the rarefied elite of spielbergs best but entertaining and never less than watchable cruise and fanning give understated and believable performances as a father and daughter caught up in the chaos of alien invasion
Oct 23 2012,neutral,i was dissapointed in this
Oct 23 2012,positive,very intense and great

Oct 2 2012,positive,alright movie even though i hate tom cruise
Oct 2 2012,positive,freaked me out a lil bit
Oct 2 2012,positive,it captures the utter terror one would feel during a real invasion better than anyone it is a tense and brilliant scifi movie well deserving of its place in spielbergs scifi trilogy
Oct 1 2012,positive,dakota fannings character was a bit annoying was that just good acting
Oct 1 2012,positive,enjoyable but kind of stupid and with a disappointing ending also i had the impression that the little girl was acting better than tom cruise tim robbins steals the show
Oct 1 2012,neutral,after trying to ignore that tom cruise was in this movie i kinda enjoyed it
Sep 30 2012,positive,love this moviedakota is so cute
Sep 30 2012,positive,sweet movie stuff blows up stupid people die and big huge killer alien robots what could be better
Sep 30 2012,positive,it was good but it ended abruptly
Sep 30 2012,positive,contrary to spielbergs customary treatment of aliens the extraterrestrial beings in war of the worlds are not friendly  in fact theyre downright terrifying  know what youre getting into before turning on war of the worlds this is not the fun lightweight summer blockbuster you may be expecting  this is in fact very dark very bleak and very grim  but nonetheless war of the worlds in spite of many problems is a mustsee    ray ferrier and his two kids robbie and rachel dont get along very well  ray is divorced and he rarely sees his kids so when hes placed in charge of them for a few days things are difficult  but that all seems so slight when strange things begin happening  and then the aliens come    who would have thought that an alieninvasion film could be so affecting  war of the worlds is an intense thrilling and often very frightening experience but it still has a brain      the aliens are horrifying  though for the most part we only see their tripods large walking and flying machines from space their presence is still immensely terrifying  to be completely honest i wasnt frightened at all when we get the first full look at the tripods  the buildup got me on the tense but the reveal was surprisingly unspectacular  but once people start getting vaporized war of the worlds becomes a shocking and suspenseful cinematic disaster film  it gets even more intense when we see whats actually happening to the individuals that get collected    but who needs aliens  there are many points when desperate humans seems to have even less humanity than the aliens  it is exceedingly rare to see an act of goodwill performed by a human in this movie  many of the people in war of the worlds are savage and violent  though ordinary people dont contribute to the extremely high death count nearly as much as the aliens the murders authored by humans feel even more brutal    indeed brutal is a key word here because that was one of the main words flashing in my head throughout the entire film  war of the worlds is a brutal film  its far more gritty and intense than most popcorn movies would dare to go  i actually struggle with using the term popcorn movie to describe this film just because its hardly fits this description  war of the worlds is remarkably thoughtprovoking and uses its brain far more than most action films today    the special effects are stunning  there are some visuals in this film that literally caused my jaw to drop  i cant elaborate much more than that without spoilers but i can say that this is a gorgeous film    there are some problems with this film one of the biggest issues are the characters themselves  robbie and rachel are incredibly obnoxious and bratty  and while robbie seems to become at least slightly more likable as the film goes on rachel is an annoyance from start to finish  ray the protagonist is unlikable by traditional movie standards but among the cast here the audience tends to sympathize with him a bit    i do believe that the two children and ray are supposed to come off as slightly obnoxious at the beginning of the movie but their attitudes are so unbearable at times it sort of takes me out of the movie a bit  thankfully the action gets intense soon enough that this issue doesnt spoil the movie though it does annoy me    my other major problem is with the ending  its not inherently bad but its a tad unsatisfying  theres a bit of deus ex machina and an overly triumphant finish that clashes with the incredibly dark and horrifying events that preceded the ending  the ending is really the only thing that reminded me that i was watching a summer blockbuster    the acting is a mixed bag  tom cruise as ray ferrier is solid his razzie nomination for this performance baffles me and justin chatwin as robbie is good enough  dakota fanning as rachel is incredibly bratty whether this is because of the acting or the character itself is up for debate  there are some interesting side characters as well that are given solid performances and you cant go wrong with morgan freeman narrating he speaks at the very beginning and the very end    john williams score is mostly atmospheric with a couple solid bits of action music  theres an especially good piano piece at the end  for the most part i doubt this score will be very interesting taken away from the film but when put next to the picture the movie is greatly enhanced    while war of the worlds does have some problems its a gripping brutal and thoughtprovoking rush  its surprisingly hardtowatch at times but this film is all the better for it  war of the worlds is not only a very good film its an important one  and an unforgettable one
Sep 29 2012,positive,dazzling special effects and wonderfully committed performances from its cast make this science fiction film a hit
Sep 28 2012,negative,i hve seen it once and i would not watch it agian
Sep 28 2012,positive,okay for an action movie
Sep 27 2012,positive,i like tom cruise  i liked his realistic portrayal of a guy having the worst day of his life
Sep 26 2012,neutral,a good one time watch i enjoyed it but its not the type you would want to watch over and over
Sep 26 2012,positive,cgi was amazing a great steven speilberg film
Sep 26 2012,negative,not the best roll for tom
Sep 25 2012,positive,intruiging but couldve been better check out jeff waynes musical version of the war of the worlds
Sep 24 2012,negative,didnt expect the ending to be that blunt
Sep 24 2012,positive,very well made just not my cup of tea
Sep 23 2012,negative,ok you cant really replace the origonal this was disturbing to me did we ask for a remake
Sep 23 2012,positive,it took one person to pull the trigger to bring down the alien vessel  why couldnt anyone else thought along the same lines
Sep 23 2012,positive,this war of the worlds remake is darker scarier but also less likeable than the previous 1953 version
Sep 23 2012,negative,one of steven spielbergs worst movies tom cruise just looks so out of place in this movie and both kids are very irritating though i feel its really the scripts fault for that
Sep 23 2012,negative,this movie is a disgrace both to scifi and the original hg wells novel
Sep 22 2012,positive,this movie was one of toms best movies
Sep 21 2012,positive,i liked that one alot me and my dad went to c it
Sep 21 2012,positive,loved the old one  the remake was not as good
Sep 21 2012,positive,ive read the book and its not that close to it but it is pretty good tom cruise is actually ok for once and the alienhorror works well

Sep 17 2012,positive,i liked it  the special effects were definitely worth while
Sep 17 2012,negative,not bad but didnt understand the ending as the revelation to solving bringing down these monsters was said during a very noisey scene so couldnt hear itlol
Sep 16 2012,positive,good movie over all has ask of the good movie necessities
Sep 16 2012,positive,from the moment the invaders arrived breathed our air ate and drank they were doomed they were undone destroyed after all of mans weapons and devices had failed by the tiniest creatures that god in his wisdom put upon this earth by the toll of a billion deaths man had earned his immunity his right to survive among this planets infinite organisms and that right is ours against all challenges for neither do men live nor die in vain
Sep 16 2012,negative,kind of a weird movie
Sep 16 2012,positive,justin chatwin  was so hawt it was great
Sep 16 2012,positive,ok apart from the girl who wont stop screaming
Sep 16 2012,positive,this is a terrific movie that successfully relays an alien invasion on a massive scale yet keeps it personal by following the horrors experienced by a single family there have been more likeable families portrayed in the movies but cruise and company manage to make you care about the terrible things happening around them  this is an intense ninety minutes there really isnt any gore but the aliens are so merciless in their attack that things get very disturbing the fact that they are using humans as fertilizer to grow their own planet makes the aliens really scary this isnt a plotting and planning alien race its a force that needs an ingredient for dinner  people are running everywhere they are fighting amongst themselves there is no doubt that this is an accurate portrayal of what would occur under such terrifying circumstances even when offered a helping hand by tim robbinss character cruise is ultimately faced with a pyschopath its just one more excruciating challenge for him to deal with in a movie filled with plenty of them   the alien tripods are incredibly ominous the way that they step over the landscape is nothing short of horrible you talk about hellonearth i cant think of a more terrible situation to be in in short this is a scary spielberg its not the same thing as his jurassic park style frights this is a spielberg horror movie  unfortunately he cant resist tacking on a warm and fuzzy ending he chooses to focus on the bright happy reunion of a family after he just laid waste to much of the human race some reflection on the scale of what has just occurred is warranted instead we get hugs and kisses its the reason the movie falls from excellent to just very good for me
Sep 15 2012,positive,i know ive seen thisbut i cant remember if i liked it or notwhich i guess says it all really
Sep 15 2012,positive,it was good but i thought the original was better
Sep 15 2012,positive,soooooo good a little bazzar but good

Sep 12 2012,neutral,i think they could of found someone better than tom cruise
Sep 12 2012,positive,a very very well made film even tom cruise shines in this film and i thought he acted superbly here dakota fanning was amazing as usual she is so capable of performing well tim robbins was a strange one but not bad justin chatwin was very well cast as well as the son im pretty sure steven spielberg does it again
Sep 11 2012,positive,saw this with jenny and eric before they were married and jenny screamed and jumped through out the whole movie it was hillarious
Sep 10 2012,positive,just an all around good movie
Sep 10 2012,positive,tom cruise stars in one of the greatest movies ever made
Sep 9 2012,positive,oh man great job on most of the movie good sci fi flick but the book was so much better
Sep 9 2012,positive,this vision of hg wells masterpiece could have been more loyal to the novel the main problem is that it should have  the suspenseful and gutwrenching events set in london instead the story has been altered into a some scare all action american movie however spielbergs vision still maintains some major moments from the novel this doesnt stop war of the worlds from having superb visuals and acting especially from tim robbins
Sep 8 2012,positive,i liked some parts of this movie but then other parts were just too ridiculous but the good parts slightly outweighed the bad so grade c
Sep 8 2012,positive,love cruise and fanning and this was a fast paced movie that kept my attention
Sep 8 2012,negative,too boringtoo clumsytoo predictabletoo everything

Sep 6 2012,positive,i want this to happen
Sep 6 2012,positive,great special effects compliment a soso story
Sep 6 2012,positive,wotw 05 has its ups and downs  its extremely enjoyable for those who cant find the hokey elements  pros  1  acting  really good  dakota fanning was fantastic  2  suspense  loud noises and heavy doses of suspense are enough to make this a summer blockbuster  3  score  creepy and wellfitting  45    cons  1  there are elements overlooked in the movie  ex a  when cruise and other people are stuck in a cage right under the tripods head and cruise puts a grenade in the tripods head causing the tripod to fall over destroyed how is it that nobody got injured in the fall  thats a tall tripod    ex b  all the electricity is supposed to be sucked into the tripods but a reporters camera still worked  how  2  the ending sucked  its the same ending as the book but it sucked  whether you enjoy this movie or not is your choice
Sep 4 2012,positive,love it watch it everytime
Sep 4 2012,positive,nice angle but needed more on the aliens
Sep 4 2012,positive,this film is underrated it boasts fantastic cinematography and great lighting as well as spectacular set pieces although the acting is occasionally dry this is a great scifi movie that doesnt get enough credit
Sep 4 2012,positive,not what i thought it was gunna be but it was good n e ways
Sep 4 2012,negative,why the original was so much better i can believe that it was the perfect film for a post 911 america harking back to the cold war and the commie threat i dont doubt audiences lapped it up    watching this was simply consuming another product tc as a blue collar joe was just laughable dakota fanning was picked for her ability to scream on cue i ended up hoping the aliens would win
Sep 4 2012,negative,not as good as the previews made it sound
Sep 4 2012,neutral,oh heavens what a waste of time and money i truly think they could have made a better film on a lesser budget and a little more imagination yes visually it was fantastically flawless but incredibly dull
Sep 3 2012,positive,this was well made and i loved every second
Sep 3 2012,positive,it was better then the 1st one
Sep 3 2012,positive,overall good movie but it wasnt near as good as i expected or hoped for
Sep 2 2012,positive,another classic spielberg movie
Sep 2 2012,positive,not as good as the original and im not a fan of tom cruise
Sep 2 2012,positive,that scene close to the beginning where all of the electronics were fried and that guy was video taping the aliens killed the movie for me
Sep 2 2012,negative,tom cruise cannot play a man he just cant
Sep 2 2012,positive,i liked this a lot i think it is a genuinely kind of scary movie  when i first saw it in theaters i sat there in my seat clutching the cup holders as the people were zapped into dust  it was so real and the music didnt play the scene up or down it was just these people are being zapped into dust and it is happening right in front of you  i reccomend it very much
Sep 1 2012,positive,dakota and the aliens were dope they shouldve killed tom cruise really
Sep 1 2012,positive,dakota fanning and tom cruise are both good actors it was a great movie
Aug 31 2012,positive,cool but kinda boring
Aug 31 2012,positive,a very cool movie my idea of a good scifi movie
Aug 31 2012,neutral,one of the best directors of our time collaborates with the biggest freak of our time  and the aliens are suseptible to getting a cold   why    why the humanity      why didnt these aliens just send an email to the signs aliens about the water   
Aug 31 2012,positive,surprisingly true to wells something i personally appreciated spielberg did very well keeping the enemy menacing without relying too much on visual it was pretty good not too much else to say other than that
Aug 30 2012,positive,great effects great supporting cast  tom cruise turned in a typically predictable performance as a deadbeat dad turned well not exactly hero actually any potential show of tenderness for his children was pretty much thrown out due to his inability to make it believable     the story on its own is pretty good not great but pretty good the resemblance to hg wells classic novel of alien invasion is very limited in scope if not concept the fact that the only actual character used from the original story ogilvy played by tim robbins existed in name only and had nothing to do character from the novel     that being said however the spectacular special effects and directing wizardry of stephen spielberg it makes for a fun and thrilling 2 hours the machines were memorably frightening and just the sound of them alone was something that haunted me for  a long time afterwards  about the only thing that this had in common with wells novel was the portrayal of the aliens  both in and outside of their robotic machines they effectively conveyed a very human sense of brutality in other words the movie very effectively demonstrated the aliens efficiently exterminating the human pests on the earths surface much in the way we would destroy an ant hill     i rated this movie as highly as i did because     1 it was a very fun film with some really thrilling moments     2 the primal fear it evoked was pretty instense it did effectively demonstrate just how vulnerable of a race and planet we really are
Aug 29 2012,negative,kinda dumb but ive watched it more than once so
Aug 27 2012,negative,cruise is good as always but after the initial attack it just gets less and less interesting
Aug 26 2012,positive,not bad but then again watched it under bad cercumstances
Aug 26 2012,positive,stephen spielberg yea tom cruize yeesh no comment
Aug 26 2012,positive,im not a tom cruise fan but this one was pretty good
Aug 26 2012,negative,radio play was better
Aug 25 2012,positive,not a great movie but visually awesome
Aug 25 2012,positive,this is one of my favorite alien movie that i actually like since it was directed by my favorite movie director steven spielberg the plot of the movie was good and the graphic was good
Aug 25 2012,positive,best scifi documenting an alien invasion
Aug 25 2012,positive,loved the movie even though tom cruise is in it
Aug 25 2012,positive,this thriller was alot of fun to watch it was action packed great story plot and he effects were great with great cast members must watch again
Aug 25 2012,negative,watta film   owesome 
Aug 24 2012,negative,if only the ending was lord xenu vaporizing tom cruise and the rest of the scientologist idiots
Aug 23 2012,negative,total crap ending plus they didnt deem it necassary to explain things
Aug 22 2012,positive,liked it but not tom cruse
Aug 21 2012,neutral,good effects very disapointed in the movie overall though
Aug 21 2012,negative,the original was so much better
Aug 21 2012,negative,anohter piece of shit in the quick list
Aug 21 2012,negative,alright but not to good kinda stupid
Aug 20 2012,negative,was worse than i expected it to be with tom cruise in it
Aug 20 2012,positive,it could have been better but its still great
Aug 19 2012,positive,not a bad movie nothing beats the original
Aug 19 2012,positive,not bad not good but not bad
Aug 19 2012,neutral,hmmm not sure what to say
Aug 18 2012,positive,if all else fails use the universal greeting
Aug 18 2012,negative,ok but pretty boring not into alien stuff
Aug 18 2012,negative,pretty boring and i hated the kids
Aug 18 2012,neutral,good remake too much tom cruise though
Aug 18 2012,positive,pretty exciting seen it several times

Aug 18 2012,negative,tom cruises worst movie
Aug 18 2012,positive,i like the orriginal but this was still good
Aug 17 2012,positive,always thought this movie was somewhat underratedconfirmed when i saw a rt audience rating of 45 give me a break not a perfect film to be sure but has a genuine creepy feel special effects are quite good story is a bit uneven  but overall this is a pretty engaging scifi thriller and that crazy horn siren when the tripod emerges from the street  not easy to forget
Aug 17 2012,positive,i did like the aliens destroying earthlings
Aug 17 2012,positive,a fun pop corn adventure nothing more nothing less
Aug 17 2012,positive,a real surprise when i saw it in theaters this is one of my favorites there are some brilliant haunting moments in this film that recall what worked in the original novella and for once tom cruise earns his paycheck the most beautiful parts are his desperate and almost tragically futile attempts to protect the innocence of his daughter well portrayed by dakota fanning from the horror around them an overlooked theme in the age of shock and bonedeep saturation of violence i think this film is a science fiction masterpiece and while not the crowd pleaser that jurassic park was this film fits in well with spielbergs more adult science fiction work but it is the best of the lot
Aug 16 2012,negative,this is an insult to hg wells brilliance
Aug 16 2012,positive,tom cruise was awesome before this movie came out good movie but why is tom cruise running from the deities he worships
Aug 16 2012,negative,tom cruise turning in a less than stellar preformance
Aug 16 2012,positive,tom was good in this movie suprisingly
Aug 16 2012,negative,tom cruise really steven spielberg fails in this reboot which has alien noises more interesting than what any of the people have to say
Aug 16 2012,positive,i gladly remember this movie id watch it even ten times in a row it wouldnt bother me anyway one of the last good interpretations by tom cruise now too devoted to scientology and to his personal life rising stars fanning and chatwin were to me unknown in 2005 but i remember i rly liked their acting
Aug 15 2012,positive,not your average sci fi blockbuster there is a real sense or tension exhaustion awe and panic  throughout the movie as well as an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of the the imagary from the jeff waynes vinyl one of the view tom cruise movies ive really enjoyed
Aug 14 2012,neutral,scary movie 4 is better
Aug 14 2012,positive,a wonderful film probably one of the best alien movies out there
Aug 14 2012,positive,morgan freeman was great
Aug 12 2012,positive,can only be described as wellpolished brilliantly acted bmovie tom cruise was phenomenal and the special effects are mindblowing the film is also very dark not to mention bleak
Aug 12 2012,positive,a part of me wishes spielberg would have gone with his gut and adapted hg wells novel set in victorian england at the same time the other part of me loved spielbergs apocalyptic vision of modern society shattering after the sudden invasion of highly advanced aliens a lot of people slammed the casting of tom cruise but i think he did quite well with the script given the special effects were top notch but the glaring weak spot and i hate saying that in a spielberg work was the 3rd act it just had a lot of plot gaps and poor scripting give it a go you might like it
Aug 12 2012,positive,kind of stange but good all at the same time
Aug 12 2012,negative,dakota screaming thru most of it ruined it for me one scene she was standing there and nothing was going on and screamed for no reason really
Aug 11 2012,negative,a good way to kill time only
Aug 10 2012,positive,dont know what it is about this but i love it
Aug 9 2012,positive,i loved the book and the orsen wells version this was closer to the book and was a great adaptation but tom cruise kinda got in the way for me
Aug 9 2012,neutral,it took me a long time to understand the end of this movie
Aug 8 2012,positive,with a charge of amazing visual effects and the well managed tension war of the worlds triumphs
Aug 8 2012,positive,very good movievery intreging
Aug 7 2012,positive,this could have been better some good fx but the acting left me with a headache
Aug 6 2012,negative,carried by the graphics
Aug 6 2012,negative,didnt really dig it
Aug 6 2012,positive,b    i really liked this it was dark funny and suspenseful the effects were really good i was actually surprised by how well the effects were for being in 2005 i cant believe i waited until 2012 to get to watch this movie definitely go and watch
Aug 6 2012,positive,all effects i liked the remake but was only better because of the effects im a big fan of ms fanning and thought she did a great job working with mr cruise
Aug 6 2012,positive,a real superb remake of a classic  the special effects are over the top
Aug 6 2012,negative,this overloaded movie tried to use the times fashion of showing special effects and it may be good for seven years ago now cinema is a bit different and with good not fantastic special effects you cant do a good film casting and premise are wasted and the only good thing here is steven spielberg as the director i hope the original is better
Aug 6 2012,neutral,i really didnt care for this movie  i think i was expecting too much from it
Aug 4 2012,negative,the original version was one hundred fold better
Aug 4 2012,positive,amazing effects and a great adaption this movie makes you feel like invasion is really going on and takes you on a ride of its own i enjoyed it

Aug 2 2012,positive,stuff blows uppeople scream in the streetits freaking loud and intenseheck it made me happy
Aug 2 2012,positive,an effective film although it does get quite dull at moments and doesnt offer enough to get you out of that moment
Aug 2 2012,positive,pretty good but it looked like they were trying to make it scarier than it was
Aug 2 2012,negative,i guess i expected more
Aug 2 2012,positive,to many mistakes  such as all technology isnt working cars phones lights nothing  except for that one guy that starts video taping the alien
Aug 2 2012,negative,wasnt as good as original
Jul 31 2012,positive,never really seen it
Jul 30 2012,positive,well acted visually stunning and a great script makes war of the worlds a great action film while still delivering the paranoid thrills from the novel
Jul 30 2012,positive,kind of scary makes you wonder what is really out there
Jul 30 2012,neutral,dakota fanning is annoying as hell filled with stupid moments that make you cringe and angry and all round just not a good movie
Jul 29 2012,neutral,unbelievably boring
Jul 29 2012,positive,great action movie but something was missing
Jul 29 2012,positive,it may appeal to those who didnt read the book or didnt see the original version otherwise not as thrilling as it should lacks suspense and emotional tension though on the technical it is very decent war of the worlds is only a mildly enjoyable scifi flick and while some of the scenes are creepy and frightening in their tone even tom cruises overprotective performance isnt able to save the film
Jul 28 2012,positive,if it is the original it was really good and scary
Jul 28 2012,negative,totally absurd in the early part of the film theres only one car out of probably ten million that can run and naturally its the one our hero finds and in the end after most of humanity is killed off the invaders are finally defeated by birds cant wait for the sequuel not  i gave it a not interested even though i just viewed it would rather  sit through 100 rewatches of the original than having already watched this remake once

Jul 15 2012,negative,complete flop bad graphics and tom needs to just join his freaky scientist friends  boring movie
Jul 15 2012,positive,fantastic effects just lacked the compassion which was evident at the start of the film
Jul 15 2012,positive,liked it lots of action
Jul 15 2012,positive,i got to see this one in a drivein very cool
Jul 15 2012,positive,watchable for its sfx and underlying tones but the script lacked in quality and it becomes a escape from the thing we cant see up until the outhouse part anyway we only see the true alien towards the end and even then it looks like something ripped off from independence day a let down considering the audience was taken so far for so long
Jul 14 2012,positive,thrilling with an entertaining plot that sends chills down your spine
Jul 14 2012,negative,this is suppose to be about alien invasion not tom cruise as a bad father
Jul 12 2012,positive,scientology may have destroyed tom cruises braingreat now im gonna get sued but i still think this movie is excitingyeah its a big chase scene but one conatining awesomeness
Jul 12 2012,positive,not tom cruises best
Jul 12 2012,negative,this is steven spielbergs worst movie
Jul 12 2012,positive,war of the worlds  release date june 29 2005  director steven spielberg  stars tom cruise dakota fanning tim robbins  runtime 116 min    steven spielberg brings a modern retelling of hg wells classic war of the worlds to the big screen    the story follows one familys fight for survival after the earth is attacked by alien tripod fighting machines    the film has sweet special effects the usual great direction from spielberg great acting and a pretty great story the film was lacking in very much heart at parts though spielberg did direct it well but generally for a spielberg movie it definitely isnt his greatest    its a pretty sweet scifi thriller though and is quite gripping at times    the film also stars justin chatwin miranda otto and rick gonzalez    i never saw the original so i wouldnt know if its a good remake or not  without the original to affect my overall view of the film its a pretty solid science fiction flick    it seems a little underrated by the user community
Jul 12 2012,positive,one of tom cruises better films 
Jul 10 2012,positive,its an adaption vs based upon huge difference it does bring a entertaining joyride to it i would have liked if spielberg stuck to the original more
Jul 10 2012,positive,cool movie espcially for the effects
Jul 8 2012,positive,absolutely love this movie
Jul 8 2012,positive,in all honesty out of the 3 war of the worlds films released in 2005 this was the best but out of all the interpretations of the hg wells it sits in amongst the other average versions most of the storyline stays generic to all the other film  radio versions of the book
Jul 7 2012,positive,good though im getting to like tom cruise less and less as the years go by
Jul 7 2012,positive,again my firend said it was good
Jul 7 2012,positive,it was ok i didnt really understand how the robots got here in the first place
Jul 5 2012,positive,huge wells fan so i was so thrilled with this movie
Jul 5 2012,positive,yes yes tom was spectacular in this film
Jul 5 2012,negative,one of the most overrated spielberg films
Jul 5 2012,neutral,i owen it and dont watch it much
Jul 4 2012,positive,special effects were good kind of confusing though
Jul 4 2012,positive,a remake that is exciting because of spielberg and cruises work
Jul 4 2012,positive,it was good but sad
Jul 4 2012,positive,it was alright a great premise turned into a pretty boring film with a bad performance by tim robbins
Jul 3 2012,positive,wow i didnt know cruise could act anymore  loljust kidding but he did redeem himself a little in my eyes
Jul 3 2012,positive,speilber and cruise nuff said
Jul 3 2012,positive,scary stuff can you imagine if this really happend everending action to keep you on your seat
Jul 2 2012,positive,once again prefer the original
Jul 2 2012,negative,although i love tom cruise and he was great in this movie i wasnt crazy about this remake  it went too far off based and totally changed the movie it should  have had a different title  the original was much better
Jul 2 2012,negative,interesting alien effects and conclusion you cant beat morgan freeman narration but the family dynamic leaves you unattached while tom cruises character conflict leeches into cliche a pretty runofthemill alien apocalypse story
Jul 2 2012,positive,they did an amazing job of the story
Jul 1 2012,positive,entertaining if you ingnore the acting
Jul 1 2012,positive,really liked this on several levels
Jul 1 2012,negative,one of the few spielberg films i would not recommend
Jul 1 2012,positive,one of the best sci fi and tom cruise movies in my opinion
Jul 1 2012,neutral,idk why this got ok reviews sfx  ok and to me it wasnt as dark feeling as i would have liked it to be too much tom cruise thinking that hes cool and straight yet suspiciously still far too fashion forward wearing that 120000 leather jacket actual price tag this movie felt too m night shammy which is not a good thing unless youre bruce willis the war of the worlds legitimately caused chaos when it aired on the radio and even was responsible in 1944 for multiple deaths in south america when they repeated the stunt   seriously though you had infinite stories to tell and we got tom cruises characters uninteresting one its the end of the world lets find something better to do
Jul 1 2012,positive,kept me on the edge of my toilet seat
Jul 1 2012,positive,i did like this felt cheesy but the effects are awesome
Jun 30 2012,positive,i thought this was a wonderful remakenot bad at all
Jun 30 2012,neutral,good film but cant beat a classic
Jun 30 2012,positive,great special effects
Jun 30 2012,positive,good remake amazing special effects good acting
Jun 30 2012,positive,i thought it was awesome
Jun 29 2012,positive,a reilly birthday movie classic
Jun 29 2012,negative,an awful pitiful excuse for a movie adaptation of hg wells classic story it doesnt do anything right the time period is wrong the characters are wrong the plot is wrong everything is wrong for instance the protagonist hides in a sewer with a british soldier not some bum in a basement and whats wrong with the setting it takes place in london not new jersey and why does the protagonist have children he didnt have children in the book this movie is a total disaster spielberg probably didnt even read the novel in the first place just made this cinematic garbage for the heck of it this is a bad bad movie stay far away from it
Jun 29 2012,negative,can hardly go wrong with tom cruise and dakota fanning
Jun 28 2012,negative,if you like movies where most of the earths population is annihilated then pop it in
Jun 28 2012,positive,finally tom cruise makes a good movie i think that speaks for itself
Jun 28 2012,positive,unbelievably intense almost amazing film until the final 10 minutes when spielberg delivers what may go down as the most pussiedout ending of all time
Jun 28 2012,positive,i am a fan of the 1950s war of the worlds and having seen this i have come up with thisthe 1950s version is geared for the audience in the 50s with its old school special effects and mostly unknown cast this one is geared toward the audience of 2005 with the impressive special effects and big name actors
Jun 28 2012,positive,it was okay lame storyline
Jun 27 2012,positive,i love this movie it is absolutely hilarious
Jun 26 2012,positive,tom kicked ass in this scifi thriller
Jun 26 2012,negative,remakes should be approached with caution because they are not creative and merely a rip on someone elses idea  i saw the original and did not want to taint it but this version was on tnt      the movie kept my attention  i was engaged by tom cruise  dakota fanning puts forth a solid effort into making the movie completely unwatchable
Jun 26 2012,positive,steven spielbergs adaptation has faced lots of criticism mainly because of two main characters performances chatwin fanning but putting that aside cruise gives it his all and combined with the naturally beautiful direction of spielberg who has done and accomplished this genre before et close encounters of the third kind we get a film that may not be as good as those two but dazzles nonetheless
Jun 25 2012,positive,and enjoyable retelling of the classic sorry with some good points of conflict between the human side of the story
Jun 25 2012,positive,wha his son livescommon
Jun 25 2012,positive,steven spielberg delivers a truly gripping experience with war of the worlds thats both exciting and thrilling with another terrific performance by tom cruise

Jun 24 2012,negative,couldnt have made it better
Jun 23 2012,positive,forgot how amazing this movie is
Jun 23 2012,positive,spielberg masterfully plays with hg wells timeless novel bringing in fresh action and drama
Jun 23 2012,positive,good movie though i felt something was missing but it was good
Jun 22 2012,negative,is it that hard to follow the orriginal script
Jun 22 2012,positive,it was another apocolypse movie where we get our asses kicked and we barely survive it was ok
Jun 22 2012,negative,war of the worlds is a decent film by film merits tom cruise does a fair portrayal as the main character it has plenty of explosions and suspense to make it what it is a good popcorn flick however in contrast to hg wells classic novel from which it was derived it fails considerably
Jun 22 2012,negative,the original was so much better
Jun 21 2012,positive,i havent seen this movie in a long time but i what i remember from this movie is that i was at the edge of my seat through most of it
Jun 20 2012,positive,i really liked this one id never understood the book but the movie i got
Jun 20 2012,positive,this is a very solid alien invasion flick the dark flipside to spielbergs close encounters et if george pal had produced his classic film in 2005 it too would have undoubtedly contained a 911 allegory this one has its share of critics but its got its fans too in addition to decent reviews and raking in over half a billion worldwide war was nominated for 3 oscars best visual effects sound and sound effects editing
Jun 20 2012,negative,nothing like the book it was stupid and the original movie was way better
Jun 20 2012,positive,compared to original black and white movie and okay with todays special effects but not as a whole
Jun 20 2012,positive,gotta love this movie
Jun 20 2012,positive,omg tom cruise may be gay jk but he is really great in this movie

Jun 19 2012,negative,not too bad from what i saw
Jun 19 2012,positive,i would consider this remake a very strong one there were very slight deviations from the original the aliens looked scary and powerful the noise that the aliens made was the amazing another spielberg great
Jun 19 2012,positive,ummspeildberg is a freaking genius
Jun 19 2012,negative,pathetic update of a classic
Jun 19 2012,positive,i did not expect to like this i did
Jun 18 2012,negative,could have been better
Jun 18 2012,positive,pros  effects story  cons  tom cruise but he was still decent
Jun 18 2012,negative,6 dollars my parents wasted on letting me see
Jun 18 2012,positive,scared the crap out of me
Jun 18 2012,positive,will it goes to show you that the real personality will show when a crisis is about
Jun 18 2012,positive,if there is a sci fi movie that will make you wonder this one is defiantly it tell how it could truly happen
Jun 17 2012,negative,found it quite boring
Jun 17 2012,positive,thats a good flippin movie
Jun 16 2012,negative,see tom run run tom run  wait you can stop running the aliens are allergic to water or was it air does it matter wow i did as much to stop them as tom did which is nothing this movie sucked
Jun 16 2012,positive,it was ok good action flick
Jun 16 2012,positive,some funny moments but the ending was relly boring
Jun 16 2012,positive,could have been beter
Jun 15 2012,negative,it appears hollywood is willing to give any movie a good review regardless of how utterly horrible it is based solely on the notoriety of director in charge of said movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,as far as spielberg movies go war of the worlds would be the one im most conflicted on in one scene hes dishing out something thats pure cinematic gold and in the next youre screaming at the screen what the fuck was that  were treated to some great special effects here but at most theyre limited its like spielbergs pushed his subtle style of things happening outa shot and only really witnessing what our characters are witnessing too far this time what were left with instead of shock and aww is nagging questions of whats actually going on over that hill whys it raining shredded clothes howd them dead people in the river die howd the train catch on fire i mean a lil mystery is good but on this occasion little isnt the case   its other huge flaw is the acting tom cruise suits the character he plays and for his part its enjoyable everyone else unfortunately sucks dakota fanning is no longer cute shes strait out annoying i spent the most of the movie hoping her and the dude playing her brother would die next then theres tim robbins hes okay but his character and the whole part of the movie involving him just felt like a time filler   i could go on but in the end for every positive theres a flaw surrounded by a bunch of actors i simply wanna punch in the throat
Jun 15 2012,positive,i loveeeddd it also it would have been better without language
Jun 15 2012,positive,heard the original was better but i thought it was pretty good
Jun 15 2012,positive,great twist from the book that made it a little more interesting and full
Jun 15 2012,positive,they should have brought some alien theraflu apparently

Jun 13 2012,neutral,not as good as the original
Jun 13 2012,negative,not as good as i thought it would be
Jun 13 2012,positive,not as bad as the panning it got
Jun 13 2012,positive,this film reminds us the famous radiobroadcast by hg wells which shocked and made the us paranoid there is an amazing cast of actors and actresses like tom cruise dakota fanning and justin chatwin the acting in this film gives that feeling about survival and being with your family in the end the director did an incredible amount of camera shooting the film has alot of high and low lighting the setting in this film is nationwide but the suspense and horror made it worldwide also the special effects in this film is amazing and pretty bizarre
Jun 13 2012,negative,not that great of a movie special effects were goodbut the plot was thumbs down bad
Jun 13 2012,positive,i can watch it all day over and over
Jun 12 2012,positive,scared the sht out of me with the needle thing gah
Jun 12 2012,positive,scared me alittle bit
Jun 12 2012,negative,little girl screams too much
Jun 12 2012,negative,this is a terrible movie  the main problem as far as i can tell is that every character in this film is unlikable  you cant care where the story is going if you dont care about the people in it  i couldnt have cared less about whether cruise lived or died  do not see this movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,the special effects are surprisingly believable solid storyline
Jun 12 2012,positive,one of 3 tom cruise movies worth while
Jun 12 2012,positive,loved i scarey if you sit and think about it
Jun 11 2012,positive,new or old like them both
Jun 11 2012,positive,an improvement on the hgw classic story war of the worlds is an action packed emotional thrill ride which has the ability to entertain you but sicken you at the thought of being in that situation
Jun 11 2012,positive,a masterpiece tom cruise at his finest
Jun 11 2012,positive,tom cruise is awesome in this
Jun 11 2012,positive,it looked beautiful and the aliens first attack was terrifying  again its what spielberg didnt show us that was more frightening  some people complain about dakota but im sorry if that stuff was happening i would be screaming like a little girl too  the ending was a little too pat but oh well
Jun 10 2012,positive,was awsome till the very end where they suddenly all died cause they got sick
Jun 10 2012,positive,dakota fanning and tom cruise show their best in this film
Jun 10 2012,positive,blu ray in 3d please
Jun 9 2012,positive,cruise was really good here even if hes turned a bit crazy
Jun 9 2012,positive,omg the best movie ever
Jun 8 2012,positive,although it fails to make any sense at many points and dakota fanning insists on playing the part of worlds most annoying little girl its sheer creepiness makes watching it worth the while especially in the dark preferably preceding a paranormal activity marathon
Jun 8 2012,negative,format lacklustre and disappointing
Jun 8 2012,positive,interesting of course gives you a new outlook on live
Jun 7 2012,positive,such a good movie it really makes u stop and think
Jun 7 2012,positive,very good movie  classic remake
Jun 7 2012,positive,tom cruise wasnt too annoying and it was a nice escape
Jun 7 2012,negative,the only good things in this movie are the special fx tim robbins and dakota fanning  really why did this have to be made  ok it has one or two good scenes in it my favourite being the flaming train one  but i see cruise and i think no fucking way and his older son you just want to smack him
Jun 7 2012,negative,aliens can figure out how to make massive machines but not how to fight a cold whatever
Jun 7 2012,positive,only 4 because of tom cruise
Jun 7 2012,positive,intresting but the ending was horrible
Jun 6 2012,neutral,this movie wasnt so good i liked it just not that much
Jun 6 2012,positive,better than expected
Jun 6 2012,negative,good story line but the whole movie was really bad and the book seems good but all together a really bad one
Jun 6 2012,positive,problem with cursing
Jun 6 2012,positive,great special effects but the leave the real acting to the old skool kats
Jun 6 2012,positive,whilst lacking the depth characterization and strong plotting of other spielberg movies this is still an exciting and thrilling roller coaster ride with masterful special effects and action sequences tom cruise puts in a good performance as a slacker father under enormous stress but still managing to hold his family together the alien war machines are suitably menacing and there are several chilling almost blood curdling moments to savor it isnt a classic but it is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours
Jun 5 2012,positive,another one of my favs
Jun 5 2012,positive,probably underrated
Jun 5 2012,positive,its a quick action ride  could have used more character development  the cellar scene w tim robbins was well directed  also some great visual effects    id4 was better

May 4 2012,negative,war of the worlds comes to us to tell us the story of one man with his two annoying and uncooperative kids trying to survive an alien invasion the basic premise is delivered to us via voiceover narration from morgan freeman which isnt ever a bad way to begin a movie he explains that intelligent life has been watching us for millions of years planning an assault when the time seems right    that time is now or at least a few minutes after we begin first we have to see how incompetent ray tom cruise is at raising children his exwife mary ann miranda otto drops off the children telling ray that shell be in boston to visit her parents once inside the house we see just how unequipped this man is to be a father the kids have to share a room despite being 10 and 16 years of age and of different genders there isnt any food in the fridge and the older one robbie justin chatwin doesnt even respect him enough to call him dad the younger rachel dakota fanning has pleasant conversations with him and initially shows herself as the more mature child    soon enough something appears in the sky it looks like a really weird cloud and is causing a massive storm in the area strangely the cloud is pulling things toward it instead of having the wind blow away from it like you might expect and then lighting starts striking the earth 27 times in one spot were told although it also hits rays back yard and scares both him and rachel robbie had already stolen rays car and go into town at this point its here when we get a harbinger of things to come not with the aliens but with the character of rachel she will scream loudly and excessively whenever something marginally frightening occurs    oh yes there are also some aliens when ray goes into town to retrieve his son we see one of their machines the film calls them tripods presumably because they have three legs they kind of look like jellyfish and before anyone knows whats going on theyre vaporizing humans left and right panic ensues ray manages to steal the only working car in the city and he and the kids are off to find their mother im not sure why its either because they think its a genuinely good idea because thats the only safe direction anyway or because they think that rachels mother will finally shut her up i prayed that the final of those would come true whether that was their intention or not    i dont understand this characterization she has shown herself to be mature enough to look past her fathers incompetency and treat him like a human being but once anything goes wrong including one lightning strike she freaks right out this is a movie and were allowed to include nonhysterical children it might make more sense if she was say 6 years of age but war of the worlds makes sure to tell us her exact age those screams are deafening and by the fifth time we got one i wanted her character to be abducted    robbie isnt much better once the aliens start attacking he decides to act as stupidly as possible despite not screaming or showing any emotion i liked him more than rachel but neither one is particularly likable ill give you an example of his idiocy in one scene there are soldiers driving toward the aliens spouting lines like weve done our job if we manage to hold them back for a few minutes robbie decides to follow the soldiers who as i mentioned last sentence are driving directly at the aliens all three characters could easily get to safety but no we have to get a long drawnout scene where we have to try to convince this character not to get himself killed    there isnt any tension to scenes where the aliens might get our lead characters if i dont want to see them survive thousands of more likable people are slaughtered in the background and they havent done anything to send me into a fit of rage humanity seems doomed anyway at one point the characters hide out in a basement and we get a few scenes of alien machines trying to find them to director steven spielbergs credit he tries to make the scene tense unfortunately when you have characters that i wanted to see get caught i was rooting for the alien which is a reaction completely contrary to what the filmmakers wanted    war of the worlds does look good and i suppose if all you want is a specialeffectsdriven science fiction film youll be perfectly content after this one ends well maybe not perfectly content as the ending comes as a little slap in the face but content enough to not want to write an angry letter to someone due to the failure that this movie ultimately is not only doesnt the ending really make sense but even if thats the ending they wanted to use because theyre making an accurate adaptation of hg wells novel it happens too quickly and the entire film gets to its resolution far too fast to be completely satisfying    war of the worlds lives and dies by its characters youre not going to get a poorly made movie from someone like spielberg at this point in his career but the screenplay didnt give him a lot to work with in terms of the people were supposed to care about its a valiant attempt but this is a film that just doesnt work when you want to see a tenyearold girl get abducted by the aliens everyones working hard to run away from you havent done a good job
May 4 2012,positive,it might have a forgettable ending but the remaining tale of the family as they cope with an extraterrestrial invasion is neatly planned and grandly acted by its cast the camerawork makes you feel like youre genuinely following these people as an onlooker and its marvellous special effects and some disturbingly petrifying climaxes make this scary not perfect but spielberg knows whats best
May 4 2012,positive,if anyone was going to make a wotw reboot it had to be spielberg and it shows
May 3 2012,negative,that sound still freaks me out to this day
May 3 2012,positive,loud proud and bold as anything this is good fun

Apr 29 2012,negative,hate this movie although there are a couple parts that are so cheesey theyre funny
Apr 29 2012,positive,i loved the movie and i think youd have to be crazy not to like it the only way i could see someone not liking it is if they hate movies this is totally worth the money
Apr 29 2012,positive,its often maligned unfairly in my view given that its one of the few times spielberg is willing to go to some pretty dark places which i do like the divorced father cant connect with his kids plot is a tired one but by the time tim robbins shows up and the true purpose of the invasion is revealed i cant help but get lost in the darkness as for the ending i find it surprising that people were upset that it didnt follow a typical independence day styled finale if it bothers you that much i suggest you just go argue with hg wells corpse
Apr 29 2012,positive,much better than the dry and boring original classic hats off to tom cruise
Apr 29 2012,positive,good adaptation of the jules verne book
Apr 29 2012,positive,the ending was kinda lame

Apr 26 2012,negative,if your movie has to have a break down of what just happened in the end your film is garbage  this film by definition is garbage  big budget equally big pile of crap  great actors wasted on poor writing  dakota fannings lines consisted of ah and ahhhh and aaahhhhhh
Apr 26 2012,positive,ok the sotry is already written and this is but a remake but give me more on the aliens destroying shit give me more international destruction global scale not just a scene on a tv screen the only reason it gets this rating is because morgan freeman narrated the thing see morgan freeman is awesome

Apr 16 2012,positive,i rarely say this but this remake beats the original it was suspsensful and it brought entertainment i was on the edge of my seat throughout and it was quite enoyable one of tom cruises best performances in film and the whole entire cast gave a powerhouse performance  the aliens in this movie were pretty cool and whenever they came the film started to have brilliant visuals which was predictable but on a disaster film basis its one of the best i have ever seen i loved how the film made you care about the characters which rarely happens in a film like this i really enjoyed myself in this movie and there was not that many flaws really none thinking of the top of my head an enjoable alien movie and i would watch it again

Apr 14 2012,positive,pretty good not as scary as i thought it would be lol

Apr 13 2012,positive,great special effects and a really good first half but falls apart in the second
Apr 13 2012,positive,ok but dont like tom cruise
Apr 13 2012,positive,has the same pathetic copout excuse of a conclusion that hg wells had in his novel which isnt helped by the worlds most overused narrator morgan freeman otherwise decent considering the general publics dislike for tom cruise and dakota fanning and as noted by doug benson war of the worlds effectively teaches us that children slow you down so just ditch em and run
Apr 13 2012,positive,special effects were great
Apr 13 2012,negative,i thought it was kinda dumb
Apr 13 2012,positive,would have loved to see tom cruise get his ass harvested
Apr 13 2012,negative,really splits its audience i personally detested the poor superficial additions to the plot and the weakly designed alien craft while the crux of the story is the same the changes made to make it seem fresher are so minor as to be insulting to the original novel  films but i know plenty who loved the new version so it must have something i didnt see or feel
Apr 13 2012,positive,good show kinda wacko tho
Apr 13 2012,positive,if its tom cruise i have seen it  he can jump on my couch anytime

Apr 12 2012,positive,it was very horrifying how it begins
Apr 12 2012,positive,i thought this was a wonderful movie very well done the movie made you really become part of the situation and made you forget you were in a theatre very mind boggling plot which makes you contimplate what you would do if this ever happened

Apr 11 2012,neutral,i have to agree with what most critics will say about war of the worlds  its surprisingly underwhelming
Apr 11 2012,negative,amazing special effects and a good general plot are weakened by tom cruises reluctance to die despite all odds
Apr 11 2012,negative,not tom cruises best work  like the original better although the special effects were better in the remake
Apr 11 2012,positive,wow this movie actually had me scared in places i loved it
Apr 11 2012,positive,dakota and tom were great but the story not sure about
Apr 11 2012,neutral,it was okay but with all the hype this movie had i was kind of disappointed
Apr 11 2012,positive,it tries so hard to be an epic but it doesnt quite materialise

Apr 1 2012,positive,the first half was spectacular but a rushed ending and no real climax ultimately degraded what could have been a scifi classic

Mar 27 2012,positive,better than the original one
Mar 26 2012,positive,hella good tom cruise was too impersonal though i thought
Mar 25 2012,positive,i thought it could have been better
Mar 25 2012,negative,the most bland movie i have ever seen and a giant waste of time
Mar 25 2012,positive,speilberg is at it again along with the very talented tom cruise
Mar 25 2012,negative,not good at all the ending sucked horribly
Mar 25 2012,positive,i really like steven spielbergs vision of hg wells classic science fiction novel in some ways its quite scary
Mar 23 2012,positive,i thought it was a good remake of the original
Mar 23 2012,positive,thrilling disturbing but other than that its the same old spielberg thriller
Mar 23 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies it was way cool didnt get nearly the attention it deserved
Mar 22 2012,positive,this was a good movie over all
Mar 22 2012,positive,the first 30 minutes of the movie is the best the build up of suspense and fear is truly provocative  the rest of the movie is still good and delivers some good thrills
Mar 21 2012,positive,i love the visuals and whole americans as refugees in their own countrysurvival of the fittest subtext  the family dynamics never really engage me and spielberg takes the easy road out by tacking on the happy reunion of father with son who would have been dead if anyone willing to take a risk had made this film  cant endanger the box office potential of course
Mar 21 2012,positive,so cool seen it at least 99 times
Mar 21 2012,positive,really intense  well acted and welldirected  speilberg comes so close to making exceptional movies yet he falls just short  sells out in the name of commercial success
Mar 21 2012,positive,tom cruise might be insane but he still knows how to do good action films
Mar 20 2012,positive,some great action but needed some major work on the script
Mar 19 2012,positive,spielberg does it again this had me glued to the screen from start to finish
Mar 18 2012,positive,pretty good this only movie i liked tom cruise in second to rain man this thriller had great graphics to keep you intersted and the aliens will creep you out
Mar 18 2012,neutral,light spielberg clashes with dark in a movie that ultimately cant decide whether its heavy drama or popcorn fare and winds up slightly unsatisfying as either  definitely not a bad film but one of spielbergs weaker entries  to see a latter day spielberg alien feature check out super 8 he only produces but you can see his stamp on things
Mar 18 2012,positive,great film bbc1 half past watch it
Mar 18 2012,positive,crazy special effects and it was scaryno alien movies scare me but this one caused me to have nightmares  good despite the main character being portrayed by a psychotic douche bag
Mar 17 2012,positive,a well thought out adaptation of hg wells novel
Mar 16 2012,negative,most confusing and pointless movie ive ever watched 
Mar 16 2012,positive,tom cruise delivers his role well and the terror that spielberg can twist so perfectly is there too
Mar 16 2012,negative,split vote on this critics liked it maybe because its spielberg the audience didnt which is really strange since it was a huge box office success although special effects and action scenes are at high levels i found it hard to stand through and almost gave up before the end
Mar 13 2012,positive,dakota fanning made this movie worth watching
Mar 13 2012,positive,entertaining with a satisfying ending but half assed acting and a running time that goes about 20 minutes longer than it should have been makes this one a mediocre action flick
Mar 11 2012,positive,the first time i saw it as a young child i thought this was a big loud thrilling alien invasion film with lots of impressive special effects and terrific action sequences with tom cruise in it but now seeing it as an adult i realized that this was a horror film about humanity and wars i found war of the worlds absolutely terrifying not just because the scenes involving aliens are effectively done but because the implications behind all the destruction and killing some of which happen between people reflect our fear and paranoia toward invasion and terrorism this is a scary and dark film a cautionary tale disguised as bigbudget blockbuster entertainment its not one of my favorite spielberg films in terms of escapism and sheer popcorn entertainment but it is definitely one of his most mature films tense gripping visceral horrifying
Mar 11 2012,positive,boring bits but nice effects and spooky scenes characters werent very interesting and there are some stupid moments but its not a bad adaption and can be entertaining
Mar 10 2012,negative,lamethough the sounds was pretty good
Mar 9 2012,positive,i liked the movie i little wierd at the end but turned out pretty good
Mar 9 2012,negative,beyond disappointing in the story although tom cruise is fabulous
Mar 7 2012,positive,i dont get the negative critical response how could this movie get any better its a great remake the material is so well handled this is spielberg people
Mar 6 2012,neutral,ok action movie not much else it was pretty boring
Mar 5 2012,positive,would have been better without tom cruise and dakota fanning
Mar 5 2012,neutral,i was sufficiently entertained while watching it
Mar 5 2012,neutral,the original is so much better
Mar 4 2012,positive,excellent keeps you on the edge of your seat
Mar 4 2012,negative,i wanted to kill dakota fanning by the end watchable but ultimately disappointing considering its spielberg and cruise usually a recipe for a good movie
Mar 3 2012,positive,i watched war of the world and i really liked this strange allen movie
Mar 3 2012,positive,surprising could have called it anything no resemblance to original
Mar 2 2012,positive,while it is pretty entertaining to watch entire cities fall from giant walking pods that shoot lasers the portrayal and plot of this movie didnt cut it for me
Mar 2 2012,neutral,nothing special in terms of story spielberg still remains a great director and does his best of making this an entertaining movie
Feb 29 2012,positive,love dakota fanning in this picture
Feb 28 2012,positive,stephen spielberg the outstanding director of jurassic park and jaws is back with a bang with his new scifi thriller war of the worlds this stunning adaptation of hg wells novel will leave the viewer hungry for more action and horror long after the ending credits have rolled however the ending may disappoint some with its all star cast extraordinary special effects and dark and sometimes terrifying storyline this film is defiantly worth watching star trek beware you have competition     the plot follows ray ferrier tom cruise a divorced man who looks after his children rachel fanning and robbie chatwin over the weekend when disaster strikes and evil robotic aliens begin to destroy the city  ray had to become the protective and selfless father he never was during his previous marriage  ray makes  a desperate and valiant rush to boston to try and find a safe haven in his ex wifes house the distressed family constantly find themselves in life threatening situations in which ray ferrier must do anything to attempt to protect his children  as the plot develops ray  begins to realize it is not a war they can win but a war they have to survive     cruise brings his previous acting expertise to this film and creates a believable character of ray ferrier and manages to move the audience especially in the scenes towards the end of the film featuring only himself and his daughter fanning plays the role of the innocent and distressed child getting into the role so well it almost hurts to see a child in so much terror even if you know she is only an actress chatwin manages to pull off  the role of moody teenager robbie almost effortlessly and also shows the progression from boy to man very well especially in the scene when he fights free of his fathers protective grip and if several scenes of his did not move you you have a heart of stone     although the script is an extremely loose version of the original 1898 novel one of the main differences being that it is set in america where as the original novel was in fact set in england  however the holes in the screenplay are covered up by the dramatic special effects and the fabulous and gripping performances of all three of the leads a moving sub plot to the film is the growth of cruises character from a poor dad to a loving and caring father who is willing to give up his own life for that of his own children the dialogue used at the beginning of the film indicated ray ferriers impatience with the panic of his youngest child rachel however towards the middle of the film he has a heartwarming monologue whilst trying to console that her brother is still alive after he ran away from them yet due to the nature of this film touching speeches are few instead spielberg uses lots of close ups of the faces of the actors especially in the moments when cruise is surveying the damage of the area he is in which makes up for the lack of emotive conversation      the soundtrack of the film composed by john williams makes the film even more of a spectacle adding pace and tension when the acting and special effects simply wouldnt be enough such as the panicked journey out of new york city which signifies the start of many dramatic  escapes to come the use of tracking shots at this point in the film also helps the audience see the urgency of the people trying to escape the city and shows that all of the people have an every person for themselves attitude which portrays perfectly how every human being would behave if such a disaster was to occur  the soundtrack also adds a clever twist to some especially dark scenes of the film such as when fanning sings the lullaby hushabye mountain to herself and covers her ears as her father murders a man in order to keep them from being found and to keep them safe however the soundtrack is perhaps unnecessary in certain moments such as the scence when the robotic eye of the alien is revealed scanning the ground for remaining humans a scene  which leaves the audience holding their breath and on the edge of their seats     the end of the film is somewhat disappointing after all the action horror blood and gore you expect the film to go out with an unforgettable finale however it concludes with the arrival of ray and rachel ferrier at rachels mothers house and the camera focusing on robbie proving that somehow he escaped his death from when he ran away from his father and managed to find his way home on his own a seemingly impossible feat the death of the aliens comes as a great let down as it is not the humans that finish them off but the microbes and viruses in the earths resources which have been consumed by the aliens who are not immune to them as humans were  this is explained in the ending narration by morgan freeman however fans of the book may be pleased by the ending as it stays true to the original novel     hold onto your popcorn as this film will take you on a breathtaking and bumpy ride through a truly amazing story
Feb 28 2012,positive,its alright but cruises character is annoying  would have loved to listen to the radio show
Feb 27 2012,positive,scary movie gave me nightmares for a loooong time though haha
Feb 26 2012,positive,i like this movie  its cutting edge special fx and the classic story make it a great scifi thriller i think tom cruise was pretty good in this and tim robbins plays type as a nutter justin chatwin and dakota fanning both turn in great performances i like the first 30 minutes because of the discovery and the terror but the flaming train looks like something stephen king thought up   definitely a popcorn muncher
Feb 26 2012,negative,the enviorment killed them fucking dumb
Feb 24 2012,positive,i dont really like tom cruise
Feb 24 2012,negative,from what i remember the effects are impressive but its a very empty film thats low on humanity and spirit
Feb 24 2012,negative,a bland disappointing adaption of what was previously an exciting phenomenon that kicks off with visual brilliance and promise only to be stopped to a halt by the nutter of an iffy performer that is tom cruise
Feb 23 2012,neutral,one of the rare spielberg films that doesnt live up to the hype
Feb 22 2012,positive,wicked more my taste
Feb 21 2012,positive,this film sticks pretty close to the novel its just nice to see it in the hands of someone like spielberg so that we can see a truly great actionadventure director return to form and not leave the theater disappointed
Feb 21 2012,neutral,isnt dakota fanning old enough to be in high school by now when is she going to stop playing scared little kids  besides tom cruise is no longer top gun material
Feb 19 2012,positive,special effects were the best ive ever seen but there were obvious plot holes overall its definitely worth watching
Feb 19 2012,positive,action packed you can say the movie stuck to its main storyline ordinary man protects his children
Feb 19 2012,positive,first half quality second half could of been better and the aliens looked like dweebs i would of kod them easy
Feb 18 2012,negative,loud obnoxiouscute kids lousy dad and what the heck is tim robbins doing in this train wreck
Feb 18 2012,positive,that movie scared the bejeebers out of me

Feb 16 2012,positive,gave me nightmares but it was good lol
Feb 14 2012,positive,an interesting take on the book but i prefer the classic
Feb 14 2012,negative,ugh just for the fanning alone it gets a half star
Feb 14 2012,positive,liked it dispite tom cruise
Feb 13 2012,negative,the buildup and the reveal gets a 45 the invaders tearing things apart gets a 35 and the ending gets a 15  apparently the ending is how it ends in the original which i was unaware of and found it very abrupt and empty feeling
Feb 13 2012,neutral,i liked it when i saw it when i was younger now i realize its just another corny tom cruise movie the special effects were great but the story in plot were just lacking not a fan of tom cruises acting as it is in this movie didnt help to change my mind
Feb 13 2012,positive,war of the worlds is an alien extravaganza unfortunately the ending is not well made
Feb 12 2012,neutral,too much scientology who directed this lron hubbard or steven spielberg way too much tom cruise and dakota fanning and the kid who played tom cruises son only proved that playing spoiled brats on screen isnt that hard the biological diseases killed the aliens what boring and horrid pacing the good part of the film were the sound and the visual effects i guess even spielberg is allowed to make a few duds now and then
Feb 12 2012,positive,thought this was rather long and boring without enough action
Feb 12 2012,positive,a lot of people didnt want to see this bc tom cruise is crazy but its really well done

Feb 5 2012,positive,i like this one   dakota fanningyou fall in love with

Jan 26 2012,positive,steven speilberg draws you in with a fastpaced beginning genuine special effects and an ironic performance from tom cruise but slowly the movie starts to fizzle and drive slowly around in circles its a bit of a roller coaster thrilling action then sitting and waiting then thrilling action etc   it was definitely good enough all around to make up for the tacky ending    i would recommend this movie if youre really in to alien invasion stuff its not bad
Jan 25 2012,positive,got weird towards the end
Jan 25 2012,neutral,not what i expected
Jan 24 2012,negative,what an annoying movie  not as good as the original   too many distractions and side plots   theres no place in a scifi for parenting and domestic family problems  get rid of the kids and maybe this movie would have been much better

Jan 21 2012,positive,its to hard to explain but if ur gonna c it go to the theaters to c it it will make ur heart thump its so good get up right now and c it
Jan 20 2012,positive,i do not understand the hate for this film  and when pressed i cannot find a single critic or detractor who is able to offer an intelligent argument for why they did not like this movie i just didnt is not a reason but i have some theories people simply do not like tom cruise  and small blame to them  but when that distaste becomes such a deterrent that it becomes the aspect that invalidates all of his work well thats kind of pathetic war of the worlds is a visually arresting and faithful retelling of the original hg wells book so much so that i have to wonder if those who found fault with the ending ever even heard of war of the worlds before this film cruise was effective in his role as an everyday jerk caught in the midst of incredible events and there was some truly unsettling imagery that brought the story into the modern day its not often that i am actually impressed with steven spielberg but this was definitely one of those times
Jan 20 2012,positive,haha kinda stupid but it was ok
Jan 20 2012,positive,extremely well done and entertaining

Jan 18 2012,positive,cant stand tom cruise
Jan 18 2012,positive,not tom cruises best but i like tom
Jan 18 2012,positive,this is quite a frightening and enjoyable film for only fist time around scenes that seemed like 20 minutes of suspense at first will turn into oh yeah i remember that being scary moments faithfulness to the plot and ideas presented by the original novel falters the aliens who not even vaguely resembling those in the novel arrive in lightning storms not giant cylinders and operate tripods which after having somehow remained buried under topsoil for tens of thousands if not millions of years project clearly visible loud arc rays and not the invisible nearly silent heat rays of the classic    my advice dont watch it too often youll spoil the fun of the first viewing
Jan 18 2012,positive,good but not amazing worth seeing
Jan 18 2012,negative,oh wait have they done from my favorite novel book of alltime
Jan 18 2012,neutral,some memorable scenes but would have been cooler if spielberg would have used the 19th century english setting of the novel

Jan 13 2012,positive,the rise of the machines terrifies everyone and leads to great edge of your seat entertainment
Jan 11 2012,positive,the theme of humanity versus aliens never gets old and war of the worlds has effectively told a thrilling and intense story of that as a child actress dakota fanning keeps surprising us with her amazing performance and her character is different in each film shes in in addition the visuals and sounds are great and tom cruise is definitely the best choice to star in this movie the ending however comes too fast and is unsatisfying
Jan 11 2012,negative,a very difficult film to sit through at the theater i found nothing enjoyable

Jan 4 2012,negative,tom cruise cant act
Jan 4 2012,positive,spielberg made another scifi as few tense moments of survival were one of the best made in the genre the film also drew one of the best performances of tom cruise  the film would be much better if the filnal fix the error

Jan 3 2012,positive,pretty good good effects
Jan 3 2012,negative,wasnt worth the buck i spent to rent it

Jan 1 2012,negative,good but tom cruise is the scariest alien in this film
Jan 1 2012,positive,a little freaky at times but a good sci fi movie
Dec 31 2011,negative,not as good as the original
Dec 31 2011,negative,i hate this sci fi ending where microbes kill the aliens almost as much as when water kills them or they leave for an unknown mystery reason
Dec 31 2011,negative,again with the remakes we are smart people come up with something new
Dec 31 2011,negative,great visual effects but the ending made me feel like id wasted my time and money

Dec 29 2011,positive,scary atmospheric and disturbing tom cruise also turns in a great performance
Dec 28 2011,positive,i was surprised with this one it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
Dec 28 2011,positive,certainly a scifi fans favourite its a much more interesting and fast paced remake of the same adaptation tom cruises performance was over whelming dakotas performance was not so well merely a screamer sadly people cannot understand the concept behind the alien invasion its genuinely a smart film for mature audience despite the plot holes
Dec 27 2011,positive,even though i had to put up with tom cruise
Dec 27 2011,neutral,good performances overall tim robbins is especially chilling not what youd expect from a tom cruise scifi spectacular ending is a bit of a disappointment
Dec 27 2011,positive,a great movie from steven spielberg
Dec 27 2011,positive,this was an awesome movie i love the suspense action and se

Dec 26 2011,negative,i really didnt like this movie it was kind of disturbing to me
Dec 25 2011,positive,is this really possible dakota was good in it though
Dec 24 2011,positive,gorgeous effects and even a respectable if barebones story based around some of the most annoying and infuriating characters ever written to the screen
Dec 24 2011,negative,another overhyped movie but it was entertaining overall
Dec 24 2011,neutral,great cgi and more than a few jumpoutofyourseat moments
Dec 23 2011,positive,outstanding acting solidly suspenseful very good pop film by spielberg
Dec 23 2011,positive,reconfirms spielberg as a master of action here seamlessly integrating spectacular visual magic into the most mundane and familiar settings 
Dec 23 2011,negative,really crappy and fake
Dec 22 2011,neutral,war of the worlds is a fantastic movie trapped inside an abysmal one going from a great scene to utter crap with little in between despite some interesting scenes and some great potential the film just comes across as flat
Dec 22 2011,positive,steven spielberg is known for making movies that are cherrished and loved by all great examples are et indiana jones and jaws i thought that this film was among most of his movies as being a beloved film when i saw it got a 4 star rating and loving it after i saw it but i was unpleasently surprised when i saw it got a 45 for user ratings i will have to disagree with that percentage and say that this film was a visual masterpiece but with style and substance a great story about divorced father trying to find a safe haven for his two kids after the world is invaded by aliens coated with spectacular special effects is what you need to make a great movie i feel that this movie is extremely underrated and i thought it was a fantastic movie steven spielberg can do almost no wrong
Dec 22 2011,positive,decent adaptation of the book
Dec 22 2011,negative,original radio drama was better
Dec 22 2011,positive,the 2005 version of war of the worlds is a weak remake that is so much inferior to the original 1953 film i get what spielberg was trying to do here and the movie has its moments but it rarely succeeds as an alien invasion film or as a family drama as it does not contain enough scifi thrills and the family drama is not deep enough to carry it through its color palette is also pretty hideous and it hurt the movie tremendously
Dec 21 2011,positive,a very faithful adaptation of hg welles masterpiece it also at least i think the best film in the alien invasion genre you actually can take this seriously tom cruises second collaboration with spielberg semed satifactory but made up for a good blockbuster i guess some people were alarmed because of the way spielberg portrayed aliens violent and destructive than friendly and curious you just have to see it to believe it
Dec 20 2011,negative,my least favorite book of all time and a movie thats almost as craptastic
Dec 17 2011,neutral,one of those movies you really like when the credits hit the screen then every moment after that you spend cutting it down in your mind the kids are terrible dakota fanning is unconscionably annoying the whole story with the aliens coming to earth is stupid especially when you get to the end but it looks really good and there are some good moments spread throughout
Dec 17 2011,positive,blows my mind every time i watch it every time
Dec 17 2011,negative,tom cruise sucked this one up what a waste of a great book
Dec 15 2011,neutral,steven spielbergs modern version of hg wells book is a bit of a mixed bag things like the opening monologue and the design of the tripods and level of destruction are dead on the tripods in particular look exactly as i envisioned them when i read the book  it also is a decent action scifi popcorn movie  but it lacks something there i think a lot of the science was ejected from this version the characters are pretty hard to admire its this angry bickering family  i mean they are somewhat realistic but i just dont really want to be with them for two hours im not the biggest fan of cruise and i really dont understand what so many sawsee in dakota fanning i disliked silly things like the tripods being buried under the earth for ages  and why is morgan freeman the narrator  jeez he even narrates movies he isnt even in  i also felt that despite the emotions being quite forthright in all the characters the film still managed to feel pretty emotionless cold and distant  i didnt hate nearly as much as i expected too because a lot of the film stays true to the spirit of the novelbut it still didnt thrill me
Dec 14 2011,positive,this is by far the best adaptation ive seen from hg wells novel the war of the worlds
Dec 13 2011,positive,great effects acceptable writing and good cruise
Dec 12 2011,neutral,thought it be better
Dec 11 2011,positive,saw it in theaters vury good but maybe could have been better
Dec 11 2011,positive,with a stand out performance by tom cruise war of the worlds is a smart alien movie with amazing acting and effects
Dec 10 2011,positive,a fun movie a great watch with friends movie but not a speilberg
Dec 10 2011,positive,another good alien movie that entertains most alien loving poeple but will bore anyone else
Dec 10 2011,positive,spielberg and cruise pair up again in this movie interpretation of hg wells famous book war of the worlds is mostly a delight as the blend of science fiction and survivor horror makes one reminisce to jurassic park the movie has its moments but overall didnt leave as much of an impression on me as i had hoped for certain decisions and scenes for me hurt the movies full potential
Dec 10 2011,positive,still havent seen the ending yet but what i did see was good
Dec 9 2011,neutral,good action but i hate tom cruise
Dec 9 2011,positive,this movie was ok   
Dec 8 2011,negative,does dakota fanning have to scream the entire time
Dec 7 2011,negative,i liked the original much better
Dec 7 2011,negative,sucks dont waist ur time
Dec 6 2011,negative,gosh i cant stand this movie
Dec 6 2011,positive,okay like the plot on this even though tom cruise has gotten weird in his old age
Dec 6 2011,positive,a good movie and of course it was by spielberg i felt that tom cruise did a phenomenal job in this movie i have not seen the original but i do not think it could be better than this movie the visuals made it feel so real one of the best alien movies i have ever scene
Dec 5 2011,positive,upon seeing this in the theater when i was 12 it was the most intense film i had seen at the time  it isnt anything like the original film but it does pay homage to hg wells classic novel by including some notable glimpses
Dec 5 2011,positive,ok nothing to write home about
Dec 4 2011,neutral,microweave em all  the original idea could have been turned to a movie much better than it was still liked the aliens unforgiving way to treat humans and the panic spirit in the movie
Dec 3 2011,negative,looks for couch to jump on
Dec 3 2011,positive,lots of flash and bang and spielberg but thats about it
Dec 3 2011,positive,one of my favorites
Dec 3 2011,positive,lightning storm     at the end of the nineteenth century no one would believe that things of the earth were keenly and closely by intelligences greater than those observed in men      herbert george wells man is able to theorize invent build it can create the creation is quite another thing is not yet within his reach and perhaps never will be and maybe its all well and good the war of the worlds has a deeper meaning in itself rigid introverted and the act of the mirror i understand the true ruler of the narrative thats where you find the starting point to delve into a story far from simple you see do not listen  emotionally strong because for many verse in terms of asynchronous communication and achromatic visual one dropped the mirror as perverse as a catalyst for feelings is healthy nothingness absence emptiness but man thats true that is not wounded and bent soul immortality by an irresistible urge to imperialism still able to find in the tears of a child to give the world a teenager hungry for love of ones gender it is from this type of man that the world expects to see the spark to rise to a new time dimension this world upon reflection is chock full of tripods as small as powerful for their destructive capacity we begin our defuse those from higher intelligence to us we can do quietly without     good click    italian version    lightning storm     alla fine del xix secolo nessuno avrebbe creduto che le cose della terra fossero acutamente e attentamente osservate da intelligenze superiori a quelle degli uomini     herbert george wells      luomo è in grado di teorizzare inventare costruire non può creare la creazione è tuttaltra cosa non è ancora alla sua portata e forse non lo sarà mai e forse è cosa buona e giusta la guerra dei mondi ha un significato in sé profondo rigido introverso    e latto dello specchiarsi mi par di capire il vero dominatore narrativo è lì che trovi il punto di partenza per inoltrarti in una storia tuttaltro che semplice  devi vederla non devi ascoltarla perché emotivamente forte e per molti versi asincrona dal punto di vista comunicativo ed  acromatica da quello visivo caduto lo specchio catalizzatore di sentimenti tanto perversi quanto sani resta il nulla lassenza il vuoto    ma luomo quello vero quello non piagato e piegato nellanimo da una irrefrenabile voglia di immortalità imperialista ancora in grado di ritrovarsi nelle lacrime di una bimba di donare al mondo un adolescente affamato damore per il proprio genere è da questo tipo di uomo che il mondo saspetta di veder scoccare la scintilla per assurgere ad una nuova dimensione temporale    questo mondo a ben riflettere è pieno zeppo di tripodi tanto piccoli quanto potenti per la loro capacità distruttiva iniziamo a disinnescare i nostri quelli provenienti da intelligenze a noi superiori possiamo farne tranquillamente a meno      good click
Dec 3 2011,positive,a generally good film to watch tom crusies acting is what is expected from him the film however does have its flaws with rachel dakota fanning screaming ever 5 seconds good movie but cut out the screaming to make it better
Dec 2 2011,positive,war of the worlds seems to be hated by the some people but not by me  maybe i had a different experience than they did i mean in a movie theater it all just felt so epic and fun this film is not trying to be one of steven spielbergs classic scifi films its trying to be just a fun disaster movie that has tom cruise trying to save his kids  tom cruise does not pull off a phenomenal performance but really all i was expecting was just him to be good and in my opinion he played a solid performance  dakota fanning was also very good in this film and she really knows how to handle a big role even as a small kid  justin chatwin really annoyed me in this film he just seemed really whiny and annoying and i was kind of glad when he is gone  i loved the visuals and how i felt thrilled for the entire film and even if you felt differently i guess thats your opinion  it did have its stupid and strange scenes that detracted it but it didnt ruin the overall experience for me  war of the worlds is a thrilling and fun science fiction film that i believe lives up to spielbergs line of great films
Dec 2 2011,positive,the first time i saw this movie at the beginning i said its gonna be great why because  saw a little girl with a big talent she is so talented she is my fave kid actress yes it dakota fanning not to mention tom cruise after that i set my expectations high and this movie did not disappointwell done
Dec 2 2011,positive,aliens blasting stuff is the only good parts
Dec 2 2011,positive,awesome movie i loved it even though the critics hated it
Dec 1 2011,positive,i should hate this filmwhen i read that speilburg was going to update it i yawned still i have to admit i have a dvd copygo figure big noisy dumb overdone and damn entertaining
Nov 30 2011,positive,ah spielberg you never let us down
Nov 30 2011,positive,love scifi and this was scary as all hell
Nov 30 2011,positive,a disturbing and accurate depiction of if war of the worlds took place in our time stunning visuals and a solid performance from tom cruise the overuse of the kids being depressed takes away a little from the film but regardless this film is awesome
Nov 30 2011,neutral,after i saw it it quickly evaporated from memory
Nov 29 2011,positive,a good sciencefiction thriller its slowpaced for movie with so much action but its an entertaining watch
Nov 29 2011,positive,this movie was pretty terrible i gave this three stars for the entertaining chase scene in the basement watever
Nov 29 2011,positive,steven spielberg releases a new world upon us and shakes the ground
Nov 28 2011,positive,lets see the good points are the tripods in fact they should be the rightful stars of this film for their big massive scariness like giant evil ballet dancers theres nothing cooler than giant alien heavy machinery the bad points tom cruise the slow bits of the film morgan freemans overlydetailed narration and the uneccesary gore and violence i give this film 70 entirely for those tripods d
Nov 27 2011,positive,mildly entertaining
Nov 27 2011,positive,kept me thinking if this would be possible since we have some so called alien artifacts as well as of today
Nov 27 2011,positive,why is the user rating for this so lowthis movie is great
Nov 26 2011,positive,it was neat but i really am not into aliens and space movies

Nov 26 2011,neutral,not that good  dakota fanning needs to stop screaming
Nov 26 2011,positive,scary visually thrilling and well acted surprisingly
Nov 26 2011,positive,not as good as the old one
Nov 26 2011,positive,the beginning of the film was good and they got the subtly right but the child actors where dreadful and very winy and the ending they just thought it be a good idea for morgan freeman to explain it in the stupidest way
Nov 25 2011,negative,okay movie but needed more action besides running i think it was rushed a little but decent enough
Nov 25 2011,positive,this movie gets a lot of shit from critics tho i can see the complains about seeing the aliens or not match the shock and awe of the original but its hard to deliver it back in 2005 since earth being invaded from something wasnt new what i love about this film is the humanity aspect of the film how far are you willing to go for you and youre family to survive
Nov 25 2011,positive,this is basically one of the best alien films ive ever watchedtom cruise gives this film a marvelous performance and fantastic visual effects
Nov 24 2011,positive,it is very extreme better than the film made in the 50s creepy and thrilling
Nov 24 2011,positive,despite the terribly underdeveloped and frequently unlikeable characters war of the worlds stands as a thrillingly directed event film showing once again spielberg is the master of action and it is plentiful enough to forget the films flaws frequently enough for a highly enjoyable experience
Nov 23 2011,positive,it was okay it would have been nice to see a film more accurate to the hg wells classic
Nov 22 2011,positive,ending followed exactly the actual ending in the radio programtv showprevious movies
Nov 21 2011,positive,paranoid haunting and exciting cruise might be kooko for coco puffs but he turns in a fantastic performance as a selfish everyman who becomes a shrewd father when the chips are down
Nov 21 2011,positive,cool but it really was just the day after tomorrow with aliens
Nov 20 2011,positive,i really enjoyed it not a big tom cruise fan but he was good in this 
Nov 20 2011,neutral,tom cruise is in it  yuck
Nov 19 2011,positive,an exciting and even horrific alien invasion film war of the worlds is a great remake but is still not one of spielbergs best
Nov 19 2011,positive,impressive special effects decent cast awesome action really well made score and it did a good job at putting across the human story however this could of been a whole lot better plus i get the feeling that with it being set in america it feels dumbed down
Nov 18 2011,positive,i red the book and this movie was good but could of been more interesting with details from the book
Nov 17 2011,positive,hate the constant screaming from dakota fanning
Nov 17 2011,positive,great until the cheesy famlily reunion ending
Nov 17 2011,positive,i love hg wells and i used to read his stories when i was a kid and i also remember watching hp lovecraft on tv real late at night
Nov 16 2011,positive,saw some of it  the ending was really unexciting you see military tanks etc and then what kills the ailens germs  thats right  germs
Nov 16 2011,positive,kinda missed that crazy laser sound
Nov 16 2011,negative,this movie had cool effects but i feel like the book was ruined dakota fannings damn near constant screaming made my ears bleed and i hated how the tripods had shields they didnt have them in the book and they shouldnt have them in the movie why am i posting this 6 years after the movie came out boredom makes people do dumb things
Nov 15 2011,positive,i want to see it again
Nov 15 2011,positive,awesome cgi special effects really interesting movie
Nov 15 2011,positive,steven spielberg has always been and always will be one of hollywoods best film directors

Nov 14 2011,negative,ok as an adventure film did not do credit to the original novel
Nov 14 2011,negative,scientology not science fiction  whait a minute theyre the same thing
Nov 13 2011,positive,predictable and not like the original thing
Nov 13 2011,positive,very interesting kept me on the edge of my seat
Nov 13 2011,positive,love everything up to tim robbins cellar then it drags on
Nov 12 2011,positive,well packed movie fantastic special effects
Nov 12 2011,positive,its an interesting movie with some ups and downs and more or less well adapted to their original work
Nov 12 2011,positive,steven spielberg provides a great thriller in war of the worlds the action scenes are thrilling the acting is good and tom cruise displays a great job with the help of a young dakota fanning
Nov 12 2011,positive,not bad typical cruise fare but ruined by the story of the martiains already being here
Nov 12 2011,positive,love this movie the best tom curise is a babe
Nov 12 2011,positive,freaking scary love the sounds the walking ships make holy crap that freaks me out
Nov 12 2011,negative,rubbish couldnt watch walked out spielbergseriously from schindlers list to this crap
Nov 11 2011,positive,scary thrilling overall i loved it
Nov 11 2011,positive,good looking but missed out on what was so great about the original
Nov 11 2011,positive,the effects were really good compared to the old movie especially
Nov 10 2011,positive,cliche with great special effects
Nov 10 2011,positive,cliche with great special effects
Nov 9 2011,positive,excellent made film great footage wild scenes graphics are incredible
Nov 8 2011,negative,too many continuity problems the 1953 is far superior plus rachel and robbie are completely offensive characters
Nov 8 2011,positive,it wasnt until i saw this movie that i started scratching my head and wondering why so many people think disaster movies are supposed to be fun escapism no friends this is how you do it the bleak atmosphere and relentless suspense complement each other brilliantly the human drama actually works for once and the effects are dynamite yet another home run for spielberg
Nov 8 2011,positive,aw yeahkick ass movie
Nov 5 2011,positive,oh yeah even better than the first
Nov 4 2011,positive,while it is a bit paintbynumbers and not a fan of cruise as a scifi and action fan i loved the total carnage and thrilling mystery solid entertainment which isnt oscar material
Nov 3 2011,positive,i did not like how they made the aliens die
Nov 2 2011,positive,this was a movie event  worth the watch amazing adventure  thats spielberg 4 u
Nov 1 2011,positive,a typical spielberg movie not as exciting as the book but still really good last good role i saw tom cruise play
Oct 31 2011,positive,didnt like the way they changed the aliens arrival  or the fact they made cruise a jerk that did not work
Oct 31 2011,positive,got to love a speilberg
Oct 30 2011,positive,liked the old one best
Oct 30 2011,positive,loved it and watch it over and over
Oct 28 2011,positive,solid acting and solid special effects
Oct 27 2011,positive,although the relation with wells novel is limited spielberg still succeeds in making a successful thriller while intertwining it with family drama i still wish they would have embraced morgan freemans narration a little bit more i mean common the guys god
Oct 26 2011,positive,and to this day i hate red licorice
Oct 25 2011,negative,i remember thinking it was silly the first time i saw it but i still kinda like it
Oct 24 2011,positive,again to much action and things crammed into films knowadays were all the fucking alfredo hitchcock directors gone still like the original film best they dont make them like they use to
Oct 23 2011,positive,another film that outdoes the curse of the remakes through convincing performances from dakota fanning and tom cruise
Oct 22 2011,positive,as much as i dislike tom cruise he didnt bother me too much in this loose adaptation of the famous hg wells book some of the imagery is truly terrifying not in an obvious way but i just imagine myself in that situation and i cant help but get creeped out by those tripods and red weeds the basement scene with the alien scout giant eye of doom was very tense i hold my breath hoping it doesnt find them i really liked this when it was released
Oct 21 2011,positive,did not find the humor in this movie amue sing at all except for the killing
Oct 21 2011,negative,this movie scared me to death when i was little but i love apocolypses so i should see it again
Oct 21 2011,positive,pretty good close to the orginal
Oct 18 2011,positive,good follow and right on time
Oct 17 2011,positive,i didnt want this to end the first time i saw it and 2nd time and i really cant see anything wrong with the film only good stuff its a surreal take on the classic alien invasion thats why im giving it an 8
Oct 16 2011,positive,its a pass for a an adaption of the hg wells classic with barely enough character development and a few action sequences to keep you moderately entertained
Oct 16 2011,positive,911 haunts and informs this movie lending an unsettling atmosphere of realworld calamity and destruction to spielbergs movie spectacle tom cruise engages without asking to be liked its one of the more compelling of the eras portraits of an unheroic hero and the imagery and action sequences are strikingly effective a spielberg set piece even in mid to lowtier spielberg still outclasses nearly everyone else in hollywood couldve used a better script though
Oct 15 2011,positive,yikes at the negative audience ratings i dont see what was wrong with the film i dont see what was so amazing about it aside from the good although yelly childacting from dakota fanning but i definitely didnt see anything wrong with it solid blockbuster yo
Oct 15 2011,positive,anybody other than tom cruise
Oct 15 2011,positive,this is a good filmvery intense and pretty scary
Oct 14 2011,positive,omg i used to get yelled at for watching this movie all the time lol
Oct 13 2011,positive,one of my all time favorite alien movies very interesting view on a classic story
Oct 12 2011,negative,tom was great as jerry mcguire 
Oct 12 2011,positive,great special effects by the master and a great tribute to the book
Oct 11 2011,negative,terrible film  i had to sit through 2 hours of it only to get voice over to tell me how it ends
Oct 11 2011,positive,by the end of this film you find your self feeling a little bit let down its almost as if you think there is going to be something more but there is not
Oct 11 2011,positive,very different from the original but pretty good
Oct 11 2011,positive,ehhhnot bad of a remake
Oct 10 2011,negative,okay first of all ive never really liked tom cruise except in very few selected films in this film is no such exception his character is unlikable his acting barely average and i just cant relate to him his struggle with his children is more annoying than it is sympathetic and the rest of the actors arent that great either mostly this is because their motives remain hopelessly unclear i have no idea why they do whatever they do the only somewhat decent character was cruises daughter rachel ferrier dakota fanning though even she was more annoying than entertaining but at least her character felt genuine and setting the war of the worlds into modern times just doesnt work guys the whole movie is so full of plot holes and inconsistencies that it isnt even funny anymore especially the ending solution feels stupid but the visuals are nice the aliens are decently done and while the action is somewhat lackluster at least there is some and yeah this film isnt worth your time believe me if youre a diehard spielberg or cruise fan well go ahead if you must but the rest of you no
Oct 9 2011,negative,annoying characters boring concept and a bad movie
Oct 7 2011,negative,an hj wells adaptation starring tom cruise who gives a strong performance but cannot salvage the mediocre booktoscreen translation tim robbins is a surprising delight
Oct 6 2011,negative,not at all very good just wrong somehow
Oct 6 2011,positive,coooldude it is nice
Oct 6 2011,positive,one of spielbergs best that to this day remains one of the most underrated epics of the 00s
Oct 5 2011,positive,fantastic film loved it
Oct 3 2011,negative,ugh i hate tom cruise
Oct 3 2011,positive,i really dont understand the hatred for this film  while i agree that its nothing special i think that there are some scenes that are nothing short of remarkable  at times this film drips with spielberg schmaltz and at times it gleams with spielberg brilliance  this was the first time i really appreciated spielbergs ability to set up a shot and represent scale  dakota fanning gives the performance that set her up as the next drew barrymore as a child prodigy  there is also a stunningly shocking scene with tom cruise and tim robbins and a shovel  however what i have come to appreciate the most about this film is the simple story  this isnt a movie about aliens taking over the world  this is a story about a deadbeat dad trying to be a good fatherduring an alien attack
Oct 2 2011,positive,didnt meet expectations in the theatre
Oct 1 2011,positive,scary kinda more suspense and shocking
Sep 28 2011,positive,slick and smooth editing dazzling visual effects and modern day aliens prove that steven spielberg still has it in him
Sep 27 2011,negative,one word tom crusie i watched but was wanting to punch him in the fact the whole time because hes an idiot on and off screen
Sep 27 2011,negative,hmm kind of boring
Sep 26 2011,neutral,good effects weak everything else
Sep 25 2011,positive,its a decent attempt to recreate the original hg wells classic watching this on a screen where america is already used to alien invasions this movie fails however to cause sheer terror to its audience the kind that people felt 100 years ago when the story was broadcast over the radio
Sep 25 2011,positive,this is another movie where i have a lot of history with it started off as i saw tom cruise on the front cover on a poster and it looked cool then people were like oh the movie sucks the movie sucks so that lowered my hype until i saw a scene where the aliens first appeared and chased the locals i was like this is so badass and without listening to anyone i took full advantage of myself watched the movie myself and liked the movie myself as a steven spielberg director and david koepp writer film i am not going to hate this no way unless its the lost world how fucking sad all the actors do their best and the aliens were badass and justin chatwin still cant act that is no shock war of the worlds gets a 92510
Sep 25 2011,negative,wow  the best scene in the whole movie is when after a guy gets eaten by an alien in one of the landing tripods not one of the folks waiting in the same holding tank does a thing to stop him from being devoured but when its mr cruises turn to get digested everyone hangs onto him while he plants a grenade in the aliens lower intestinal tract  why do they grab him because hes tom cruise thats why  seriously go watch some paint dry or count stucco ridges on your ceiling for better entertainment there was no investment by viewers into the characters and one of the more disappointing moments is when the whiny son miraculously returns unscathed at the end of the movie after unsuccessfully trying to run directly towards the alien invaders in a futile attempt to escape tom cruises attempts at acting  guess no one was allowed to take the easy way out on this one
Sep 25 2011,positive,war of their family   
Sep 21 2011,negative,better off reading the book than wasting time on this rubbish
Sep 21 2011,negative,terrrible movie made no sense and was boring
Sep 21 2011,positive,that a great assignmentwhen trying to protect his children
Sep 16 2011,positive,hate tom cruise love this movie
Sep 13 2011,neutral,one of the worst endings of alien movies
Sep 10 2011,negative,it wouldve been an okay film if it didnt have justin chatwin he killed this movie for me
Sep 8 2011,positive,a 1010 alien invasion movie an absolute must see
Sep 8 2011,negative,overall a terrible movie  there are a lot of great effects but you have to sift through cruises ham and two children so annoying you end up constantly wishing they would be the next humans to suffer a horrible end  humanity as a whole seems to have a very victorian reaction to the whole invasion the level of panic nowhere near what one would actually expect  and then there is the facetoface encounter with the aliens which seems straight out of a pixar film
Sep 7 2011,neutral,not steven speilbergs best but its an alright actionscifi film
Sep 5 2011,positive,better then i expected it to be but still not great the original is still the best but its got a lot good moments in it
Sep 3 2011,negative,tom cruise should not even be thought to play in this movie the man gets worst by the year and frankly i am tired of spielbergs fetish with little fanning and anyone from her family he try to promote it would be a perfect movie without the  cast they choose keep tim robbins and get the guys from cloverfield to reboot asap
Sep 3 2011,positive,a great movie exciting adrenaline pumping great special effects
Sep 3 2011,negative,ideally being art a movie should never have to justify its existence or defend itself from questions to that effect however when someone like steven spielberg is involved and the final product barely stands out from contemporaries the why question suddenly starts to have a little more merit the fact is amidst all prior adaptations of war of the worlds the only standout feature of spielbergs take is that this is more or less the first time on the big screen the martians have been portrayed in their tripodal fighting machines after that its one step back after another its set in the modern era instead of the late 19th century its told from the perspective of a nighanonymous civilian instead of authoritative figures and bodies for all intents and purposes independence day was the updated war of the worlds and spielberg instead of trying something different seems to play it safe for the most part and ends up backpedaling for it
Sep 2 2011,negative,dont even know why i bothered
Aug 31 2011,positive,you really see a side of tom cruise youve never seen before one of his best
Aug 31 2011,positive,one of my favorite films so well done very scary too when you really think about it
Aug 31 2011,negative,didnt really dig it
Aug 30 2011,negative,this is by no definition a good movie its biggest flaw is as with many spielberg films its predictability the kids live the aliens die everyone is happy and even the teenager who was assumed to be dead returns
Aug 30 2011,positive,whats with me and these end of the world movies
Aug 30 2011,positive,a masterpieceif you mean the original one only
Aug 30 2011,positive,loved it tom cruise still kicks ass
Aug 29 2011,positive,fantastic film that leaves you on the edge of your seat
Aug 29 2011,positive,spielberg is the man
Aug 27 2011,positive,tom cruise is to running what forrest gump was to running
Aug 27 2011,negative,the ending just doesnt cut it for me
Aug 27 2011,positive,scarey movie just the thought of being fertilizer ha ha
Aug 26 2011,positive,interesting like it some one watcher only
Aug 25 2011,positive,not nearly as good as the original but the cgi infestation is very entertaining and if you can put up with dakota fannings screaming for 2 hrs then i think you could enjoy this because i sure did
Aug 23 2011,neutral,much is destroyed in steven spielbergs war of the worlds but the movie never quite delivers an emotional knockout blow
Aug 23 2011,positive,i think the director wanted to make a few bucks more this yearbut works as e
Aug 22 2011,negative,for the most part thrilling and frightening but unfortunately let down by imperfections and tim robbins scenes
Aug 21 2011,positive,a failed dad an annoying kid and an angry teenager watch the world being invaded by monsters both human and otherwise its properly terrifying and emotionally engaging even if the end seems anticlimactic
Aug 20 2011,positive,a dark science fiction film but i still loved this movie
Aug 19 2011,positive,if theres two people its fashionable for the elite filmgoers to criticise its steven spielberg and tom cruise they team up for this fantastic remake that isnt always true to previous adaptations of hg wells masterpiece  or the book itself tom cruise and dakota fanning both put in superb performances and the suspence is amazing war of the worlds is one of tom cruises best pieces in a distinguished career
Aug 18 2011,positive,a pretty awesome alien invasion flick the special effects were cool and it was very terrifying the aliens had a different look thank god and the acting was pretty good as well probably my favorite tom cruise flick
Aug 18 2011,negative,hmmm how to put this worst movie ever
Aug 17 2011,negative,so far this is the only steven spielberg movie i dont like
Aug 17 2011,positive,this is a film did i didnt like at first but as time passed i started to  appreciate it more the decision to take the original material and focus on the family instead of the military was a bold one  tom cruise gives an excellent performance as a father trying to establish a relationship with his children after a messy divorce who is right or wrong in the divorce is never really addressed it is clear the children have taken the mothers side and resist all attempts from their father to become closer   it shows the mother has remarried a more successful man and use this to make the father look more pathetic the children believe the father has nothing of value to offer them during the course of the film tom cruise shows his children not only his worth but to what ends he will take to keep them safe
Aug 16 2011,positive,good version of a good story loved it

Aug 15 2011,positive,great movie and another epic running scene from tom cruise
Aug 15 2011,positive,a good sciencefiction thriller its slowpaced for movie with so much action but its an entertaining watch
Aug 15 2011,negative,a stupid version of a good story
Aug 13 2011,positive,tom cruises best movie
Aug 10 2011,positive,best if seen on the big screen crap ending sure but a hell of an adrenaline ride
Aug 10 2011,positive,this was a great movie alot of action and a good story tom cruise did a great job in this film i liked the other actors too i recommend this movie
Aug 10 2011,positive,i like how this movie terrified my sister when we went to see it in the cinema
Aug 9 2011,positive,good ideas and brisk pace keep us interested until the supremely disappointing ending
Aug 9 2011,positive,i thought this movie was great it was entertaining thrilling action and adventure setting very tense film i loved it tom cruise giving another good performance and spielberg directing another masterpiece id see this film if you havent
Aug 9 2011,positive,only seen half though
Aug 9 2011,positive,a good but not amazing thriller
Aug 9 2011,positive,why is it that white boys always survive these types of movies he walked into a wall of fire you cant just show up at the end of the film unharmed and the aliens die because of germs is that because if the aliens won then the american audience would stock firearms in preparation of an intergalactic war dont get me wrong the film was good however it didnt translate well to the small screen via dvd dakota fannings anoying screaming and the predictible scene where the bodies float down the river was only redeamed by morgan freemans fantastic voice over
Aug 7 2011,positive,very silly plot and deffinetly spielberg at his worst but overall a pretty good movie
Aug 6 2011,neutral,it provides an original twist on a dated premise but consequently the actions of its characters are ultimately inconsequential to the movies conclusion and therefor its an hour and a half of unfulfilled expectations
Aug 6 2011,positive,the screaming kid killed it for me
Aug 6 2011,positive,this move is very fun ride you will love it from start to the very end
Aug 6 2011,positive,pretty ok good at times bad at times
Aug 6 2011,positive,great effects another solid performance by tom cruise  dakota fanning
Aug 5 2011,positive,solid scifi flick  i stayed up really late once to watch this on tv and i wanted to watch it again  wonderfully cast and directed i recommend this movie to everyone if you havent seen it yet
Aug 2 2011,positive,the plot is average the acting although very realistic its not very natural the effects oh lord this is a good oh lord this movie has the best effects of all time there is no comparison i just cant see any other movie with these effects its just a bit too good actually this makes things much better the movie is indeed a hit or miss but its also indeed thrilling this is what most alien invasion movies are thrillers most as in the exception being men in black close encounters of the third kind erm well uh 2001 a space odyssey and yes the movie is about aliens the monolith chocolate bar thing for most is an alien so is it good yep and not overwelling on action like independence day neither this is the golden cheese
Aug 1 2011,positive,war of the worlds is at first glance tom cruise movie but its actually more than meets the eyesteven spieldberg direction really makes the movie workthe special effects are eye popping and well craftedthe acting in this film is actually realisticwar the worlds is a movie that is a tribute to old 50s alien invasion filmsfor me personally i enjoyed myself
Aug 1 2011,positive,good in pieces that second half is quite the wreck
Jul 31 2011,positive,saw it in theatres and opposed to others i actually liked it could it have been better sure but it was pretty well done
Jul 31 2011,positive,as good as original was in its day
Jul 31 2011,positive,nothing wrong with this movie good special effects and story just a little error that tom cruise is the main character as i feel the part could have gone to someone better the aliens crafts look realistic enough to believe without being too over the top and the same goes for the aliens themselves sometimes the characters are a little annoying particularly the kids but they are just bearable although the ending is a little abrupt it is not as bad as some movies at least there is an explanation not spielbergs best work but its not bad i feel that it is watchable and not forgettable although the ending may need to be viewed twice in order to fully understand what happened a much needed remake which should spell the end of this particular film franchise
Jul 31 2011,neutral,its ok  but it could be a little better
Jul 30 2011,negative,the movie ends almost as suddenly as it started which is framework i guess but in between we see alot of humans running and getting squished like ants the movie is a decent remake of the novel only without any political statements and it moves along with a story and tom cruise did well but otherwise if you have read the book you know what you are in for coming into this there are however no great life lessons learned by the tornapart family no attempts to see the errors of their personal ways nor arming of knowledge that we can be better having survived such trials and tribulations the movie is about trying to survive and protect your loved ones for two hours
Jul 30 2011,positive,as fun and entertaining as jaws and raiders of the lost ark spielberg is again on form
Jul 29 2011,positive,the only reason this movie is good is because steven spielberg directed it
Jul 29 2011,positive,this is about to feel to be invade by aliens and thats what i felt
Jul 29 2011,neutral,great character development  tom cruise goes from a selfish schmuck to a good father in two hours wow terrific special effects
Jul 29 2011,negative,sorry steve i hate 2 say it but u killed the great 1953 classic
Jul 28 2011,positive,as flawed as some sequences may be and as innocent as spielbergs films are sometimes it delivers visual spectacle and thrilling rhythm alike strongly underrated
Jul 28 2011,positive,not as good as the original
Jul 26 2011,negative,the orginal was better
Jul 26 2011,positive,in all honesty i would give it a 35 a 4 and a quarter if i could if the ending wasnt what it was because up till then it was a engaging well shot film that at the same time maintained sfx to make it a good summer blockbuster but since the score on here is way too low in my opinion much for bad reason going by the reviews i read tom cruise hate really ill give it a five
Jul 25 2011,positive,a very misunderstood and underrated movie probably cruises best performance and the most unique alien invasion movie
Jul 25 2011,positive,the movie has an excellent storyline tom cruises role is perfect for the character directed in an excellent way makes this movie quite watchable
Jul 24 2011,positive,with the talent of spielberg and cruise and unlimited resources at hand this was quite a disappointmentnonetheless it is interesting enough to recommend
Jul 23 2011,positive,if  this  really happened  i would  not be as  put together as cruise was i would run around  like  a chicken with  my head chopped  off
Jul 23 2011,positive,i guess theyre not all like et
Jul 23 2011,positive,although i am a fan of tom cruise i didnt really like this
Jul 22 2011,positive,old or new this is excellent
Jul 22 2011,positive,good movie again lots of action
Jul 21 2011,neutral,not spielbergs best but it has a few good moments
Jul 20 2011,neutral,when i heard this movie was coming and spielberg was at the helm i was very excited to see the result  i have read and enjoyed the book and had hoped for a more accurate adaptation than the previous film  well upon seeing the film i had mixed reactions  had it not been called war of the worlds i may have enjoyed it more or maybe expected less  the story takes a bit to set up but moves fast once it gets going not that there is a wealth of story to be had here  effects are good and are on par with films of the time although the alien design is a bit uninspired and their tripods feel exceptionally improbable  but exciting and interesting action sequences are present although the script doesnt provide much excitement between them  the cast largely does a good job although i think there could have been a better choice for the character of ray than tom cruise but he does alright  the biggest blemish in the film in my mind are the scenes involving tim robbins  they feel completely out of place in the tone of the rest of the film and i could honestly say the entire sequence could be cut from the film without damaging or losing anything from the remainder of the film  recommended for those that want a straight forward hollywood sci fi adaptation of a classic sci fi novel that has a completely bizarre and uneccessarily dark sequence late in the second act  and those who love tom cruise
Jul 19 2011,positive,such an amazing movie  classicly crazy
Jul 19 2011,negative,i like itbut its just screaming throughout the entire movie 
Jul 17 2011,negative,good cgi and effect but annoying characters especially dakota fanning it seemed more as a run here scream type of movie it was predictable type where you knew everyone was almost going to die but eventually they would find a button or main computer or something to shut them off
Jul 17 2011,positive,nice and lovely flm with great concepttommmy boy was cool in there
Jul 17 2011,positive,makes you feel like a looser you dont want to be human as you continue to watch this misery but at the same time you cant look away bad part is they dont really take the time to make you feel again and makes you wonder if we won or not
Jul 16 2011,positive,as ridiculously violent as spielberg films are i knew it was only a matter time before he just started vaporizing people oh the horror but man does it look cool still as dazzling as it looks that doesnt mean that the film isnt rather disturbing of course thats not the films only flaw the film suffers from slow spots the occasional editing fault noisy points abrupt scene conclusions and a bit of a forced deus ex machina i also had a problem with the cinematography in that it is overemphasized simple scenes of dialogue lack calmness and subtlety because their shot too vividly however as overmphasized as the cinematography is it remains absolutely beautiful and whenever a scene calls for that kind of vividness it looks beautiful and gritty especially when its being backed up by truly stellar visual effects    before we touch on the effects lets touch on the films other strengths such as an effective hook incredible sound chilling tensity and emotional resonanse as for the performances theure sublte yet effective the actors rarely have anything heavy to work with but they constantly keep up an aura of genuine compellingness further proving that the razzies cant always be trusted sorry tom still it all comes back to the visual effects which are so stunning and blend so well into the environment but dont feel too focused upon the effects are dazzling and truly something to see but dont get in the way of the story in fact they keep the story tense and compelling    in the end though spielbergs take on war of the worlds isnt the most feelgood apocalypse film it remains a gritty deeply compelling epic backed up by truly stunning digital sights to see

Jul 16 2011,neutral,not spielbergs best but it has a few good moments
Jul 15 2011,neutral,a must watch for every family
Jul 13 2011,negative,good sfx but kinda poor acting
Jul 12 2011,positive,i liked how speilberg twisted this up to make it more modern and more believeable im not generally a tom cruise fan but he did this well as did lil ms fanning i was genuinely scared at times which is hard for movies to do to me these days
Jul 12 2011,positive,the best movie ever yeah
Jul 11 2011,positive,love the actors in this
Jul 11 2011,positive,always tough to have a good ending for these types of moviesthats what separates a 3 from a 4
Jul 10 2011,positive,i actually really enjoyed this remake much more than the original
Jul 10 2011,positive,this film gave me chills not unlike jurassic park just not quite as good as that film
Jul 10 2011,positive,i like it specialy bcouse was film where i used to live
Jul 9 2011,neutral,nothing on the original but the scene in the basement is intense
Jul 9 2011,positive,a well thought out adaptation of hg wells novel
Jul 8 2011,positive,good but dakota fanning was sooo annoying
Jul 8 2011,positive,not nearly as bad as i thought it was going to be worth a watch if theres nothing else on
Jul 7 2011,negative,mmmkeannu reeves i like and i did not mind his acting partsit just lacked that little something i cant quite put my finger on
Jul 7 2011,positive,a great thriller with a lot of moments that gave me the chills i do believe it could have been better but steven spielberg did his best and he created a movie with a strong cast and a great story overall war of the worlds isnt steven spielbergs best movies but its worth a watch
Jul 6 2011,positive,the sound affects were awesome
Jul 6 2011,positive,exceptional special effects nonstop pacing spielbergian story telling at its best but hindered by the endless annoyances of a fractured family subplot
Jul 6 2011,negative,here are my questions spoiler alert  how did the son not die and somehow make it to the mothers house  if youre an alien race that can make the type of machinery and weaponry how could you not check the local environment to make sure you could actually survive
Jul 4 2011,positive,tom cruises dysfunctional performance along the first 30 minutes and a  lot of exposition dialog throughout the whole thing certainly do not  benefit this movie but at some point cruise gets the chance to play a  scared fuup which i found he does pretty well for some reason and  between all the dull dialog there are enough authentic performances and  an outrageously talented dacota fanning to make this movie not appear  cheaply written    the rest i found just pretty fuing awesome meaning not just the  action spielberg doesnt forget to not just deliver dialog and  explosions but some actual scenes and among them a few damn effective  ones great movie great cinema its not a spielberg movie for  nothing
Jul 4 2011,positive,gets into the plot quickly and keeps you completely captivated the whole time
Jul 4 2011,positive,just like most remakes not as good as the original
Jul 3 2011,neutral,even herbert wells and tom cruise teamed together cant save steven spielberg from making another horor movie about alien invasion and brave ordinary man
Jul 2 2011,positive,dakota fanning is the movie biggest right
Jul 2 2011,positive,check out my movie reviews at 
Jul 2 2011,neutral,not too bad tom cruise ruins it and the plot is awful they could have made it so much more better the original book by hg wells destroys this movie handsdown and this movie does not do justice to the brilliance of wells fantastic genius if you read the book and then the film youll see how trashy this film really is
Jul 1 2011,positive,wont be seing that one again
Jul 1 2011,positive,i liked the movie tom cruise and fanning gave good performances but some major plot holes also like the ships buried in the ground etc good movie overall though
Jul 1 2011,positive,i liked it dont care what others say
Jun 30 2011,positive,good but not great the kids are annoying
Jun 28 2011,positive,i guess its spielbergs first movie with an alien antagonist what works here are the special effects that are ground breaking no pun intended and tom cruise does not save the world but is a mere spectator of the war of the worlds spielberg has been out of this special effects action genre for a while and good to see him back with this spectacle
Jun 27 2011,positive,i was a little let down by this one
Jun 26 2011,positive,this is one of my favorite movies of all time apart from the special effects i think this movie was a huge success i also think that people not including the critics are looking at this movie the wrong way giving it a hard time
Jun 26 2011,positive,well donebelievable fxwelles would have approved
Jun 26 2011,positive,holy cow the movie blew me away very riveting very exciting the special effects were incredible i thought the alien tripod war machines were awesome i thought it was also reasonably faithful to the original book by hg wells with some understandable updating i took points off for language your kids will have nightmares wait till theyre older
Jun 26 2011,positive,a creative take on a classic film and book with great performances a twisting plot and fantastic cinematography this movie is a must see
Jun 26 2011,positive,a great adaptation of the hg wells story
Jun 26 2011,positive,this film was very impressive it wasnt one that tried to scare you with jumps but you still had that exhaustion of anxiety that kept you wondering the whole time the graphics are very impressive for a 2005 movie steven spielberg definitely impressed me with this dramatic paranormal tale
Jun 26 2011,positive,2005s war of the worlds is a genuinely thrilling blockbuster that although failing to achieve that special something that allows a summer film to sit with the big budget greats still manages to entertain and excite as well as capture some of the paranoia associated with the original novel largely due to the presence of blockbuster king himself steven spielberg at the helm he brings his agame to directing war of the worlds and with his steadyhand the movie is remarkably efficient and relatively characterdriven for a summer blockbuster despite a script that is not necessarily great suspension of disbelief is required at points and a resolution that feels rushed overly clean and a little trite the movie manages to hold the viewers attention regardless being a nice surprise that reaffirms spielbergs talent for knowing how to use special effects to enhance mood atmosphere and our emotional involvement in the characters rather than just to blow up some stuff real good and of course you can damn well expect that before the end of the movie some stuff will have blown up real good as well     the movie wisely keeps its story focused on a small number of individuals ray tom cruise and his children rachel dakota fanning and robbie justin chatwin ray a bluecollar construction worker comes home one day and finds himself having to care for his two children a task he is not necessarily prepared for normally they stay with his exwife but since she is going to boston to visit her parents she has dropped them off with ray after a little setup where we get to know these characters everything sort of goes to hell as well that hole in the ground everyone walks toward early on in the film yup turns out to be a giant alientripod and it generally does a good job of deathraying find a cooler verb than that everyone around it luckily ray escapes the initial confrontation and amidst the carnage around him he gets his two kids and decides to get the hell out of there where to well to boston of course who wouldnt want to go see a red sox game while aliens are destroying the world and killing everyone well actually hes going naturally because thats where his ex and her family are and new york and the surrounding environs dont really seem up to snuff for surviving what with the giant tripod around and such     the movie wisely understands that it is a movie about a father and his kids running from aliens and the sense of desperation the alien invasion creates in not only ray but in everyone around him we dont get any hollow and mindless specialeffects driven battles between the army and the tripods what no helicopter vs death ray fight or silly shenanigans regarding ray becoming this ultracapable alien killer either ray has his chance to shine but much of that simply comes from his ability to run away and escape while keeping himself and his kids alive rather than because he can drop an alien or two unlike most summer blockbusters comparisons to another highprofile alien invasion blockbuster independence day are inevitable this film knows that you can be big and small at the same time here all the special effects driven carnage which there is a lot of occurs around ray and his children and we feel suspense because we care about them and want to see them survive rather than because that explosion we just saw looked hella cool or anything as hollow as that the movie never feels like its overextending itself to show more action or make the scale artificially bigger at the expense of a focused concise story with relatable characters and this is the smartest decision made by the writer and the director in short spielbergs ability to find the human story in his material shines through as always    also worth noting is the tone of war of the worlds which is surprisingly and effectively grim this film is dark for a summer blockbuster with death and destruction all around the main characters almost all the time in terms of the terror displayed on screen this is much more akin to an rrated pseudohorror movie than a light airy summer blockbuster the dark atmosphere extends to the paranoiaaspect of the film too although the aliens are the chief villains sufficient time is allotted to hint at the degree to which such a catastrophic occurrence will cause brother to turn against brother with their electronics shut off due to electromagnetic pulses  and a dwindling food supply people begin to panic and people who are friendly and casual in everyday life begin to do what they need to in order to survive sometimes at the expense of other people while the movie doesnt focus on this in the way that a highcaliber drama might room still has to be made for humans getting their asses handed to them by aliens and of course the requisite small doses of human kicking a little ass back it still does a solid job with this material which is refreshing in a blockbuster such as this  because of the dark tone while war of the worlds is often exciting fun isnt really the word to describe this production     on the acting front tom cruise is solid and believable he wont win any oscars for this performance but its nice to see him playing a character that isnt charming in that typically tom cruise way dakota fanning shows she can scream and plays her part amiably but i would have liked more for her to do while justin chatwin who occupies the least screen time out of the three principle characters also feels a little underwritten although considering his relatively limited screen time this isnt a fatal flaw the only other notable performer is tim robbins as a man whose family was killed and who provides shelter for ray late in the film this sequence is a change of pace for the film is quite suspenseful and shows that the film isnt afraid to get even darker than it was early in the proceedings     war of the worlds makes good on the promises of the concept of humans fighting to survive in an alien invasion this is really where the movie works best as its relative restraint makes the movie more immediate suspenseful and emotionally involving whereas any other movie would have turned the budget into an opportunity for cramming in scenes of aliens destroying landmarks and other cities all over the world almost every scene here focuses on ray and his children the military is often present but the film never brings ray into the knowhow on what the military is doing and as such the film wisely keeps things streamlined and eliminates extraneous characters and subplots that would distract from the central premise of a man trying to keep his family alive spielberg understands that spectacle doesnt have to mean taking the viewer away from the characters that the movie has built up and because of this the events depicted in war of the worlds are gripping and exciting rather than hollow and meaningless this is the main reason why war of the worlds succeeds where so many summer movies become the victims of their own budget and ultimately underwhelm war of the worlds shows that although spielberg may not have made many great movies recently hes still remarkably consistent and he knows how to make a big movie that remembers that theres more to a big movie than being big for the sake of it     rating 8010
Jun 26 2011,positive,a suspenseful remake that works for today and tomorrow
Jun 25 2011,positive,going against the grain here dont care what gospel cruise is preaching and i thought fanning was appropriate casting material fun remake and a feast for sight and sound on bluray
Jun 25 2011,positive,another view of world
Jun 22 2011,positive,an extremely enjoyable movie that also puts a twist on aliens changes their stereotypical appearance and ways of attack which makes it extremely interesting very well acted and amazing effects
Jun 22 2011,neutral,ok but not my speed did not like the ending
Jun 22 2011,positive,3 stars for the movie effects but not for tom cruise acting

Jun 21 2011,positive,what viewers have to acknowledge immediately is that this isnt an alieninvasion film its a drama about a dysfunctional family    but even with that distinction youll be hard pressed to find anyone who will tell you they liked any of these characters or found any chemistry between them in the end its a series of emotionally inconsequential events delivering little to no feeling for its viewers    still you cant deny how spielberg rocks the disastertheme in several well directed scenes from the average joes perspective its visually engaging enough to sit through thats for sure
Jun 20 2011,positive,thought it was an excellent movie too much screaming though on some scenes
Jun 20 2011,positive,amazing story of a father trying to get his kids to safety tom cruse is jaw dropping in this epic performance
Jun 20 2011,negative,cant quote  movies good but dakote and cruise in the same movie its too much for me
Jun 18 2011,positive,war of the worlds is quite possibly the most suspenseful and terrifying alien invasion of our time due to solid realism and creativity by director steven spielberg dynamic yet frightening visuals and strong performances from both tom cruise and dakota fanning
Jun 18 2011,positive,extremely suspenseful
Jun 18 2011,negative,it had the potential to be one of the brilliant scifi thrillers and it did worked like an effective suspense for the major part of the movie but loses it all in the end no wonder the visuals are great but no movie can work without a good story and thats what is true about this film too the reception couldve been totally different if the ending was written in a whole different way than depicted a great suspense in the first half a big disappointment in the second
Jun 18 2011,positive,it grew on me but not as good as most alien invasion films the plot was great and because its more darker than most films like this and it only adds to it all my main problem with this film is dakota fanning her character was so annoying and i was waiting for her to be killed off but we all know kids never die but tom cruise was great to watch as he always is
Jun 17 2011,positive,rw was inpired by tom cruise character which lessons the value of all of his movies for me
Jun 15 2011,neutral,phallic imagery and weird butthole cage on the tripod  tom cruise film
Jun 15 2011,negative,war of the worlds  total piece of shit
Jun 15 2011,positive,i love it and you wil love it too
Jun 14 2011,positive,good  still like the first one best
Jun 14 2011,positive,steven spielberg has done it again i dont see how anybody can hate this
Jun 14 2011,positive,itâtms rewarding to see director steven spielberg return to the alien studies for which we know him best  his earlier films close encounters of the third kind and et the extraterrestrial were classic and much less intense but seeing him revisit such a marvelous concept is phenomenal  the running up satisfier about this adrenalineheavy thriller is that it is not merely an adaptation of hg wellsâtms classic novel it is a 21st century twist narrated reverently by morgan freeman  it was also one of three versions of the story in 2005  all remakes of the 1953 film the war of the worlds    full review 
Jun 13 2011,positive,when i saw this i spent a majority of my time watching this film hating tom cruise
Jun 12 2011,negative,i honestly couldnt remember if i saw this  still not sure
Jun 11 2011,positive,allittle better than i expected
Jun 10 2011,positive,steven spielberg brings war of the worlds to life in fantastic ways it examines the survivialist nature of mankind and also serves as an interesting cautionary tale to wouldbe invaders of our planet i also enjoyed the addition of another of spielbers intense hide and seek scenes last seen in jurassic park a good movie that offers good acting and cinematography
Jun 10 2011,positive,this is one of my favorite scifi movies ever spielberg and cruise keep the tension high the entire thrillride
Jun 10 2011,positive,slightly entertaining
Jun 10 2011,positive,i would love to watch this  i think this movie will give me goosebumps d
Jun 9 2011,negative,the beginning is pretty cool but after the initial attack it just keeps going downhill and i remember wanting to slap dakota fannings annoying face
Jun 8 2011,positive,dakota fanning enough said shes awesome
Jun 8 2011,neutral,i prefer hg wells novel and the orson welles radio broadcast
Jun 8 2011,positive,a fun bgrade alien flick that at times provide a scary undertone and hold powerful performances from both tom cruise and dakota fanningthis is a blast to sit through again and again
Jun 7 2011,negative,butchered the original
Jun 6 2011,positive,war of the worlds 910
Jun 6 2011,positive,entertaining and puts a family fare twist on the original story spielberg once again is in complete control of his cast and crew
Jun 5 2011,positive,i thought it was a great remake of the radio show from the 1930s
Jun 5 2011,negative,really hated this blockbuster when it was released and still do standard stuff pretty boring actually and brought nothing new to the table cruise is limp
Jun 4 2011,neutral,not usually interested in alien movies but this one is great
Jun 3 2011,negative,ive never seen it but sounds good so idk
Jun 3 2011,positive,war of the worlds is a thrilling and fun movie from beginning to end although a scifi movie it has a sense of humor are these the terrorists tom cruise was not nearly as bad as i heard he was in this movie i think people let his personal life clout his acting abilities him and spielberg always make good movies and war of the worlds is no different this spielberg and cruises second pairing is equally as good as minority report even those who hate the movie say they liked the special effects the special effects made the movie worth the watch alone but with some solid performances and great directing from spielberg its easily one of the most fun ive seen
Jun 3 2011,negative,reading down the reviews im surprised by the widelyvarying takes on this film given how strongly i felt about it thats a great lesson in the diversity of taste when i saw it at the theater several people laughed outloud or booed when the credits started rolling the special effects were amazing but in no way could they make up for a poorlymade film the script was convoluted the characters were shallow the dialogue was akward and the subplots were clunky the original book is dated to be sure but it featured themes and ideas disturbing enough to spark audience imaginations for decades speilberg who openly admits his fascination with children experiencing loss uses a script which tries to create subplot tension between cruise and his exwife his inlaws and his son this is distracting weakly executed and explored in a very superficial way the plot has several confusing holes and simply doesnt make much sense let alone move me and as usual i was told what emotions to feel and when by the saccharine orchestral score but what really made the movie so bad for me was the excessive time spent showing the aliens why not leave them to the imagination hitchcock and many other directors right up to the blair witch folks have proven that our own imaginations are usually more powerful at scaring us the more screen time devoted to the aliens the less interesting and scary they became i dont understand how this film with nearly limitless financial and artistic resources and a famously successful book at its roots managed to be so ponderous
Jun 3 2011,positive,not bad not good but again not good
Jun 2 2011,positive,the directors could have really done a lot more with this film and put more wow factor into it and it had the opportunity to be done so it gets a 35
Jun 2 2011,positive,like orsons version better more impact
Jun 1 2011,positive,while it will never top the original gem from 1953 it still manages to be an awesome and well made scifi epic
May 31 2011,negative,a film so bad i it cant even be called bgrade quality war of the worlds offers up an alien invasion with impressive visualstucked away in the background that is with the focus instead on a dysfunctional family featuring two of hollywoods most wooden and overhyped actors tom cruise and dakota fanning  just as the movie starts to touch on various scifi or excitement aspects it cuts away to some family moment usually conflict leaving you going hey get back there  a shame since its obvious much effort went into the special effects only to have them sidelined  after the disastrously awful ai this film made me wonder if spielberg shouldnt just hang up his moviemaking hat
May 31 2011,positive,i thought this was a pretty cool movie  maybe not the best plot but it kept me interested and was original with the visuals
May 30 2011,negative,not as good as the original
May 29 2011,neutral,thought it was ok but cruise and spielberg have both made way way better movies
May 29 2011,positive,verry good lots of action
May 28 2011,negative,tom cruis need  i say more
May 28 2011,positive,steven spielberg is back with aliens but this time taking over the world on his verson of war of the worlds and it is one of the best movies from him and also one of the best action packed remake on my list a
May 28 2011,negative,they took a really great movie and destoried it so disappointed
May 27 2011,positive,war of the worlds is taut gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking
May 26 2011,positive,good movie  new movie from the oldthats what made good
May 26 2011,positive,ah this is what we needed a well recognized director working with a superstar yes cruisespielberg team at its best first of all why because they understood wells novel the paranoia the chaos made by the invasion till we arrive to a point when we start to destroy ourselves the love for our family and to protect it a theme which spielberg is very familiar with and everything about the invasion is in here tripods blood bacterias the red weed well except the cylinders and the black smoke but they made a mix of some resources for adapting it into modern times cruises performance is fresh but the one who shines in here is dakota fanning on eof the best films by spielberg loyal enough to the original novel
May 26 2011,positive,this is best alien takeover remake movie
May 25 2011,positive,one of the better alien invasion flicks
May 25 2011,positive,i love tom cruise or this movie wouldnt be as good
May 23 2011,positive,good for scifi junkies despite presence of tcts
May 23 2011,positive,great special effects
May 23 2011,positive,primo home theatre tester just play the scene when they first come out of the ground window shattering stuff would ya expect anything less from steven
May 22 2011,positive,dont see how people can hate this yeah the ending is a little weird but the concept acting and graphics are fantastic
May 22 2011,negative,piece of crap with a bad actor i hate waste my money for shit like that
May 22 2011,positive,an epic and expert rendition of the original story concept
May 20 2011,positive,to the people who didnt appreciate it i ask what would you have done differently
May 20 2011,negative,this movie is fucking terrible
May 20 2011,negative,having read the book i am aware that the 1950s version of this film was far less accurate however this film just felt mediocre to me and just seemed like a money spinner such is the way of modern hollywood
May 19 2011,positive,what a great film this is the kind of film that makes me jump up to the edge of my seat tom cruise and dakota fanning made a perfect duo in this film to bring frights bright lights a on the edge suspence i give this film 5 whole well deserved stars
May 19 2011,positive,ok but really getting tired of the remakes
May 19 2011,positive,one of the better postapocalyptic movies out there
May 18 2011,positive,grounded exhausting and claustrophobic beautifully filmed and well acted as well as effectively pointofview  wow is one of spielbergs under rated gems
May 18 2011,positive,this adaptation is spielbergs way of doing independence day with his tastes in scifi flicks than roland emmerichs tastes in disaster flicks which was the films subgenre the visual effects are more enhancing and an addition in suspense but more effective and weird this film places spielberg between james camerons titanic and emmerichs way of these kind of films b    full review coming soon
May 18 2011,positive,this movie had plenty of action in it cruise did a decent job and fanning just screamed too much which became annoying the visual effects were decent but it was just the retelling of the hg wells tale nothing to get excited about but worth a look
May 17 2011,positive,love these kinds of shows
May 17 2011,neutral,i liked it all the way up until the endwhich made the movie suck
May 17 2011,neutral,ok but nowhere as good as the original
May 15 2011,positive,not a fan of tom cruise yet another boring role for him
May 15 2011,positive,3 stars for spielberg not for cruise
May 14 2011,negative,tom cruise worst movie he ever made sucked
May 14 2011,positive,will day like this come to our world
May 14 2011,positive,when i first saw this film i was frightened by it and thought it was well done i was a thrill to watch and being unfamiliar with the original i found myself not knowing what was going to happen  going back to this film years later i find some of the dialogs to be stupid in addition the ending was too hollywood
May 12 2011,positive,big fan of hg wells big fan of spielberg well who isnt not a bad movie not a great movie ill say this much its entertaining and well made
May 12 2011,positive,this was a pretty entertaining film that had an interesting human element to it i liked the special effects and how it told more of a story than just aliens zapping people i thought the relationship with the father son and daughter was a good touch and showed to a point what it would really be like if a situation like this happened
May 11 2011,neutral,promising but it doesnt quite live up to that promise
May 11 2011,positive,stephen spielberg really hit the mark with this amazing depiction of an alien invasion the invasion is shown entirely from the point of view of a dock worker named ray ferrier played by tom cruise and his two kids rachel and robbie cruise is awesome and his performance is one of his more memorable ones dakota fanning can be annoying with her earpiercing screams but her acting is great for her age war of the worlds works so well because it makes some of the best use of special effects ive ever seen and creates a true terror deep inside of you unexplainable things occur before our eyes and they arent always explained because explaining it would make the terror more understandable and less effective
May 11 2011,negative,like the first one better
May 11 2011,negative,deeply depressing film
May 10 2011,positive,a good remake to the original
May 9 2011,negative,a rare bad movie by spielberg felt like killing dakota fanning whenever she screams in the movie
May 8 2011,neutral,it was good but one of those movies thats much better in the older version as the special effects actually take more away than add to it  sometimes if the story is good dont ruin it with specials not that there isnt a time and place for them
May 7 2011,positive,despite the negative stigma due to cruises now infamous oprah show episode i was able to enjoy wotw i liked the original film adaptation and was interested in what spielburg had in store
May 7 2011,positive,a movie that uses the alien invasion tropes in a fresh manner this movie remains frightening it could have gone the way of so many other alien invasion movies and then you remember steven spielberg directed it
May 6 2011,positive,seen it more than 2 timesall were good
May 6 2011,positive,got this on blu recently and not only is it way better than the original movie its a damn sight darker than other movies of its ilk how did the studio allow that ending though 
May 5 2011,neutral,movie was ruined wdakota fanning and tim robbins
May 5 2011,positive,hope nothing like that ever happens
May 5 2011,positive,shouldve been alot better especially whos in it tom cruise  dakota fanning directed by spielberg
May 5 2011,negative,took a great story and butchered it with the hollywood aspect
May 5 2011,negative,dont waste time and money on this piece of shit boring and ridiculous movie h g wells should be ashamed
May 3 2011,negative,dumber than the americans that believed it was true in the first place cruise is rubbish
May 2 2011,positive,not a bad remake but couldve been so much better i like cruise in the mi films but im not really a fan otherwise and this film shows why however the state of the art cgi makes the aliens more realistic and the film isnt bad but do check out the original
May 1 2011,negative,tom cruz was a babe in his own time
Apr 30 2011,positive,disturbing but predictable
Apr 30 2011,positive,a fantastic adaption of hg wells novel the effects were amazing the acting was superb spielberg was perfect for this movie i still think that it should be remade in a few years in a movie that follows the actual novel basing the film in 1800s england then we could all see hg well vision on the big screen
Apr 29 2011,positive,wasnt bad but the aliens were funky lookin
Apr 29 2011,negative,tom cruise just make me laugh in this movie
Apr 27 2011,positive,not bad but drifts off toward the end
Apr 26 2011,positive,like all other incarnations of hgwells classic story spielbergs adaptation is a product of its time fueled by the fears that still prevail in this post 911 world
Apr 25 2011,positive,okay but not scary enough
Apr 25 2011,positive,i honestly expected more but not so much so that i will condemn it with a green tomato    i was a little disappointed with this one usually any film that is directed by steven speilberg will be a winner at the box office and i guess war of the worlds has been  but i think that this has much more to do with general expectation hype and the immense bankability of its main star tom cruise than it does the movie itself    the movie does have brilliant special effects and whilst it does have a bit of an america saves the day tone to it its storyline is a little more complex and interesting than many of its brainless blockbuster counterparts    if you want the real grass roots experience of this story  read the book      overall it was very easy to watch but dont expect to come out raving    recommendations     watch it if you liked transformers independence day armageddon    dont watch it if you typically dont like big showy blockbusters dont like suspense    could children be in the room nope stick to 15 years and over for this one
Apr 24 2011,positive,one of the underrated spielberg films that not deserves to be vanishing
Apr 24 2011,positive,only movie i like with cruise
Apr 24 2011,negative,it has to many loose ends and me as a viewer focuses often focus on those things for instance an advanced civilization thousands of year more advanced than us does not do research prior to invading an alien planet the film has thrills reminiscent of those in signsbut tries to throw in some action which does not coincide well with the rest of the films pace entertaining at times but easily one of spielbergs weaker moments
Apr 24 2011,positive,i really enjoy alien movies
Apr 23 2011,positive,it was creepy and all dont get me i was freaked out after watching but it was just a blob of running screaming crying and hiding basically every character annoyed me in some way but it was not a bad movie
Apr 23 2011,negative,one star for special effects and thats about all
Apr 22 2011,positive,yet again i have to bring up the classics that make it difficult for old people no offense to appreciate movies this time i might have to agree with them though im not a fan of tom cruises acting but other than that this was a decent movie
Apr 22 2011,positive,war of the worlds is an entertaining and exciting remake of hg wells classic the film has received flack for its casting of tom cruise who by this point was pretty much screwing up his career with the famous couch incident and his open support for the church of scientology considering all that one cannot expect anything good from this right well i was surprised to say the least i quite enjoyed this film and i thought it was a terrific sci fi action  horror film if thats what you want to call it cruise himself isnt too bad and i never really was a fan of his only for a few exceptions i find him to be quite the average actor war of the worlds is an awesome visual feast i can understand why people seem to hate this film and i view it as an either you love it or hate it i loved it i thought the story was horrifying thrilling and dramatic war of the worlds has got to be the best sci fi film dealing with alien invaders since the remake of invaders of the body snatcher in 1978 steven spielberg crafts a film thats bold and brash as this was made after 911 and with that in mind you know that this is a film that takes risky because it shows aliens destroying civilization and destroying humans the story is good and should appeal to sci fi fans and for the most part war of the worlds is quite an awesome sci fi action film with horror elements thrown in people should give it a chance and not be turned off by the fact that tom cruise is in this
Apr 22 2011,negative,very disappointing no music from the original score all froth and no beer
Apr 22 2011,negative,nothing more than another tom cruise turd
Apr 21 2011,positive,it was a good movie   b
Apr 21 2011,positive,another alien invasion film the only reason it is better than most is because it is directed by steven spielberg and the visuals are excellent dakota fanning ruined it with her incessant screaming though
Apr 20 2011,positive,a thrilling movie that is very entertaining cruise is excellent and the visuals are awesome but dakota fanning just has to shut up damn it was annoying besides that slightly flawed film
Apr 20 2011,positive,the only movie worth watching by tom cruise
Apr 19 2011,positive,i enjoyed this movie alot
Apr 19 2011,negative,learn how to throw a fucking baseball and peanut butter sandwich tom cruise you fucking fairy
Apr 19 2011,positive,incredibly intense and suspenseful special fx are mindblowing has quite a few plot holes and and an anticlimactic ending though grade b
Apr 19 2011,positive,this would of been a five star if not for tom cruises typical bravado and themekilling hes been chased through dirt and death and at the end hes still cleanshaven not sweaty not greasy in fact his fair was still prettyboy perfect  directors need to avoid this actor or start pushing him around
Apr 18 2011,negative,tom  steven among disappointing movies
Apr 18 2011,positive,absolutely my favourite spielberg recreation ive probably seen it a dozen times and it still never fails to completely captivate my favourite bluray without a doubt
Apr 17 2011,negative,disapoinment from both spilberg and cruise

Apr 15 2011,negative,not really beautiful
Apr 14 2011,positive,fun to watch if you like these kind of movie
Apr 12 2011,positive,great most of the time but boring at points
Apr 12 2011,positive,when the director of jaws and raiders of the lost ark announces hes making an alien invasion film there comes attached a certain buzz of excitement for my money steven spielberg is at his most effective as a filmmaker when the subject matter is for want a better expression cheaper thats not taking anything away from the likes of saving private ryan but its hard to think of anyone who entertains so wildly yet humanises what should be throwaway low rent material its true testament to his talent that a film about a giant fish terrorising a beach community endures to be celebrated and revered as much today as it has ever been so on to war of the worlds spielbergs stab at reviving hg wells seminal classic thriller modern day alien invasion films have screened the end of the world as a global catastrophe with vast military presence presidents ordering go to defcon4  and an abundance of cgi critters what we have here and in keeping with the spielberg style is a more personal account of the invasion as told through the eyes of tom cruises ray ferrier as he and his two children flee the alien apocalypse this keyhole view of the invasion is a daring but highly effective move at times we glimpse the unfolding disaster in the background as it envelops everything behind our escaping protagonists thats not to say that ther arent jaw dropping full on cgi moments but these are done sparingly and without ever feeling like somethings being jammed into your face until you submit transformers anyone spielberg also understands the threat and suspense created by implication as opposed to full on exposure when it comes to use of sound as with jaws spielberg proved how much you can heighten that sense of impending danger with a few notes in war of the worlds the alien invaders have machines that omit a low sonic boom that immediately sends shivers down the spine and recalls the ominous sound of the air raid siren used during world war ii its another master stroke a simple idea executed for maximum impact jumping and leaping around like an energiser bunny tom cruise brings great verve to the film and instead of playing the all american hero his character is presented as a failing father whos relationship with his children borders on mutual apathy once all hell breaks loose that dysfunction allows the film a pleasing dramatic scope which helps drive the film forward on two fronts if i have any criticism itd be that the film isnt long enough in some ways thats a back handed compliment such was my enjoyment that i was disappointed when the end came so abruptly all things considered though another fine addition to an impressive catalogue of films from the true king of the summer blockbuster 45
Apr 12 2011,negative,finally sat through all of this movie because i was bed ridden with the flu  what spoils it for me is the fact that not one of the main characters behaves in a manner that is believable  they behave dramatically to the extreme in the case of the daughter character  but not in a way that is for a second believable  and so i could not sympathize with them  the son especially
Apr 11 2011,positive,most of the points im giving this movie come from the action
Apr 11 2011,positive,visually stunning  acting wasnt the greatest but it was acceptable  kind of disappointing that an entire alien machine could be destroyed by just one grenade or a few grenade launcherskind of makes you think about whether or not these aliens were really a threat to mankind   ending wasnt that satisfying but still the bacteria concept was clever    overall a good movie everything id expect from steven spielberg d
Apr 11 2011,positive,this was amazing d
Apr 9 2011,positive,awesome movie simply awesome speechless wow why hadnt i seen this earlier wow so good intense like crazy woah

Apr 8 2011,positive,i really like it i just think its not spielbergs best
Apr 8 2011,positive,pretty good for a remake
Apr 7 2011,negative,dakota fanning screams your ears into bleeding submission as the worlds most influential science fiction novel ever written is butchered and molested by the theatrical ineptitude of tom placenta eater cruise
Apr 7 2011,positive,the original one of course
Apr 6 2011,positive,despite wht ppl say i love tom cruise n i think hes a great action star
Apr 6 2011,positive,pretty good original is far better
Apr 5 2011,positive,pretty good but original show was better
Apr 5 2011,positive,dont be fooled by the rating this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the dialogue is crapthe acting is terribleoverly cliched and nothing helps the plot saying there is a plot i give this movie a good 5 stars because it is hilariously terrible the only thing considered good in this movie is the graphics they were pretty freakin awesome but thats all i feel like they didnt even try spielberg is going through his bad movie phase of filmmaking so give him some slak but if you were to watch this movie i would consider you be very wasted or high to actually enjoy it otherwise get together with your friends and make fun of it youll have a ball xd
Apr 5 2011,positive,not the best when remakes happen
Apr 4 2011,neutral,a real let down actually expected more of this remake
Apr 4 2011,positive,really thrilling and very thoroughly done i love the plot and the special effects are stunning
Apr 3 2011,positive,excellent suspense and graphic appeal but sometimes it seemed at a standstill i dont think cruise was the right choice for his role a classic cameo or easter egg would have been a nice addition
Apr 3 2011,positive,great movie with a compelling story love the first half not as much the second great ending and awesome special effects tom cruise at his best dakota fanning at her best too this movie was more of a horror movie rather than a science fiction movie like the 1950s one overall with great special effects great directing narrating at its best and along side great acting this was a a movie
Apr 3 2011,negative,this sucked it cant hold a candle to the original
Apr 3 2011,positive,many of h g wells scientific and futuristic predictions came true through his scientific romantic novels
Apr 3 2011,positive,its a good film i can watch it everytime its on
Apr 3 2011,negative,good storry line it wos ok
Apr 3 2011,neutral,this film want all that good i found it be missing something but i couldnt put my finger on it besides that i found the acting to be not that good at times this film was very dull the color in this film was terriblethe movie started out bad but then got better as it went along and became more original then the ending happened and it went from 3 stars to 2 and a half
Apr 3 2011,positive,not sure if i saw this version
Apr 1 2011,neutral,robbie ferrier what is it is it terrorists   ray ferrier these came from someplace else     a disappointing movie from spielberg which was never expected  the plot is unconvincing the only thing good is visual effects also performances are good tim robbins character is a waste the movie does not even carries suspense and not thrilling too boring and lacks logic the ending is most disappointing finally you can ignore this movie

Mar 22 2011,positive,great effects  actors
Mar 20 2011,positive,this was an intense movie
Mar 19 2011,positive,war of the world is a good adaptation of hg wells novel and owes nothing to the 1956s version the movie has lots of thrills and great effects
Mar 19 2011,positive,havent seen the original was kinda creepy had a sense of despair so at least it was involving
Mar 19 2011,positive,a lot of action fairly entertaining
Mar 18 2011,neutral,so so neat story but the plot was meh
Mar 18 2011,positive,a cheesy but thrilling scifi epic with a groundbreaking performance by dakota fanning

Mar 17 2011,positive,not as good as the original
Mar 15 2011,positive,im a sucker for scifi but this is monumental entertainment that i cant help but be enthralled by fuck tom cruise though
Mar 15 2011,positive,spielberg delivers a pretty great reboot of the original war of the worlds the effects are pretty great and the visuals are very intense at times tom cruise does a good enough job dakota fanning gets really annoying at times though other than that i liked it
Mar 15 2011,negative,rays son shouldve died if the aliens didnt i would son or not
Mar 14 2011,negative,one of those movies that you thought would be better and then makes you want to jump off a bridge haha
Mar 14 2011,positive,never having read all of the book and not seeing any other movie based on it i watched this film as a stand alone picture and it was fun it had all the explosions and screaming but it didnt seem to have many action clichés we arent watching the movie through the point of the military or people who can stop them were seeing it through a normal family just trying to survive i know that if they die it technically doesnt matter they have nothing to do in fighting the aliens im not a beleiver but if aliens do exist then i hope that theyre either friendly or die from bacteria like in this film its fun well acted and has plenty of thrills its a typical summer blockbuster
Mar 14 2011,negative,good but not very good
Mar 13 2011,positive,interesting to see tom cruise not being much of a tough guy character but more of a survivor for his children
Mar 13 2011,positive,overated but watchable or special effects
Mar 13 2011,positive,pretty cool watching everyone fall into anarchy and go to war with eachother trying to delay death for as long as possible
Mar 12 2011,positive,despite of what people say i love this movie
Mar 12 2011,positive,gripping and thrilling the survival adventure story is told well through the eyes of a master filmmaker
Mar 11 2011,positive,a great adaptation with some great crowd scenes as you would expect from spielberg there are also some genuinely tense and scary moments the scene towards the end when they are in the basement being searched for by the mechanical eye is frightening great special effects too
Mar 11 2011,positive,spoileraliens that didnt study our atmosphere take over the world only to have karma ruin there plan of conquest
Mar 10 2011,positive,steven spielberg could have done better than this nevertheless this is one smart scifi film with some heartpounding scenes to offer
Mar 10 2011,positive,theres something strange and scary about this film it isnt for everybody but if it is for you then you will be surprised just how easily you can fall in love with it terrifying in parts but never loses its campiness
Mar 10 2011,positive,from a technical perspective this movie is amazing lots of epic scenes and ridiculous shots great acting very suspenseful i feel like a lot of this movie is 40 quality but i couldnt get past some of the side plots which seem to be lacking a purpose it angered me at times take out these 2 side plots and the movie is 20 minutes shorter more fast paced and better about 4 viewings      spoilers      the side plots i hated were the son trying to join the army smh and the weird creepy guy in the cellar at least he created more suspense but if felt forced and unnecessary
Mar 10 2011,negative,tom cruise is a douchbag and should be shot for helping to ruin one of the best moviesstories ever told
Mar 10 2011,positive,a great film from beginning except the ending which i felt was kind of stupid
Mar 9 2011,positive,good film again good acting and plenty of action
Mar 8 2011,positive,a fun movie a great watch with friends movie but not a speilberg
Mar 8 2011,positive,its a decent watchable flick but i must say its simply 2 hrs of tom cruise running from aliens and dakota fanning screaming
Mar 8 2011,positive,havent watched ot yet
Mar 8 2011,positive,typical hollywood fear the aliens movie  great for what it was
Mar 7 2011,positive,steven spielbergs reinterpretation of hgwells timeless scifi classic is full of bigtime hollywood blockbuster spectacle and even when the drama and deep themes reach the highest pit even for its own good the film never loses focus of what to offer having the best out of an apocalyptic alienflick with enough disturbing moments stylish visuals and the unexpected presence of young star dakota fanning offering tom cruise an appealing company
Mar 7 2011,positive,i am such a sucker for alien movies this one did it for me
Mar 6 2011,negative,weird but one of the few decent remakes
Mar 4 2011,positive,good film really liked
Mar 3 2011,positive,very good remember have 2 ending on it
Mar 2 2011,positive,cruise is actually believable in this film the action scenes are great and the plot is freaky as hell however the thing that ruined this movie for me was the performances by cruises characters children especially dakota fanning who is one of my least favorite actresses alive worth watching because of the action scenes fanning needs to go jump off a cliff
Mar 2 2011,positive,i watched this movie last year and couldnt sleep for 3 days
Mar 2 2011,positive,fantastic remake of an old movie the actors pull it off well not much i can say really im not a massive war of the worlds fan for what the movie is it pulls it off excellently

Mar 1 2011,negative,seen movie soes not feel completed
Feb 28 2011,negative,disappointing for  a fan of spielberg  cruise

Feb 25 2011,positive,well done and enjoyed it
Feb 25 2011,positive,sit on th edge of your seat stuff
Feb 24 2011,positive,could have been better
Feb 24 2011,positive,i actually quite enjoyed this film which shocked me
Feb 24 2011,positive,the beginning makes up for everything
Feb 23 2011,positive,it is good but wow freak me out stuff here great to scare the hell out of kids
Feb 22 2011,positive,shocking realistic and one of those movies that often kept you sitting on the edge of  your seat and making a meal out of ones finger natis hee  hee tom played one of his best rolls in this movie  computer effects and art work were the best i have seen in a movie like this one  wow
Feb 22 2011,positive,tom cruise never ceases to piss me off but i can look past that and enjoy this good scifi popcorn movie that only aims to be a blockbuster and nothing more i know the majority of people dislike this movie but theyre probably all too stuck up their film snob asses to just take it as a crappy special fx orgy and enjoy it
Feb 22 2011,positive,its a three hour movie in a two hour movie that best sums it up
Feb 22 2011,positive,dakota fanning was great in this movie and the special effects were terrific  good script
Feb 21 2011,positive,it a little old but its still pretty good
Feb 21 2011,negative,another overhyped movie but it was entertaining overall
Feb 20 2011,negative,although i love tom cruise and he was great in this movie i wasnt crazy about this remake  it went too far off based and totally changed the movie it should  have had a different title  the original was much better
Feb 20 2011,positive,not a big tom cruise fan but the more i watch this film the more i like it
Feb 20 2011,negative,the original was better
Feb 19 2011,neutral,i dont like tom cruise but i thought that the movie was soso good special effects in the movie all the way
Feb 19 2011,positive,after the incredible trailer i wanted to see this film instantly with speilberg as commander surely it was going to be something   whilst not a fan of tom cruise i felt that he was well  cast it was a clever approach to view the epic tragedy in the eyes of a struggling ordinary american family unit     lets just say for the opening 20 minutes you are left breathless in a brilliant naturalistic approach like the opening to saving private ryan speilberg treats us to something special his use of suspense in these first 20 minutes are truly breathtaking and in my mind underrated  this is great great filmmaking    as the family dolve deeper into the gloom and darkness of the invasion the boat scene i still feel gripped to mostly every frame the atmosphere is superb and it avoids many cliches     then we are treated to an interesting a well cast tim robbins but this is where the film the film begins to fall down part of the fall down is only an illusion because the first half of the film is so so intense  but some of it feels rushed particularly the actual final result of the alien war which seems as if they had cut something out then we get to the ending  a real pushover which leaves you goinghmmmm at the ending instead of screaming for joy at such a great film    it could have been an absolute miracle of a film but the ending let it down however i still believe that 70 of the films entirety is amazing and one cannot forget that
Feb 18 2011,positive,i havent seen it but would love it
Feb 18 2011,positive,brillant scifi film which never gets old and the book is just as good
Feb 17 2011,neutral,it was alright for a movie i knew what was going to happen
Feb 17 2011,positive,not a great fan of tom cruise but i thought this was one of the better films hes done dakota fanning was the star though
Feb 15 2011,positive,liked the pace the story  and the fx
Feb 15 2011,positive,great scifi movie ive not for the too happy endingi would have given it 5 stars
Feb 14 2011,negative,not even close to being a good movie
Feb 14 2011,negative,wasnt very happy with it not enougth in it
Feb 14 2011,positive,ok for science fiction
Feb 14 2011,positive,loved it thought it did well as a remake
Feb 14 2011,negative,brilliant  worth the wait
Feb 14 2011,neutral,tom cruise ruined it
Feb 13 2011,positive,not the soul entrance in the human eradication epic genre but a good addition to it  this film is an effective modernized version of a well known classic
Feb 13 2011,positive,war of the worlds is one of the greatest close encounter films ever made but we expected this from spielberg  after extraterrestrials invade earth ray ferrier tom cruise takes his daughter dakota fanning and older son justin chatwin to his ex wifes house in boston for protection but the things the witness on the way there will be horrifying  tom cruise was my one problem with this film he looked like he was on crack the whole time and his performance was not good  dakota fannings scared face made me really feel her terror  i found the plot an amazing journey that showed terror family bonds and intensity that will stay in our minds a long time  the effects were amazing as well everything looked real and it truly has spielbergs magic touch  this isnt spielbergs best sci fi but thats because all of his sci fi movies have been great
Feb 12 2011,positive,unlikable characters like whoa  its stephen spielbergs adaptation of the hg wells novel where aliens decide that now is their time to strike and attack all of humanity on earth  we focus on tom cruises dysfunctional family and their survival process  i will start off on a positive and say that this boasts some pretty badass special effects  i know this came out first but i saw it second and the whole way through i was really really reminded of the movie 2012 theyre practically the same movie only war of the worlds has aliens  one thing different is that with 2012 while i didnt particularly care a whole lot for the characters i didnt actively dislike them  not the case here although both movies have a pair of snotnosed bratty kids  but points are given to john cusack for being more affable than tom cruise but you probably already knew that  i got the distinct impression that i would have liked the movie a lot better if it were told from another familys perspective i dont want to spend two hours with a dorky dad and two kids that are in desperate need of disciplining because it brings down the movie  its a huge flaw that overshadows most of what the movies got working for it but i did like parts of it and it does somewhat work as a loud theme park ride
Feb 12 2011,negative,tom cruise was laughable in this movie
Feb 12 2011,positive,i couldnt imagine this story better great acting from everyone
Feb 11 2011,negative,revolves around cruise
Feb 9 2011,negative,could have been better then what it was 
Feb 9 2011,positive,its a great movie i love it
Feb 9 2011,positive,steven spielberg has always been and always will be one of hollywoods best film directors
Feb 9 2011,negative,scared me to death really freaks me out d
Feb 8 2011,positive,epic just need to see more aliens and hiding parts needs some more exelerating parts
Feb 7 2011,positive,everythings amazing except the ending
Feb 7 2011,neutral,the movie didnt really need to be remade but for what it is it works reasonably well
Feb 6 2011,positive,dakota fanning is adorable tom cruise too
Feb 6 2011,positive,man this rocks  trailer is it self awsome
Feb 5 2011,positive,awesome loved the beginning the mystery fear and suspense got a bit poo towards the end though
Feb 5 2011,negative,this was not worth mentioning plus the old film is better than this remake
Feb 5 2011,positive,good movieone to see
Feb 5 2011,positive,very scary but great action and dakota fanning was awsome 
Feb 3 2011,neutral,its very weak i didnt expect a great film but i was disappointed
Feb 2 2011,neutral,as a fan of the book war of the worlds was a major disappointment while ill admit that it obviously tried to mimic orson welles 1938 radio broadcast rather than hg wells book the movie gives genius writing a serious downgrade into mediocrity first by giving the hero a name second by giving him kids and third by having tom cruise play him    let me get this out of the way the images in this movie are stunning and frightening as a silent movie it would have been perfect the machines are replicated almost perfectly from their description in the book and have an otherworldly eeriness that make them so much more threatening    unfortunately i think a general rule should be that if youre rooting for the monster the director hasnt done his job as insensitive as this is i spent much of the film wondering when the aliens were finally going to eat dakota fanning she was fay wray from king kong all over again as follows cruise was a selfrighteous genius fanning was a bratty coward and the brother was just selfish    in short war of the worlds was okay but i had expected better especially from this director
Feb 2 2011,positive,amazing movie very intelligent
Feb 1 2011,positive,action freaked me out a little bit but good
Jan 31 2011,negative,the effects are imressive but thats where the accolades end   just about the only thing this film has in common with the hg wells story is the name it s set in the wrong place the us in the wrong era with the wrong characters   tom cruise does what he has so often before let us all down with an egotistical lacklustre performance this film is yet another us rip off of a good british story  if this flim had been set at the turn of the last century in the uk if the story had been told the right way if it had stayedd at least slightly more faithful to the original story and above all if it had a worth while cast it might have been worth the time it too to watch    as it stands all i can say is take a lesson from king kong not all stories have to take place today or in the future and for gods sake when will the americans finally realise that there are other nations out there    war of the worlds should be a story told from the point of view of an englishman in england at the turn of the twntieth century this film misses the mark on so many levels its more insulting than entertaining
Jan 31 2011,positive,little dakota fanning was quite annoying the whole movie and coulda got them killed with all her screaming and stubbornness i woulda tossed her and made another kid later
Jan 30 2011,neutral,i liked it despite the fact that i do not like tom cruise wish that they had come up with a new ending however aliens that advanced surely they would have checked the atmosphere and indigenous microbes etc before getting out of their machines

Jan 14 2011,positive,i like it its so great
Jan 13 2011,negative,when people ask me what my favorite movies are im able to easily recite my top 10 rather easily but when im asked about the worst ones i really cant say for sure i know movies i hate but i know for a fact if it werent for the special effects and the directing  this movie would be one of the worst of all time in my eyes the acting is so undiscribiably horrible especially by tom cruise and it does trickle down the entire cast yet of course not so much so on fanning but the script is simply terrible its so terribly written i found myself hating my tv screen yet i do respect the ending because its something different from your run of the mill disaster movie
Jan 13 2011,negative,based on a good book but was a real nowhere movie spielberg can do better
Jan 13 2011,positive,on its own great as a remake it sucked not a cruise fan but he did a good job with it and it was different enough  nice interaction between father and son and great moment with tim robbins

Dec 31 2010,positive,tom as his usual macho hero entertaining
Dec 30 2010,negative,not as good as the original
Dec 30 2010,positive,departing from his typical kid friendly flair steven spielberg crafts a harsh alien invasion film that managed to put a little fear in me however like minority report it is yet another tom cruise performance that causes the movie to nearly fail    score 8410
Dec 30 2010,positive,great action adventure great performance by tom cruise
Dec 29 2010,positive,a epic monster of a movie
Dec 28 2010,negative,oh god  this bit

Dec 23 2010,negative,the originals better
Dec 22 2010,positive,this is a epic ride its full of awesome wide shots and with morgan freeman as a narrator nothing can go wrong its scary and its quite cool the fact that tom cruse was in this didnt bug me at all
Dec 20 2010,positive,based on the story of the same name and the subsequent panicinducing radio broadcast performance by actor orson welles by acclaimed science fiction writer hg wells and once already made for the silver screen by paramount pictures in 1953 steven spielbergs 2005 war of the worlds is an excellent companion piece to the original novel and film its a remake that works in large part because spielberg takes the time to update the picture without sacrificing the integrity of the story audiences might be disappointed with the pictures rather abrupt ending but it stays true to wells vision and works well within the context of the film with extraordinary special effects fine characterization and several underlying themes war of the worlds is an excellent genre film and another winner from steven spielberg
Dec 19 2010,positive,not what i expected is very good directed good actors dakota is excellent but something was missing
Dec 19 2010,positive,i enjoyed this flick tom cruise is actually really good here
Dec 18 2010,positive,spielbergs alien invasion thriller is a sharp contrast to his other alien works  benefiting from the elements that brought him to fame war of the worlds is an effective scifi piece and his second hit with cruise
Dec 18 2010,positive,very good story tom cruise is actually good in this one  a
Dec 17 2010,negative,that kid never stops screaming
Dec 16 2010,positive,really intense and whats intense about the movie is hardly the aliens but how humans act and react in the light of such destruction most of the scariest scenes to me center around the human characters and they are so realistic
Dec 16 2010,neutral,an average movie read the book
Dec 16 2010,negative,ive never been much of a fan of hg wells work  the time machine always seemed like a childrens story more than anything else and war of the worlds never particularly captured my interest  the tripod invasion plotline can be relatively interesting though the white mountains and its kin were well written  i do love the original orson wells broadcast tooits always been one of those moments that make me think i wish i had been there  but combining an in all honesty mediocre director with a story thats inconsistently decent at best    well its just not that great of an idea  i think the real weakness of this film is how dull and lifeless everything is  steven spielbergs directing is uncharacteristically static along with the acting of the entire cast  lacking any flair or depth or for that matter traditional spielberg charisma this is really just a disaster film no better than independence day  the dialogue is weak and the actors dont enhance it one little bit    the best actor in the film is tim robbins and hes justdisappointing  then theres dakota fanning who is hit and miss at her best  for every incredible performance like in i am sam there are performances like hers in twilight and war of the worlds  and now for tom cruisewhat can i say theres no way this irritatingly wellsculpted man could pass for an average joe even if he put effort into his role  the hollywood rule that the prettiest person in the film cannot die applies well here as he narrowly avoids death at least a dozen times while every extra around him is disintegrated    fans of roland emmerich and michael bay will appreciate this film and that is their right but i would not recommend this to anyone else  20100
Dec 15 2010,negative,aliens attack earth in a super lame movie

Dec 12 2010,positive,nice one from spielberg
Dec 11 2010,negative,i cant believe tom cruise agreed to act in this movie terrible movie no real reason for what happens pretty disgusting and the fact that the main characters dont immediately get killed like everyone else but theyre lucky enough to be on a different alien that harvests them and keeps them is pure bs
Dec 11 2010,positive,i love this movie d horror is my thing although this isnt very scary
Dec 11 2010,negative,boo purist booooo

Nov 28 2010,negative,it should have been a faithful adaptation set in the current time but noooooooo instead we got dakota fanning irritating us and tom cruise making us wonder why steven speilberg hasnt made a good movie on his own sincewait this movies so bad it made me forget that speilberg ever directed another movie for better or worse seriously its signs with special effects
Nov 28 2010,negative,ugh bad graphics and bad acting
Nov 26 2010,positive,out of all film remakes this is one of the best to me and i definitely prefer it over ther original that bored me to death the effects are top notch in this film and tom cruise and dakota fanning do great jobs as the father and daughter trying to escape from this alien armageddon on the planet it is also a faithful adaption to the original novel which is one of my favorite books and does the same thing the original film did that make the film take place at the time it was made and not the time the novel was written the apocalyptic scenes of people being turned to ash and the destroyed buildings add to the fantastic detail and cg spectacle to this film also the aliens are very interesting looking and the amphibianlike moving martian war machines are fantastic to look at and the roar it makes is very threatening and intimadating to listen to also morgan freeman as the narrartor nice touch
Nov 26 2010,negative,dark miserable movie with very little redeeming qualities
Nov 26 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a movie that combines action adventure fantasy sicene fictiona nd fear all in once its a story about a machine which has been lying inside the earth for millions of years suddenly becomes activated and destroys the whole world what will happen watch this awesome movie

Nov 5 2010,positive,very grim  a real downer  dont watch this if youve had a bad day
Nov 5 2010,positive,i really dont understand the hate for this movie war of the worlds is one of spielbergs best entertainment in years and having made darker more serious movies actually helped in making this movie darker and more visceral the chaos and apocalyptic doom in this movie is actually very convincing sure the ending was your typical spielberg sap but thats only a few minutes in an overall thrilling 2 hours
Nov 4 2010,negative,i like the actors and actress but not the story
Nov 4 2010,positive,a terifying performance by an underestimated tom crews
Nov 4 2010,negative,it s a bit over the top
Nov 4 2010,positive,a wild ride movie the only real disappointment is the major plot flaw of the aliens watching this world and humanity before they attack us  but their machines are buried underground for hundreds if not thousands of years before civilisation appears then the machines alien masters arrive seems like a major chicken and egg problem mr spielberg
Nov 4 2010,positive,a genuine film for all the family full of action and great scenes and acting

Nov 2 2010,positive,good movie but dont like tom cruise

Nov 1 2010,positive,really good  love tom cruise
Oct 31 2010,neutral,this may be one of spielbergs worst movies no worst is the wrong term i will say one of his least appealing films we know he has made far better films for scifitom cruisespielberg minority report is your pick but one thing this film did give me was a certain conclusion about dakota fanning she will be around for a long time
Oct 31 2010,positive,the impressive staging and overall intensity of the story helped me forgive a typically awful spielberg ending
Oct 31 2010,negative,mr spielberg mess this one up this movie was suppose to be an alien invasion with the human beings unable to defend themselves instead we ge this human interest that happens to run away some place and hide from the aliens
Oct 30 2010,positive,is it scary no but of course its not supposed to be is it tense you bet your ass
Oct 30 2010,positive,amazingly awesome thriller shows human nature under extreme stress
Oct 29 2010,positive,this is war martians
Oct 27 2010,positive,underrated remake even with cruise
Oct 27 2010,positive,spielburg directs a great remake of the 1953 classic which i think is even better based on hg wells novel war of the worlds succeeds with a good preformance from tom cruise
Oct 27 2010,positive,i am a dakota fanning fan and did enjoy the movie despite not caring for tom cruise if you dislike him great movie for that since in the movie he was an absent father
Oct 27 2010,positive,i enjoyed this movie  lot of action and suspense  would watch it again
Oct 25 2010,positive,this movie was awesome i wouldnt take my eyes off the screen because i was too afraid that i would miss what would happen next
Oct 25 2010,negative,not bad  the director created a decent atmosphere of threat and it was a fait accompli that the story would be modernised and set in the usa so i cant judge it on that
Oct 25 2010,positive,as a scifi movie lovers tom cruise did not dissapoint in thie movie war of the worlds is a must
Oct 25 2010,positive,the original was great the tom cruise remake was interestingly just as good

Oct 23 2010,positive,it seems like i liked this but not memorable
Oct 22 2010,neutral,my one or two sentence review ets back and hes pissed off in this sci fi alien invasion movie that starts well and gets progressively worse and has one of the stupidest endings of all time and one of the most overrated actors of all time amazing effects funny and touching spielberg moments do not save this film
Oct 21 2010,positive,writing reviews on movies i rate as 3 stars is hard since to me a 3 star movie is ok entertaining for one view but really not worth a second that pretty much sums up my thoughts on this movie its not a bad movie just nothing special either
Oct 21 2010,positive,love the sci fi but this one isnt my fav invasion film
Oct 21 2010,positive,i should be one of the cast next p

Oct 19 2010,negative,too depressing and corny
Oct 19 2010,positive,not only was an excellent theater directed by spelberg but had cruises hot and action magic
Oct 19 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a somewhat inconsistent film on a dramatic level particularly towards its sentimental conclusion nevertheless its fusion of wellsesque paranoia and searing imagery combine to make it one of spielbergs darkest and most suspenseful works with some of the strongest iconography in his career
Oct 19 2010,positive,cinematic geniusthe only film where tom cruise has a reason to run l
Oct 18 2010,positive,i really liked it more than most people

Oct 12 2010,negative,tom cruises worst performance ever i think
Oct 11 2010,neutral,after watching a ton of good action sequence i just want a good ending to remember not that silly cheap scientific explanation i call it silly because not a half of the audience on the theater know about that scientific issue
Oct 11 2010,positive,dakota fanning was completely stunning in this movie the effects were crazy and there were some pretty intense scenes against these odd looking extra terrestrials
Oct 10 2010,positive,only alien movie aside i have throughly enjoyed

Sep 28 2010,positive,very very good film great cgi
Sep 27 2010,positive,it packs some great special effects and the acting is pretty good the one thing that pisses me off is how the hell did his son survive my guess is he hid in the sewers and survived off of rat carcasses until it was over still a half ways descent remake
Sep 26 2010,positive,excellent remake of the classic thriller although if i had to really choose id have to go with the original  both are great and have their great special effects tom cruise has a meltdown throughout the movie but all the other cast hold it together
Sep 26 2010,positive,i lack any real desire to see tom cruise in a movie  and why do all teenage guys in movies have to be so angsty cry more

Sep 20 2010,positive,it was a really nice sifi movie but i seen better
Sep 20 2010,positive,this is how you make a disaster movie when it came out it was my favorite movie of all time and it remains one of the most intense movies ive ever seen spielberg youve still got it
Sep 19 2010,positive,the aliens werent very good shots lol but yeah a good movie
Sep 19 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a great adaptation from 1800 books to current day  most of these remakes are absolutely terrible the day the earth stood still need i say more  steven spielberg is such a great filmmaker though that you dont notice the fact that its a remake you just say its a new film  also add in tom cruise and say its pretty good    heres the plot a man divorced from his wife gets his two kids for the weekend whilst she goes to boston and during this time one of the kids is a jerk and the other is a freak and so what else could happen  how about an alien invasion  so now the three are on the run as they go from one end of the east coast to the other  on their travels so much happens that its hard to mention everything  good story originally by hg wells    tom cruise is a good action star and this wasnt an action movie it was a mix of a thriller and a scifi the two obvious ones  so did he belong in this movie  he was good but i wouldnt immediately go for him like i think spielberg did  dakota fanning is good so is his son but tim robbins character doesnt belong in this movie  his role is just a crazed man who has lost everything and is too focused on the present and not the future  a good performance but not necessary  and sure the aliens look cheap but still a great entertainment from one end to the other
Sep 19 2010,positive,not much to the story however has good specialeffects and love the aliens
Sep 19 2010,positive,this movie was okay i was listening to my mp3 player and as soon as the ferry scene comes on so cold by breaking benjamin started to play that song goes well with that scene
Sep 19 2010,positive,spielberg loves aliens but this one doesnt measure up to a close encounters or an et but pulls off this one with unparallelled precision it definatley leaves its mark with some deep footprints in the genre most defintley memorable but not quite the best he has ever done still it is undeniably stunning
Sep 19 2010,positive,entertaining with great fx
Sep 18 2010,negative,the first 15 minutes or so starts out with much anticipation and potential but the whole movie left me longing to see the classic 1953 version again after nearly ten years
Sep 17 2010,positive,this and the orginal
Sep 17 2010,positive,great effects but the bar set by his other films is way above this one
Sep 17 2010,positive,a good movie based on a book i personally liked this movie better than hg wells novel
Sep 17 2010,negative,dud can never get back the lost time spent watching it
Sep 16 2010,positive,i am just starting to think that steven spielberg doesnt care anymore the movie was okay the effects were fantastic but that was pretty much all to recommend about it tom cruise didnt look like he cared in this movie he was just a flat actor steven spielberg i feel that he just made this film because he could the academy of motion picture arts and sciences probably felt the same way i can picture the top men at a table saying okay steven well nominate war of the worlds for best visual effects now get the hell out of our office

Sep 11 2010,positive,well done but not repeat worthy
Sep 11 2010,neutral,yeah its okay feels bloated and the cruiser is just going through the motions though he does have a great exchange with his son as they escape the first alien assault where the latter asks the cruiser to clarify where these things are from and the cruiser confirms that they are not from europe  brilliant

Sep 9 2010,negative,refer to rating it was the lowest mark that could be recorded
Sep 9 2010,positive,this could have been brilliant if they placed it in right time period dropped cruise and let dakota fanning act more and scream less not as good as original but ok

Sep 5 2010,positive,more dramatic than i expected very interesting alien depiction as far as the meat grinding goes and sort of a far fetched sequence well duh its a scifi  i know but does land a surprise ending

Aug 29 2010,neutral,this movie had good special effects but i didnt get into the story that much and it does not explain anything about the aliens so they need human blood to survive why have they been under the earth this whole time why do they look like machines well whatever you may enjoy this film the 1st half was kinda boring for me but i enjoyed the 2nd half alot
Aug 29 2010,positive,based on all time classic novel of hgwells

Aug 21 2010,positive,good but original better
Aug 21 2010,positive,an okay film about an alien invasion but tom cruise ruins it cos im not keen on him
Aug 21 2010,negative,tom cruise trying to remake this was a mistake
Aug 19 2010,negative,quite bad shame on you spielberg
Aug 19 2010,positive,a retelling of hg wells scifi classic steven spielberg innovates his film with a more dazzling effect which is not that bad actually if you dont already know war of the worlds is about an extraterrestrial race that are technologically superior than us and makes the human race take refuge from the onslaught that they bring upon us possibly leading the human race into extinction we get a glimpse of this from the eyes of an american family who struggles through this     being in the 21st century the special effects are better and steven spielberg puts on a new view of the alien race but like the original the concept stays the same tom cruise who plays the father which is the lead puts on a performance that seems dire but it is definitely a good acting role i might say the least justin chatwin plays the son and dakota fanning plays the daughter of the bunch believable characters are hard to come by as i did not feel a connection for the supporting characters and therefore did not care for them but no doubt the special effects are the main attraction for this film
Aug 19 2010,positive,really good film love tom criuse
Aug 17 2010,positive,alot of crapbut worth a try tommy
Aug 16 2010,negative,stupid movie  tom cruise cant pull off movies like this
Aug 16 2010,negative,ilms visual effects are the best thing about this film the us armed forces can not destroy a single tripod but tom cruise could and its another spielberg happy ending the 1953 film was much better
Aug 16 2010,neutral,sorry not as good as the original
Aug 16 2010,neutral,one could have hoped more from a welles adaptation directed by spielberg with cruise fanning and robbins the result is a inconsistent movie with a few high points but a ultimate letdown
Aug 15 2010,positive,great film didnt have a fag all the way threw
Aug 15 2010,negative,what an annoying movie  not as good as the original   too many distractions and side plots   theres no place in a scifi for parenting and domestic family problems  get rid of the kids and maybe this movie would have been much better
Aug 15 2010,positive,a brilliant film of paranoia thrill and fear ended with a very anticlimatic happy ever after ending
Aug 14 2010,negative,another useless remake
Aug 14 2010,positive,this was a really good movie
Aug 14 2010,positive,great flick books better

Aug 11 2010,negative,tom cruise why cant we give negatives
Aug 11 2010,neutral,good moviegreat action and if i was to imagine aliens invading the earth in my head this movie was spot on but no matter how realistic it was the story of why the aliens came to earth was not clear to me at all

Aug 7 2010,negative,its not so scary but those aliens are pretty freaky
Aug 7 2010,neutral,what was steven spielberg doing here dissapointed
Aug 7 2010,positive,the effects and the films pace are so breakneck it really gives you a full ride i liked the fact you were thrown into the disaster and like the characters you didnt know what on earth was going on that for me made it all the more dramatic i can see why that would distance others from enjoying the movie but sometimes not explaining everything can help
Aug 7 2010,positive,its okay they didnt explain alot
Aug 7 2010,positive,spielberg made a great movie here lots of people who dont like tom cruise had to admit this one was fun
Aug 6 2010,positive,actionadventure this classic story is full of unique special effects and disaster sequences the acting did not seem to really encompass the feeling or passion i thought it should and did not live up to the story while entertaining definitely not the best more average
Aug 5 2010,positive,i dont know why but ive always like this movie
Aug 5 2010,positive,what a fricken great movie
Aug 4 2010,positive,this movie was not as good as i expected it to be very unrealistic but entertaining not a movie that i would want to watch more than a few times

Aug 4 2010,positive,cool aliens super rendition of the classic 1930s radio story
Aug 3 2010,neutral,tom cruise ruins what i think to be a wonderful scifi franchise  better casting next please
Aug 3 2010,positive,tom cruise wasnt right for it but a good film
Aug 2 2010,negative,not anywhere as good as the gene barry one 
Aug 2 2010,positive,this had potiential but not honestly saying tom cruise should be acting anymore he has a swelled head and thinks his poo dont stink well watch his acting it proves it does lol
Aug 2 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a very good thriller that even though can slow down in pace at times will still please fans of science fiction films
Aug 2 2010,positive,action packed exciting
Aug 1 2010,negative,it suck not better the othe older one
Aug 1 2010,positive,i dont get this movie even though i watched it 6 times already

Aug 1 2010,negative,not as good as the original
Aug 1 2010,negative,looks good thats about it
Jul 31 2010,positive,a classic story of alien invasion turned once again into a movie  steven spielberg brings the world of ilm to hg wells classic science fiction novel about invaders from mars but in this one according to spielberg the aliens dont come from mars they probably come from where et comes from says spielberg only they come from a much darker part of the universe which reminds me what a great stretch for spielberg from making benevolent alien movies to a malevolent alien movie    anywho the film is about a divorced man tom cruise who tries to save his family from the alien invaders who want to annihilate all life on earth    i liked this movie i thought it was a great remake it certainly served up some good scares but it did have one flaw tim robbins character i didnt quite get his character he was just way too weird but thats about it all in all its very good but its just a shame that it was surrounded by the curse of scientology maybe it wouldve done better without it
Jul 31 2010,positive,pretty tense received unnecessary criticism
Jul 29 2010,positive,dont care for tom but the movie was good
Jul 29 2010,positive,dont have time to write
Jul 29 2010,neutral,kinda weird movie i thought they dragged it on to long
Jul 29 2010,positive,what a wird allian so dump and easy to terminate to easy an end
Jul 28 2010,positive,lightning never strikes in the same place twice
Jul 28 2010,positive,a stunning visual adventure that spielberg directs quite well overall war of the worlds is a great remake of the classic 1950s one and is packed with thrills and chills that go deep to the bone
Jul 28 2010,positive,i dont usually rate tom cruise films but i like him in this
Jul 28 2010,positive,the only issue i had with this film was that lame melodramatic ending the same one the book had and i cant even blame spielberg or anyone else for trying to stick to the source material
Jul 27 2010,positive,great movie kinda creepy though
Jul 27 2010,positive,chills throughout the whole movie
Jul 27 2010,positive,i read the novel when i was a kid
Jul 27 2010,positive,see it if youre a fan of the genre  even if not its still a crowdpleaser though a little long      postapocalyptic
Jul 26 2010,positive,i hate tom cruise but i loved this movie i liked the book too and i think it was a good depiction of it
Jul 25 2010,positive,dakota fanning was in it so i loved it haha but the ending was a little wierd 
Jul 25 2010,positive,the greatest scifi film that ss gave us  it is came with a strong plot  cg of this movie that actually fun and one of the most thrilling too
Jul 24 2010,positive,i liked this movie but not so much towards the end kinda got a bit off board
Jul 24 2010,neutral,not as good as it should have been
Jul 24 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a very flawed movie that works thanks to spielbergs confident direction  cruise and fanning were quite aggravating and the ending was contrite and ridiculous      but when spielberg introduces us to the aliens in an enthralling chase sequence he propels worlds into an exciting direction
Jul 24 2010,positive,i cant give it a full 4 stars because dakota fanning whining the whole movie ruined it for me
Jul 24 2010,negative,nothing can compare to the original
Jul 24 2010,positive,i love every movies which is directed by steven spilberg

Jul 23 2010,positive,action packed amazing
Jul 23 2010,positive,made you think about the furtue

Jul 22 2010,positive,it was a very good movie  it was tom cruises 2nd best movie  a must buy movie  action all over
Jul 22 2010,positive,one of my favorites
Jul 22 2010,negative,the story may be a scifi classic but its spoiled in this telling by a gratingly offkey performance from a woefully miscast tom cruise derivative action set pieces cribbed from other better movies and some surprisingly cheesy special effects  stephen spielbergs formula of mixing equal parts spectacle and sentiment has grown pretty stale at this point and while hes still capable of cranking out a good movie along those lines with the right material eg ai or minority report this isnt remotely one of his stronger efforts
Jul 20 2010,positive,great story but seemed to be lacking but  wasnt bad just wanted more action or something
Jul 20 2010,neutral,why why why why why why did they have to cast tom cruise in this if it werent for him i would of totally gave this movie tops lol
Jul 19 2010,negative,im in love with katie holmes few years later i hate katie holmes
Jul 19 2010,negative,worst movie of all time has horrible acting that is actually so bad its funny and it has no story line
Jul 19 2010,negative,good special effects and a story that pulls you in a poor final third lets it down
Jul 19 2010,positive,good all around scifi
Jul 18 2010,negative,a better movie then i thought it would be
Jul 18 2010,negative,i cant help but hate tom cruise since his wierd outburst on oprah and i think i held that against this movie for whatever reason i wasnt a fan
Jul 17 2010,positive,preferred the original bwthere just aged myself
Jul 17 2010,positive,this movie is very good and many scenes make me feel suddenly very interested in
Jul 17 2010,positive,intense show by steven spielberg the ending is unbelievably bad though

Jul 14 2010,negative,this movie wasnt that good it could have been better
Jul 14 2010,neutral,this move has very interesting ideas that could apply to the actuality of these events actually acurring except the part where hes in the basment with that crazy guy and he has to kill him to save his daughter highly unlikely
Jul 13 2010,positive,loved this movie it scared me and made me excited and made he cheer and laugh in triumphif u havent seen it then ur missin out

Jul 12 2010,negative,im sick of tom cruise
Jul 12 2010,positive,very good scifi movie very intense to the last second a little bit of a quick ending but its a great movie
Jul 12 2010,negative,dakota was adorable in it tom nothing new about his acting there
Jul 12 2010,positive,war of the worlds has steven spielberg working in top form sure the script can be a bit shaky when it comes to the alien mythology but its in the astounding special effects cinematography sound editing and directing that make the film so insanely gripping couple all of that with three wholly believable performances by tom cruise dakota fanning and justin chatwin and you are in for one hell of an experience i have always admired war of the worlds for being able to hold my attention and my emotions for every single minute of its running time
Jul 11 2010,positive,the intensity doesnt let up for even a second it is an edge of your seat thriller all the way until the credits roll the ending though could have been better
Jul 11 2010,negative,i did not saw the movie
Jul 11 2010,positive,haaa the sound of the alien keeps playing in my head until nowpoooowwuuuungggg hahahaha

Jul 11 2010,positive,a very good movie and a must see movie i think tom cruise plays an excellent role in this movie
Jul 10 2010,positive,a great scifi movie with a great performence by tom cruse the only thing that brings this movie down is that at times dakotah fanning is really annoting but still a good movie
Jul 10 2010,negative,freaky movie i hated it
Jul 10 2010,positive,really pushed the pg13 rating which is a good thing in my opinion love the aliens
Jul 10 2010,positive,very good better then the original and its a scary idea  just imagine if this really happened in real life how insane it would be  tom cruise did fantastic like usual and since he had to worry about his kids it was more believable than just some hero
Jul 10 2010,positive,tom cruise always rocks world went on great destruction here  tom move his family towards safe plce
Jul 9 2010,positive,6610        steven spielberg is an accomplished director in almost every way im impressed by nearly everything i watch that is directed under his name war of the worlds is a spielberg film with big ambitions most of which it can handle but as one can expect war of the worlds still isnt the intoxicating work of science fiction that it wants to be cinema has yet to receive a flawless adaptation of hg wells novel but i suppose steven spielberg and his expansive vision will have to do war of the worlds is a terribly cliched yet thrilling and visually spectacular edition to spielbergs evergrowing filmography it certainly isnt his most ambitious love letter but none the less its obvious that he tried pretty damn hard to make the film good he does indeed succeed even if i didnt love the film overall it did what it did it was pretty thrilling yet lacking the chill of an alien invasion in many ways i found the invasion to be too loud and too muddled i enjoyed the alien invasion in m night shyamalans signs which was somewhat quiet and at the same time complex and deeply suspenseful war of the worlds all together feels more like an action epic than the next big geek flick but it is what it is most will perceive it as good pretty good or decent i cant see the film being bad unless one truly despises the alien invasion subgenre in general i personally feel as if its a pretty solid subgenre considering that theres plenty of classics and plenty of goods to be found most directors know how to deliver such basic things and as we know spielberg might as well be the man for the job its just a matter of preference and i certainly prefer spielbergs tender family outing et over war of the worlds it depends how much spielberg devotes his time to the emotion of the characters or even the film in general           war of the worlds was originally effective due to pure human paranoia nobody knew what to believe and it was purely based on ones personal faith and beliefs war of the worlds is somewhat showing its age as a story mostly because so many can successfully modify the story into something genuinely memorable and typically beautiful it just hasnt been done often spielbergs adaptation of war of the worlds starts with promise and carries that promise pretty much until the end the film opens with a simple suggestion the narrator morgan freeman suggests that mankind is ignorant and does not currently suspect that they are being watched by higher beings of intelligence he is most likely referring to aliens and surprise surprise it turns out that he is correct we are then introduced to a somewhat dysfunctional family that consists of the father ray and his children rachel and dobbie ray was divorced causing all sorts of problems with the kids mostly with dobbie ray has constant trouble relating or even communicating with the somewhat antisocial dobbie who rejects any invitations from ray to connect but human interaction proves to be the least of their problems since earth has been literally damned since it was created and by that i of course am referring to the giant alien spaceships that have been hiding underground all these years soon the aliens begin to show themselves and begin to attack causing uproar in humanity everyone starts to run about not that doing so will save them theyre going to get their asses blown up anyways in a frenzy which causes problems for our heroes everyone wants to travel via car although even that probably wouldnt guarantee a ticket out of ones certain demise essentially the whole film consists of a father and daughter and for a good amount of time a son running from lightning zapping alien tripods sound interesting some may say hell yeah i personally wouldnt guarantee entertainment from such a limited source although i found it to be satisfying its nothing brilliant as you probably knew but it certainly isnt stupid enough to make a film bad it just needed a good amount of polishing thats all also mind the characters none of them are very interesting or complex people you might as well live next to the guy tom cruise gleefully impersonates              tom cruise isnt a bad actor nor is he a good one i feel as if he is often misjudged as a person for obvious reason but at the same time i can understand why the general population does so hes not particularly bad in war of the worlds but his performance feels rather silly but as i noticed that obvious quality i also noticed than cruise was having loads of fun and thats pretty important for most actors fun is usually good too bad cruises character isnt all that endearing and i dont think thats the actors fault dakota fanning is young here and annoying as hell she screams and whines about everything but perhaps thats what her character calls for and sadly she never fails to do those things because those are the things she does best everything else is most definitely filler justin chatwins performance certainly wasnt awful but like all of the other actors he lacked a solid amount of emotional complexity or even capability any of the dramatic or emotional scenes involving these actors are mostly pathetic and it would be better if the film didnt try to be sappy at least there are enough giant alien tripod death sequences to cover most of that up nicely                war of the worlds has a good amount of paranoia i mean that was expected spielberg crafted the film nicely as he does with nearly every film he delivers that tense paranoid feeling throughout but that doesnt match the finesse of creepiness or shear fear itself sadly war of the worlds is not frightening its a nice thriller but it didnt make me as paranoid as i had hoped but when it was exciting i watched with joy this was a fairly geeky little film and it did a good amount of good its not memorably cinematic but at the same time it has some solid heart in it its the work of a natural born film director even if its not the best example of his absorbing filmmaking none the less i kind of digged the style and aim of war of the worlds it wasnt too hard to do and nor was it to easy too disguise the film wasnt creepy or disturbing but at the same time it did what it wanted to do the films original score which is brilliantly brought to us by john williams is fairly good in terms of atmosphere its not truly memorable or addicting but its worth a go and finally i must discuss war of the worlds as a visual experience visually this film was very very good not groundbreaking but the cgi was breathtaking and none the less thrilling but as always i prefer cinematography over fx and thankfully war of the worlds fed my need for good camera work the camera work in this film is absolutely incredible its nothing new but its amazing none the less the angles are amazing and every action sequence is flawlessly filmed by cinematographer janusz kaminski simply stunning and thoroughly impressive stuff          war of the worlds was how does one put thissatisfying i liked it but i didnt adore it its not an intoxicatingly beautiful piece of work but it is none the less another wholesomely absorbing film by steven spielberg master director not his best piece of work and its bound to disappoint some die hard fans of both the novel and the director but hey arent all adaptations bound to do that for some reason i suppose so but if i said i disliked this cliche entertainment piece then id be lying its average filmmaking overall but i was impressed at least spielberg can make the adaptation of war of the worlds that most cannot seem to craft and in that sense stephen spielberg might as well be one of the geek gods
Jul 9 2010,positive,so much fun loved it
Jul 9 2010,positive,good movie better graphics than the original

Jul 8 2010,negative,what a west of time never expect something from god of film direction
Jul 8 2010,neutral,i came into this film with high expectations but unfortunately war of the worlds suffered from a large budget and not much material to work with its mildly entertainingthe visual effects are nice and the acting isnt horrible if youre looking for a good scifi film there are better ones not recommended
Jul 7 2010,negative,didnt see it dont want to tom cruise doesnt have any respect for women
Jul 7 2010,positive,it would be epic if something like this happened so randomly one day hell id be delighted to have my life end by some robotic like machines coming out of the ground
Jul 7 2010,positive,top movie could have been longer
Jul 7 2010,positive,tne end was crap lovely graphics though
Jul 7 2010,negative,i dont think this movie short of updated effects brought anything to the plot there were a couple good moments but were squallered away by the bad parts
Jul 7 2010,negative,remake stinksorigonal is the only 1 2 watch
Jul 6 2010,positive,remake no thanks original yes
Jul 5 2010,negative,i did not like this movie to much it was ok but i am not a tom cruise fan
Jul 5 2010,negative,i did not like this movie to much it was ok but i am not a tom cruise fan
Jul 5 2010,positive,steven spielberg directs this remake of the classic hg wells novel  packed with spectacular special effects and explosive out of this world war sequences war of the worlds should not be missed  the acting could have been better and the story a little touched up  although the story is not horrible  starring tom cruise dakota fanning and even an appearance by tim robbins
Jul 5 2010,negative,if it wasnt tom cruise i wont watch it
Jul 5 2010,positive,dakota fanning made this movie worth watching
Jul 5 2010,positive,manages to do well with the suspense and paranoia it delivers as it clunks along
Jul 4 2010,positive,jumpy and got my attention
Jul 4 2010,positive,watched that when i was like 7 it scared my mom but i liked it
Jul 4 2010,neutral,one of the most traumatizing movies i have ever seen lots of deathbut otherwise well done
Jul 4 2010,positive,no its not just another scifi popcorn movie but so many people fail to see that
Jul 4 2010,positive,average and overdramatic  tom cruise  as expected
Jul 4 2010,neutral,great special effects however its not so much my cup of tea as i found it a bit intense
Jul 4 2010,positive,im not sure why so many people hate tom cruise well i guess a lot of people really love him too seems like a lot of young people dont like him though as far as ive seen i like a lot of his movies and he really is good in this one he and dakota are so believable in this movie and tim robbins too as the stressed out weirdo lol the 3 of them really make this film work well all 3 give great performances i think i thought this movie was very suspenseful and literally scarier than a saw film any day
Jul 3 2010,positive,amazing best picture of its year
Jul 3 2010,positive,havent seen the remake yet
Jul 3 2010,positive,one of my favorite movies
Jul 3 2010,negative,pathetic great if it was meant to be a comedy
Jul 2 2010,positive,interesting movie i believe it was sort of a remake back in the day
Jul 2 2010,negative,didnt age well  one of spiellbergs lesser films
Jul 2 2010,positive,a good representation of the book
Jul 2 2010,positive,the strongest aspect of this version of war of the worlds is actually the performances mixed in with the special effects of alien invaders tom cruise is very strong as the young redneck father one of his more memorable performances in recent years dakota fanning is unforgettable in a perormance that seems almost too genuine and tim robbins nails his stressed out weirdo character and makes him quite interesting and creepy the film overall is decent but the performances stood out the most amongst the scifi set in my view
Jul 2 2010,positive,scary what if it could really happen
Jul 1 2010,positive,an interesting picture yet a bump in spielbergs core abilities
Jul 1 2010,positive,surprisingly gory and disturbing war is an edge of your seat action thriller that delves into your deepest fears it fell flat though in terms of acting and writing
Jun 30 2010,positive,not a bad movie it seemed to have all the keys to a great suspense movie although i knew that i was supposed to be on the edge of my seat i never got that into it some cool special effects and for people who enjoy death this movie did show lots of it i thought the children were unnecessary and only slowed tom cruise down they added to the drama but mostly just annoyed mebut this movie truly did make the aliens look frightening they red plant was intimidating it ended up cleanly which i always enjoy in a movie so not a bad movie just not amazing
Jun 30 2010,positive,great acting from dakota fanning
Jun 30 2010,neutral,has nothing new to offer barring some good special effects
Jun 30 2010,neutral,tom c its nice movie but when this was showed here everything thats about end of the world are showed so its all the same storynice
Jun 30 2010,positive,fear of unknown  last day to comeinteresting
Jun 29 2010,negative,i dont blame spielberg for how bad this is i blame cruise and fanning
Jun 29 2010,positive,hate tom cruise but love this one
Jun 29 2010,negative,it sucked but thats my opion watch it if you want
Jun 29 2010,positive,its a good movie but it definitely could have been better it seemed like it was too open with the aliens a mysterious alien species that has been around for untold millions of years shouldnt have their plans and motivations explained within the first 15 minutes of them arriving now granted they didnt really explain the aliens motivation but you could definitely figure it outtake over the world why because the aliens freaking feel like it now i did like the part of the movie when they hide out in the basement with the crazy guy that was the peak of the movie showing how humans react to an alien invasion it did certainly feel more down to earth than other alien invasiondisaster movies some parts can be a bit cliche but its easy to overlook it i did like the grey lighting its perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the movie and enhances it it does turn out to be entertaining and i dont regret watching it definitely much better than most of the other disaster movies coming out
Jun 29 2010,positive,coulda been better but cant have everything
Jun 29 2010,positive,the ending is terrible in this overly american film but in the middle of this the atmosphere does become chilling and very relistic to its credit
Jun 29 2010,negative,a little too weird for me
Jun 28 2010,negative,great special effects mediocre to just plain bad dakota fanning performances its a forgettable film that doesnt leave you with anything special to take home it might have worked better if they family the movie follows were a group of people i didnt want to see vaporized by the space alien shipthings
Jun 28 2010,negative,too much screaming on screen bit annoying
Jun 28 2010,negative,this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but considering the director leading man and budget it might be the most disappointed ive ever been
Jun 27 2010,positive,the best remake of a classic since oceans 11    a dead beat dadray ferriertom cruise gets a second chance to be a father when the earth is threatened by a robotic alien force with a rebellious teenage son and impressionable young daughter racheldakota fanning he must avoid all obstacles and make it to boston     the only problem i had with this movie was that they didnt make it r rated i felt they could have been a little more graphic but spielberg is still genius great acting character development and above average special effects keep this movie entertaining the whole two hours
Jun 27 2010,negative,okay adaption of original  original better though
Jun 27 2010,positive,the destruction scenes is where this film succeeds its overall entertaining but the movie suffers from annoying characters and a script that does not serve the film justice i advise when watching the film skip the first 15minutes because they dont matter
Jun 27 2010,positive,the only guy who could have done it did it spielburg rules
Jun 27 2010,positive,its always awesome to see tom cruise in a vulnerable role  hes too cocky and i dont particularly care for him in most things  this remake wasnt that bad but it wasnt that great either
Jun 26 2010,positive,fantastically made but uneven
Jun 26 2010,positive,dark and frightening
Jun 26 2010,positive,simply a fantastic movie my only problem was the ending which is only a minor flaw compared to the greatness achieved by the rest of the film its not the first time that spielberg succeeded in making a film about aliens any other person could never make this film as good as him spielberg is easily one of the greatest directors in movie history
Jun 26 2010,positive,another great sifi better than the old version
Jun 26 2010,positive,i like you war of the worlds i do
Jun 26 2010,positive,i watched this movie with my buddy and he pretty much made it into a comedy
Jun 26 2010,positive,despite some silly charecters and scientific implausabilities i am very pleased with this movie of spielburgs  he creates an exciting wellpaced plot with both horrifying human and nonhuman elements that seem to compliment each other perfectly as the plot unfolds  the adaptation itself is a perfect imprinting of wellss story on modern times and one that sticks surprisingly close when compared with past adaptaions    for naysayers i say look at recent scifi remakes and alien invasion movies  yeah they make this film look godlike dont they
Jun 25 2010,positive,at first i didnt like it but when i recently seen some of the bad disaster movies recently i had to watch it again it is defiantly one of the best disaster movies since independence day the visual effects are breath taking the only down side is the acting is nothing to brag about dakota fanning is as annoying as ever tom cruises performance was the only good one it is defiantly not speilbergs best but it is an entertaining great movie
Jun 24 2010,positive,i liked it but dakota fanning was so annoying in this movie
Jun 24 2010,positive,i thought it was good b
Jun 24 2010,negative,original or remake only 1 12 for remake though dakota fanning was good
Jun 23 2010,positive,a brilliant modern day version just like the brilliant modern day original film excellent acting from all the cast and a terrific score by john williams which makes the prologue even more scary and the continuous hornlike blowing for the aliens this movie has one of the scariest and most terrorfying scenes ever and in my opinion beats the original 53 scene the scene where the cylinder opens but in this film it takes at least five minutes and the beautiful directoral work by spielberg that doesnt fully focus on the alien intruder but instead shows its reflecting in cars and the reactions of the people of the town  this is one of the rare 12pg13 films that truely scare me to bits
Jun 23 2010,positive,the original was much more better
Jun 22 2010,positive,the original war of the worlds was more interesting
Jun 22 2010,positive,thought towards the end of the movie  on the set was not so good  too fake
Jun 22 2010,positive,epicalthat even a wordbut i enjoyed itreally goodmakes you think maybe a day like that is inevitablethey are watching us
Jun 22 2010,positive,i wish this came true so i could look cool being a hero even though i would probably die
Jun 22 2010,positive,havent see the new one with tome cruise yet
Jun 21 2010,negative,nice special effects butthats all
Jun 21 2010,negative,i didnt like the movie i mean a movie where aliens look like annoretic models only prettier and where tom spends the whole movie carrying the little girl around i mean its really boring and i really like scifi but this one was terrible sorry all war of the worlds fans
Jun 21 2010,negative,war of the scientologists
Jun 21 2010,positive,pretty darn good also quite scary
Jun 20 2010,negative,i saw tom cruise say in an interview that this movie was really scary not even a little bit scary and not entertaining even
Jun 20 2010,negative,just about watchable
Jun 19 2010,positive,good i love it watch it every time on tv family loves it to
Jun 19 2010,positive,i always thought hg wells war of the worlds story was brilliant and absolutely perfect this movie may not be as good as the classic 50s movie but its definitely a very fun action flick and still true to the original novel highly recommended
Jun 19 2010,negative,again why mess with perfection there was no reason to remake this movie other than to up grade the special fx other than that leave it alone also if you have never heard the musical version i highly recomend spending your money on that and not this load of crap
Jun 18 2010,positive,i wil c it one more time for tom cruise
Jun 18 2010,neutral,the story is dumb   assuming the aliens were intelligent why didnt they just dust us off with a highly contagious plague virus  wouldnt they be aware of and test for biological threats to themselves we kept the moon rocks in isolation until we were certain there were no biological threats to us  what was the point of the aliens planting their machines thousands of years before the actual invasion wouldnt our destruction have been easier then  the truth is we will be utterly defenseless against any hostile alien species capable of coming to this planet
Jun 17 2010,positive,a great action film with tom cruise running around like a lunatic i was a little disappointed to how the movie ended but i think the visuals and action make up for that good movie not great
Jun 17 2010,positive,damn good remake of the scifi classic  i really enjoyed it
Jun 16 2010,negative,tom cruise as he often does poisoned this film to crap
Jun 15 2010,positive,creepy not really scary but thrilling not really as amazing as expected to be
Jun 15 2010,positive,hard to get over hating tom cruise enough to enjoy this no matter how good the special effects were
Jun 15 2010,positive,steven speilburg directs the h g wells clasic syfi thriller novel about aliens who come to earth and try to destroy human life  tom cruise has done another speilburg movie called minority report and this movie lives up to the syfi classics
Jun 15 2010,positive,simply breathe taking  this is steven spielberg at his absolute best
Jun 14 2010,negative,not nearly as good as the book
Jun 14 2010,negative,serioulsy gave me the willes fog horns still make my heart stop
Jun 14 2010,neutral,i really liked it when it was released but after watching it a few times it get ridiculous
Jun 14 2010,positive,the kitchy original still my favorite
Jun 13 2010,positive,very good tom cruise film
Jun 13 2010,neutral,entertainingher screaming got on my nerves but overall i liked it
Jun 13 2010,negative,poor compared to jeff waynes musical version
Jun 12 2010,negative,a horribly lost opportunity
Jun 12 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a rare flick that earns my 100  the film is flawless the most ironic part is that the premise and framework is from 1898    spielberg out did even himself on this one the movie starts out fast enough with lightning and earth quakes and never lets up until the final scene  it has superb ideas cinematography script audio cast production editing  i cant think of any part that took a bad turn    tom cruise is perhaps at his very best here just playing a dad protecting his own rather than an over the top hero    this is one of the best movies for blu ray i have in my collection    tripods from mars rolling over the strongest military on the planet in 2 days people losing faith their mindstheir humanity     bravisimo
Jun 11 2010,positive,steven speilbergs war of the worlds based on hg wells novel which started off all the end of the world stuff has a great script and plenty of briliant suspensful moments  the special effects are first rate and has strong performances by tom cruise and co  but its good points are the films weaknesses    the suspensful scenes are just piled on top of one another which only gives a few short minutes for the plot to breath  spielbergs direction and camerawork is first rate and the cinematography is fantastic      this is a master of a film full of suspense and terror and has the emotion of et  7510
Jun 10 2010,positive,so tom cruises scientology crap pays off in this movie
Jun 9 2010,positive,epic action i loved this movie
Jun 9 2010,neutral,this had the most disappointing ending  lots of fluff and showing effects
Jun 9 2010,negative,you would think in todays market that this version would have smoked the original i guess you cant improve on the original
Jun 9 2010,positive,gotta love tom cruise he has made a great career out of being an action go to guy when his movies hit the big screen i am almost always impressed
Jun 8 2010,positive,it was freaky it was not a movie i wanted to see
Jun 8 2010,positive,i could watch this over and over again its one of my favs
Jun 8 2010,positive,the special effects were great acting was great too rachel ferriers dakota fanning is a really talented actress i did like this movie it was quite entertaining but the beginning was a bit boring to me but i must say that the ending was extremely disappointing i didnt get why all of a sudden those machines started to stop working was it because ray ferrier tom cruise destroy one of them with bombs and make the other ones weak how can it be connected it was too confusing robbie ferrier justin chatwin came out of nowhere in the ending the fire explosion was big enough to burn everything but yeah he had to be the surprise in the end so hes alive oo  i would say this movie would have been awesome with 5 star if the ending was something else    
Jun 8 2010,positive,cheesey but good haha
Jun 8 2010,neutral,tom c just didnt make the cut  shoulda been someone more untomcruiseish
Jun 8 2010,positive,homecoming for spielberg to his home of science fiction movie

May 30 2010,negative,scared the  out of me  
May 30 2010,positive,awesome remake of a stellar classic
May 29 2010,negative,i didnt really think this is that good no offense to the fans who loved this but i absolutely thought that this was stupid i watched this because it was spielbergs film and i was expecting more i could honestly say that this was one of the worst scifi films ive ever watched even though the special effects were one of the most spectacular ive ever seen
May 29 2010,positive,of course boston is far fromengland regardless this new take on the hg wells classic does classic with an intriguing plot and excellent visual effects

May 17 2010,positive,good effects but not as menacing as the original
May 16 2010,positive,an above average screen adaptation of the great hg wells booklight years ahead of most blockbusters in terms of believabilitytom cruises performance is noteworthy as the reluctant heroand the script moves along at a steady pacesome nice touches throughout with fully fleshed out minor characters adding to the realitygenuinely scary at times and worth watching

May 10 2010,neutral,i have mixed feelings for this movie it succeeds in being eary but it fails in the character development plus i think it should of used the same character from the novel and the first person perspective didnt do it justice
May 10 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a classic steven spielberg thriller i loved the awesome alien special effects i liked how in this movie he didnt really focus on the alien race themselves and on a boring background plot he put a lot of heart from human characters and we got enough thrill out of that but when an alien finally popped out it was so freaky and cool     the charactersactors not complex but well acted and performed not boring and drawling like in 2012 but good enough the young cast was very sweet   65100     special effects specatacularly done typical spielberg the alien scenes are not for the faint of heart but were bloody and tastefully done for an action film   85100     directing they were pretty good but i kind of expected a little more considering spielbergs past work   65100     storyplot not very complex but everything fits and makes a satisfying thing to watch   70100     overall consensus it was an awesome movie overall nearing spectacular   70100

Apr 20 2010,positive,great movie loved the aliens
Apr 19 2010,positive,aliens are they out there watching our every movement planning an attack or diplomacy will we ever know for now it seems uncertain people claim to have seen strange lights in the sky and some have even said that they have been abducted these stories are never proven of course but it makes you wonder the possiblity of alien existance in this universe is high and life is rare in this vast void of space but some say the neighboring mars holds the possibility of life and h g wells seems to have agreed his book was adapted and remade and the latter was superior  steven spielberg directs this remake and he does quite a job it is much more character focused and driven than its predecessor and is a better film for it the story follows divorced father ray farrier played by a usually intense tom cruise his two younglings a picky girl rachel dakota fanning and a surly teen robbie justin chatwin are at his house for the weekend ray is obviously the pathetic secondary father next to the new stepfather and cruise actually manages the part quite well soon spielberg does what he does best aliens attack earth in epic fasion ray rachel and robbie are trying to make it to safety as the invasion escalates all along the way the characters arent forgotten the developement is excellent ray tries to salvage relations with his estranged children robbie tries to achieve his independence and rachel tries to grasp whats happening with her meagre youth the story as a whole is as solid as an alien invasion story can be it escalates and builds nicely even if the pacing feels a bit off in the third act it really feels like it slows down however also toward the end spielberg uses an increasingly stark color pallet to increase the desperation of the situation overall its pretty solid apart from the pacing  the acting is universally excellent cruise who usually bothers me in a film does great and brings conviction to his role he does great as the struggling father in the same way he did in minority report though better he also does quite great in coping with the concept of an alien invasion and ps tom you cant sing dont dakota fanning gives her usually strong performance stealing scenes frequently her character feels a bit annoying at times though at least to me anyway sometimes watching it i really felt like saying shut up giant alien tripods are shooting around us and disintigrating people there are other things to worry about for the most part she is very good outdoing every other child actor out there chatwin also does quite a great job as robbie although he only really steals the show in one scene but what an amazing scene that is it was dark artistic emotional tim robbins also shows up for a while and as usual does fantastically as far as his performance goes think mystic riverlevel intensity and it works out  special effects are the usual industrial lights and magic greatness they are all fantastic and of course we would expect nothing less of the great ilm the mighty tripods are terrifying at their best and sequences featuring them are scifi creepy overall pretty excellent  also more than worth mentioning is the music john williams crafts his usual greatness the score featured here is creepy and mysterious it is one of williams finest  war of the worlds is a fantastic entry in the science fiction genre and in the alien invasion subgenre of that it ranks among spielbergs more emotionally resonant films and one of the more emotional films in the entire scifi genre its packed with great performances suspense and awesome effects scenes it is brought down a little bit by a slow third act and something happens in the end that does remove some of that emotional power if youve seen it you should know but not so much that it becomes bad it is definitely a film worth watching
Apr 19 2010,negative,if i could give negative stars i would im dumb dumb movie

Apr 16 2010,positive,such a consistently sinister tone  the moments that transpire between the storm and the rise of the machines are nothing short of terrifying  that industrial honk of the machines makes me shudder    it only fails to kill tom cruise
Apr 16 2010,positive,i hate tom cruise speilberg on the other hand i enjoy
Apr 15 2010,positive,i really loved this moviei dont know how but spielberg made the film so intense that i felt like i was there with the desperate people running from danger you can wait ages for a movie that has that psychological effect on you    i also thought that tom cruise does some of his best work here as the weekend dadclueless to how his children thinks or what they want he really has to step up and become a real dad to themand i think its an interesting character arc the change in his attitude seems absolutely convincing to me    as for the special effects they are spectacularand big i think the way these machines and aliens seldom are in full view is also a good way of keeping the tension
Apr 15 2010,positive,steven spielberg reteams with tom cruise for a wild ride
Apr 15 2010,positive,really a thriller great design the beginning is my favorite where you dont know what it is yet but one thing bugs me and that is the picture perfect untouched parents in the midst of chaos and death

Apr 11 2010,positive,war of the worlds is taut gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking effects wise this is a very very good film like all modern scifi films it looks awesome and very realistic the aliens and their mechanical tripods are slick shiny and uber cool looking  whilst the fungus like growth they produce across everything looks brilliant and fully believeable superb effects kudos a wickedly entertaining scifi thriller filled with explosive speacial effects teriffic action and mindblowing excitement
Apr 11 2010,neutral,i was disappointed in this movie  was expecting much more than what i got
Apr 11 2010,neutral,i saw this movie five years ago when it was released  i watched it again as i really didnt remember much about it  i still didnt see much that caught my attention  dakota fannings character is kind of annoying i guess  but i have no doubt that i will forget the story again in the not to distant future

Apr 5 2010,positive,no its not as good as the original but it is good war of the worlds has some great special effects and the direction is excellent with some incredible camerawork which made me think how the hell did they do that the characters are likable but flawed and easy to identify with while many of the aspects of the film are trite this is definitely a good yet a been there done that alien invader movie
Apr 5 2010,positive,this movie sticks to a well known for alienbelievers propaganda that aliens have been here for a long time and one day they will take over as for the beginning of the movie it seemed great i liked that the main character wasnt too much hero the movie had its tone but then it lost it the ending wasnt that well thought of and was on a way to become cheesy one to sum up its ok for a dose of scifi but its not entirely great
Apr 4 2010,positive,i dont know why i liked this

Mar 29 2010,negative,identical scenes from both this movie and jurrasic park lame
Mar 29 2010,positive,however i didnt find tom cruises character convincing as usual in my case the detailded sets and superb visual effects made that show worth investing a while of my time

Mar 20 2010,neutral,this movie is redeeming for the subsonic frequency content cruise is well cruise not bad i guess
Mar 20 2010,positive,realy loved it like five star
Mar 20 2010,positive,69100 the war of the worlds remake is pretty good but not as good as i was hoping it would be one of director steven spielbergs strongest traits as a director has been his incredibly well developed characters especially the children in his films what happened here actually none of the characters were appealing its probably not a good thing when you root for the aliens to win over the earthlings i wanted them to suck up dakota fanning soo bad just to shut the brats screaming tom cruises character of a deadbeat dad was not exactly a character one would sympathize with and his performance is very one dimensional     technically it is terrific the special effects are first rate very imaginative and well filmed truly amazing in that regard but as with so many modern remakes of classics its all razzle dazzle and so little substance the original is more than 50 years older than this version and it still remains the best version great special effects are very entertaining but you need more than that a film has to have a heart and soul and not just wallow in a superficial mix of technical achievements
Mar 19 2010,positive,this movie had the most chilling special effects this movie gave me nightmares the main actors were great but the extras mostly sucked at the acting it wasent bad but it could have been better
Mar 19 2010,positive,visually great but some annoyence
Mar 19 2010,positive,i liked it more than the original at least
Mar 18 2010,positive,not scary but a little chilling
Mar 18 2010,positive,initially scary but great movie
Mar 18 2010,positive,in this remake of the classic sic fi masterpiece it is a well put together film tom crusie is brilliant as the leading man but the one how steels the show from him is the girl who played his dauagter she alone adds that tone of realsitic  fear and paranoia which would occur in a disater the one thing the movie dose is make a small trubite to the oringial 1953 movie with scene like the leading characters traped in a fram house when an alien probe enters effect wise its nothing that special but the walkers are cool to look at 710
Mar 18 2010,positive,by far the best disaster flick ever made no one is better at showing you disturbing alien invasion sequences better than steven spielberg this movie also shows you a graphic image of how an alien invasion would come down if there were any aliens
Mar 18 2010,negative,to fakeits going to so much more in real life
Mar 18 2010,positive,excellent special effects ok story which could have been fleshed out more rent stream
Mar 17 2010,negative,later on in the day i saw war of the worlds i missed the first 5 minutes though war of the worlds was wierd were the aliens killed by the filth of pidgeons they sure looked stupid though and how the hell did the emo kid get out of the blood bath i was very much confused by this movie damnit why did i have to miss the first 5 minutes     oh yea now i remember i missed the first 5 minutes because the asshole pizza guy was late
Mar 17 2010,negative,i wanted to like this simply for the awesome cgi and effects but the characters ruined it for me i ended up rooting more for the aliens than the humans

Mar 13 2010,positive,ahhh the film that spawned my 5 yearand still going tom cruise obsession gotta give it something for that  pretty cool visually with a scene i didnt expect and definitely found the most emotional  spoiler  tom cruise realizes the guy he and his daughter are rooming with is crazy and plans to reveal them to the aliens tom cruise makes his daughter hide and he then kills the man in order to survive o  an alright disaster film but with a kind of disappointing ending jipish

Mar 9 2010,positive,decent movie with some rather annoying characters
Mar 8 2010,positive,545 take whatever movie you think of when you see the title and throw it out the window you arent going to see a war instead you get signs meets cloverfield and spielbergs masterful direction doesnt waste one moment or a single line of dialog to keep the tension and the stakes running ever higher its the complete opposite of his previous close encounters and i recommend it as a double feature
Mar 8 2010,neutral,not as impressed with this tom cruise vehicle remaks of a classic
Mar 8 2010,positive,i didnt really care for tom cruise in this film but i loved the special effects
Mar 7 2010,negative,just about to watch it again big fan of the originalbut not keen on the vey odd scientologist tom twat cruise

Mar 4 2010,neutral,good could of been better
Mar 4 2010,positive,the interconnections and tropes are seemingly cliché but the apocalyptic nature is terrifying one of the few movies that actually has me on the edge of my seat

Mar 1 2010,positive,what would be a magnum opus for any other director it becomes rather forgettable in the steven spielberg canon particularly after his other two alien epics  still manages to be good despite having a bit of cheese from tim robbins
Mar 1 2010,negative,this is one of those scifi movies that was better as a book
Mar 1 2010,negative,not big on this movie

Feb 28 2010,positive,i think tom cruise gives his best performance in war of the worlds hes switching from action man to a protective father figure who tries to connect back with his estranged kids amongst a vicious alien invasion its no surprise steven spielbergs update is a new classic and its an eight years old movie that hasnt aged a bit the visuals are mind blowing from the moment the first tripod emerges to the total obliteration of the military attack in the last half the suspense builds up and at times this can be terrifying if you havent seen this by now then you are missing out big time
Feb 28 2010,negative,some cool action sequences fail to make this less cheesy than it ought to be
Feb 27 2010,positive,interesting
Feb 27 2010,positive,i like this movie its awesome

Feb 24 2010,negative,a poor remake of the over used original story
Feb 24 2010,positive,im not really interested in this kind of movie
Feb 23 2010,neutral,the acting is good and so are some of the thrills but other than that this movie pretty much sucked a dissappointing remake to a true classic the special effects are great and it was a good role for tom cruise but for some reason i really did not enjoy this film it was boring at times and it takes away the originality of the first film the dialogue was okay but still its uneventful
Feb 23 2010,positive,nothing really stood out to me in a sense of appeal or originality but still had quite a few enjoyable epic sequences
Feb 23 2010,positive,a film called wow in another language
Feb 23 2010,positive,well tom cruises acting as usual is good and the thrills are good but it still feels like this is missing something i just cant put my finger on iti know  youre thinking here it comesanother snide review but youre wrong i just dont think it was as epic as it couldve been but heck yes it was a good movie lots of thrills and even that morally questionable scene with cruise and the crazyman and a blunt object
Feb 23 2010,positive,above average use of sound and computer effects  say what you want but i didnt mind tom cruise in this one
Feb 22 2010,positive,my friend got scared and i though it was good
Feb 22 2010,positive,im not a big fan of hollywood trying to make every blockbuster centre on the us but i actually really enjoyed this film granted it suffers from starring tom cruise but even that fails to spoil a damn good remake of the hg wells classic
Feb 21 2010,positive,the visual effects were awesome cruise and fanning made me believe they were experiencing the action it was easy to suspend disbelief because of their performances
Feb 21 2010,positive,cool but um kinda freaky

Feb 19 2010,negative,effective though has a bit too much spielberg stink on it for my taste  at least they kept the opening passages from the book intact  ill settle for the orson welles radio version thanks
Feb 19 2010,neutral,before dakota fanning got overexposed and tom cruise went over the deep end another unneeded remake but spielberg has his moments like always
Feb 19 2010,positive,much to my surprise cruise was good in this  the special effects stole the show though  but by far the lp which this story is based is far superior
Feb 19 2010,positive,its has a moral that we can learn
Feb 19 2010,positive,i like the main characters
Feb 18 2010,positive,not usually a fan of cruisr but he did well in this scifi adventure
Feb 18 2010,neutral,this is a 2 star movie but speilberg gives it a 12 star more just cause i love his movies but he shoulda stayed away from this movie and cruise is a has been two bit actor him and reeves should hang it up

Feb 18 2010,positive,i fought it woz awesome

Feb 17 2010,positive,good reinterpretation of the h g wells classic
Feb 16 2010,negative,a terrible film  everything about this seems to say it was done by committee  specifically i know of no group of people who would hang around at point blank range as a suddenly split open earth spews forth a strange device aslightning is striking around them    skip this one  note the dvd of this film is being sold most everywhere i see discs being sold for around 500  says a lot

Feb 15 2010,negative,i paid to see this movie and still walked out of the movies awful
Feb 14 2010,negative,i love the original radio recording of it the sheer terror some people mustve felt believing it was actually real    almost as bad as the fear i felt as i watched it being turned into an atrocious attempt of a blockbuster epic
Feb 14 2010,neutral,this is what makes the difference in having an otherwise perfect directing career
Feb 14 2010,negative,this movie was too dark and depressing for me i like the old version better
Feb 14 2010,neutral,asking urself  so what while the end title is rolling up is never a good sign even if its directed by spielberg

Feb 9 2010,positive,a bit far from the original but quite thrilling
Feb 9 2010,positive,fine remake of a classic tom cruis is lit from head to toe in this fab production
Feb 9 2010,positive,the outspoken war of the worlds actually i heard quite a few negative opinions from my friends back in the 2005 and 2006 when it was largely debated as i am a true friend and respect the opinions of my closest and most reliable pals i never took some time to watch this flick haha but boy they were wrong they kept me in ignorance of this movie all these years and i should really explain to them that war of the worlds is a good movie worth the time youll be spending on it  the story ray is a divorced dock worker who got his kids for keeping while his exwife maryann and her husband tim go to her parents to boston while he is with his daughter rachel in his house a strange storm rages in town his teenage son robbie has meanwhile stolen his car and is driving around the town soon as the son comes back they realize this is not an ordinary storm the roads start to crack and something strange comes out from the ground the chaos and panic starts to spread and soon everyone has to fight or better to say run for their lives  as a disaster movie it lacks the stuff almost every one of its kind does emotional depth id say mostly then theres no deeper message or serious questions raised it rather bases on the effects and suspense throughout 116 minutes when i say that i dont think theres much emotional depth i mean that i really did not care about the characters except for the little girl rachel dakota fanning played her brilliantly she really stood out there in my opinion  im really not tom cruises biggest fan but here he was bearable i even liked the painful scenes where he tries to be the father there was really something realistic in em  justin chatwins character robbie was the most irritating one i found myself hoping he gets killed somewhere half way into the movie haha damn he was stubborn and illogical in ever single thing he did oh and one other appearance tim robbins i just love the guy whatever he plays  war of the worlds was well taken among the critics and the crowd so if theres any chance you missed out on it like i did till now then i really recommend you see this maybe not because of the originality especially because nowadays we get more and more global disaster movies but just for the thrills and effects it incorporates with a satisfying story
Feb 8 2010,positive,just another  remake in my eyes  kyle nelson    
Feb 8 2010,positive,not a good ending though
Feb 8 2010,positive,great classic remake
Feb 8 2010,neutral,average good action just not much story pretty fun flick
Feb 8 2010,positive,its easy for a moviegoer to hate this movie and i can see why its very intense some aspects of the story arent explained dakota fanning screams a lot and people might just dislike tom cruise in general however this is still one of my favorite movies watching it a second time really helped because it made me appreciate the film a whole lot more    the acting in this was just flawless say what you want about tom cruise but he delivers an outstanding performance here im among those who didnt like the excessive screaming by dakota fanning but i can guarantee that people in real life would be that paranoid if this really happened overall the acting was just outstanding even if some characters are annoying at times    the story is also really great but you have to understand that this is a movie that strictly centers on tom cruises character and focuses on developing his character throughout the storyline which also explains why they didnt explain those so called plot holes in the movie they were deliberate and just leaves the human imagination to decide for itself    the special effects of course were great every scene was amazing even if it has the retro style that most people dont like the tripods were extremely freaky and even intimidating at times i also liked how the film carried a suspenseful tone throughout making it even more scarier than it should have been overall this is a great scifi from start to finish
Feb 7 2010,positive,very exciting remake with lots of action and scary parts 10 and up could handle
Feb 7 2010,positive,i didnt expect a lot from it but war of the worlds surprised me i enjoyed the raw feeling of the film it was intense and filled with suspense the special effects were great and tom cruise himself performed well first and only viewing  7252014

Feb 6 2010,positive,way too much to talk about here but its well worth seeing it for yourself and your 2 hours not perfect but very entertaining
Feb 5 2010,negative,if id have seen the original movie first i wouldnt have wasted my money on this one  they were both awful
Feb 5 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a thrilling brilliantly acted movie that is beautifully shot in only the way spielberg can
Feb 5 2010,positive,ehhhh  dakota fanning was fab in this as usual in any movie shes in tom cruise makes me snooze  ok but thats about it
Feb 5 2010,neutral,i like this update movie but than it took too long to end special effects on point of course steven spieberg come on now i did like the whole dead beat dad that becomes a father who cares but how the son end up at the end can anybody explain that for me
Feb 5 2010,positive,great remakeof modern times
Feb 4 2010,negative,its not my type of movie but it was ok

Jan 27 2010,positive,think it commands attention take might have to fight for when you watch the 2
Jan 27 2010,positive,the action doesnt stop in this brilliant adaptation of wells classic  the cinematography is excellent  the combination of wide angled scenes and the play with ambient light makes wotw the claude monet of scifi  tom cruise and his hesitant natural style really top this off  a film that i can watch time and time again
Jan 26 2010,neutral,okay premise remake good execution badddddd    it was still decent but this movie was a fail by speilberg and company
Jan 26 2010,positive,an incredible remake of a classic

Jan 13 2010,positive,good movie with good cast
Jan 13 2010,neutral,i like spielberg but i didnt really like the movie you know when tom cruise and dakota fanning collide it wasnt as good as a match up like dakota fanning and denzel washington that i have seen the fact that a film that shouldnt be made in recent times because i dont wanna see good effects with an old story like this and the fact that all dakota fanning does is screech and bitch just makes the movie borring and just aaaaaanother sci fitoooo bad sorry stevie

Jan 12 2010,positive,the ending needs work
Jan 12 2010,positive,not the best slightly comical
Jan 11 2010,positive,was good enough to make me freak in athunder and lightning storm
Jan 11 2010,positive,no matter how many times i watch it it never gets old
Jan 11 2010,negative,no way as good as the 50s version very disappointed
Jan 11 2010,positive,not bad but i liked the tv series better
Jan 11 2010,positive,very spielberg   i am fastinated by dakotas performance also mass scenes look perfectly realistic and sountrack is involving and what is most  directing of photography is just magnificent   for my it was a little bit too much horror and i found quite much bloopers but it is the good one
Jan 11 2010,positive,i really enjoyed this film it takes a step away from us marines v aliens and its nice to see that there wasnt any nukes used i really enjoyed this film
Jan 11 2010,positive,doesnt compare to the original but still pretty good
Jan 10 2010,positive,not my favourite but it is okay to watch more than once
Jan 10 2010,negative,youd think that this was a colorized version of some horrible 1950s tv version  its as if the entire budget went to pay spielberg and cruise    i enjoy most of spielbergs and cruises films but this definitely fails  considering the power they both have to influence how a film turns out only they can be blamed    technically youd think this would be better at least in terms of visual fx and editing but its a choppy inconsistent mess with almost no congruity  the editing is horrible theres absolutely no plot development cliches abound and formulaic meaningless scenes dominate  let this world end
Jan 10 2010,negative,perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen
Jan 10 2010,positive,action packed comical scary
Jan 10 2010,negative,cruise  a kid  whoopie

Jan 10 2010,positive,somewhat disturbing loved it though
Jan 9 2010,positive,a solid reboot of a classic tale tom cruise was a little unnecessary but this movie frightened me as a child still creeps me out now
Jan 9 2010,negative,this movie did no justice to the original tom cruise movies like this are not your fopah i thought that the 1930s version was way better which is sad to say because of a ll the steps we have taken to make movies better all that i can say is this movie is a mustnot see unless your a huge tom cruise fan and can stand dakota fannings irritating high pitched squealing throughout the movie dont watch this
Jan 9 2010,positive,at least they got the tripod thing right but i still like the book better  even one certain scene made me think of m night shyamalans signs which i also enjoyed
Jan 9 2010,positive,1st one was good too
Jan 8 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a pretty good remake of an old 50s bmovie called war of the world but this 2005 was actually pretty good the special effects were just amazing tom cruise on the other hand had a great performance in this film
Jan 8 2010,neutral,im a little surprised the tomatometer is rating as high as it is for this film  maybe i have to give this one another glance  until then  only impressive special effects and pretty good acting got it up to 50 for me  i actually left the film thinking it was atrocious so maybe it was all moodinduced  ya think    but if i had been persuaded that it felt real real enough for a scifi to make me care about the characters then i wouldnt have bust out laughing when dakota fanning shreiked is it the terrorists  it was so campy and funny i couldnt help myself  that kind of set the tone for the rest of the movie  definitely a large scale special effects film and i have no beef with that in itself  i just didnt care a bit for any character in the movie so that may have doomed it for me
Jan 8 2010,positive,this movie is really good
Jan 8 2010,neutral,too bad it had tom cruise in it
Jan 8 2010,positive,omg i love that movie
Jan 8 2010,positive,verry intresting film
Jan 8 2010,positive,one of the very few who likes this movie aside tom cruise
Jan 7 2010,positive,its oki mean it could have been a lil better
Jan 7 2010,positive,i liked everything in this movie but dakota fannings screaming and tom cruise
Jan 7 2010,negative,i like the original more than the new one
Jan 7 2010,positive,the movie was great
Jan 7 2010,positive,dark yet fast paced fun by spielberg
Jan 7 2010,positive,a masterpiece by cruises standards
Jan 7 2010,negative,duuuuu tom cruise  its ok  not a favorite got bord half way through
Jan 7 2010,neutral,big dissapointment it could have been a lot better but its not all bad it doesnt make any sense
Jan 6 2010,negative,what a nice way to ruin an  awesome story
Jan 6 2010,positive,having watched this again recently ive added to the rating i forgot how tense this was at times and i actually found myself a little on edge at the thought of something like this happening it still annoyed me in places though particularly dakota fannings screaming justin chatwins cliché teen angst and tim robbins in general
Jan 6 2010,positive,excellent good action very believable good special effects
Jan 6 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a new look and take from all of the previos ones and has the aliens invading from not the sky but the ground
Jan 6 2010,positive,tom cruise and dakota fanning were great  the special effects were out of this world
Jan 6 2010,positive,wicked remake good film
Jan 6 2010,positive,shopping  on a href
Jan 5 2010,neutral,tom cruise proves that he can single handedly bring down an entire movie that would have been awesome
Jan 5 2010,negative,disappointing i expected better from spielberg i even expect better from tom cruise the whole movie was flawed sure the aliens were cool but the finished script was probably about two pages long so they could fit all of that cgi least favorite part about this movie tom cruise bringing his 10 year old daughter to see a lightning storm thats safe
Jan 5 2010,neutral,pretty good  a little anticlimatic at the end  everything just suddenly ends and then the credits roll  i enjoyed it but its not my favorite movie
Jan 5 2010,negative,the black and white version was better
Jan 5 2010,positive,dont you get it were under attack
Jan 5 2010,negative,slow action  sticks to the original movie but acting sucks
Jan 5 2010,positive,my tommy was to over the topbut i stilled enjoyed his proformance
Jan 5 2010,positive,oh gosh hope this will not be in reality
Jan 5 2010,positive,im admittedly not a fan of tom cruise and his place within this could  in my mind  have been replaced by any number of actors that said the special effects of this movie more than adequately retain a good review from me  the sheer size of the aliens tripods lends a somewhat epic feel to the scenes featuring them i loved the mechanical sounds they made  very ominous and almost the movie itself but the fact that so little is known about them a given really since they literally just pop up out of nowhere with only a little backstory to explain it is also the films drawback
Jan 5 2010,positive,war of the worlds is a great film what everyone should see
Jan 5 2010,positive,would be better if it wasnt tom cruise
Jan 5 2010,positive,camera angles that will blow your mind
Jan 4 2010,positive,this remake and adaptation surely delivers suspense action and some great performances
Jan 4 2010,negative,omg one of the worst movies ever made
Jan 4 2010,negative,what a terrible rendition of a great story  the war machines were pretty good they were big and scary  but the story was just junk  that bratty kid and unrealistic behavior took away from the drama they were tying to create  the idea that the machines were in the ground was just to much for my suspension of disbelief to take   the original 1953 version was so much more entertaining   nice try spielberg next
Jan 4 2010,negative,its a mustsee film
Jan 4 2010,positive,i like to watch this movie
Jan 4 2010,positive,no where near as good as the original film stevens war of the worlds is a great remake none less

Jan 2 2010,positive,the original movie i think is better
Jan 2 2010,positive,great special effects but i prefer the original
Jan 2 2010,positive,just good entertainment and imagination
Jan 2 2010,positive,ive always loved the original movie by george pal and spielbergs version does an excellent job in escalating the terror however this modern version of hg wells classic could have been really really good   dont get me wrong the special effects was topnotch  those martian tripods truly looked like the unstoppable juggernauts wells imagined as they caused havok everywhere  but tom cruise was forgettable and as for his gungho son justin chatwin i kept hoping the martians would get him so you can imagine what i felt about the sugarcoated ending  one big letdown
Jan 2 2010,negative,i like tom cross and this movie is like the best
Jan 2 2010,positive,not as bad as everyone seems to think it is
Jan 2 2010,positive,this blockbuster had more potential than what it actually delivered still worthwhile to see it
Jan 2 2010,positive,excellent version of the scifi remake
Jan 1 2010,positive,not as good as the original but great special effects
Jan 1 2010,positive,adoro a justin chatwin
Jan 1 2010,positive,loved it a good remake but it only shows the story of one man and why didnt boston got wiped off the face of the earth
Jan 1 2010,positive,ok but to unrelistic
Jan 1 2010,positive,a master piece i also like the original too
Jan 1 2010,positive,the latest version was good

Dec 31 2009,positive,absolutely thrilling
Dec 31 2009,positive,awesome that movie was amazing i dont know which one i am talking about but if this is the tom cruise one it is amazing if it isnt doesnt matter cause it still rocks
Dec 30 2009,neutral,unfortunately not too great but not the worse  dakota is a good actress and coupled with tom well that saved the movie
Dec 30 2009,neutral,this movie is pretty good they made dakota fanning act really annoyingbut i heard there was a part 2
Dec 30 2009,positive,okay first on turner classic movies

Dec 30 2009,positive,delivers crazy special effects however tom cruise was disappointing
Dec 30 2009,positive,is really good liked how the aliens looked and the special effects were great
Dec 30 2009,neutral,if it wasnt for tom cruise i would have really liked this movie
Dec 30 2009,neutral,the prank was better
Dec 29 2009,negative,i would have rated this movie higher but that little girl screaming every 5 minutes was annoying
Dec 29 2009,negative,could have been better
Dec 29 2009,negative,not as good as the original
Dec 29 2009,positive,wooow another great greaaat education about alien
Dec 29 2009,positive,not a tom cruise fan but he did great in this film
Dec 29 2009,negative,not toms best one i thought he could do better
Dec 28 2009,positive,meh raining blood nice
Dec 28 2009,positive,the truly scary thing about this movie was how well it showed peoples reactions it did a great job in capturing the fear and emotion of panicky mobs dakota fanning as well as tom cruise both did excellently though with slight adaptations due to its modernization this was a good visual version of the classic novel
Dec 28 2009,positive,i have seen this movie it is very nervewrecking and interesting
Dec 28 2009,neutral,good effects but a overall lack of decent characterization for some of its leads and leaves the viewers with a sense of feeling cheated
Dec 28 2009,positive,i like dakotta very very muchthat child is very special
Dec 28 2009,negative,this movie was a sick joke what was made to look like an epic turned out to be a predictable annoying mess
Dec 28 2009,neutral,science fiction and the insatiable human drama
Dec 28 2009,negative,for some reason just didnt do it for me
Dec 28 2009,negative,will i did not like it or love it i think it suked the sory souked and the grafiks where ok but the cud of did beter but thay did not
Dec 28 2009,positive,great effects solid movie
Dec 27 2009,neutral,too much science fiction but i like the twist with the mitonchondria  if you aint know what i talkin about watch the damn movie
Dec 27 2009,positive,war was a pretty good well paced end of world movie that kept me watching and the acting was pretty good on top of the camera work  this is before tom went all crazy atleast publicly anyway
Dec 27 2009,negative,this half star is only for dakota fanings acting
Dec 27 2009,positive,spielbergs worst film  still better than most directors best efforts    the beginning of the end for tom cruises career as a box office big hitter    dakota fannings character really should have been killed by the aliens you know you were thinking it too
Dec 27 2009,negative,would have been okay without dakota fanning screaming for 45 minutes
Dec 27 2009,positive,i usually do not comment on anything by spielberg or anything that includes tom cruise simply because i find the majority to be tremendously bad in spite of it all this is a great remake
Dec 27 2009,positive,scarylolsalways imagined it real
Dec 26 2009,positive,not bad for a remake but the original waaay better
Dec 26 2009,positive,perfect good and extreemly intertaining

Dec 26 2009,positive,i thought this movie was funny cant believe this came out in 1995
Dec 26 2009,negative,i just couldnt deal with the acting in this movie  it sucked  graphics were fairly good though
Dec 26 2009,positive,i really loved this movie since i was 10 and i has good graphics too  why cant i download it on itunesââ
Dec 26 2009,negative,bahut achchi toh nahee thee
Dec 25 2009,positive,awsome movie i could watch it all day
Dec 25 2009,positive,pretty good overall were it the first time anyone had ever seen this story it would be excellent the trouble here is we all know the ending and no effort was made to changemodifyretwist the denouement so other than being a bit anticlimactic with a predictable ending the rest is actually quite compelling
Dec 25 2009,negative,again the original is much better
Dec 25 2009,neutral,meh kind of a let down its not a bad movie but to be honest i fell asleep half way through
Dec 24 2009,positive,was a great out of world movie but good to watch
Dec 24 2009,positive,didnt expect to ever like a cruise movie
Dec 24 2009,positive,pretty good scifi film
Dec 24 2009,positive,one of my favorite movies special effects were very good the movie was done very well
Dec 23 2009,negative,it is out of my expectation
Dec 23 2009,positive,this is my all time favorite disaster flick i absolutely love this movie few movies have left me in awe and at the edge of my seat at the same time i loved the characters with the exception of the son  he was so annoying and selfish i loved the special effects i loved the thrills it delivered and really what else could i ask for a fully entertaining movie
Dec 23 2009,positive,great fun with supurb special effects also not withstanding its inacuratly set in the us an attempt to recapture some og the orginal novel go see the film but for a serious and facinating experience read the book
Dec 23 2009,negative,should have and could have been so much better
Dec 23 2009,positive,great film always makes me laugh how when it came out on radio people thought it was real
Dec 23 2009,positive,what the heak was going on there
Dec 23 2009,neutral,better cgi than the last
Dec 22 2009,positive,it was ok unrealistic looking blood suspense anticlimactic ending
Dec 22 2009,positive,though not as memorable as spielbergs earlier sci fi spectacles and featuring complete sequences marred by an ever present ever shrieking dakota fanning through thrilling eye candy an involving story astounding cinematography with a car scene thatll have you guessing and spielbergs never ending love affair with sci fi war of the worlds benefits and manages to engage
Dec 22 2009,positive,i liked it but the ending was rubbish common cold killing aliens sweet as thats what happens in the book but the whole family surviving in their boston apartment theres no way i can believe that
Dec 21 2009,positive,not the book but still very good again the visuals stole my heart on this one
Dec 21 2009,negative,the special effects are a spectacle but the story ends up being dry and thin
Dec 21 2009,positive,kept me on edge of my seat
Dec 21 2009,negative,watched about half of it and turned it off
Dec 20 2009,positive,this is a sick movie
Dec 20 2009,neutral,this freaked me out 
Dec 20 2009,negative,perfect example of wt a worst can b made by da best  plz dont waste ur tym

Dec 18 2009,negative,mmmmhh if i dont have anything else to do
Dec 18 2009,positive,like the old one the remake not so much
Dec 18 2009,positive,it was sick and awsome at the same time
Dec 18 2009,negative,the special effects are a spectacle but the story ends up being dry and thin
Dec 17 2009,positive,entertaining movie à la hitchcock great scifi thriller the last third is a little weaker than the first two but overall very good
Dec 17 2009,positive,awesome remake tom cruise did amazing job love the concept
Dec 17 2009,positive,one of spielbergs weakest efforts some scenes and dialogue are truly terrible
Dec 16 2009,positive,narrator no one would have believed in the early years of the 21st century that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they observed and studied the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe confident of our empire over this world yet across the gulf of space intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us    im actually quite shocked that audiences didnt like this movie as much as critics did because this is a highly entertaining movie from start to finish apparently they didnt understand that this movie was meant only to focus on tom cruises character and how this movie was focused on a first person point of view on his character    the whole cast in this great in every way tom cruise is arguably the winning actor here however every performance is still great in this film although i couldnt stand dakota fannings screaming in this movie i did think her performance was very well done here as well the acting overall is excellent    the story in this is great and if you really look deeper into it then youll realize this was meant to be told in a first person point of view the special effects in this movie are great i especially liked the way the tripods were designed not to mention that all the destruction scenes in this movie very well done as well i also liked how wellpaced this movie was and it wasnt really dragged out this is definitely a great popcorn flick in every way
Dec 16 2009,positive,great film one of the best blockbuster of the year 2005 even tom cruise wasnt annoying as he usually is
Dec 16 2009,positive,a good movie  i love tom cruise acting
Dec 16 2009,neutral,ok but kinda stupid at the same time
Dec 15 2009,negative,well made but the story never really interested me
Dec 15 2009,negative,why would you rewrite a great story and add so many plot holes
Dec 15 2009,positive,top 5 stevie spielberg movie one of the tom cruises top performances and dakota fanning will be a great actress in the future
Dec 15 2009,positive,a very frustrating film it has a lot of the typical things you get with a spielberg movie the action is great the effects are solid and i actually like tom cruises character as the not so perfect dad but dakota fanning is annoying and the scenes with tim robbins are embarrassing the ending was a let down also if all feels like an action director that has become board with the action but its still watchable
Dec 14 2009,positive,we haad to agree its not that bad quiet thrilling
Dec 14 2009,positive,since the last movie they made which it was minority report they took the remake to an exhilarating next level in the film war of the worlds    it stars tom cruise dakota fanning justin chatwin tim robbins etc    ray ferrier tom cruise is a working class man living in new jersey hes estranged from his family his life isnt in order and hes too caught up with himself but the unthinkable and ultimately the unexpected happens to him in an extraordinary sense his small town life is shaken violently by the arrival of destructive intruders aliens which have come en masse to destroy earth as they plow through the country in a wave of mass destruction and violence ray must come to the defense of his children as the world must fend for itself by a new and very advanced enemy not of this world its inhabitants must save humanity from a far greater force that threatens to destroy it    they did a really good job remaking the classic novel which it was written by hg wells
Dec 14 2009,negative,again why a remake when the original was better
Dec 14 2009,positive,surprising since tom cruise was in it
Dec 14 2009,positive,i liked ithard act to follow orson welles radio rendition
Dec 14 2009,negative,i was like wat the after watching it
Dec 13 2009,positive,had been curious to see this as its the only one of spielbergs films i had never seen ive lost the ability to see tom cruise as hero and i kept wondering if all that screaming was going to scar dakota fanning for life but i will say that i was riveted by the visual effects and wished id seen it on the big screen tim robbins short but effective cameo also impressed like he did way back with jaws spielberg can portray raw fear like no one else a master at work so 60 feels a bit stingy and im putting my score up to 70
Dec 13 2009,positive,steven spielberg makes yet another intense white knuckle monster movie  the set pieces are staged like only he can the atmosphere is suitably foggy and creepy and the aliens provide a menace that seems all too real  a terrific combination of sound love that alien horn light and emotion with a nice turn from tom cruise as the deadbeat dad thrust into hero mode
Dec 13 2009,positive,thoroughly terrifying and splendidly entertaining the spielberg treated war of the worlds is one of the best alien invasion films i have experienced this results from the invasive personalized point of view of the characters that will leave you shaking in your seat
Dec 13 2009,positive,seen it 2345346453 times and loves it
Dec 13 2009,neutral,first one was better
Dec 12 2009,positive,i enjoy every moment of this movie
Dec 12 2009,positive,ok movie nice sfxsome very confusing ending
Dec 12 2009,positive,this is a great film i would watch it again
Dec 11 2009,positive,awesome movie i love all of the movies tom cruise makes
Dec 11 2009,neutral,not sure which one it is so ill go with the remake that i saw
Dec 11 2009,positive,loved the 1953 version the newer one relied too much on special effects etc
Dec 10 2009,negative,that was one of the worst movies i have ever seen honesty
Dec 10 2009,negative,is it true america is the only place for alien if true thanks godkekeke
Dec 10 2009,positive,tumaas rating kc and2 c dakota fanning hehe
Dec 9 2009,positive,unnerving treatment of the immediate panic after 911
Dec 9 2009,negative,i am a bit disappointed with the visual effects
Dec 9 2009,neutral,good in parts the beginning before dakota starts screaming and after tim robbins dies
Dec 9 2009,negative,terrible probably because of cruise
Dec 9 2009,neutral,i dont get the ending
Dec 9 2009,positive,the best sci fi ever cool effects
Dec 8 2009,positive,saw this in the cinema when it came out but was a bit dissapointed too hyped up maybe watched it on tv the other night though i dont remember much of movies ive seen and enjoyed it quite a bit great effects and decent suspense factor 
Dec 8 2009,negative,i like the scary movie one beter p
Dec 8 2009,neutral,if this is the new one i didnt like so much because they relied on the star power more than the storyline
Dec 7 2009,negative,has one or two moments but lacks the quirt of the original
Dec 7 2009,positive,is not like the book
Dec 7 2009,positive,to me another underrated tom cruise movie great effects awesome tension and it is flat out scary tim robbins is a maniac wish i wouldve seen it in the theaters
Dec 7 2009,positive,dakota fanning is a good actress
Dec 6 2009,negative,the original was so much better
Dec 6 2009,positive,its okay kinda depressing but okay
Dec 6 2009,positive,great until the last act then it loses steam and ends on a lackluster note
Dec 6 2009,positive,three times now spielberg has made alien movies where the aliens are friendlyclose encounters et and ai but now he makes the alien movie where they are here to destroy us  tom cruise does an adequate job in his role but the only other actor that does well is dakota fanning as his daughter  its great  to see the destruction scenes and one thing i really liked was the inferno train excellent scene
Dec 6 2009,positive,this movie is good but not great excellent director with an excellent cast a good allaround remake
Dec 6 2009,positive,the effects are and suspense and acting are on par with jurassic park and close encounters nice movie after the great effects but poor pacing and terrible acting of speilbergs  war of the worlds remake  one of speilbergs best
Dec 6 2009,positive,the original was better
Dec 6 2009,positive,good but the ending ruined a bit of it for me
Dec 5 2009,positive,this one was really good
Dec 5 2009,positive,a good movie and fun but not the end of the movie i liked
Dec 4 2009,positive,once this movie introduces the main characters it takes almost no time for the action to start they achieved great nervousness by gradual revelations of the happenings when the excitement starts the movie gradually continues becoming more exciting at a steady pace it takes a similar and equally effective strategy with the aliens and their tactics for domination i felt as though i was given enough information to have a satisfying understanding about the aliens while still retaining a decent amount of mystery to them     another theme that was explored was not only the destruction caused by the aliens in the takeover but what type of people we humans can be in such an event some people try to save only themselves while others are genuinely helpful the movie also explores many other behavioral effects of humans     i think the characters were done quite well they were not completely likable but we still feel for them cruise however would always seem to nudge his way to the front of a crowd and then survive when they were attacked you would think the main character would be a bit smarter what i did like was that they didnt introduce the characters then spend twenty minutes with character development before finally getting to the action as many other movies like this might instead they begin the action early and work on most of the character development in between action sequences     the ending could have been much more conclusive though but overall it was extremely exciting throughout the whole movie and i was highly entertained
Dec 4 2009,neutral,man those kids are annoying
Dec 4 2009,negative,another suckie movie remade damn they had to kill this movie like this hey i love dakota its not her fault tom was kool too this movie made rated r would have kicked ass damn you directors but it really stunk
Dec 3 2009,negative,it was ok but not near as good as the original
Dec 3 2009,negative,it a watch it only onec movie
Dec 3 2009,negative,not interested in movie
Dec 3 2009,positive,hes mad he washes his anger down with diet rite he is an angry movie reviewerwar of the worlds this is the june 29th remake i watched it only 1 time but it was the greatest movie i ever saw since max payne i still can not believe that it was a real movie so this is the best i say rent it from your video store or better buy this moviesee you later
Dec 3 2009,neutral,this was not that good it had good graphics and a pretty neat concept it is worth seeing at least once i would say this movie made me realize that tom cruise is losing his acting ability plus the whole ending was kind of a smack in the face but leading up to it was decent
Dec 3 2009,negative,to long to complicated
Dec 2 2009,neutral,not like the first one for those of you younger than me watch the first one then decide
Dec 2 2009,positive,very good but if you not seen origianl its hard to work out the end
Dec 1 2009,positive,if breathing werent automatic im pretty sure i would have died watching this movie it was literally that engrossing and intense ive never seen a movie like it before or since i honestly wish i could forget having seen it just so i can watch it again for the first time
Dec 1 2009,positive,on my top 40 nice one
Dec 1 2009,neutral,it is a big production but a little bit too much
Dec 1 2009,neutral,i keep thinking of the giant ipod from scary movie lol
Dec 1 2009,negative,the graphics was good but film was soso
Dec 1 2009,positive,this movie is really good if you are in that type of mood
Dec 1 2009,positive,the many versions of a film based upon the superluxury book hg wellss work is a little boring to watch apart from the visual effects that spoil the eyes spielbergs version is less able to build a strong story a very strong message at the end of the movie spoken by less bite by spielberg but at least this film successful enough to make the audience was stunned at the cinema
Nov 30 2009,positive,a rare good tom cruise film
Nov 30 2009,positive,excellent but i preferred the radio version
Nov 30 2009,positive,i like this movie overall
Nov 29 2009,neutral,well this was definitely an antihero film but i think all the characters were unlikable is spielberg trying to relate to americans by showing a complete dislikable family fend for themselves without a care for another human i hope that no one actually related to the characters in this film i kept waiting for one of them to get a clue but they were static characters through and through
Nov 29 2009,negative,my rating should describe how i feel about this
Nov 29 2009,negative,not a fan of scientologists
Nov 28 2009,positive,it was pretty decent
Nov 28 2009,positive,i was a fan of the 1953 verson of war of the worlds and after i saw indepence day back in 1996 i wanted to see a remake of war of the worlds and then in 2004 i heard that tom cruse and steven spielberg were reteaming once again for a remake of war of the worlds i throught how cool is this going to be and this was one of the big movies i was looking forward seeing in 2005 besides star wars eposide 3 and what a movie this was when the aliens first showed they started attacking right a way not like what we saw in the old war of the worlds and indepence day when the aliens first showed up this movie was remade by the right people and going into this movie i knew how it would end a great movie to check out
Nov 28 2009,negative,horrifying remake  wasnt tom fired after this
Nov 28 2009,negative,bad movie super lame the effects sucked the acting was alright and the story was probably made up by a five year old who is scared aliens are gonna come out of his closet if you havent seen it take my word for itdont
Nov 27 2009,neutral,hmmm its a scifi i myself dun reali enjoy tis show
Nov 27 2009,positive,much better than i thought it would be
Nov 27 2009,positive,excelent and creepy loved it
Nov 26 2009,positive,maybe im biased to this since it has two of my favorite people working together tom cruise and steven spielberg are such a great match their styles complement each other perfectly tom cruise delivers on pulse pounding action and dramatic acting and steven spielberg gives us such a great improved storyline and visual atmosphere justin chatwin also blasts on to the screen as the most believable son of tom cruise their looks and mannerisms are scarily similar what i like about this disastertype movie is that it doesnt feel like one the isolation technique that was used makes the terror of an alien invasion all the more disturbing we know very little more than the characters and theres very little foreshadowing used the intensity practically builds from the moment the movie starts and has you captivated all the way through honestly i think we all know why this was not as popular as expected tom cruise was unfairly singled out as a complete madman because he doesnt follow a respected religion not only did that hurt this movies success but it has been one of the most insane celebrity judgments of all time war of the worlds should be seen for what it is an excellent movie
Nov 26 2009,neutral,thumbs up for the special effects  thumbs down because tom cruise is the star
Nov 26 2009,positive,saw it it was ok but i was hoping for more
Nov 26 2009,positive,funny in a sick way lmao
Nov 26 2009,positive,an intelligent film with a lot to offer  nobody makes better sci fi films than steven spielbergthis is one of the best sci fi comedies to come out in this centurythe film keeps you on the edge of your seat and in my opinion this is the best film about aliensthis is based off of hg wells classic novelclassic story made into a soon to be classic movienext to 2012this is the second best end of the world movie to come out and i was frankly really scared by this moviethe effects are outstanding and the acting is greatit was an interesting experience seeing the end of the worldyou will not notice the runtimetrust meyou will not be bored with this rollercoastercall it sci ficall it a disaster flickbut this film will go down in historywar of the worlds earns my highest reccomendation

Nov 25 2009,neutral,i think ive seen this ages ago s
Nov 25 2009,negative,shite could have been brilliant but gets worse as the film goes on
Nov 25 2009,positive,a very classic scifi moviethe action is very intense and lots of stuff blows up the camera becomes a character of its own making it look like your right by toms side this came out the same month as 3 other war of the world remakes but by far this is the best most likely because it had the largest budget
Nov 25 2009,positive,book is an all time favorite yet this movie dragged on too long orson wells meant it too be a short story prank and provide the power that media would have tge aliens were not the ones to fear its the humans

Nov 20 2009,positive,war of the worlds is just one of those films you watch and dont really appreciate but after several viewings you really get to grips with the thrill    tom cruise usually means a bad film to me but in this he wasnt half bad i can also not fault the direction as each scene helps the film progress to a climatic ending i would like to see the original as im sure id not fail to compare the two but as a stand alone film war of the worlds is interesting explosive and packed with action
Nov 20 2009,positive,again the original
Nov 20 2009,positive,this is happy and sad but always keeps u interested

Nov 4 2009,positive,would have been better without tom cruise
Nov 4 2009,negative,this could be termed as a disaster movieor rather a disaster tom cruise is certainly a disaster as the hero of this poor adaptation of the hgwells classic  the scifi story has been nudged to one side in favour of horror yesthere are a few good setpieces along the waybut overall this is a great disappointment  i have to say however that the extra items on the disk are interesting indeed a great deal more interesting than the film itself

Nov 1 2009,negative,if you want to watch a film of tom cruise running then this is for you otherwise this is pure poop
Oct 31 2009,positive,all the fx can set you reeling i guess this is also toms subtle way of pushing his scientology advocacy
Oct 31 2009,positive,i loved it but nothing compared to the bookstage performance or the original
Oct 30 2009,neutral,cmon what the good special effects though too many liberties have been taken with this classic scifi story

Oct 27 2009,positive,when you make a movie about aliens attacking earth you think of war of the worldsa movie based off a book by hg wellsnow im currently reading the book and i can say its a great bookbut im here to review the 2005 remake based off the movie made back in the 1970s or some time back thenoh well lets check out the posterall i can say is its epici dont why but its so cooli mean something about it is so cool                the plotaliens come to earth from mars and attackyou cant get any simplerand since this was made by steven speilberg you know its gotta be atleast halfway decentwell it surpassed halfway decentthe direction makes the attacking seem like it is happeningbut its ruined by one tiny problemthat little girl whines so much i wish the martians who zap hero into oblivioni also hated the fact she is a main characterwell thats all there is to complain there                        the actionvisually its stunning to see the how they mastered the art of alien attacksnow when i saw this i thought it would be another lame alien moviebut the action made me think twicethen when i saw the how the plot and action mixed so well i wanted to jump for joy i found the perfect alien moviethough its gonna be replaced with close encounters very soonmabey 4 days or sonow lets get back on trackthe action makes the mood of this movie even more unsettling and suspencefulthe clouds of smoke make it seem depressing and the destroyed city makes it seem like theres no hopehonestly the action is unsettling and visually stunning                    the final verdictoverall war of the worlds is a stunning masterpeice that is just amazing in every way possibleits got an exellent plot and fantastic cgiits got to be one of the best alienscifi movies i have ever seen in my entire life a 10 out of 10 for this movielord help us since the fourth kind is out thoughand no i will not see that movie

Oct 27 2009,neutral,ds is wat called action
Oct 27 2009,positive,strange but in a good way
Oct 27 2009,positive,i like the genre but could have been much better
Oct 27 2009,positive,much better than the cruisebashers will admit  a classic spielberg adventure
Oct 27 2009,neutral,im not sure if i really love the movie
Oct 27 2009,positive,special effects but anyone could have played the part tom cruise playedand dakota fanning did nothing but scream all the way through the movie
Oct 26 2009,negative,if you want to kill a little time
Oct 26 2009,positive,very scary love the ideas though and how they made the movie is fascinating worth a try if you havent seen it

Oct 26 2009,positive,i liked the original a little better
Oct 26 2009,negative,i would seriously pay aliens to take tom cruise away once and for all
Oct 26 2009,positive,pretty goodreminds me of the end times
Oct 26 2009,positive,ok nothing fancy for me but nice story
Oct 25 2009,positive,ive got it on dvd
Oct 25 2009,positive,surprisingly grim take no prisoners end of the world horrors  the end is lame as hell but the first 23s are lots of fun
Oct 25 2009,negative,a friday night movie
Oct 25 2009,positive,original better or was i just younger
Oct 25 2009,positive,i thouht as a remake of the original it was pretty cool as any other kind of movieit would not have cut it out of all of the remakes o the movie this one is one of te better ones it is also the only remake in wich the tripods have three legs and not more tri means three yet in all of the other films it had more than that i designed some of the original concepts for the tripods in this version believe it or not yay me
Oct 25 2009,negative,prefer original tom cruise sucks
Oct 25 2009,positive,worth seeing mostly for the spectacle if youve read the book or seen other versions then you know what to expect its good to see it stayed somewhat loyal to the book remakes these days go so far from the source material that they had to invent a new term the reimagining in other words a dishonest way of making bank war of the worlds has a mood and aesthetic appeal that i like everything seems to have a layer of dust over it like youre reading the story from the first print of the wells classic the dvd should come with a scratch and sniff that smells like an old book to complete the experience
Oct 25 2009,positive,it was really heavy on effects
Oct 25 2009,positive,long and drawn out to an insane degree war of the worlds is still a solid action movie
Oct 25 2009,positive,special effects direction and suspense were on point although at times it became really difficult to suspend disbelief
Oct 25 2009,neutral,i hate anything about aliens
Oct 25 2009,positive,i dont think its possible that the world would end like that
Oct 24 2009,negative,the continuous screams of the little girl make this one of the most unbearable movies in the history of ever just kill the girl and get it over with inferiror story and shitty acting makes this a 10 film
Oct 24 2009,positive,3 stars for dakota fannings scream very impressive
Oct 24 2009,positive,a great alien invasion movie very intense and realistic i loved it
Oct 24 2009,positive,now thats a really good film
Oct 24 2009,positive,a passable remake with some genuine suspense thrown in i felt that the film would have enhanced should jeff waynes music been allowed to be used subtlely of course
Oct 23 2009,negative,i think this story is difficult  to make movie
Oct 23 2009,positive,i never understood the hatred towards this film is it because of tom cruise okay even if this was released during the height of cruises douchebaggery  i still view this as a spielberg film first  and a film that he did a great job of remaking
Oct 23 2009,negative,eee i hate tom cruise
Oct 23 2009,neutral,wasnt worth the hype
Oct 23 2009,positive,great movie effects and story

Oct 22 2009,positive,i luv this kind of movie
Oct 22 2009,negative,spielberg was having an off day
Oct 22 2009,positive,wow way way way better than i expected  i was genuinely terrified and kinda loved all the special effects so many many amazing visual moments omg had braced myself for a saccharine family dynamic right from the start so was quite pleasantly surprised and even a bit unnerved by the animosity between the characters they really had to fight to earn that sense of family and that was great to see my only flaw  aside from cruise being overemotional at times  was the lack of detail about what exactly felled the aliens i wanted more detail damnit now im all curious about the original film and definitely the radio play and yay for the chitty chitty bang bang shout out
Oct 22 2009,positive,it scares me when i watch the part where d alien enters the house alone
Oct 22 2009,positive,a  treat for all those who are tom cruise fans
Oct 21 2009,negative,what the heck way that  a scientology lesson
Oct 21 2009,positive,though tom cruise is a total waste here and emotionally is a little bit distant war of the worlds offers what people hope to watch at theaters stunning special effects as never used before in this innovative alien movie
Oct 21 2009,positive,best part when the tripod comes outta the ground an goes honnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnk
Oct 21 2009,positive,i love war of the worlds butyeah

Oct 21 2009,negative,oh my god this movie was soooooooooooo bad
Oct 20 2009,negative,this movie was horrible
Oct 20 2009,positive,for some reason people love to level at this film the complaint that its anticlimactic wellduh thats pretty much the point the only problems with spielbergs war of the wolrds are a couple of lazy scene transitions towards the end but until that point its flawless filmmaking and a good case for taking tom cruise very seriously as a much better actor than hes given credit for being
Oct 20 2009,positive,its a good movie but it tends to be a little low on the sufficient side  its good but not good enough
Oct 20 2009,positive,there is no denying how amazingly crafted the scenes are but when attending a spielberg movie it is always expected dakota fanning never fails to amaze me
Oct 20 2009,negative,great effects but shallow storyline
Oct 20 2009,positive,what i really wish to see is to see what is happening at the bottom of the hill
Oct 19 2009,positive,that movie scared me

Oct 17 2009,positive,i think every one in the theater wanted to tell dakota fanning to stop screaming
Oct 17 2009,negative,all dakota fanning did the whole movie was scream
Oct 17 2009,negative,the war is fought inside us not outside
Oct 17 2009,positive,good but built up too much in media
Oct 17 2009,negative,oh cmon u can do better than this tom
Oct 17 2009,positive,steven spielberg directs this retelling of hg wells classic in which tom cruise leads an up and coming cast while also giving us an amazing performance along the way the special effects are magnificent the acting is brilliant and the story is flawless a classic movie
Oct 17 2009,positive,really had me at the edge of my seat
Oct 16 2009,positive,another movie with tom cruise running
Oct 16 2009,positive,a fair enough film  tom cruise plays the down to earth father fighting for his and his kids survival im not too sure about this one though  i mean i love the story and idea but some of the characters really get on my nerves  the kids for example bobby just doesnt care about anything and the little girl is constantly being a pain  its an alien invasion eat the damn bread and when he says stay close  he means it for a reason this film had a good cameo by tim robbins but his death was completely unnecessary he dug his way out of shawshank  let him dig out of the house the ending is rather sudden too  the tripods just die all of a sudden and everything is back to normal in the last 5 minutes i think this was one of those films that went nuts on the cgi but cared little about the story as long as they had a gist for what they were making an okay film but easily forgettable  it has morgan freeman too for some reason he says about 3 words then leavesi dont know what thats about seeing as morgan freeman is expensive
Oct 16 2009,positive,good effects though i not much of a fan of tom cruise yet again have liked some of his films

Oct 11 2009,positive,this is a big movie with big cgi used as a spielberg film we could ask for something more fun to watch   but cant match to spielberg territory   somewhere it goes up somewhere down it failed to stick you through whole continuously  work of janusz kaminski can be seen as of other spielberg film   overall ok for good summer flick

Oct 10 2009,positive,war of the worlds is one of the best remakes that has ever been made it was a great aventure fantasy film it was a fantastic edge of your seat thriller the only thing i did not like in this movie was that tom cruise was the lead role and in it i just hate him for some reason almost everyone hates him for some reason it is just the way he is and how he acts but there was a lot of other good actors like dakota fanning and tim robbins they probably made the film a lot better it was very adventourous and suspensful    7 stars

Oct 6 2009,negative,bleh just another pumped up tom cruise trainwreck it must be true that the scientologists own a good chunk of hollywood since this dude is still managing to star in films i frankly cant stand him as a person or an actor and generally dont watch things hes involved in the only reason i was interested in this was because ive read the book heard the radio play and the rock opera by jeff wayneit wasnt worth having to sit through almost 2 hours of tom cruise for p

Oct 5 2009,positive,this was an ok movie i was expecting a little more from spielberg but you do get your moneys worth it has good effects and the actors are giving believable performances fanning is the films high point she is a great actress that has incredible presence on screen i didnt really understand toms sons desire to always see the fighting and want to run into the foray without any weapons tim robbins played a crazy paranoid guy that added a moment of intensity to the picture that didnt come from the aliens i didnt buy the  fact that aliens planted these pods underground many years ago and then suddenly come back to pilot them why wait why not just get on with conquering earth now instead of doing what they did in this movie i dont know if thats true to the wells story or not but it didnt make any sense as a science fiction fan i did enjoy this picture and it has enough action good performances and special effects for the average movie goer to enjoy i would say see this picture

Sep 16 2009,positive,steven spielberg has become famous by presenting alien visitors as peaceful curious beings who are lost or simply want to explore in war of the worlds spielberg decides to go with the crowd and set the aliens up as the bad guys and in the process shows other directors how its really done    ray ferriertom cruise is a divorced dock worker who is not satisfied with life and is obviously not too distraught that he does not have a meaningful relationship with his son robbie and his daughter rachaeldakota fanning rays exwife is going out of town with her boyfriend and reluctantly decides to leave the kids with ray who always leaves auto parts on the dining room table and has nothing but condiments in his fridge after subtle yet interesting conversations between ray and his kids strange occurrences begin to appear such as electrical flashes from the sky and tremors from below the streets as is expected audience knows what is coming but not the characters do not but that is not the point spielberg is aware the audience knows the aliens are about to attack but it is how he directs the events that transpire that gives the film its life    in the beginning half of the film ray tells bad jokes to his kids forgets that one is allergic to peanut butter and in light of the recent alien attack wants to travel from new jersey to boston massachusetts  where his exwife was suppose to travel to so that ray can give the kids to her effectively lessening his burden a subtle element that spielberg does not allow to weigh down the film is how ray warms up to his kids ray may not know lullabys but he becomes so attached to his kids that he is willing to sing whatever he knows and even go to extreme and brutal lengths to ensure his kids survive the alien extermination in lesser hands it would be meaningless goo but spielberg directs it in a way that is likable and always intriguing with his signature style    the special effects are superb the lighting is highly contrasted in some scenes and overly saturated to make things look gritty yet surreal an effect similar to what spielberg used in minorty report and ai artificial intelligence it gives the metal of the alien tripod walkers a beautiful shine as the vaporize citizens right out of their clothes    spielberg always has the audience in mind and it shows scenes in which mobs surround ray and his kids are intense and subtle details such as burning trains and hiding in basements keeps the viewer engrossed into how each event will transpire next action scenes are very fun to watch and introduce something unique to every tense moment seeing ray try to keep his working car away from angry homeless citizens or watching him receive human dust particles to the face while running from alien onslaughts are some examples of particularly engaging moments    probably the films strongest feature is that it follows an ordinary man and gives no perspective into military or government affairs this makes the events that play out much more fun and easier to relate to if aliens suddenly attack its a good bet that you and i and about 95 of the population would not have a clue what was going on and would never know what was going on with the government the film follows this path and for that it is much more effective than the film independence day and other films that unrealistically try to show both human and government perspectives    some having pointed out plot holes in war of the worlds and some are bold to do so a common theory is that if the blackout killed all electrical devices why can the army still use their vehicles why can the news trucks cameras still work and why can a camcorder still work to address this the film wisely never explains exactly what blackens out electrical power the mechanics are able to fix a car by replacing its battery and solenoids so whatever emplike effect struck it was not permanent secondly the lightening that sends the aliens into earths ground and into the buried machines could have possibly caused the blackout meaning that not everything electrical could have been damaged only large portions of devices or devices near the lightening flashes some devices could have possibly been spared     spielberg knows what kind of film this is its a fun clever film that is well directed and exists purely for entertainment its not dumb fun its simply clever fun that never asks too much from the viewer and provides enough character progression and intelligence for those that do not want their iq lowered and enough fun so that no one viewer is ever bogged down by dull exposition or boring irrelevant sequences
Sep 16 2009,positive,original was way better

Sep 4 2009,positive,run twards the tri pod
Sep 4 2009,negative,how i wished i had not wasted my valuable time watching this rubbish from the asinine scenes of tripods literally destroying everything in their path except for the house that tom cruise was in when they sent a probe to see if anyone was in there before destroying it and then the airliner which crashed outside the house where again tom cruise was in destroying the whole neighbourhood the only house left intact was his when he emerged from the said house amongst of the carnage and chaos and guess what his van was also the only vehicle left intact and wow what a surprise he could actually find a route out as well and then we had the vomit inducing scene of his son saying dad if you loved me you would let me witness this battle and the sap lets him while ignoring his daughter who was really in danger  these are only some of the awful scenes in a major disaster of a film do yourself a favour go and buy or rent the 1953 version which was excellent or hire debbie does dallas or visit the dentist as it be definitely more pleasurable
Sep 4 2009,positive,absolutely terrific for me this is one of steveen spielbergs best films tom cruise gives one of the strongest performances of his career and dakota fanning is brilliant as his daughter spielberg delivers with some tremendously exciting and at times shocking set pieces with the mob attack on the car the standout and perfectly captures the films sense of paranoia and desperation of the people also the tripods are totally realistic and well realised this is one of my favourite films and if all summer blockbusters were as intelligentgripping and just as plain stunning as this i would be a very happy person
Sep 4 2009,positive,good movie for everyone

Aug 31 2009,positive,this is an exhilarating and new look on the end of the world yes we have seen alien invasion before but this one had some pretty interesting aspects about it i especially liked the fact that the reason they couldnt survive on our planet was because of the bacteria in our air or we but anyways tom cruise gave an amazing performance even though i dont like tom cruise very much he was perfect for this role and also bravo to dakota fanning she is so amazing to watch and she screams like a pro this is a fun and intense end of the world flick that goes just beyond the stereotypical labels
Aug 31 2009,negative,ifuckinghatetomcruise
Aug 31 2009,positive,steven spielberg is back after trying is luck with a couple of easy going movies but now hes back with real pop munching material and also ones more he has turned his way to space which havent been bad to his bank account this alien flick isnt as easy going as his other alien films and that is just a good thing    et and close encounters are fantastic but i feel the war of the world belongs with the likes of jurassic park and jaws its an alien film but a bit of a monster film also obviously spielberg knows what hes doing and is one of the best in the world at what he does and when you watch any of his movies youll see why the good thing about the war of worlds is that shes quick and really exiting all the way through seriously i havent been in a roller coaster like that in a while just brilliant and i have to give spielberg credit for having the movie pretty horror like at times it really came as surprise but a good surprise of course     the acting is superb and that is pretty amazing because in these kind of movies the casting and acting goes unnoticed most of the time my favorite scientologist tom cruise is brilliant in this masterpiece he really blew me away like always because not only did he do a great job in the scenes where he was screaming and running from a to b but also in those little scenes were he does brilliantly like in a couple of scenes with dakota fanning speaking of dakota fanning she never seizes to amaze me shes so young but still such a brilliant actress and i just dont remember her not doing a brilliant job and for a little girl barley a teen  thats amazing     the only problem i have with spielbergs work he always drags it out for me the movie could have ended 5 or 10 minutes earlier and sometimes he goes a bit far but that is nothing compared to his brilliance he is a god in hollywood the script was brilliant and david koepp and josh friedman really deserve credit    the war of the world is brilliant the acting is superb the visual is breathtaking at times and this is one of spielbergs and cruises best work
Aug 31 2009,positive,interested to see movie
Aug 31 2009,negative,the scifi is too glaring

Aug 30 2009,positive,i loved the special effects and some of the stuff that happens is really cool overall i thought it was a good movie but i hated the ending they should have made it more tragic and dramatic tom cruise pisses me off nowadays but he was alright in this movie dakota fanning gave the most annoying performance of her career but at least shes not a crappy actor i have mixed feelings about this movie its not for everyone its way better than the remake of the day the earth stood still though

Aug 29 2009,positive,as a kid i was scared of war of the worlds and this version by stephen spielberg does not disappoint like the recent district 9 it shows what would happen to people if this were to go on and it does it very well the action by all the cast is really good tim robbins tom cruise and dakota fanning the realism is painful to watch but very very engaging
Aug 29 2009,positive,the best movie ive ever watched
Aug 29 2009,positive,seven spielbergs spectacular contemporary retelling of hg wellss classic novel in this adaption a divorced dockworker living in new jersey named ray ferrier played superbly by tom crusie with his estranged two children rachel  robbie played wonderfully by dakota fanning and justin chatwin witnesses a freak lighting storm in his neighborhood this storm causes lighting to struck the ground near his house several times in the same spot when he goes out to investigate along with most of his neighbors he notices that the ground where the lighting hit is ice cold than suddenly the ground begins to tremble and buildings around the area start falling apart the ground opens up and a gigantic leg springs out of it almost crushing ferrier as the foot of it comes crashing down on a parked car then it stands completely out of the massive hole in the ground a towering 200 foot tall extraterrestrial war machine which is shaped like a tripod at once it begins its murderous attack on us it starts shooting a lethal heat ray which turns people to ashes on contact as well as destroying buildings and cars it seems that this killer tripod is part of the first wave of an allout invasion of earth by malevolent aliens ferrier must try to transport his children from new jersey to boston in an attempt to get to a safer zone away from the rampaging killer tripods that annihilate everything in their path flawless direction by seven spielberg with stunning cinematography by janusz kaminski a solid score by john williams and magnificent aweinspiring oscar nominated visual effects by industrial light and magic under the supervision of dennis muren an explosive scifi thriller that amazes highly recommended
Aug 29 2009,positive,read the book a few times w students  saw older versions  tom cruise did a good job with this

Aug 29 2009,positive,very interesting movie
Aug 29 2009,positive,laughed at the mashed human alien machine
Aug 28 2009,neutral,interesting for its portrayal of the selfish way people act in an emergency but otherwise fairly runofthemill
Aug 28 2009,positive,enjoyable and exciting war of the worlds proves once again that spielberg is the master armed with teriffic visual effects superb cinematography tense editing booming sound design and a pulsing score by john williams spielberg manages to get an excellent performance out of tom cruise and the rest of his cast the action is great and when the fast paced scenes slow down in favour of a suspenseful basement sequences featuring a manic tim robbins spielberg notches up the uneasy tension that pervaded the earlier scenes of this film highly recommended
Aug 28 2009,positive,gave me nightmares  something about something taking over my planet
Aug 28 2009,negative,tom cruise is so overrated
Aug 28 2009,positive,never saw it but saw parts of it in scary movie 4 or 3 i think

Aug 26 2009,negative,not as good as the original
Aug 26 2009,negative,spielberg is losing it this one is believable proof
Aug 26 2009,negative,apart from the scene in the basement the spielberg version of war of the worlds is not a great tribute to the original story by hg wells spielberg became a product of the crowd and whereas jaws was extremely important for the history of cinema this film just aims at delivering some special effects and establishing some emotional scenes in a very very cheap way
Aug 26 2009,negative,not much of a fan of it but it was ok
Aug 26 2009,positive,this is good just a shitty ending

Aug 24 2009,positive,great move cruise actually does a good job
Aug 24 2009,positive,best thing about this movie is the special effects other than that its all over the place a few good scenes but not enough of in any discernible order for them to make any difference
Aug 24 2009,negative,this movie sucke balls
Aug 24 2009,negative,read the book and hardly any of it is the same its all different apart from the aliens invading and then dying its not even set in england which is where hg wells set ithow crap is that
Aug 24 2009,positive,twisted movie but a great movie altogether
Aug 24 2009,positive,cruise does a decent job playing a father trying to hold his family together amid the possible end of humanity robbins plays a good crazy dude as well not my blood

Aug 23 2009,negative,alien movies annoy me
Aug 23 2009,positive,crazy special effects
Aug 23 2009,positive,watched ithave itloved it
Aug 23 2009,positive,one of the more underrate spielberg movies i believe that in time this movie will be well regarded unfortunatelyit is polarized by current feelings about perceived political undertones and a general dislike of tom cruise but many of the scenes and memorable moments of this film are ingeniously constructed and brilliantly executed     this is not to say it is a perfect flawless movie though it is frought with plot holes particularly when it comes to the aliens themselves and the execution of their plan and of course the ending is predictable thanks in large part because everyone over the age of twenty already knows the aliens will die because they failed to take into account our toxic microbes the ultimate failure of this movie is that it tries to stay true to hg wells     in many ways that particular criticism is beside the point though in the end this is not a movie about aliens it is a movie about panic and survival under the stress of extinction and perhaps their is no better director of such themes than spielberg
Aug 23 2009,negative,should be subtitled little girl that screams too much
Aug 23 2009,negative,forgettable the ending sucks too i know its just following the book but that still doesnt change that fact
Aug 23 2009,neutral,ok weird but tom cruise is weird lol

Aug 23 2009,negative,dumbest movie in the world
Aug 23 2009,positive,could have ruined the concept with technological overindulgence but did not im not always a fan of tom cruise but he was aptly cast in this
Aug 23 2009,positive,a too intense with the blood
Aug 23 2009,positive,not a bad action adventure film special effects were good but this could have so much better  the ending was weak feels as though it was an after thought
Aug 23 2009,positive,this movie is liek horro mixed with si fi mixed with thriller and action soo it all blends in to a action filled movie
Aug 22 2009,positive,such a movielike it
Aug 22 2009,neutral,seen it but it is sad
Aug 22 2009,positive,a nice story showing how aliens cannot invade our world a loved also how tom cruise showed his love for his family
Aug 22 2009,positive,i personly was looking foward to this and while it was visualy impressive i was left feeling wtf thats it
Aug 22 2009,positive,no one would have believed in the early years of the 21st century that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they observed and studied the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe confident of our empire over this world yet across the gulf of space intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us      a decent science fictiondisaster film that lacks the quality expected from steven spielberg    ray ferrier is a dock working living in new jersey he is estranged from his family is a lousy father his life isnt in order and is always concerned about himself more than others he comes home from a night shift to realize that he will be looking after his daughter and son since his exwife and new husband will be in boston for the next couple of days he lets his kids look after themselves and everything is going as usual for the unhappy ray until the most unexpected and inexplicable event occurs lightning is striking in the same spot more than twice in his backyard and in other corners of the world as well he heads downtown and to his amazement all electrical devices have been immobilized he joins a group of people who are examining a mark left in the ground by one of the lightning bolts and then all of a sudden the ground starts moving concrete and buildings are being pushed away as a gigantic tripod walker ascends from the ground and starts vaporizing every human being nearby ray runs back home gets his son and daughter and luckily finds a running vehicle to abandon their homestead and get as far away as they can from this lumbering nightmare ray begins to realize that these machines must have come from another planet and everywhere he travels he sees death and destruction humanity has realized they are no longer alone in the universe and they must fight for their survival in this war of the worlds    this film had all the ingredients to be a great cinematic marvel the screenplay was based on the classic novel of the same name by hg wells steven spielberg was signed on to direct tom cruise was the lead role and john williams was helming the score this adaptation did not live up to the hype as spielberg focuses too much on the family aspect john williams score isnt as memorable as it should be and dakota fannings character ruins the whole movie a budget of 132 million was allotted for this epic war and it took in 591745540 worldwide at the box office war of the worlds also received academy award nominations for achievements in sound sound editing and visual effects    this film may focus too much on the family aspect but tom cruise certainly doesnt disappoint as the at first lousy father ray ferrier the minute he and many others experience a close encounter of the killing kind his paternal instincts kick in and he takes his son robbie justin chatwin and daughter rachel dakota fanning away from the disaster and they head for boston massachusetts cruise pulls off every emotion excellently and i really bought into this guy finally getting his act together and expressing his love for his children through this epic run for their lives i never cared for the children in this story and i felt that they brought the film down a grade robbie for some reason wants to go and fight the aliens and he somehow manages to survive walking into a field of tripods that is throwing tanks hummers helicopters and everything else around like ragdolls the minute rachel starts to cry is the minute the film starts to suck she screams so often and so loud it must have rivaled every tripod horn within 50km the supporting actors play their roles fine but their characters suck and the writers are to blame    the special effects are pretty spot on in every scene the film features lots of great shots whether they be tripods death and destruction or a burning train sweeping by which really catches the viewers attention the look of the aliens themselves is well crafted but other than that these beings dont have much personality to them and you never connect with them since you dont know what is on their mind the tripods are also well crafted with a loud chilling horn and laser burning death rays these machines capture humans and suck their blood out in order to spew out a red weed that covers the land thus slowly turning the earth into a new red planet the hardware used by the military is top notch but you only get two scenes of the cavalry fighting the martians i enjoyed seeing explosions and guns firing at the tripods but i never got enough of it thus making war of the worlds 2005 a missed opportunity in that regard    this film could have been a lot smarter with the action and characters but it isnt a complete flop it is not a spielberg film for everyone and should only be enjoyed by scifi lovers    think about it they defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days walked right over us and these were only the first theyll keep coming this is not a war any more than theres a war between men and maggots this is an extermination  harlan ogilvy
Aug 22 2009,positive,kinda scary but i knew what to expect since it was a remake

Aug 16 2009,negative,let me write out the script for you    aliens attack earth troufgh obscure ligthining    lots and lots and lots of drama about nothing but we are supposed to care because main actor is insert celebrity actor here     i think tom cruise would work well for that    end of script  thats about it

Aug 16 2009,positive,very dark movie but truly a movie that can be recommended if one wants to see aliens taking over the world in this alienconquerstheworld movie it mainly dwells on the human side depicting how the humans fight for survival tom cruise and in particular dakota fanning both performed excellently as lead protagonists of the movie a movie worth watching
Aug 16 2009,positive,only sience fiction  i do like
Aug 16 2009,positive,i loved this movie it gave the big budget blockbuster a more serious  darker undertone than we are usually used to i guess thats why audiences felt alienated by itoh well i need this on bluray asap
Aug 16 2009,positive,very weird one part grossed me out but good from what i remember
Aug 15 2009,negative,dumb rehash of old script cruise over acts again aagrhh
Aug 15 2009,positive,only seven months transpired between the first day of filming and its release date  i mention that because war of the worlds has a lot of great ideas but the final product feels like it couldâve used a little more time in the oven  still spielberg knows how to make one hell of a popcorn movie and you canât really go wrong with tom cruise as your leading man  they did well writing his character melding all the cruise characters from the 80s and placing him in todayâs much more cynical world  sadly the film begins to run out of steam during its final act goes out with a whimper instead of a bang and shows that spielberg is still a sucker for happy endings  that aside itâs solid entertainment
Aug 15 2009,neutral,25 stars as not a tom cruise fan at all

Aug 13 2009,positive,i watched this with my dad which probably made this movie a little bit extra special it has that element of letting go of your son which struck a core in both of us while we were watching he would never have done it still spielberg never seizes to impress the special effects are amazing and the camera work is amazing he can truly make a great adventure

Aug 2 2009,positive,interesting did not like the way they ended
Aug 2 2009,positive,hats off to stephen spielberg the man can really direct the movie moves at the rates of a speeding car the movie is well paced and a trill ride of exhilaration    john williams writes another masterpiece of a score the music keeps you on the edge of your seat and is fun through out the score is loud and victorious in parts and low and subtle in others    this movie will leave you breathless you will be dead silent at times and at other times you will be cheering on the action the movie is action packed without being violent it is fun without being boring     this is a movie i strongly recommend to others over the age of 13 it is rated pg 13 for a reason and children under that age should be kept home come one and all to one of the most exciting movies of the summer                            grade b

Jul 31 2009,negative,better without cruise
Jul 31 2009,negative,one of my favorite books of all time not a tom cruise fan though i wonder if ray bradbury agrees with me
Jul 31 2009,negative,not a bad film per say but what is it with american film producers and film adaptations of classic british novels as a film its fine not good not bad but knowing what he based the film on i wounder if he had even read the blurb on the back of the book never mind a chapter  its based in england in the 194050  and why is it the only thing film directors in this kind of film can think to do is just give the aliens big glowing shields but once theyre gone the aliens are fucked its just so unimaginative and dull  so go buy it if you have a desperate need to see 2 hours of mostly darkness with occasional burst of very bright light and a crippling need to throw away money     even as an adaptation its still a very bad film and surely an adaptation should attain at least a semblance of what its based on  instead this has just done the most unoriginal hollywood thing of just making about some guy trying to find his exwife with two very annoying kids in toe which seems to be the plot line of every other hollywood film these days its getting old and as for the kids he has in toe the little girl is the most annoying movie kid of all time bar non whining and screeching at everything    i could however recommend that you just listen to jeff waynes musical version of war of the worlds and stare at the box art sure the pictures wont be moving but itll still be more interesting and youll get to listen to some good music as well
Jul 31 2009,positive,good film but i like the original story more

Jul 30 2009,positive,if you enjoyed the original telling of hgwells war of the worlds then you are going to enjoy this one tom cruise plays his part good and for dakota fanning she is a good actress for her age in this film 10 out of 10 for her performance

Jul 29 2009,positive,i dont know if it was a bad script or bad editing but this movie just devolves into nothingness at the end  where did the son go  how could the aliens not have vaccines  what the heck was tim robbins problem  so i guess spielberg has reached that stage of his career where he can just throw a couple of cool scenes together and not bother making a coherent plot  it felt like those times when id bought a cd because of one good song and the rest of the disc was just lame bside jams

Jul 28 2009,negative,badthats all i can say
Jul 28 2009,positive,love it its awsome the aliens invade the world its cool
Jul 28 2009,positive,the original was very well done a head of its time but it has an almost norman rockwell view of americawhich was probably not too far off considering that it was produced in the fifties this version is updated to reflect a more accurate portrait of todays america     the special effects are much closer to what hg wells wrote of in the original novel     the storyline works for me it ends on a much more sobering note than the original for the record the original rates 5 stars for me i give the updated version 4 stars
Jul 28 2009,positive,this is tom cruise dats all i will say
Jul 27 2009,positive,sure its not spielbergs best movie and cruise actually does a pretty good job with some smooth action scenes and good camerawork this movie passes fanning also gave a great performance the movie doesnt leave out much of the book but it does leave out some crucial elements but makes up for them in other places some people have said the movie is overrated well its made by steven spielberg so what were yo expecting and independent film the movie is actually pretty good and it does feature some of speilbergs best camera work the scene where they are the only ones that have a working car good flick but seemed kinda overplayed but the moral of the book is still there

Jul 24 2009,positive,the original was the best
Jul 24 2009,positive,could have been better
Jul 24 2009,negative,this war of the worlds remix is a big overrated movie containing some sensational special effects but lacking the excitement the original story so richly deserves skip this one and select one of the others
Jul 24 2009,positive,a lot of flash and spectacle without any emotional connection  spielberg pulls heavy on familiar turf ie the parentless child and the child in need of a parent figure but all in all an ambitious reimagining

Jul 22 2009,positive,oh god dont happen in reality
Jul 22 2009,positive,somehow the original was scarier
Jul 22 2009,positive,i saw this when it came out though i have read the book and have seen other makings of it the movie still kept me in suspense and i loved it i always enjoy tom cruise and dakota fannings acting they along with justin chatwin and the other actors made the characters believable i often watch reruns of this movie
Jul 22 2009,neutral,probably a solid three star film but like king kong doesnt just interest me too much there are some really great scenes at some parts and at times the foreboding atmosphere and slow pacing of the film blend together to create a truly chilling experience however overall the movie doesnt keep the suspense up and for me became a mediocre movie with some brilliantly eerie moments
Jul 22 2009,positive,very good films keep u at the edge of ur seat
Jul 22 2009,positive,great movie and storyline

Jul 20 2009,positive,the movie is the best
Jul 20 2009,neutral,this is 1 of those this might acctually happen movies
Jul 20 2009,negative,this filmwas crap to much had changed from the origonal and it focused on tom cruze to much the film on its own if called anything else would have been good but to ruin one of the great films since films si fi began was just bad  if it had been called invasion  staring tom cruise then yea good film but it wasnt and even though the effects were good infact very good a true film goer would watch both and come to the same conclusion  sorry tom but i think this was one of your worst films you have ever done i was disapointed that it just wasnt up to much  they missed the core of the story compleatly but wowed you with effects

Jul 19 2009,negative,was a disappointment why was tom cruse in this he was terrible
Jul 19 2009,positive,this is epically the best
Jul 19 2009,positive,war of the worlds  30  40 stars    in hg wells novel earth is at war with another species from another world  they invade by lightning storms spaceships already buried underground and with no mercy toward the human race  but how well did steven spielberg do on remaking this sciencefiction suspense thriller  by making it his own spielberg delivers superbly    tom cruise is divorced with two children who are brought to his house to be looked upon for the weekend  while living with their dad the three are invaded by superior beings whom have emerged from the ground  multiple number of tripods invade leaving the humans to run helpless and find safety  the entire duration of the movie is tom trying to keep his two children safe from the tripods and their adventure to get to boston to be reunited with their mother    the movie has some flaws that are obvious  for one dakota fanning was an excellent casted role for her part but let us face it we really cannot stand her most of the time  she did prove she can be the daughter who screams with a scared look on her face for the entire film  some other bad acting throughout was noticable but the bigger aspect was seeing how real these tripods looked  spielberg was a genius for throwing in a couple of themes from the classic horror soundtrack of the original war of the worlds making it seem more realistic and intense    at first it seemed this would be another poor scifi thriller but in the end it became to be a great movie to watch when you are feeling up to a horror flick at the end of the day  suspenseful sequences and horrific scenes make war of the worlds a classic fresh tomato
Jul 19 2009,neutral,meh  i hated the ending  one of spielbergs few misses
Jul 19 2009,positive,28  really good lots of rather eerie moments and impressive acting from cruise and robbins

Jul 17 2009,positive,great story and special effect
Jul 17 2009,positive,ive heard mixed reviews about this movie and i have to say if this isnt spielberg at his best then that alone solidifies his status as one of americas great filmmakers this movie impresses in many ways from the visuals to the chemistry between the father daughter pairing of tom cruise and dakota fanning both of whom deserve praise for their performances there were a few wtf moments in this film but all in all this movie does what it set out to do and it does it better than most of the other films in this genre these days

Jul 11 2009,positive,amazing scifi story with cool cgi and great actors
Jul 11 2009,negative,why hg wells is no doubt turning in his grave  on hearing they were filming wotw i was euphoric then i heard its set in the present day  no  in america  noooo  and tom cruise is the lead  any one of these factors would have been bad enough but all three together was too much to take  i went to see it anyway and my fears were confirmed it was pants not just pants but rancid smelly offensive pants that you have to pick up with tongs whilst wearing a biohazard suit
Jul 11 2009,positive,nothing too excited like the performance by the little girl  however was disappointed by tom cruise
Jul 11 2009,positive,once is enough  the beginning is the best

Jul 11 2009,positive,love spielberg the man great sci fi from the man
Jul 11 2009,positive,ok i admit i enjoy this movie even after second time watching so there you go i feel the thrills and chills of every events happening the cinematography might be one of the best for moving camera and action movie if not then its one of my favorites and it has no shakycam like michael abomination bay which i loathe a lot it also delivers a story with spielbergs trademarks family and ordinary people facing extraordinary situation even that the script is atrocious at some part and dakota fannings constant screaming is annoying but those are forgivable and finally bang you get the typical spielbergian ending which is kinda forced fuckin ridiculous and ruined the whole movie if only the ending wasnt like that i would give this movie 45 stars at the end its still a passable entertainment so 3 stars or six out of ten is enough and even generous
Jul 10 2009,negative,o tom cruise htan o atrwtosde pathaine tipota

Jul 10 2009,positive,love this movie best ever besides a couple ok really awesome
Jul 10 2009,negative,had much more of a good time watching scary movie 3 s mockery of the movie a giant ipod was definitely much more interesting that the giant alien pods walking around fell asleep numerous times trying to get into the same mode of fear but not seeming to be able to manage well i dont reccomend this movie to anyone but it was a hit so obviously its all about individual experiences
Jul 10 2009,positive,ergh a little disturbing but i enjoyed it

Jul 9 2009,positive,keeps you on the edge of your seat
Jul 9 2009,positive,crazy story but i like it
Jul 9 2009,positive,war of the worlds was first introduced to me as a radio drama by orson welles as an example of the magic bullet theory it caused panic to the listeners who really believed martians was invading earth later on it caused a public outrage when they found out it was a halloween trick pulled onto them the story was an adaptation of the great sci fic writer hg wellss classic      as i was watching war of the worlds as a film i cant help but think this is the sort of movie with the main character tom cruise looking like he is going to be the sole survivor as he escapes from the alien attacks unscathed   coupled with the everscreaming psychedelicclothed dakota fanning suffering from frequent panic attacks  this father goes through more than just a martian experience but also forms a bond with his estranged daughter as they try their best to survive the ordeal      anyway the conclusion is for a story that is translated into 3 forms of media book radio and film it goes to show how much the power of media is to create imagination
Jul 9 2009,neutral,alright but kinda borin
Jul 9 2009,positive,this show is freaking awesome
Jul 9 2009,negative,too lame i lyk scary movie 4

Jul 2 2009,negative,my aunt said this made her cry
Jul 2 2009,negative,the obvious  another bad tom cruise movie  the surprise  a bad spielberg movie    ok i prefer the 50s version to this one in all respects but especially and oddly in the special effects department      the movie left me with more questions than answers but the main one would be if the aliens came up with this plan one million years ago and they could not update it since then what happened during all that time did they get more stupid or were they just playing up to the competition humans the other question i ask is over one million years the land forms on earth have changed due to plate tetonics what happened to the buried craft that are now under mountains   plus tripods for vehicles really now that is stupid      in the end i really did not care for any of the characters and was hoping that tom cruise would get killed in the end which would of been fitting
Jul 2 2009,negative,someone explain this movie to me

Jun 27 2009,positive,frightened me for awhile
Jun 27 2009,positive,the original was better
Jun 27 2009,positive,seriously spielberg  this is it  even tom cruise looks bored  a fine example of how big hollywood effects dont necessarily mean a good movie  its got its high points though
Jun 27 2009,positive,a tense film that flirts with hopelessness some gaffs with respect to technology and the ending though classic is decidedly anticlimatic
Jun 27 2009,positive,it is funny when someone like hg wells gets credit for a movie like this that has nearly nothing to do with the original work the title doesnt mean as much as the movie standing alone and it does pretty good on its own there is a lot of eye candy but the characters were complex and interesting i like how tom cruises character is a complete failure and only acts out of cowardliness
Jun 27 2009,positive,this too could become a scifi classic and is well on its way towards that goal
Jun 27 2009,positive,i hate the little girl in this film you actually finding yourself hoping she gets lost
Jun 27 2009,positive,great action packed movie i enjoyed it very much

Jun 26 2009,positive,on again the original
Jun 26 2009,positive,impressive work old school aliens roam the earth and blast humans with their old school red lasers the design of the craft was tightly based on the novel big budget computer effects and foggish hue made it more realistic made to feed your eyes with realism cruise was just another typical father no heavy drama nor massive action was out but i like the basement scene gripping and breathtaking all at once the plot was also interesting entertainment from start to finish but the ending was dissatisfying
Jun 26 2009,negative,tom cruise not at his best lame movie
Jun 26 2009,neutral,you wanna know the end but its not that good
Jun 26 2009,positive,fucking brilient i loved this i wached it with my family
Jun 26 2009,positive,war of the worlds is surprisingly one of the most deeply disturbing and intensely frightening alien invasion films of all time painting a vivid tense and riveting two hours of absolute bleak horror that is gorgeously shot

Jun 14 2009,positive,very wonderfuldo you think next will out the war of the world 2
Jun 14 2009,positive,i have seen it so many times that now im bored of it lol
Jun 13 2009,neutral,high production values a bigname lead actor in the form of tom cruise and terrifying imagery are wasted on a halfbaked retelling of hg wells classic novel if not for the magnificent special effects and action setpieces this war is bland unaffecting and forced the ending keeps in line with the original but today seems wholly anticlimatic and very unsatisfactory spielberg probably does kind aliens like those of close encounters of the third kind and et the extraterrestial better than a fullon invasion
Jun 13 2009,positive,the war of the worlds remake is pretty good but not as good as i was hoping it would be one of director steven spielbergs strongest traits as a director has been his incredibly well developed characters especially the children in his films what happened here actually none of the characters were appealing its probably not a good thing when you root for the aliens to win over the earthlings i wanted them to suck up dakota fanning soo bad just to shut the brats screaming tom cruises character of a deadbeat dad was not exactly a character one would sympathize with and his performance is very one dimensional technically it is terrific the special effects are first rate very imaginative and well filmed truly amazing in that regard but as with so many modern remakes of classics its all razzle dazzle and so little substance the original is more than 50 years older than this version and it still remains the best version great special effects are very entertaining but you need more than that a film has to have a heart and soul and not just wallow in a superficial mix of technical achievements
Jun 13 2009,positive,stunning on how earth being invaded
Jun 13 2009,positive,i watch dat but i cant rememba

Jun 12 2009,positive,way better than the second one and more realistic
Jun 12 2009,positive,bi think this movie is really cool
Jun 12 2009,negative,this movie had a lot of potential i found what killed the movie for me was not the acting it was the incessant screaming of dakota fanning i really cannot say it was unrealistic because quite frankly if i had my neighbors being turned into a fine powder all around me i would probably scream like a little girl too    but her shrill high pitched screaming broke my ears and my careometer on this movie
Jun 12 2009,positive,i had really expected more
Jun 12 2009,positive,not as good as the original not as bad as it might have been

Jun 11 2009,neutral,oikay but could be way better another remake which is not as good as the original dakota fanning is good but only watch this one if you want to see a more up to date version of a scifi masterpiece
Jun 11 2009,negative,what a waste of effort better off checking out this     or even better this one  the effects may not be as good  but the execution of the basic concepts are much better  in fact the second one   is generally right in line with h g wells original story

Jun 11 2009,positive,nice scifi movie i like the et invasion
Jun 11 2009,negative,not exciting or action packed
Jun 11 2009,positive,horrible but realistic
Jun 11 2009,positive,i really enjoyed this film a lot more than i thought i would tom cruise hate him or love him does a fantastic job in this movie he basically won me over into liking this movie hes just an average guy trying to save his kids during the end of the whole freaking worldwhats not to like theres plenty of action and a great story my only gripe would be the hollywood ending in all reality im pretty sure it would have never happened but you never know

Jun 9 2009,negative,yeah good special effects
Jun 9 2009,negative,the worst of tom cruise
Jun 9 2009,positive,some movies simply must be experienced in a theatertype setting in order to be properly appreciated this summer blockbuster fits the bill due to the advanced sound design the wide disparity in the percentage of approving critics vs flixster users 73 vs 45 may be explained in part by the fact that reviewers evaluated the film as needed and i imply necessity because seeing wotw in anything less than surround sound is akin to watching a movie with compromised andor missing audio tracks
Jun 9 2009,positive,the ending destroyed the entire movie
Jun 9 2009,positive,loved the action and the story line
Jun 9 2009,negative,ohhh god    would somebody please bitchslap whoevers responsible fot this    spielberg astaounded audiences worldwide starting with me after delivering such a sloppy and absurdidly lame fucking movie     as with the minority report which wasnt bad ill admit the special effects take a front seat in the movie     the problem with this movie is that its the only thing that takes a front seat tim robbins cameo is deplorable the script is ridiculous the actions are imperfect the characters arent belivable if anything dakota does a fine job but beyond that fucking point i mean whats the nee to make tom boy the average joe savior of humanity huh    fucking movie

May 29 2009,neutral,gud film but abit gory
May 29 2009,neutral,an appealing cast some dazzling special effects some good action sequences great production designcinematography and some interesting ideas overall however the alien design for everything except the tripods are uninspired characters do pointlessly stupid things throughout or serve no real purpose and overall nothing really distinguishes the film from any other alien invasion movie the biggest issue though is the moment the movie decides to end instead of slowing the tension down gradually it decides to completely kill all the tension at one moment and throw in a deus ex machina device to wrap everything up overall its just ok
May 28 2009,positive,my 1 favorite movie made during the recent years visuel effects and sound design was very powerful and storyline was really amazing one of spielbergs best d

May 19 2009,positive,good science fiction movies
May 19 2009,positive,sometimes its a good thing to revisit movies that you hated the first time and that was the case for me with war of the worlds i cant remember why it disappointed me so much when i originally saw it in the theater but i was a bit leery to try again i still have one significant problem with the film and that is the fact that i dont really like any of the characters i find ray played by tom cruise to be a very poor father figure who really needs to get his life in order and his two kids are annoying what i managed to connect with this time however was the story that these characters were walking through the way that they encounter so much destruction death and the decline of humanity is captivating its riveting to watch how these characters are forced to do things they never imagined themselves doing in order to survive what really surprised me because i didnt remember it is how much agency tom cruise had on the events in the film my memory was that he just watched things happen and ran the whole time but there are several scenes when he makes aggressive choices in order to fight back and keep his family alive still there is an awful lot of luck involved in the whole film and that did bother me a little that he dodged hundreds of bullets the most impressive aspect of war of the worlds is the special effects i think they hold up remarkably well even a decade later and put to shame what many modern films deliver i have a new found appreciation for this film i still think its lesser spielberg but its certainly not among his worst films which i would have said before rewatching it
May 19 2009,positive,april 29th 2012  february 8th 2014

May 9 2009,positive,war of the worlds is just one of those films you watch and dont really appreciate but after several viewings you really get to grips with the thrill    tom cruise usually means a bad film to me but in this he wasnt half bad justin chatwin is one of my favourites in this and i just find it so easy to realate to his character i can also not fault the direction as each scene helps the film progress to a climatic ending i would like to see the original as im sure id not fail to compare the two but as a stand alone film war of the worlds is interesting explosive and packed with action

Mar 24 2009,positive,a decentenough attempt at remaking the fantastic story the idea of following a family rather than the government is interesting and provides some brilliant moments but the whole thing seems bloated and repetitive not to mention the fact that it is littered with numerous plotholes and some dodgy slightly dodgy acting it is tim robbins lunatic in the basement who gives the films best moments and provides the desire to watch again

Mar 23 2009,positive,pretty epic i wasnt sure to expect since ive seen the original war of the worlds movie  which is ridiculously hilarious im not a huge fan of tom cruise but this movie was very creepy and it keeps you watching thats for sure very happy that justin chatwin was in it because hes great i actually saw part of the set of this movie when i went to universal studios the plane crash set that was brilliant but that has nothing to do with anything not sure what else to say i guess if a creepy alien action movie with tom cruise doesnt appeal to you dont see war of the worlds

Mar 16 2009,positive,steven spielberg has crafted one of his most horrific nightmares with war of the worlds an unrelenting disaster pic that brings the genre to a bruised post911 world with imagery taken straight from historys darkest days the master storyteller goes against his crowdpleasing genes and delivers a harrowing tale of survival as only he could spielberg and americas favorite crazy man tom cruise follow up the inspired but bloated minority report with a surprisingly efficient picture thats as succinct in its running time as it is in its scares made under the gun with less than a year of production behind it theres an energy to the 128milliondollar film that hasnt been found in the famed directors work for quite some time he once again shows his magical skills directing young actors with dakota fanning whose traumatic performance sells every bit of the frightening action while relative newcomer justin chatwin impresses as the older brother filled with blind retribution most surprising is actually cruise himself whos cast against the typical heroic mold in favor of a conflicted selfcentered father forced to accept his responsibilities in the face of imminent death which even then is questionable considering his plan of action with superb effects and nerverattling sound design war is filled with its share of jawonthefloor awe moments but they simply wouldnt work as well if not presented through the narrowly focused perspective of cruises character the somewhat maligned third act with tim robbins is a perfect example of this with spielberg closing in the action to a single basement where the fear comes not from what you see but what you dont in another persons hands this could have been a soulless exercise  as it is now war of the worlds stands as a strong allegory for its time taking its place in a summer full of movies with more on their minds than simple popcorn entertainment

Mar 16 2009,negative,okteam up tom cruise steven spielberg and one of the greater science fiction writers best storylike the saying in crazy like a fox  what could possibly happen  as it turns out not too much  cruise running around like a maniac would not be too badif itd happened following the invasion  however it seems like thats the way the character normally acts  dakota fannings claimtofame seems to be her ability to remember one line of dialog  shriek  sir spielberg places this film in the modern day which might have worked  however in this case it didnt  in his reimagining of the invasion it turns out the aliens have been here all along spoilernaw  the socalled effects just seem too michael bayish with the only item that i enjoyed being the harvesting tripod  i will mention that the ending was greatit meant this tripe was finally over

Mar 9 2009,negative,possibly the worst film ever wel maybe not that far but its close the actors jst verbaly attack each other more than they physicly attack the  aliens which are not even ment to b seen  and  the little screaming girl played by that little 1year old dakota fanning could have bn played  by absolutly any girl under the age of ten  i can jst c  her reading her script  dad aaaaaaaaaaggggggggrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhh daddy aliens aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Mar 9 2009,positive,war of the worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest scifi film brought to the screen although when considering movies such as likethemed independence day its far from the dumbest but it is an intense visceral experience

Mar 3 2009,positive,special effects were awesome
Mar 2 2009,positive,in some ways this movie is a more faithful retelling of the novel than the 1953 version very disturbing though  both in the graphic portrayal of the aliens treatment of humans the literally blood soaked ground and the alien vines which grow using blood are sights that are really too much i think and the portrayal of the main characters calculating approach to violence i would go so far as to say too disturbing and part of the ending youll know which part i mean if youve seen it is so overthetop hokey that spielberg out to be chastised and its rather ironic given how dark the rest of the movie is the directing and special effects are alright though
Mar 2 2009,negative,was a good movie when it first came out  but this tried to be a vehicle for cruise didnt work

Mar 2 2009,positive,what was that all about very anticlimactic
Mar 2 2009,positive,great reimagining of a classic tale  though it still has the same abrupt ending to contend with
Mar 2 2009,positive,thrilling however dakota fannings screaming got very old quickly nice acting by tom cruise
Mar 2 2009,positive,a lame adaptation of a great orson wells 50s radio drama sensation that rocked the us and sent almost anyone in panic during that age  the 50s original film release is much more powerful proves that not all rereleases are better

Feb 26 2009,positive,not an amazing film it had the chance to be epic but failed great cast and great acting but i felt the story line was changed by spielberg in a way that it no longer fit it was enjoyable but not great
Feb 26 2009,negative,and now its time to make fun of tom cruise lets put aside the fact that the scientology poster boys acting skills are greatly surpassed by his 8 year old female costar  perhaps we can even forgive the plot holes that you could drive a bus through or rather a giant alien war ship that has never been found heck i may even belive that pigeon crap could be the death of us all but think long and hard friends if you were going to make an action film based on a clissic radio drama would you really cast the bumbling moronic pretty boy that is tom cruise if eveloution were true i regret that it led to this moment    ps tom cruise is probably the only dummer thing that evolution

Feb 22 2009,neutral,cheap horror film couldve done way better
Feb 22 2009,negative,not as good as the original
Feb 22 2009,positive,begins and escalates well though the thought of afterlife following an alien issued apocalypse is depressing the film does a great job of illustrating a believable and at times horrifying vision such however the resolution does adequately extend the evolution of the characters to the point that youll expect in other words it seemed to end to easily but its still a visual masterpiece in varying aspects
Feb 22 2009,negative,another very poor remake
Feb 22 2009,positive,would have been better with out tom cruse

Feb 22 2009,neutral,preferred the 1950s version
Feb 22 2009,neutral,great movie epic i think and wonderful
Feb 22 2009,negative,i should read the novel version before seeing it
Feb 22 2009,positive,it is far from what i expected but it is still good having tom cruise and dakota fanning here is a good idea since both of them are good performers justin chatwin is also good enough im not that into scifi films but this is a good one i was never bored watching it because there are scifi films that seems boring for me the best thing about this film is its special effects all of which are great another thing making this film great is having it seen from the point of view of a usual american family struggling for survival but amidst those it is not one of steven speilbergs best but there is no doubt that the critics would like it and there is also no doubt that the ordinary viewers wont like it that much i think its because it lacks emotional connection and its more of technical
Feb 22 2009,positive,amazing film my favourite
Feb 22 2009,negative,dreadful editing  seemed rushed towards the end

Feb 20 2009,neutral,well rounded and produced in plot and editing though still perhaps not as perfect as it could have been
Feb 20 2009,negative,bad overrated movie of 05 but dakota fanning did good here
Feb 20 2009,negative,waste of time and money
Feb 20 2009,positive,there are some intense moments in this invasion thriller with a strong lead performance by cruise but the minimalist storyline becomes more evident as the movie progresses leading to an abrupt and disappointing finale
Feb 20 2009,positive,great cinematography  was worth the ticket price but im not really in a hurry to add it to my blueray collection
Feb 20 2009,positive,hahahaha the best movie but the most best best movie is epic movie harhar

Feb 19 2009,positive,i didnt read all 240 woworlds reviews posted on rt but i sure didnt see any that dealt with spielbergs main theme which was    come on folks  its so obvious  maybe there was a conspiracy among the we get paid to write movie reviews people huh  hint what were the base colors spielberg used  remember saving private ryaneverything was a washed out army green  so what colors did he use in this movie     the key color until the aliens attack is blue  oh yeah cruise is a union dock worker who gets to ignore his boss and leave when his shift is over  oh yeah he lives in a blue state was his mustang blue i cant remember     when the aliens attack the color scheme changes to red  the invaders tear human beings apart to fertilize the landscape with blood  everything is red     the moral of the movie is delivered by rays daughter dakota fanning who says of the splinter in her finger eventually my body will reject it  thats what our planet did to the invaders  thats what the blue world did to the red  oh yeah this movie came to the screen the year after the 2004 general election her saying came true in 2008  wonder if that makes spielberg a prophet

Feb 17 2009,neutral,its ok as a boredom buster
Feb 17 2009,positive,wooohoo cruise does what he can do best runs awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy and fast
Feb 17 2009,positive,i wasnt crazy about this movie steven spielberg directing and tom cruise staring should have been much better it had good special effects but being a steven spielberg film it better things just didnt add up in the movie like how can all the major cities be devastated but when they get to boston they have power and nothing was destroyed

Feb 16 2009,positive,saw the originaldidnt quite like the remake
Feb 16 2009,positive,amazingi love watching this movie
Feb 16 2009,positive,strangely underwhelming its actually pretty intense but everything is very familiar and some of the realworld parallels are too forced the 911 dust i would say this premise has been so sufficiently done already that better approaches would have been to camp it up independence day or to set in the edwardian period like the book i also remember having some logic issues with the aliens popping out of the ground but i cant remember now
Feb 16 2009,positive,aliens invading earth where have i heard that before
Feb 16 2009,positive,not a fan of tom cruise at all and this pales in comparison to the original
Feb 16 2009,positive,i enjoyed this even though it was a remake

Feb 16 2009,positive,typically spielberg more fun every time you see it
Feb 16 2009,positive,i enjoy sci fi and it was a well done remake
Feb 16 2009,positive,what spielberg cruise and koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary theyve made a bigbudget summer blockbuster about massive destruction and action that manages to studiously avoid every clichã c and expectation of such films it stays resolutely on the characters points of view showing us almost nothing they dont see even to the point of coming tantalizingly close to a raging battle then avoiding showing it it keeps its focus on character instead of spectacle the hero of the piece remains decidedly unheroic wanting only to escape and trying to talk others out of fighting back the purpose of every piece of action is to frighten and disturb rather than thrill making ingenious use of familiar 911 imagery at the end of the second act it is handsdown the best alien invasion film ever made and perhaps one of the best scifilms of all time    then something strange happens the filmmakers lose their nerve and remember that this is an extremely expensive summer film financed by two studios or perhaps it was the fact that it stars tom cruise who up to this point has spent almost two hours doing nothing but run for his life suddenly and tragically the film changes violating not only its carefully established tone but its own internal logic suddenly cruise begins to act like a hero and summer action clichã cs force their way into the story like a worm into an apple the transition is jarring and it creates a serious disconnect from the story    while its true that wells original ending creates a problem for a movie here they try to remain faithful to it while still shoehorning moments of triumph into the conclusion unfortunately these moments come off as alternately false unbelievable and meaningless since it isnt mankind that defeats the invaders in the end    is it recommendable well i suppose that depends on what kind of viewer you are if you feel that 75 brilliant material overshadows the 25 that falls apart then youll enjoy it if however youre the kind of viewer who feels that the final impression a movie makes is its ultimate stamp on your memory you may be in for a crushing disappointment on the other hand if youre the kind of viewer who just likes the clichã c of the boomboom summer action spectacle youre likely to be bored and frustrated with the first two acts and only engage in the end it is confused about what audience its trying to reach and consequently isnt likely to satisfy any of them
Feb 16 2009,positive,the special effects were reason enough to see it but the story and acting was great
Feb 16 2009,positive,tom cruise is a graet guy
Feb 16 2009,positive,i think i have seen it not sure
Feb 16 2009,positive,interesting and great
Feb 16 2009,positive,just like  tom cruise and his gimmickslots of  input though
Feb 16 2009,neutral,ok nice idea with a good start cruise is surprisingly convincing as the spielbergian everyman  but the whole thing gets kinda boring after a while the ending was a tad conveniant
Feb 16 2009,positive,anything with tom cruise is 5 stars to me
Feb 16 2009,negative,junk horrible script supervisor glitches in the script right from the beginning mr spielberg please dont assume your audience is dumb emt knocks out everything so there would be no way possible that mr cruise could possibly have the only working carcmon and horrible acting bad remakevery disappointed

Jan 23 2009,neutral,not very special effect but i like it
Jan 23 2009,positive,good movie inspite of tom cruise
Jan 23 2009,positive,by using his oftexplored theme of a broken family mending itself during a crisis combining it with an intense and 911inspired survival situation filled with tough choices and instilling a true sense of dread into almost every scene spielberg seemed to go out of his way to make this his darkest popcorn movie to date wotw also proved that when he really wants to spielberg can put you on edge and he does so here via a relentless series of massive eyepopping action sequences i cant decide whether the tripods first appearance or the ferry attack is the best of these however the technical prowess of said sequences wouldnt have mattered if we never believed for one second that the family was in danger and spielberg aptly puts us in their shoes by never diverging from their point of view above all else the man has an intuitive sense of how to appeal to our need for excitement and our emotional core simultaneously and this film is a shining example of that ability the best alien invasion movie of all time    side note its quite an achievement to make one big budget movie in a year let alone two and i dont think enough emphasis is placed on the fact that spielberg has done this more than once in his career and when you consider the technical complexity of this film and its 2005 mate munich it becomes an even more impressive achievement

Jan 3 2009,negative,i had watched the 1953 version of war of the worlds a few months ago and i wanted to see how a modern adaptation fared    in the 2005 version the narrator is a divorced bluecollar dock worker who shepherds his  two children to his exwifes family in boston which presumably represents safety he is rather cocky and presents an iknowwhatimdoing front to the world which does not fool his exwife or his kids for a second on top of that the way he relates to his kids is one of imthefatheriknowwhatsbest which also does not impress them    this comes to a head during the invasion which takes on the form of one pod not far from his house and he sweeps his kids out of there in a stolen car all the while trying to shelter them from knowledge of what is happening which leads to growing tension among the family as the little girl starts freaking out because she can tell her father and everyone else is scared and she does not know why and the older son is getting pissed because he can tell that the father is not telling them something very important like there is this big thing that is killing everyone and is unstoppable behind us tell me what you know    it seems to have as an underlying premise that the ultimate goal is to shelter our kids from knowledge of danger and they will come out all right witness numerous scenes where they blindfold the little daughter and comfort is not achieved by helping her deal with what she is facing but by removal and having her forget the son realizes this and actively goes to help others on a ferry and looks for ways to help in the resistance to the invasion because he wants to get away from his overprotective father whom the son realizes is well beyond his level of competence the narrator here is constantly conflict avoidance refusing to explain actions include others in what he is thinking and helping others and while the movie shows the harm it causes it treats this as the way to be as he never learns    the movie misses a lot in not dealing with the relationship between father and son this could have been explored with the son pushing for more information on what is happening and having this coming to a head instead of dealing it by the son just leaving his father and sister also the old deacon on several occasions identifies that he and the narrator have a conflict but they never even try to work it out the narrator only brings it up at the worse possible times ie instead of talking it out in the quiet moments he only brings it up at times of mortal peril    so obviously i did not like the movie but it does potentially have the virtue of depicting one model of raising children in this case the parent knows everything and the child only needs to blindly follow blind to the realities of the world my wife and i should we have children have determined that during the period said children are with us they will not be hidden from the realities of life that they will experience the world in all its splendor and horrors while we and our friends around us are there to serve as guides and guardians so that their futures are faced in the knowledge of what is and what can be as they make their own choices for their futures

Jan 1 2009,positive,very realistic and powerful
Jan 1 2009,negative,crap not a big fan of these kind of movies
Jan 1 2009,positive,poorly recieved by critics and the general moviegoing public at the time war of the worlds was considered to be a dud outing from one regarded as the master  the one and only steven spielberg alas perhaps the perceived negative view was a little strong in my eyes  i recall a lot of praise from some critics here and there and i myself on my 13th birthday viewed it at the local cinema and was absolutely riveted from start to finish    i guess the notoriety and poor reception boiled down to two factors the main one was the lead role tom cruise  his reputation at the time was at the absolute lowest everyone was sick of his antics his scientology his bullshit acting like a moron on oprah and being insuferable wasnt a good way to promote what i can recall as the best performance of his career i can accept that he is annoying and perhaps idiotic on several levels but no one can deny his talent as an actor the second factor a much lesser one is that this was perhaps seen as a generic outing for spielberg a big cgidriven invasion film  yawn this film was subject to prejudice from day one    although unlike the premise suggests this film is not generic  sure spielberg relishes in special effects technology and this film contains some of the most spectacular effects ive ever seen but unlike what feels like the hollywood standard for alien invasion films roland emmerichs fun yet shallow independence day there are no sweeping battle sequences massive destructions of iconic cities rousing predisdent speeches or any of that the most we see of alien warfare is a tape shown by a straggling news team to tom cruises character which is only onscreen for a few seconds in another scene a massive battle is going on nearby but spielberg refuses to show it to us only focusing on the characters and their will to escape    war of the worlds did very well at the box office but has since faded into semiobscurity although it is not considered in general to be a classic or a masterpiece it is one i can see becoming a very well regarded cult film with a strong fanbase the film is brilliant  thrilling and horrifying from start to finish focused on the drama between its central trio lavish with commanding and emotional acting and rich with undertonal philosophy and symbolism its one of the best films that has been released this decade and is in the top elcheon of spielbergs acheivements    it is another adaptation of the hg wells novel  an iconic piece of literature and like the 1950s one did it moves the story to the present day and restructures the themes to be relevent in the 1950s film characters expressed fear that the war machines were russias secret weapon as it was the height of the cold war in this film characters query if the destruction is the work of terrorists    the film focuses only on a small familys adventure and fight to survive in the midst of martain war machines exterminating humanity  tom cruise is ray a divorced father of two justin chatwin as robbie dakota fanning as rachel who takes care of them for the weekend the opening scenes play out a family drama  expressing the tension between ray and his exwife the disillusionment his children have with him and rays sense of disorganization and apathy for leading an adult life hes a man at a dead end and is unsure of how to deal with it cruise never lets anything that resembles an ego or a look at me im tom cruise pathos into his acting  in fact he seems more human on screen than he has ever been in his real life    in a series of scenes that expertly and agonizingly build tension a freak lightning storm blows a massive crater in a street near where ray lives and is followed by a series of small earthquakes a massive war machine crawls out of the ground and starts vaporizing everything that moves  ray witnesses and barely escapes a massacre of onlookers panicked and traumatized he rushes to his house collects his children and thus begins a journey to boston to return them to their mother along the way ray and his children cross paths with and narrowly escape war machines on several occasions the devestation is clear  the crowds of people and how they act make this feel real  at times rays worst enemies are his fellow humans    some scenes are haunting  hiking through rural america a crowd of people are halted at a train crossing to see the train completely ablaze blur past in another dakota fannings character witnesses hundreds of charred corpses drifting down a river the whole movie feels like a dream sequence  it flows from scene to scene moment to moment like one and the situations and things that happen make it a nightmare in a way its more utterly terrifying and horrific than any ubergory slasher film the images stay in mind    spielberg is in top form as a film maker  the second act of the film stands in mind as the most memorable  ray ends up hiding in a farmhouse basement and an incredible set to note with a ogilvy crazy old man played by tim robbins a man who commands respect for all his acheivements as an actor ogilvy and ray do not see eye to eye but are distracted when the martains begin searching the basement the basement search scene is a classic  suspense edge of your seat you name it  as ray and ogilvy avoid the probe which searches the basement the intensity and genius of each shot and moment is overwhelming  i was on the edge of my seat the whole time it draws comparison to the raptor kitchen scene from jurassic park which is perhaps the pinnacle of spielbergs career when it comes to sheer thrills    this is a classic movie  underrated in all aspects and one of spielbergs best its the best alien invasion film ever made of one of the best of this decade highly reccomended unless you have heart problems
Jan 1 2009,negative,not a very good watchnuthing to match spielbergs standardstom cruise looks his worst here

Dec 30 2008,negative,made the 1953 original look even better   at least that version had suspense and gave the feeling of a world in peril   too much tom cruise and his family  not enough war  not even one decent battle   the claim was that this was close to the tone of the book  but the book has a lot more action  and more a feel of humanity on the ropes

Dec 19 2008,positive,the film screams spielberg it transitions seamlessly from giant action to little moments unfortunately going into the movie i knew how it ended having seen the 1957 version years ago on tv but as such i was glad to see very very nice touches in the creature design    if you plan to see this movie be warned it is much more about the family unit than it is about the invasion were not even given a reason for it except that the invaders were jealous of us somehow or how the world reacted to it but thats not to say that theres no action the first half of the film plus is pretty much nonstop edgeofyourseat awesomeness whats that you want death rays you got em giant lumbering robots check earthquakes explosions massive body count check check er well not check on the last one and youll understand if you see the movie suffice to say that the invading force has a few different ways of disposing of bodies    if youve seen commercials or trailers youve probably gathered that ray tom cruise is trying to get himself and his two kids away from this and thats where the film stays its very straightforward and linear with nothing to steer the plot offtrack the characters are sidelined for a little bit while hiding out with a crazy man played by tim robbins incidently considering my general distaste for mr robbins there was one scene involving him that occured behind closed doors that i would have liked to see but oh well    i enjoyed the interaction between father and son especially since the son was a sox fan because they both acted toward each other as i do toward everyone else as a jerk it was as if i stepped into some weird universe and there were two clones of mine barking back and forth at each other and i admit i felt a little outperformed    but while the son was interesting the daughter dakota fanning had little more to do during the first half than scream and wow does she have a set of lungs sometimes i wished that cruise had turned around to the backseat and smacked her and said shut up you are not helping but then she probably wouldve screamed more so oh well at one point during the film the son robbie tells ray that his only motivation in going to boston is to dump them the kids off on their mom so he can worry about himself i gotta tell ya i wouldnt blame him    earlier i said that this film screams spielberg well it does in one more way that kinda irks me there are plenty of people dying everywhere but in true rifletowalkietalkie fashion anything that might show the act of bleeding is conveniently hidden from view if youre going to allude to a grotesque happening you might as well show it some if not most will disagree with me on this one in the vein of the film not being a gore genre film eh whatever blood does not a gore film make although though he didnt come right out and reveal it the dust thats all over cruise toward the beginning of the film is a nice touch    overall its a fun flick is it a great film nah theres nothing new nothing innovative and nothing to make you think except maybe how to plan against an alien invasion if you plan to see it understand that it really is just a summer popcorn flick with that in mind you probably wont be disappointed
Dec 19 2008,positive,this movie was really a lot better then people let on it gave me nightmares

Dec 14 2008,positive,like most remakes it shouldnt be considered greater than the original but thanks to director steven spielberg he introduced me to one of my favorite science fiction disaster films of the 2000s this movie just like the older one is based on the novel by hg wells  which is a great book the special effects were amazing throughout the film and did a good job at making you feel like you were part of the destruction tom cruise even though not one of my favorite actors did a good job with his roles with the childrens role being probably the most annoying the ending feels a little rushed but other than than a great remake with a director who still hasnt seemed to lost his touch of being a great scifi director lets hope it stays that way

Dec 10 2008,positive,very good movie i could watch that a couple time in one day
Dec 10 2008,negative,okay first of all ive never really liked tom cruise except in very few selected films in this film is no such exception his character is unlikable his acting barely average and i just cant relate to him his struggle with his children is more annoying than it is sympathetic and the rest of the actors arent that great either mostly this is because their motives remain hopelessly unclear i have no idea why they do whatever they do the only somewhat decent character was cruises daughter rachel ferrier dakota fanning though even she was more annoying than entertaining but at least her character felt genuine and setting the war of the worlds into modern times just doesnt work guys the whole movie is so full of plot holes and inconsistencies that it isnt even funny anymore especially the ending solution feels stupid but the visuals are nice the aliens are decently done and while the action is somewhat lackluster at least there is some and yeah this film isnt worth your time believe me if youre a diehard spielberg or cruise fan well go ahead if you must but the rest of you no
Dec 10 2008,positive,the ending sucked i thought the son should have died

Dec 9 2008,positive,one wants to compare it with a the george pal version where it exceeds expectation since the protagonist is closer to the everyman in b the original novel weak almost deus ex machina ending but thats the problem of the novel of course effective fable seen from the pov of the invaded overwhelmed by the shocking and aweful weaponry of the invader

Dec 6 2008,positive,i loved this movie i thought it was really scary
Dec 6 2008,positive,now here is a excellent movie by speilberg the plot is just based off the book and the older films with different twists but what really wins the movie over is the grim tone and the superp effects tom cruise for a actor who i fined annoying is well acted dakota fanning or however you spell it i very annoying but i think its how shes supposed to act but a character that is rare in trailers is robbie he is pretty annoying he really is now the good points the tone makes the movie feel like cloverfield or i am legend and a bit spooky and sad the effects are just great especially the machines they have scenes that make you shiver and they make these loud noises that make you go wow now you may not like the film but id like to say see it at least once
