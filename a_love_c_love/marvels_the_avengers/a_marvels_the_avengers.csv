"Apr 3, 2024",positive,It's a great start to the series. Plot is pretty good and implementation is great (like in most Marvels). Overall VERY solid.
"Mar 25, 2024",positive,"It is one of the best movies that Marvel has ever made and the film has it all; the jokes, action and beautiful visual effects for its time."
"Mar 20, 2024",positive,I mean what else would you expect from Marvel. The prior solo films of some of the main characters led us to this point that will kickstart a journey unlike anything in cinema since Star Wars.
"Mar 17, 2024",positive,"Una película emocionante, que supo manejar a los personajes y adaptarlos muy bien, me encantó como desarrollaban y acababan con el conflicto, definitivamente marvel estaba en sus mejores momentos."
"Mar 16, 2024",positive,Such a good movie with a classic adventures feel. i have seen this like 1000 times.
"Mar 13, 2024",positive,im el iron man tatattatttatattatattatatattatattatatyattatataytatytat
"Mar 7, 2024",positive,The fun cast and simple exciting story makes up for a poor production
"Mar 5, 2024",positive,Love it! The way they brought it all together in this movie and staged opportunities on where to go from here - enjoying MCU much more than I thought I would’ve.
"Mar 2, 2024",positive,UM DOS MELHORES FILME DA MINHA VIDA SE NÃO O MELHOR
"Mar 1, 2024",positive,"Wow...what a movie. One of the best from Marvel. Everything works in the Avengers, there is hardcore action, funny scenes, cool lines, and a lot of bang for the buck."
"Feb 28, 2024",positive,I love the dialogue and characterization to the entire plotline and storyline to this movie
"Feb 22, 2024",positive,"A great, fun film that showcases the acting talents of all shown."
"Feb 19, 2024",positive,"Muito bom! Recomendo muito este filme.
Espero muito ver os Heróis mais poderosos da Terra novamente nas telonas."
"Feb 17, 2024",positive,"Groundbreaking for its time. Audiences now days may take team ups and crossovers for granted, but ill never forget the first time i saw Captain America face off against Loki, a villain from another franchise. Nor will I forget seeing characters stand united on screen together without any legal rights interfering. AND there's also the story which is also paced and balanced perfectly. Tom Hiddleston works his evil magic on our hearts."
"Feb 16, 2024",positive,"Outstanding storyline, great action, great actors.  What a great comic book team-up should look like."
"Feb 13, 2024",positive,"The culmination of ""Phase One"" arrives to much applause! A cinematic first to show that a collection of a shared universe of movies is possible, to which, many other studios would attempt to formulate themselves with their respective IPs. 

Marvel proved that it's possible to combine many different heroes together. Ensemble movies where you have to share screen time with many protagonists can be tough within itself, giving each their own character arc, all within a 2 1/2 hour timeframe, yet, they made it work. Granted, having most characters already have at least one movie beforehand to set the groundwork up for their character helps.

This movie is a fun movie all around!"
"Feb 8, 2024",positive,"It didn't age well today in my opinion, too goofy and i have a different view on its director after Justice league"
"Feb 1, 2024",negative,The fact this has higher ratings than The Dark Knight Rises tells you that millennials that like this movie are betas and don't know anything about film
"Jan 28, 2024",positive,A fantastic Superhero movie... You'd absolute like it if you want fun and intense Superhero action! It has everything!
"Jan 10, 2024",positive,"A little cartoony, but great for its time"
"Jan 5, 2024",positive,AVANGERS VS LOKI YO WHAT?!?!?! LOWKEY LOKI FR 90-92%
"Dec 30, 2023",positive,All of Marvel’s Phase One built up to this and at the time many felt it could not be done. Several characters from their separate movies come together to form the World’s Mightiest Heroes in this landmark movie.
"Dec 28, 2023",positive,"The Avengers have been assembled and, for the most part, they fit together superbly. A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick."
"Dec 26, 2023",positive,"One of my favorite movies of all time. That's pure nostalgia, but thinking back, this movie absolutely changed everything for the MCU, the superhero genre, and ensemble films. It showed that this connected universe thing is possible. I still love re-watching this movie, I can quote it all day."
"Dec 24, 2023",positive,"I especially loved the score of this film, I did it for marching band so ++ for nostalgia"
"Dec 9, 2023",positive,"A well-made blockbuster with amazing characters, a focused storyline and great action sequences. The only issue with this movie is that it drags a little."
"Dec 5, 2023",positive,"At a time when the idea of superheroes teaming up was still an idea that many people thought would never happen in live action, this was a true event of a film. It was a lot of fun and the characters played off of each other very well. More lighthearted than some of the future Avengers movies, which both works for and against it."
"Dec 4, 2023",positive,Peak superhero film that changed history.
"Nov 29, 2023",negative,"Like all marvel films
Boring"
"Nov 27, 2023",positive,"A story fun and engaging for anyone, and full of iconic lines and scenes. Truly a gamechanger."
"Nov 26, 2023",positive,"Perfection, and nostalgic."
"Nov 25, 2023",positive,Acción increíble personajes épicos y loki es un genial villano los efectos son buenísimo y me encanta la historia y el guión un genial crossover es un 9.1 de 10
"Nov 16, 2023",positive,"The avengers is filled with great character arcs, amazing action sequences and a great film bringing the heroes together."
"Nov 14, 2023",positive,"An unprecedented coming-together of America's heroes, in a near seamless fashion that was everything the audience could hope for and more. A score to be remembered for generations, and characters that will shape the future of movies for years to come. Avengers cements its place as the cornerstone of the MCU. 9/10."
"Nov 14, 2023",positive,Avengers assemble. Great team up movie. Plot was great. Loki was great. What more needs to be said
"Nov 12, 2023",positive,One of the best movies of all time.
"Nov 12, 2023",positive,"Pretty good movie, entertaining."
"Nov 11, 2023",positive,"This is a great film! Every character gets their chance to shine and they all use their screen time well. RDJ, Tom Hiddleston and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances but the rest of the cast is still solid. The plot is great with plenty of action and comedy to keep you entertained. It's exciting seeing all the main heroes meet up for the first time. I also love how frightening/intimidating they made the Hulk out to be (I miss this version of him). Overall, this is a solid entry and definitely one of the MCU's best!"
"Nov 11, 2023",positive,Even after all this time I still remember the energy watching this in theaters. A little goofy but a nice way to show how much potential the mcu has. Everyone had stand out performances.
"Nov 10, 2023",positive,"The cast is star studded, the action is second to none, just one of Marvels greatest projects."
"Nov 10, 2023",positive,As a kid who grew up on comic; this movie is is fantastic!
"Nov 7, 2023",positive,The beginning and it was at the time the best effing thing
"Oct 30, 2023",positive,This movie was a great start of a cinematic era
"Oct 28, 2023",positive,One of the best collabs ever
"Oct 12, 2023",positive,"After a significant build-up consisting of several movies introducing various iconic characters, Marvel finally delivered The Avengers, their big superhero crossover and the most ambitious comic-book movie adaptation at that time.

Directed by Joss Whedon, with an all-star cast portraying the likes of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), plus a long hinted-at plot that gets to the point right away, the film quickly broke a billion dollars at the box-office and it remains one of the most popular movies of all time. Marvel's bold, expensive move paid off, to say the least, and comic-book movies are still just as big as they were back in 2012, some would say more so.

Seeing all these characters together in the same film was certainly a main draw for audiences but without such a talented and dedicated cast, it's arguably unlikely that the film would have spawned as many sequels and spin-offs as it did and led to the continuation of Marvel's (and Disney's) comic-book movie domination. The story sees Loki (Tom Hiddleston) use the Tesseract to open a space portal thereby allowing all sorts of villainous creatures into the world as Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his team of Avengers to stop him.

Keeping the plot simple was certainly a good move as anything more convoluted than that could have gotten pretty messy. On the other hand, having the film just be about a one-dimensional villain we've already seen in another movie use a macguffin for some vague megalomaniac endgame he doesn't even seem all that devoted to, makes The Avengers feel a little slight depth-wise. Loki himself isn't quite as interesting as he was in Thor but Tom Hiddleston keeps him charming and fun throughout. Most of the enemies the Avengers face, however, are faceless no-name aliens and are only there to be disposed of. 

One third of the film is dedicated to introducing characters old and new like Bruce Banner/The Hulk, played by a perfectly cast Mark Ruffalo, the middle part follows Loki's escape and the Avengers having to deal with that, while the finale is just one big New York City-set battle. The film is long but it's paced well with key action beats and, whenever the heroes are interacting with each other, even if they're just standing around discussing exposition, it's a joy.

The Avengers isn't a perfect film. As I mentioned earlier, it isn't exactly a challenging watch, which is both good and not-so-good but altogether understandable. It has quite a few ropey moments, especially near the beginning when Loki shows up to brainwash Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), or whenever some alien thing we don't know is talking next to a glowing staircase somewhere on a space rock, or when a joke doesn't quite hit the mark. And it's a shame that Loki never gets a final fight against all the Avengers or at least his brother Thor.

Instead, he just basically gives up about halfway through. This is a slick-looking movie with some impressive CG effects (Hulk looks great, mostly) and it's never dull but the cast really is the glue that holds the whole thing together: Robert Downey Jr.'s wit, Chris Evans' earnest heroism, Scarlett Johansson's super-spy antics, all of that comes together beautifully and it effortlessly fleshes out characters you wouldn't necessarily expect to care this much about, let alone at all.

There's no denying what a huge achievement The Avengers was. The fact that Marvel planned out such a ridiculous project so meticulously and it somehow all led to a genuinely solid, entertaining blockbuster is worth celebrating. The film itself is slightly uneven but it's so full of charm and boasts enough cleverly put-together set-pieces that, for any comic-book fan especially, this is simply a treat.

Excelsior!"
"Oct 10, 2023",positive,Yeah i like this movie a lot
"Oct 7, 2023",positive,"For all the MCU newbies out there, this is a MUST to watch. This movie introduces all of the OG Avengers, and you aren't a Marvel fan if you didn't love this movie. The villain is well thought out, the characters are spectacular, and the action scenes are so well performed! Well done to the director and the entire cast and crew behind this movie!"
"Oct 3, 2023",positive,"I remembered this being better, but it's good... (not so much), it deserves a 7/10 "
"Sep 24, 2023",positive,"When this movie i watched i was super excited because i didn't have watched something like that before. All the characters in the same movie where I have watched them separately in the movies. Overall story, Action, VFX was superb. This was the beginning of new era."
"Sep 22, 2023",positive,"Impresionante, me encantó"
"Sep 22, 2023",positive,"It's very exciting movie, the special effects are fantastic."
"Sep 22, 2023",positive,"ten out of ten!!!
Marvel, the favorite of many ☺️"
"Sep 21, 2023",positive,It's only an amusing movie !
"Sep 21, 2023",positive,Siempre increíbles las películas de los Avengers y esta película también lo es
"Sep 17, 2023",positive,This movie is a master piece
"Sep 17, 2023",positive,"This is what kickstart the MCU and how he became great this was the first ever superhero crossover that we’ve seen any piece of very very well this film took C list characters in turned them into household names throughout the MCU. Loki as a villain was so entertaining into me probably the best performance in this movie Iron Man, Captain America Thor, black widow hulk, and Hawkeye were all interesting, and had a character arc of reuniting as a team and they did that really good. The only problem that I have with this movie is just a joke. It was too many jokes, but they balance out the jokes with the seriousness, and made sure he didn’t feel like a parity of itself. This was a really good movie, and where the MCU became a cultural phenomenon 9/10"
"Sep 10, 2023",positive,This was a good first Avengers movie I loved the acting and all of the action in this movie overall it was a good time
"Sep 8, 2023",positive,Avengers is a blockbuster Movie that's really entertaining and super fun.
"Sep 4, 2023",positive,AWESOME!!NO FLAWS SOOOO GOOD
"Sep 3, 2023",positive,one of the best mcu movie of all time
"Sep 2, 2023",positive,"La primera vez que la Vi fue mi película favorita, pero... Hoy en día se me hace aburrida. Aún así no quita el echo de que sea una buena película para su época (2012)"
"Aug 30, 2023",positive,"As someone who isn't a fan of The Avengers, I wasn't expecting this movie to this good!, thanks to a script that is emphasized on a characters weaker aspects, The Avengers came across as sympathetic & likable not to mention this movie's way too engaging and entertaining, definitely a great movie for hardcore Avenger fans & a fantastic movie for casual fans."
"Aug 29, 2023",positive,"Joss Whedon, although his recent controversy, does an amazing job at uniting these heroes together into a realistic flawed team that must work together for the fate of the world."
"Aug 18, 2023",positive,"Strong plot, Great characters, plenty of action that is done right, and overall one of the best MCU movies."
"Aug 18, 2023",positive,The Avengers is pure cinematic superhero bliss. Each character has a chance to shine on their own while adding to a triumphant film experience.
"Aug 16, 2023",positive,"O FILME EM SI É BOM , MAS NAO SE ARRISCA , O FILME SE EXPLICA , ENREDO BOM , BATALHAS BEM FEITAS E BEM ESCRITAS , OTIMAS ATUAÇOES , EM RESUMO MAIS UM DOS OTIMOS FILMES DA MARVEL...."
"Aug 7, 2023",positive,Marvel's The Avengers is a strong installment in the MCU movie franchise worth watching!
"Aug 7, 2023",positive,The 5 stars says it all
"Aug 7, 2023",positive,"Peak superhero media, the absolute best of the Marvel movies. The Avengers is consistently entertaining and thrilling from start to finish. It is brimming with quippy, clever dialogue, and an undeniable charm. Every bit that is hokey adds to the flavor of this film, from the cheesy costumes and forced jokes, to the tryhard nature of some of the action, which has ridiculously memorable choreography and moments in every sequence, I might add. This is an absolute treat of a blockbuster. It seems there will never be another movie quite like this one, and that's a shame."
"Aug 5, 2023",positive,Fantastic Movie. Loved the cross over. A great way to end the 1st phase of the MCU.
"Aug 4, 2023",positive,I was blown when all of them came together after gradually building them up throughout the years of phase 1. This movie is a total classic when they face a world ending threat together. Still definitely one of the best movies in the MCU! Loki being the villain and the post credits scene of thanos making his debut into the MCU were astonishing!
"Aug 3, 2023",positive,"Doesn't age as well as you hope, but still a classic."
"Jul 28, 2023",positive,Es el crossover mas legendario de la historia de la historia loki mi villano favorito de marvel y bueno esta genial es un 9.2 de 10
"Jul 27, 2023",positive,"The original Avengers movie is a classic. It was such a cool movie at the time and still holds up pretty well to this day. The action, the characters, the thrills, they are just great."
"Jul 23, 2023",positive,"The Avengers assembles Earth's mightiest heroes into an exhilarating and action-packed spectacle, showcasing Joss Whedon's skilful direction and delivering a superhero team-up like never before."
"Jul 21, 2023",positive,it was a pretty good origin story for all of them getting together
"Jul 14, 2023",positive,"History in the making, an instant classic."
"Jul 12, 2023",positive,This movie is the perfect team-up film. I wish I could go back to Summer 2012 and experience this in theaters again for the first time.
"Jul 11, 2023",positive,Facilmente um dos melhores filmes do UCM e atrás de homem de ferro é o melhor filme da fase um.
"Jul 11, 2023",positive,It was really fun to see all the characters interacting for the first time. Everyone gets a chance to shine at various times throughout. A great way to wrap up Marvel's Phase 1.
"Jul 11, 2023",positive,"I'm a marvel person, and this started it all"
"Jul 9, 2023",positive,"Serviceable direction, great acting, and it's cool to see our characters come together. However, most of the best material for this movie is in the deleted scenes."
"Jul 4, 2023",positive,"Simply awe inspiring 
They said it could never be done but marvel bought together what many believed could not work as a movie 
And they knocked it out of the park 
Not only dose every character get a chance to shine but the writing is so strong that when they all come together you get a feeling of such natural chemistry that at times you forget your watching a comic book movie 
To see how far these kinds of movies have come is nothing short of a modern day film miracle as for the first time in a long time audience are given more then was promised to them and then some 
But you have to wonder at this point how much more Dan a cast grow in number without this fine Original quality becoming lost 
How many more times can the avengers unite before the genre starts to show ring rust"
"Jul 3, 2023",positive,"Oh, the good old avengers, how I miss them)"
"Jul 3, 2023",positive,Love the Avengers and all star cast!
"Jul 2, 2023",positive,"As a ""putting the band together"" movie it does its job, but honestly, I know action is a big feature of superhero films, but this has two enormously extended action scenes, one at half way and one at the end, and I think they're both far too long. The middle one is at least interesting enough, but the final extended fight scene is just what feels like 45 minutes of CGI bashing and explosions. It didn't need to be that long, and they could have instead put more character and plot development into the film."
"Jun 30, 2023",negative,"Overrated flick, the action keeps disappointing, the characters are strange, nonsensical plots, lame music. Just empty."
"Jun 28, 2023",positive,The movie is an cinematic masterpiece that not only serves as a sequel to every other marvel frachise in existence but also finds ways to combine each character of different genres into one cohesive narrative.
"Jun 28, 2023",positive,An Awesome team up of the ages
"Jun 26, 2023",positive,Esse filme mudou a historia do gênero de heróis no cinema.
"Jun 25, 2023",positive,A great movie that helped improve the MCU and start its amazing storyline.
"Jun 20, 2023",positive,"This was a good start, I remember watching this on theatres(turns out I watched all Avengers movies in theatres). Amazing camera movement, action packed scenes, perfect introductions. Even non-Marvel fans would love this movie. Loki is a great villain too btw..."
"Jun 19, 2023",positive,The avengers was the very first marvel movie where the avengers assembled for the first time. And it was awesome.
"Jun 16, 2023",positive,"The movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting. It's a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the Infinity Saga, but it was a bit jarring how they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly at the end."
"Jun 14, 2023",positive,"Muy buena película, me encanto"
"Jun 11, 2023",positive,"The first Avengers is something special, and I will always love it, it's the first MCU movie I ever saw in Theaters, and the entire movie is awesome!"
"Jun 8, 2023",positive,Greatest team up movie ever. The origin story of separate characters nicely merged and excellently directed. Final Battle was massive.
"Jun 8, 2023",positive,it was a good movie starring good actors
"Jun 4, 2023",positive,It is a decent team up film. Out all the Avengers film though this is my least favorite. It was awesome to see how the team worked together for the first time facing off against Thor's adopted brother Loki who sets out to attempt to conquer Earth for Thanos.
"Jun 4, 2023",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is surely Phase One's best movie and one of MCU's overall. With a good plot, great characters and performances and stunning action sequences with great CGI."
"Jun 2, 2023",positive,A cult-classic superhero movie of all-time .
"May 28, 2023",positive,"While this film may not seem as special now, it managed to bring together a group of characters from separate stories and unite them into one, which had never been done before."
"May 24, 2023",positive,its crazy how this movie did things that we only could have dreamed for (bringing all heroes for a team up movie)
"May 21, 2023",negative,Great ensemble but im expecting for more.
"May 21, 2023",positive,It all leads to this. What can you say but well done.
"May 19, 2023",positive,Awsome movie my favorite one
"May 19, 2023",positive,esta pelicula fue unas de las mas buenas de marvel bueno tras que hay superheroes de nuestra infancia cuando leemos los comics de marvel aaay que recuerdos calificacion b+
"May 18, 2023",negative,this is a bad boring movie
"May 16, 2023",positive,"The Avengers was meticulously crafted and well thought out. There was careful consideration taken in every element, every plotline and every piece of dialogue, which is can be positive but also negative. Because it was such a monumental cinematic moment, it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks. That being said, the film itself is fantastic. Seeing Earth's mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps, there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically. However, compared to later films in the MCU, The Avengers just seems a little too safe."
"May 13, 2023",positive,The cross-over superhero epic which first showed how huge stories can Marvel call into being and proved that the studio will be an elemental part of Hollywood from then on.
"May 12, 2023",positive,Brings back good memories.
"May 10, 2023",positive,"One of the best mcu movies of all time, the avengers are the best in this, this has the 2nd best villain, an incredible film."
"May 9, 2023",positive,Absolute Classic. Nothing else to say.
"May 9, 2023",positive,"The Avengers is one of THE BEST action movies I've ever watched, and I HAVE to tell everybody who will listen that. Now that I've seen it, it's hard to express how excited I am. I deliberately steer clear of building myself up for movies because I find that when I do, nothing really seems to be able to live up to my expectations. I typically steer clear of hype trains whenever I can. Having said that, I was quite excited to watch this movie and was entirely on board with the buzz. It was unavoidable. I could have been severely disappointed if this movie had been bad. I'm overjoyed to say that the exact opposite has occurred."
"May 8, 2023",positive,It is such a classic 👌
"May 6, 2023",positive,It's a great team up film. I've enjoyed the film from first to last. The character of Loki is even more Darker. The film battle was Iconic. Joss Whedon's team up movie was incredible.
"May 6, 2023",positive,"Dated now, but when released it was truly an experience to see all your comic book heroes together for the first time."
"May 5, 2023",positive,"This movie blew me away when I first saw it back in 2012. Never in my right mind would I imagine that this many( at the time)comic book characters would work so well together on the big screen. Well, we have come a long way since then. Even though it keeps slipping down my ranking of best MCU movies it still is an enjoyable movie."
"May 5, 2023",positive,"Too much science not enough action, but still love RDJ, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo playing these iconic hero's and making them the characters I know and love"
"May 5, 2023",positive,This movie has some cool scenes but is actually kinda boring.
"May 3, 2023",positive,Amazing film with awesome action and plot
"May 1, 2023",positive,"One of the best MCU films to this date!
Tons of action, suspense 
The first time I saw the hulk was very scary"
"Apr 30, 2023",positive,Avengers Assembled and this movie kicks arse!
"Apr 12, 2023",positive,"This movie has great pacing, great chemistry between its leads and has the perfect level of corniness for an MCU movie. Loki in this movie makes a great villain and the dynamics between all the heroes is so well thought out. Also there are some really creative combo attacks from the main characters. The flaws for me are that the first few minutes are kinda lacking and some of the jokes are really cringe, still a good movie"
"Apr 10, 2023",positive,"The 1st Avengers movie is a thrilling
and action-packed adventure that brings together some of the most iconic superheroes from the Marvel universe. The film's seamless blend of humor, drama, and high-stakes action makes for a truly entertaining experience. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, with each character bringing their unique personality and skills to the table. The special effects are top-notch, bringing the epic battles to life in stunning detail. The only downside is that some of the character development feels a bit rushed, but overall, The Avengers is a must-see for any Marvel fan or lover of superhero movies"
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,"While not perfect, the OG Avengers film provides viewers with a simple yet effective story, while combining our favourite Marvel heroes in epic fashion.

Rating: 89%"
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,The first team-up flick pulls it off well. The characters have mostly been fleshed out before this and the ones that haven't are supporting characters anyhow. Each character gets their own moments that feel earned.
"Apr 6, 2023",positive,"Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song??"
"Apr 2, 2023",positive,A great story with some epic superheroes gives us the earths mightest Hereos
"Apr 2, 2023",positive,Great movie. Action and fun with just enough heart all the way through. Well done.
"Mar 29, 2023",positive,"I love this movie one of the greatest superhero team movies ever made in my opinion. Action, I love that action so I'm gonna have to give it a 10/10 aka perfect. Acting is perfect RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johansson, Jeremy Renner, & Mark Ruffalo all perfected there characters and they all made it so perfect at bringing there characters together. CGI, I think that the CGI is amazing. Villain, I think that Tom Hiddleston has done a great job with portraying Loki but Loki is more of a bad guy than a villain. Writing, the writing is perfect. Story/Plot is amazing aka perfect. Casting is a solid 10/10 no one can tell me something different. Characters were all great I love them all. Adventure is great. Ending, I love the ending and I can not express how much I love this ending."
"Mar 27, 2023",positive,"Can I give this movie more stars please. Awesome movie, great story, action, and comic relief."
"Mar 27, 2023",positive,"Avengers is one of the strongest, epic, extravagant MCU film out there. Strong performance, the excellent pace was well done, entertaining, action-packed, and one of the best Marvel films. Definitely my top 10 best MCU films."
"Mar 26, 2023",positive,"The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.

At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth..."
"Mar 22, 2023",positive,"quien no ama esta película ?, La que reunió todos nuestros héroes por primera vez ,llena de acción,visualmente magnifica y momentos grandiosos todo es genial en esta película su trama interesante y personajes perfectamente calcados."

"Mar 10, 2023",positive,"La gran reunión de los héroes que dieron inicio al MCU. Iron Man, Hulk, Capitán América, Thor y Loki unidos en un solo film. Esta película cuenta con una muy buena premisa que da comienzo a la saga del universo Marvel. Con un gran elenco que interpreta perfectamente a sus personajes, dan vida a estos increíbles personajes que por mucho tiempo han vivido en los comics o en los dibujos animados. Muy buenas y prometedoras escenas de acción y efectos especiales que se llevan toda la atención. Definitivamente una de las mejores películas de Marvel. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10."
"Feb 28, 2023",positive,A great movie to bring together the heroes in phase 1.
"Feb 24, 2023",positive,Perhaps the greatest superhero movie of all time. Each character gets their due screen time without having to compete for it. This movie set the standard for every Marvel film that came after it with enthralling heroes and one of the few truly bewitching antagonists.
"Feb 22, 2023",positive,"A comic book blast. Fun banter, great acting, great action, great stakes, great villain, great fun. Nuff Said."
"Feb 21, 2023",positive,The best movie! Watching it is an exciting adventure!
"Feb 21, 2023",positive,"""The Avengers"" is a 2012 adventure/action film directed by Joss Whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).

One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast. Each actor brings their own unique take on their character, and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging. The film's action scenes are also impressive, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces.

The plot is well-crafted and engaging, with a good balance between action, character development, and humor. The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.

The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.

The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.

However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.

Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen. With strong performances, impressive action scenes, and a well-crafted plot, it is a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the franchise."
"Feb 20, 2023",positive,This movie is soooooo fun
"Feb 18, 2023",positive,"Super-powered buddies in tights beat up a jokster and some aliens.

At the time of its release, it was probably the biggest movie out there. It was a culmination of years of hard work and movies building up to this precise moment. Everyone was talking about it. 

Looking back now, it's a bit corny (I'm talking about Captain America's suit).

It has a nice balance of humor and action. The Hulk is the best part. It's a solid film."
"Feb 17, 2023",positive,"An excellent end to phase one. This movie made Iron Man 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk worth watching."
"Feb 17, 2023",positive,Best movie of the franchise.
"Feb 17, 2023",positive,"for a first film together, Avengers is to be congratulated!  Actors chosen in their proper characters and their chemistry are notorious in the unfolding of the plot.  This is just the beginning of a phase that I missed and ended in a spectacular way."
"Feb 15, 2023",positive,The Avengers is a amazing way to set up this team of heroes!
"Feb 14, 2023",positive,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is currently ranked as my forever favorite over the accumulated weight tying together 21 different movies into an interconnected franchise's 22nd chapter. This is certainly the fourth occasion that reflect past events during a required assembly when a threat too great overwhelms singular ability – while being more as a responsive effect to its penultimate preceding first parter being the cause snapping up world-changing proportions. ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" two-parter is an inspired continuation after the previous team-ups consisting of the core members mostly given their own films and established arcs with their dynamics greatly tested and challenged, positioned to evolve their placements. Of course, none of this wouldn't be possible without the solo heroic outings, or to an extent of pairings and exclusively involved team-up, building up towards the ultimate play while connecting others along the way for familiar dynamics at least from another. But the first time it happened was the independent studio's first goal as a visionary promise that became cinematically groundbreaking as well truly define what the Marvel Cinematic Universe is capable of through the interconnected strengths. It was right then that ""The Avengers"" became my favorite movie for opening pathways that led all the way to ""Endgame"" and solidifying its shared universe concept's success – despite being stretched thin elsewhere.

While superhero teams aren't anything new as the ensemble already been witnessed theatrically, mainly under Marvel and other secondary or lesser-known comics for exploitive gimmicks, what makes this special is the hype stemmed through the shared universe concept Marvel adapted onto the screen. It broke their descending reception in reaction to subpar qualities till they were financially capable of independent filmmaking. This started when producer and president Kevin Fiege announced their goal in 2006 to bring the core team-up to life. Considering the main entertainment value for ""Iron Man"" providing general welcoming without prerequisite reading of the vast comic lore, the ultimate crossover film mainly relies on the audience who stuck around across the connected films, but the name itself is the comics' peaks of characterization being respected and taken onto different arcs outside of their comforting knowledge. ""The Avengers"" is the pinnacle of both Marvel and the cinema by storytelling combination at a perfect balance.

There's a quote that defines the team's ‘s reason to come together and assemble: ""And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat."" On that day, Thor's evil brother Loki obtains the energy cube called the Tesseract, tapping into its unlimited power in opening a portal to unleash his given army to enslave humanity. Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., must re-activate his recruiting initiative of bringing together a group of remarkable people that could fight the battle no one else could. Teaming up are non-team player Iron Man, an awakened soldier Captain America, a pursuing god Thor, a monstrously temperamental recluse Hulk, secretive assassin Black Widow and marksman Hawkeye, whose mind got controlled under Loki's spell. Different backgrounds varying in humanity, strengths and weaknesses as well as beliefs, they all must work together with trust in order to defeat a common threat.

The former four starred in their own films, while the latter two were introduced as supporting players – it would be nine years later till they received their own starring projects, but each of them evolved as part of the overall balance of finally tying them all together than just the simple assembly. Continuing from their established arcs, they each carry the weight that push them on these heroic paths that they may began to truly accept as their responsive professions while working with different individuals they wouldn't normally work alongside unless the dire situation pressures otherwise. Before his true colors were exposed in another certain project whereas he practically made himself comfortable by recycling what he inserted inferiorly, Joss Whedon showcased his skills at a peak with quite a capability of advancing pop culture from experience. Directed and written it, which positions him as full-on storyteller with confident direction that matches the brand's vision as he flawlessly fulfills it through impeccably scripted buildups of seamless dialogue referencing fresh hefts from polished arcs as slight transcendence. He achieved a proudful reception over his treatment and meeting expectations that either hinted towards planned projects or ambiguously reveals unseen details. He watched the other films carefully and perfectly mix them all into one to fuel excellent exchanges excitingly ranging timeless humor and captivating tensions.

Aside from the characterization being the elementally prominent focus, this film outlines the list of essentials that Whedon seems to must've demonstrated under an assorted definition. Obviously proven successful with the set pieces amazing as supportive backdrops to the events, the action sequences justifies and thrills awesomely specially when notes been taken from previous chapters (i.e. Hulk chasing Black Widow in the Helicarrier like the horror setting in his film taken place in the factory of continuous obscurity), all backed up by Alan Silvestri's riveting music that switches some notes from his previous venture under retrospective focus and introduced one of the most iconic themes that eventually recurs (upliftingly to the ears). The visual effects help color the film's own stance next to its preceding narrative carriages while remains constant without trimming any edges. In addition, prompted cinematography looks for unique ways to signify these dynamics as they move onto each other with nuanced contribution, and also compliments with the written direction helped by well-timed editing. In summary, an event like this provides standardization underlining hard-to-beat and the notion of synergistically saving the best for last, or later in this case.

Adding on to both storytelling and technical efforts is the ensemble cast's performing just brilliantly with most at their second rounds as their characters with opportune gravitas for further exploration, and certain few embodies their characters effortlessly at their third and fourth rounds. Joining the mixture are Cobie Smulders as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill and Mark Ruffalo taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner. Like the rest of the cast without questioning the casting choices, even going as far to include the recasts, perfection gets determined by the performances, and so it did when Smulders nicely adapted Hill in live action after the character shined in animation – which is actually where a number of these characters gotten introduced priorly. Norton signed up as Hulk for Marvel's potential horrific corner only for that to be occasionally glimpsed, luckily felt and appreciatively grasped still but not enough for his satisfaction. When Ruffalo took over, the character's captured mannerism slightly changed just to flex Ruffalo's own charismatic talent in, managing to make the character his own with equally defined energy."
"Feb 9, 2023",positive,"It was a fun, exciting thrill ride, I highly enjoyed this movie, and I got to see all of my characters come together at once, which gave us the excitement of seeing that iconic six person shot on screen. I feel like this movie gave everything it needed to give at this point in time and allowed us the opportunity to see these characters develop and partner up. This is definitely one for the books that you could watch multiple times."
"Feb 6, 2023",positive,"My writing is about the Avengers movie, the first movie of the 21st century that was not cartoonish.
It is a movie that entertains people who usually like superheroes



Loky the brother of evil thor is the leader of the chitauris and his objective is to steal the desert that the fury doctor has and dominate the world.
He will not get it because the fury doctor summons all the avengers to protect the world and win the battle.



In my opinion, these movies are always very entertaining, especially those who love superheroes."
"Feb 6, 2023",positive,"Excellent movie all the way around. Exceptional writing, acting, production value. This easily could have been a mess, there's a fine line between too much at once...& something awesome. They walked that line perfectly with this one. Strongly recommend."
"Jan 31, 2023",positive,"This is fun, timing is appropriate, and I didn't feel that long. I don't know if they are really cooperating, but I liked seeing variety of fighting style from them. Succeeded to control too many characters, and enjoyable as it it. The amount of gag and parody is acceptable."

"Dec 31, 2022",positive,"From start to finish, it was engaging, beautiful soundtracks and each sequence flows really well. One of the best marvel movies"
"Dec 30, 2022",negative,It was a piece of s*it
"Dec 22, 2022",positive,MCU shines in ensemble casts and this is the first big one. Hulk is the star. Michael Bay dreams of making big dumb action movies this good.
"Dec 12, 2022",positive,An achievement for sure in Superhero film history. It brought a bunch of larger than life personalities and had them come together and it delivered perfectly.👊
"Dec 12, 2022",positive,Awesome way to bring our heroes together. Great action and great story
"Dec 7, 2022",positive,"One of the best films of the Marvel cinematic universe, before Disney started ruining the movies. Solid film, that the family can enjoy with great action and story. Great custom designs and cinematography."
"Dec 4, 2022",positive,"An All time Classic. The idea of taking multiple heroes from other films and putting them together in this way had been attempted going back to the Universal Monsters of the 30's but they couldn't really figure out how to make it work cohesively. What started 9 decades ago was mastered with this film. The actors all have incredible chemistry, witty dialogue and excellent performances across the board. The cinematography is very good with very well done special effects. Even the end battle which is very heavy with CGI is very clean and well done even though you can tell most of it is computers. The battles between the Avengers themselves are amazing to watch and super intense. The only real downside to this film is the musical score is good but it's not really memorable or catchy like Superman 78' or The Dark Knights, but it's such a small point. The editing and pacing are both fantastic in this. The only serious downside is this is a film that requires you to watch 5 other films before this to understand how good it is. But it is absolutely worth it and even without watching the others you still can tell how good it is. Everyone should give this a try. This is a Landmark Film for being the first to nail how to do multiple characters from different franchises into one awesome unique experience."
"Nov 22, 2022",positive,"This film was a great way to unite Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The film feels like it has a different tone from the other films in the MCU, and that is part of what makes it feel like its own special thing. Joss Whedon did a spectacular job in making this film (unlike flops like Justice League), and it is a great way to close out Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Nov 19, 2022",positive,First avengers movie is very entertaining.
"Nov 18, 2022",positive,"Great comic book movie, fun for everyone.  Highly recommend"
"Nov 16, 2022",positive,classic but also aged weirdly not great even though it's not even old.
"Nov 15, 2022",positive,"Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song??"
"Nov 13, 2022",positive,"It was set up as a big team up of Earth's mightiest heroes and it worked well to build to that. All the characters have their own place in the film and don't feel wasted. It is never a dull moment with the action scenes being a constant in the film while still finding the time to advance the plot without either being compromised. There are cheesy moments in the film that are only set for the fanfare, and it does well to serve the audience along with the awesomely supportive score. The only issue regarding the film is that most of the characters don't have much change in their story. It focuses on the overall story of the MCU than having any real change in any one character's story for the most part. This is not a big stain on the film though because the character relationships are worked on instead. There was a lot that this film had to do, and I believe it paid off."
"Nov 13, 2022",positive,The Avengers is a dream come true for all Marvel Comics fans. RDJ teaming up with Evans and Ruffalo is one of the best team-ups in all of cinema. Feige makes magic happen and paves the way for the future phases of the MCU.
"Nov 11, 2022",positive,Love Loki! Favourite marvel villain ever! Iron man and Thor good too!
"Nov 11, 2022",positive,Existe coisa melhor do que isso?

"Nov 5, 2022",positive,UM FILME QUE MARCOU UMA HISTORIA
"Nov 3, 2022",positive,An instant classic. Should be remembered in the annals of film history as the unifying factor that sparked the greatest anthology in the entirety of modern cinema.
"Nov 1, 2022",positive,"One of my most favorite movie of all time, I love all the avengers movies but this one is one of my favorites, it constantly has something going on, whether its Natasha being chased by the Hulk, the beginning of the movie where Clint and Erik were in Loki's control, Black Widow tricking Loki, Loki going missing and everyone trying to figure out how to find him, when Iron man and Cap first meet Thor and have a fight, and the climax at the end where they all gather in a circle ready to fight where Iron Man flies into the void with a nuke and Black Widow closes the portal, this movie is awesome, I don't know how people don't like it, in my opinion it doesn't deserve any hate it gets, and it's a really good way to properly introduce the characters to each other as they're desperately searching for the right people to stop Loki."
"Oct 29, 2022",positive,"Esta pelicula me encanta, la historia es increible para ser el encuentro de superheroes de marvel, cada vez que la veo digo ""es hermoso"" le doy un 9/10"

"Oct 24, 2022",positive,Amazing! This is my childhood
"Oct 22, 2022",positive,UM DOS MELHORES FILMES QUE EU JA VI
"Oct 21, 2022",negative,"The first major superhero crossover film may have been loud and shiny enough to placate most Marvel consumers, but this entry suffers from some of the worst dialogue of the entire MCU and a sterile, soulless CGI battle that seems neverending. It's also worth noting that the actors hadn't grown into their roles yet, and some of the cast (especially Hemsworth) seem notably awkward in their portrayals."
"Oct 20, 2022",positive,"While the MCU phase one is arguably the worst of the three, this an the first iron man are the exceptions to that. This movie is corny and stupid but is also one of the most watchable mcu films, period. The movie is so fun, and the last third is actually amazing. It is basically just a giant final battle for over 30 minutes, but it still works. Unlike Man of Steel, which has a similar final battle, it being that it lasts for like an hour, this last act is actually fun and creative. I don't have a lot to say about this one, and besides, basically everyone has seen it at least once. 8/10"
"Oct 16, 2022",positive,"The movie that brought everything together what a treat it is to see
8/10"
"Oct 15, 2022",positive,love it as A Kid...So Goood
"Oct 9, 2022",positive,Fantastic movie and probably one of the best created by marvel! With everything you want from a superhero action movie.
"Oct 7, 2022",positive,"With all of Marvel's most iconic heroes on screen at the same time, wonderful performances, excellent soundtrack, intense, immersive and fantastic action, spot-on humor, visually appealing status and total direction control by Joss Whedon, Marvel's first teamup movie centering around the awesome Avengers, this movie remains one of the highest grossing films of all time, as well as one of the finest films ever crafted."
"Oct 5, 2022",positive,I liked this movie and I thought that Loki and Thor were pretty good in it.
"Oct 4, 2022",positive,"A huge hit with critics and viewers alike, I was surprised and disappointed by how mediocre this movie was.  Sure the dialogue is snappy and the visuals stunning, but it never adds up to much compelling, and by the overlong and tedious CGI battle scene at the end I was ready to leave."
"Oct 4, 2022",positive,"This movie is the best movie in phase 1.This movie is so awesome and seeing these characters built up from different movies in one is so cool.Also Loki is so cool but menacing at the same time.My one complaint is that Hawkeye doesn't get a lot of love in this movie.He spends a lot of time as Loki's minion.But besides that a great Marvel movie.
-9/10"
"Oct 2, 2022",positive,"My favorite MCU movie. Great action, heroes, and story. This movie cemented the MCU as a cinematic universe."
"Sep 28, 2022",positive,The Avengers is a very fun and lively action adventure. The acting performance of literally anyone here is awesome. This movie is a total vibe. It's a lot like Guardians of the Galaxy. The direction isn't necessarily awesome but it goes along with the elements. There are some cringeworthy moments. It is not perfect but it wasn't meant to be. Solid movie with definite flaws but the good overshadows the bad.
"Sep 28, 2022",positive,Didn't see this one until way later than when it came out but I was hooked on Marvel movies from here on out.

No se muy bien que le ha pasado a Marvel con el GCI en sus ultimas apuestas, son proyectos mundanos y sin alma. Avengers tiene uno de los mejores CGI hechos del MCU y es una película de hace 10 años. Increíble."
"Sep 25, 2022",positive,its a good blockbuster but the avengers must argue with each other for most of the movie if it wasnt for tom hiddlestons charizma and other actors it would bomb pretty bad but it worked well because the characters were introduced to us before

"Sep 9, 2022",positive,The Avengers burst onto screen for a great blockbuster
"Sep 6, 2022",positive,It's hard to make a team-up movie works and this movie did it in a great way.
"Sep 2, 2022",positive,"This is a relatively decent superhero (Marvel) action/adventure film, with plenty of visual effects and numerous fights/battles to keep teens watching, although there is also a fair amount of lengthy dialogue scenes too, in between the more action-based scenes, which may put some off. I don't claim to be especially knowledgeable (i.e. much at all) when it comes to the individual details/background/history of the various characters that come together to become the Avengers (not the 1960s British show starring Diana Rigg, I hasten to add). However, I can't say it's not entertaining in parts - it is and the CGI is fairly good. Perhaps not entirely as realistic as other films but then this is a superhero and perhaps part sci-fi based film, compared to a disaster film or straight drama. 

I did feel that, at times, the script felt a bit too overly cheesy but then I don't suppose I'm the main/intended demographic (a 37-year-old lady). I quite liked Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who brings the various characters together to form the Avengers - he plays cool and sassy/suave characters with ease. This is not the sort of film I'm likely to want to watch again or that will stay in my mind much but for what it is, it's not bad. A little long and slightly lacking but overly its fairly good, so I'd recommend it on that basis."
"Sep 1, 2022",positive,One of the best fanfare comic book movies ever. Movie has a good story and started the ensemble phase for comic book movies.
"Aug 27, 2022",positive,Everything about this is perfect blockbuster spectacle cinema. Except Captain America's outfit.
"Aug 21, 2022",positive,"With great care for each of the mainline characters (Hawkeye still isn't a mainline character a decade later), The Avengers showed the world something we had never seen before, the culmination of a cinematic universe. It's bright, it's fun, but it's not without flaws."
"Aug 18, 2022",positive,"A film that shocked marvel fans where, for the first time, heroes of the same shared universe come together in a spectacular crossover. Excellent direction, soundtrack, characters, plot... a perfect conclusion to Phase One of the MCU."
"Aug 18, 2022",positive,when I was younger I was scared of the scene where hulk was chasing black widow but  looking at this movie i stared to really like it
"Aug 15, 2022",positive,"While better then most movies in Phase 1 of the MCU. I do not think it ages well. The 1st and 2cnd acts are boring to me. The 3rd act is one of the best MCU scenes though. I think it is overrated.
I love the 3rd act so much, It's truely S tier."
"Aug 12, 2022",positive,"The whole cave collapse was the worst part, and that says not much because everything else is much better."
"Aug 10, 2022",positive,"The Avengers movie was alright and definitely good for it's time. If a movie of this standard was released today, it would still be a hit, just not to the levels we've seen in the MCU. Still a good movie overall."
"Aug 8, 2022",positive,Absolutely crazy I really enjoyed the movie For me it's 9/10
"Aug 5, 2022",positive,I LIVE FOR THIS MOVIE
"Aug 3, 2022",positive,"The Avengers is definitely the best film of Phase 1 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. All the characters we have seen in previous films meet here and after seeing the film you love them even more. Apart from Captain America, they made him more unpleasant here. The movie's villain, Loki, gets better than the Thor movie, and becomes a more memorable villain. The characters work and the most interesting character is definitely Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. In this film we see the best Hulk. The aliens are introduced well and it's just a taste of Thanos' threat. Film fully approved and I repeat: THE BEST FILM OF PHASE 1"
"Aug 1, 2022",positive,"Visuals were great, comedic at times, characters are entertaining to watch, and more emotional than i remember, but the end battle was a bit long."
"Jul 31, 2022",positive,"Para mim esse filme é o exemplo perfeito para um filme de herói, boas atuações bom desenvolvimento o tom para as piadas e perfeito, e o cgi também e excelente esse filme e uma obra prima dos filmes de heróis."
"Jul 23, 2022",positive,"The film that made the MCU what it is--The Avengers is everything a superhero fan could want. Incredible performances from all 6 Avengers, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, and Tom Hiddleston's Loki; stellar writing; good pacing and an engaging plot; this is what makes this movie so darn good. It's a formidable achievement in Hollywood--a classic for ages to come. You can't miss it."
"Jul 22, 2022",positive,The film just works in many ways that other ensemble films seem to be unable to. I like it quite a bit.
"Jul 20, 2022",positive,Great movie. Fun to go watch after all the marvels movies that have come out. Seems so simple back then.
"Jul 16, 2022",positive,"What an event this was, so good even in 2022!"
"Jul 15, 2022",positive,"This movie is just so fun. It definitely has some stereotypical superhero moments and stuff, but a fantastic set of characters and a fantastic villain propel this movie upward. It balances comedy, action, drama, and adventure very well and packs a lot of plot and growth into a single movie."
"Jul 14, 2022",positive,This film gives an end to phase 1 which built up to the moment where the Avengers unite as a unit to fight a big bad which became Loki. The film is truly one of the best shot and acted of any Marvel film giving each character a story and giving us a reason as to why they each were chosen bringing something different to the table to build a strong unit.
"Jul 13, 2022",positive,My favorite marvel movie
"Jul 12, 2022",positive,Absolutely classic. Tells a great story that formed the best batch of heroes. Love the ways the characters developed in this movie and it definitely setup the infinity saga greatly.
"Jul 10, 2022",positive,Perfect and aging like fine wine. I really consider this Iron Man 3 Tony gets so much character depth and thrusts him forward the future of his character. 
"Jul 9, 2022",positive,"The Avengers brings together six superheroes from four franchises into one epic movie, and the result is absolutely spectacular. Each character is given a chance to shine, there is well-written humor, and a compelling villain. Well-choreographed action scenes complete a near-flawless movie, ending with a final battle on a grand scale and an emotional resulting scene. While I wish some plot points were explained more, The Avengers is a film that flies higher than a Helicarrier."

"Jun 23, 2022",positive,"Keeping in the pace in nearly each criteria, Avengers Assemble is a memorable blockbuster where it shows the essence of humanity and how the heroes of the MCU change the pace of the world"
"Jun 23, 2022",positive,It's just the usual jumble of marvel avengers action/ fight scenes/ weak plot/ too many characters. This was first in the series and it set the script that all the sequels followed. Really it's a total mess but fans of this type of thing will find plenty to amuse themselves here. Scarlet is the real upside here. Wow as usual.
"Jun 23, 2022",positive,All of the Avengers movies are great including this one! Fun to watch but isn't something I would re watch  a lot mainly because the others are better.
"Jun 22, 2022",positive,Such a good start to the avenger’s this movie was the perfect movie to get people hyped for the future of marvel 9/10 
"Jun 15, 2022",positive,Still puts a smile on my face ten years later !
"Jun 14, 2022",positive,"This is an absolutely fantastic, good ol' fashioned blockbuster. Spectacle, fun, slam bang action, character moments, this film has it all!"
"Jun 14, 2022",positive,"Very iconic movie, still holds up 10 years later. Although not as good as the Avengers movies we love so much later on, this movie is an absolute classic and brings in our favorite superheroes together."
"Jun 10, 2022",negative,This is the movie that started the MCU going bad. A decade has made it clear that this movie is one big gimmick with little emphasis on plot and characters.
"Jun 9, 2022",positive,This movie is better than all solo movies
"Jun 8, 2022",positive,"Me recordo mucho a superman II y la épica pelea en nueva york.Creo que toma muchos elementos de la misma. en suma, Mi pelicula favorita de superhéroes de todos los tiempos"
"Jun 5, 2022",positive,Good start with good work from all the usual suspects.
"Jun 2, 2022",positive,"To give a positive review to The Avengers is basically a cliché. When it first came out, it was an absolute landmark; practically defining what cinema would be for the next decade. And, a decade later, it still holds up as one of the best blockbusters and superhero movies ever!
The chemistry between the cast is impeccable, every character gets their fair share of screen time, the action is imaginative, and the score is awesome! 
The movie does have some issues. I personally don't think Loki is the best Avengers level threat and sometimes the effects do get a bit dodgy towards the end. But those are the only flaws I could possibly find with this film!
It is a miracle that this movie came out as incredible as it did, and it's an even bigger miracle that it still holds up to this day as a generation defining film!"
"May 21, 2022",positive,There is some part that i want to skip.
"May 21, 2022",positive,"this is a movie with great comedic timing, great dialogue, and believable cgi that makes you immersed in the world and it also sets a very good story about iron man and his eventual self sacrifice thankfully he lived tho"
"May 18, 2022",positive,"Daora, gostei bastante"
"May 17, 2022",positive,"Everything from the build up, the music, the camera work, the tension, was spectacular and felt like an amazing culminating finish having these particular characters group up for the first time. Every lead actor/actress played their part perfectly, personalities clashed and together they grew to overcome a threat. Bonus points go to the wardrobe department for their amazing attention to detail. (EG. Cap wearing clothing that represents the clothing people wore before he got frozen)

I believe this film to be when the Iron Man suit looks most realistic and less CGI based. 

Overall, amazing movie that I believe will be timeless."
"May 13, 2022",positive,The Avengers is absolutely the biggest MCU of all time is really epic and entertaining film of 2012.
"May 11, 2022",positive,"LOL, funny and for ages 13+ only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"May 7, 2022",positive,"esse filme e um classico, recomendo"
"May 7, 2022",positive,One of the few Marvel movies that stands as a decent film in its own right. Watching this in theaters was one of a few moments in which I realized that the MCU could be something more than popcorn movies (even if this is still largely a popcorn movie). The action set-pieces are top tier for modern movies.
"May 6, 2022",positive,"After years of doubt, Marvel finally cracked the code and delivered a crossover event that perfectly blended the wide-ranging solo films and their unique tones and characters. An absolute must-watch!"
"May 4, 2022",positive,"It may be nostalgia talking but this movie has developed into everything I want to see in a superhero team up movie, super satisfying watch!"
"Apr 28, 2022",positive,just amazing this movie is!
"Apr 28, 2022",positive,looking forward to watching it for the 37th time
"Apr 28, 2022",positive,Loki and Thor are fighting's in Wanda visions and phi wan Leno I fights a Zeno morphs but Arnold jumps in to stop the fighting just like in butchers crossing and leaving Las Vegas.
"Apr 28, 2022",positive,"This is pure comic book fun. The characters, along with their actors, have perfect chemistry together, even when they are bickering against one another. The third act is incredible to say the least and every character, no matter how small, has a charming soul that just attaches the viewer to this universe."
"Apr 27, 2022",positive,Would watch again for the 34th time
"Apr 25, 2022",positive,10/10 it was beautiful. It is funny and serious at the same time. Love Loki and Tony.
"Apr 25, 2022",positive,"this movie set up everything for cinema crossovers, this movie has a great cast, great story, villain is amazing they should have added the deleted stan lee cameo, but its still a great film. Loki is amazing, and its tough to count your entire movie on a guy that has been two indie movies before this. 
Great movie recommend it"
"Apr 22, 2022",positive,"I can't give this a perfect 5 out of 5.  Besides the heavy lifting scenes of Robert Downey's Iron Man, and before we get the best rendition of the Incredible Hulk ever put to film in that electric third act?  Pretty mundane and average, to be honest.  Even if ultimately a memorable movie going experience.  At times feels like a TV movie in terms of aesthetics and cinematography.  RDJ drags Whedon's material to a greater sum than its parts."
"Apr 21, 2022",positive,"The Avengers perfectly brought together these characters everyone grew to love. Nuking NYC was a kinda outta pocket idea, there's things there way worse than aliens."
"Apr 21, 2022",positive,What a fun movie to see. I have been waiting for decades to see these characters presented so well. This honors the source material and I loved every second.
"Apr 18, 2022",positive,A great film to start the Avengers Franchise in MCU
"Apr 10, 2022",positive,"A thrill ride, this was the superhero movie that unseated Batman Returns as my favorite comic book movie. That same feeling I get from going on a rollercoaster I got from seeing this in theaters. Very fun from start to finish."
"Apr 6, 2022",positive,Great movie! The MCU is awesome and it was great to see the Avengers get together for the first time. Loki seemed a bit out of character but I guess they needed to do that in order to make him the actual villain of this movie. I suppose it also helps to have the excuse that the mind stone was manipulating him like it did to the avengers in that one scene.
"Apr 3, 2022",positive,An awesome team up movie.
"Apr 2, 2022",positive,The first time they Unite. The Avengers beats down everything with great performance and solid story development therefore creating something to watch.
"Apr 1, 2022",positive,Great movie that brings the avengers together on the big screen for the first time.
"Mar 31, 2022",positive,"As a smaller kid, the best movie of my youth"
"Mar 18, 2022",positive,"Definitely one of the more cinematic MCU films. The way this film changed the landscape for blockbusters is incredible. This was truly the film that showed what Marvel Studios is capable of. CGI, script, and performances are all tremendously high in quality. Standouts include Ruffalo, Hiddleston, Johansonn and Jackson."
"Mar 11, 2022",negative,So boring. Bad CGI. Terrible Plot.
"Mar 7, 2022",positive,Instant classic. Still my favorite comic book movie of all time. Love this movie.
"Mar 7, 2022",positive,"This movie still stands out as an amazing film. It is action-packed, hilarious, and entertaining throughout. The first fifteen or so minutes do feel like they are of much lower quality - almost TV quality - than the rest of the film, and some of the actors - I'm looking at your Christ Hemsworth - had not fully found their character yet. That is why it loses half a star for me.

Rating - Great"
"Mar 4, 2022",negative,The movie was ultimately a cliché rolled directly out of a rushed cinematic universe. The magic and creativity of Marvel was gimped into a not-so-funny lackluster movie that eventually led to this. Though the historical impact this movie had in team-up superhero movies is ultimately the longest lasting legacy I am happy this movie paved the way for.
"Mar 3, 2022",positive,"B+ ~ At the time of release, this movie an experience since it was the first time superheroes each with their own solo film came together in one giant film. Re-watching this though, some of the goofier elements get in the way of the story-telling. At times, it feels like every character is a clown and the quips never stop. Still have to give this movie respect for what it achieved and for what it paved the way for."
"Mar 3, 2022",positive,"This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Yes, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. The performances are bad, especially for Tony and Steve."
"Feb 24, 2022",positive,"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Feb 23, 2022",positive,"This movie did something that had never really been done before, had a nice, but comparatively small build-up to what we have now seen, and was a great kick off to the subsequent MCU phases."
"Feb 22, 2022",positive,"This may be my favourite stand-alone MCU film. From its interesting characters, threatening villain, hard-hitting action, element of espionage, and of course, heart, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" serves as a more than worth sequel to and for ""The First Avenger"" and a memorable entry into the MCU."
"Feb 16, 2022",positive,A really good start to the MCU
"Jan 30, 2022",positive,Really sets up the whole Team up thing that these movies do. One flaw though is the use of Hawkeye he is such a great character the family man should have used him more but still a great movie.
"Jan 28, 2022",positive,Just perfect and gorgeous!!!
"Jan 27, 2022",positive,My rating for the film is a 8.7/10
"Jan 27, 2022",positive,"An entertaining spectacle of superhero team-up flick with character drama and quaint quips.

Director Joss Whedon's superhero action-thriller The Avengers (2012) is sure to please all viewers seeking enthralling action, but disappoint the Marvel fans wanting stronger character arcs like the individual hero movies. I loved the thrill of watching all of Marvel's greatest superheroes team up together in one movie. The Avengers surely is a great accomplishment and a thoroughly entertaining one from Iron Man fighting Thor to Black Widow evading The Hulk. The Avengers is nearly all action among the cute character interactions. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor are all better made movies with stronger character development, stories, writing, and direction. 

Whedon brings Marvel's comic book superheroes to life all for a massive brawl in New York against Loki and some goofy aliens. The action sequences are exciting and well thought out with several memorable moments. I just found Whedon's overall direction messy and lacking real depth for each character. He turns each nuanced superhero from the previous films and turns them into Whedon quip quoting machines. Everything is a punchline or pop culture reference suddenly.

Writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn focus too much on the comedy and action and forget to give these characters detail, motivation, and nuance. It's all about the one-liner jokes and I think that severely detracted from these otherwise interesting characters. I appreciate that producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige planned this all out to get The Avengers to assemble in a way that makes sense, but I thought Loki's alien attack narrative is really boring and just an excuse to give The Avengers a horde of faceless enemies to destroy.

Robert Downey Jr. is very funny and charming as Iron Man as he gets to show off his quick thinking and scientific skills. Chris Evans remains a bastion of American patriotism and earnest heroism. Mark Ruffalo takes over for Edward Norton as the inner turmoil of rage that is Bruce Banner. His Hulk is really fearsome with cool action sequences and fun moments like Hulk punching the space whale. Chris Hemsworth's Thor loses his serious god personality and turns more into a joke spouting character, but his hammer and thunder powers are still killer. 

Scarlett Johansson is amazingly nuanced as Black Widow as she outwits every man she encounters and looks drop dead gorgeous as the redhead Natasha Romanoff. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is super cool and shines in The Avengers with her clever spy skills and combat prowess. She always feels genuine as Natasha Romanoff. I really do appreciate Scarlett still delivering excellence in dramatic acting as Black Widow, who may be my favorite aspect of The Avengers upon revisiting this beloved blockbuster.

Jeremy Renner gets taken over as Hawkeye, so we don't really get to know him yet. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is both scary and entertaining with his hateful smirks and cruel jests. Samuel L. Jackson is actually tough and commanding as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. Cobie Smulders just appears as Agent Maria Hill, but she's fairly engaging. Clark Gregg gets quite the emotional farewell as Agent Phil Coulson. Stellan Skarsgård is wasted as Loki's science plot device. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming alongside Robert Downey Jr. I wish we got more time with her endearing Pepper Potts. 

Editors Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek cut neatly around the fights, but it can all get lost in how chaotic the action sequences get. Seamus McGarvey has some inspired medium and close-up shots of each hero and them fighting alongside one another, but his wide shots are often really dull to look at compared to the more intimate spaces. The CGI is fine, but has moments that look pretty ugly, especially with all the washed out colors in every scene. Composer Alan Silvestri created an instantly iconic theme song for The Avengers. I really love Soundgarden's end credits song ""Live to Rise"" also!

In all, The Avengers is a very fun movie, that could have been much better honestly."
"Jan 24, 2022",neutral,"Loud, tedious, mind-numbing, cartoony. Each superhero had their moment, and I liked the giant flying spiney machine dragon things in the final act, but overall I found The Avengers difficult to follow and the characters unrelatable. Not bad, but overrated."
"Jan 19, 2022",positive,"A great movie that does the modern superhero movie justice, staying true to its comic material with well written characters and story whilst providing extremely well done action scenes that feel grand in scale much like the stories created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee"
"Jan 15, 2022",positive,The Avengers was a great way to combine all of the hard work that marvel studios have done. The character development is such a driving factor for this movie. 
"Jan 14, 2022",positive,"You have no idea how INSANE it was seeing all of the movies and stories that came before it in the MCU tie together. There were definitely better movies, but still really good!"
"Jan 11, 2022",positive,Epic full of action and chatacters that everyone love.
"Jan 10, 2022",positive,A bit messy at times but still an enjoyable marvel movie
"Jan 6, 2022",positive,A classic and still holds up so well to this day.
"Jan 6, 2022",positive,"There is not a single superheroe movie with more epic moments than this one, of course there have been bigger blockbusters, but The Avengers makes us connect with the human side of our favorite heroes in such a compelling way that is easy to see why the movie was and continue to be so acclamed."
"Jan 2, 2022",positive,"Somehow a group of less-than-stellar films were then funneled chronologically into a team-up superhero film that broke records and our minds. Besides that, with a clever script and exciting action scenes, what seems like a short ride of a story ends up being fairly impressive. At its lowest, Avengers is still fairly decent."
"Jan 1, 2022",positive,A fancy way to start a series of films.
"Dec 30, 2021",positive,It was a very enjoyable series
"Dec 29, 2021",positive,1 of the best movies
"Dec 28, 2021",positive,O melhor filme dos vingadores de todos
"Dec 28, 2021",positive,"One of my favourite MCU movies was so awesome to see all the hero’s at the time come together even tho some don’t even like each other but come together for the greater good. The score and story was really well done it could’ve been really bad and is easy to mess up with so many characters but I felt everything felt fluent and natural, Tom Hiddleston really shines as does Robert Downey JR "
"Dec 23, 2021",positive,Brilliant set up for a brilliant franchise. Directed fantastically.
"Dec 22, 2021",positive,"Amazing! 

With this all-star cast, there's nothing that can go wrong.

Avengers, Assemble!!"
"Dec 22, 2021",positive,The best of the Avengers movies. It has everything and more. Has a much more of an impact on everything after than some of us realize. Really love that. Wish some of the movies were at least half good as is this movie.
"Dec 20, 2021",positive,A dream come true for fans now it is a part of cinematic history
"Dec 18, 2021",positive,"Foi épico na época, mas hoje não é nada de excepcional."
"Dec 16, 2021",positive,"Marvels The Avengers was a movie most comic book fans never thought would occur, and not only did it occur, but it lived up to all the expectations it had on its shoulders. This is a movie that needs to be watched, it is easily still one of my top favorite marvel movies, and it holds up to this day as a great film. While the plot itself is simple, the characters and actions scenes within this movie hold it together and make it a fun movie to watch, even with its dialogue heavy middle. This is a must watch again with Avengers Endgame coming up, as it is the first time these characters were brought together on the big screen. With its importance there, and Endgame being the final send off for Infinity Saga, I would be very surprised if this movie isn't heavily referenced at some point within the film. Go back and watch this film, you won't be disappointed."
"Dec 14, 2021",positive,"First time watching this one in years and it's still a lot of fun.  It was particularly fun seeing all these characters meet each other for the first time, and seeing Loki back when he was a straight villain.  Probably third in the running for Avengers movie behind Infinity War and Endgame, while miles ahead of Avengers 2."
"Dec 14, 2021",positive,PERFECT!!! MY FAVORITE MOVIE MCU.
"Dec 11, 2021",positive,"Fucking awesome, a fantastic conclusion to Phase 1. 5/5"
"Dec 3, 2021",positive,"The script emphasizes its heroes humanity this lived up to its hype and, in my opinion, took the entire franchise to a new height.  The character development and dialogue were much appreciated."
"Dec 2, 2021",positive,"Having been one of the biggest success films ever is its gift and its curse. It's a grandiose and unforgettable visual spectacle, it has the most creative shots in the MCU, the action scenes are shocking and some characters have their best roles in this film.
All mentioned is the gift of the movie and the curse is that it has our full attention only in that aspects, because the film has a great script, round, complete and with great value, but they almost force you to ignore the story as such and just enjoy the fights.
I have watch it again and my experience was totally different now that I was paying attention to the script."
"Nov 29, 2021",positive,Great Movie And Still remains one of the best MCU movies to date
"Nov 22, 2021",positive,"Best superhero movie.
Ever."
"Nov 20, 2021",positive,Best Marvel movie of all time.
"Nov 19, 2021",positive,una pelicula que sin duda marco un antes y un despues en el mundo de los superheroes en general....una de las mejores producciones de superheroes de todos los tiempos
"Nov 15, 2021",positive,"One of the better installments of the MCU, ""The Avengers"" was a groundbreaking film that changed cinema forever by bringing together these different heroes for the first time. The entire film from start to finish is a blast and an enjoyment to watch, with very memorable lines and a strong performance from its entire cast. The comedy and banter in this movie lands, and the action, especially in the finale, in done very well."
"Nov 13, 2021",positive,"I think we all know how much this movie meant for all the marvel fans and it was truly a new experience. It was great watching the line up between these superhero's and how they work together as a team. The only thing that is bad about this movie are the too many jokes, every 5 minutes comes a joke and it really takes it off a bit."
"Nov 12, 2021",positive,Molto molto molto bello
"Nov 11, 2021",positive,"In my top 3 MCU movies, the Avengers is witty, tightly-paced, sharp and gripping from start to finish. Balances multiple headliner superheroes deftly in a single movie, all of the heroes being likable, unlike in ""Justice League"". Could not commend any higher."
"Nov 11, 2021",positive,It's the first trial of team-up by the studio and it turned out to be a classic one. Really like this film.
"Nov 7, 2021",positive,"Joss Whedon (I do not condone his behavior) did a masterful job at bringing all the superheroes together in these well-balanced superhero masher. This is what phase 1 was building up to and it excelled on almost every single level. The action was great. The acting was done brilliantly. The new direction in which they are taking the hulk was absolutely magnificent. Minor nitpicks or that the film tended to drag in the the middle from time to time but, those moments were easily overshadowed by the flawless nest and wish this movie unfolded."
"Oct 29, 2021",negative,The pacing is incredibly dull but the third act is worth the watch. Arguably one of the weakest films in the MCU.
"Oct 19, 2021",positive,"Arguably the best MCU movie, but by far not as good as Raimi's Spider-Man  trilogy and Nolan's Batman trilogy"
"Oct 14, 2021",neutral,"Of the ten that I have seen so far, The Avengers is one of the poorer Marvel movies. It requires a viewing of all previous Marvel films and even at that, falls short of the other ones. Its characters aren't as likeable, the humour isn't memorable, and it is by far the most confusing; at least of the ones I've seen. I'd say it is forgettable if it didn't appear to be so prominent in the Marvel timeline."
"Oct 11, 2021",negative,Just...no. None of these Marvel movies are any good.
"Oct 5, 2021",positive,This was a groundbreaking movie when it first came out and still its one of the best.
"Oct 1, 2021",positive,"Even with Whedon's taint on the film, it still results a fantastic experience."
"Sep 28, 2021",positive,A fantastic movie and one of the best marvel movies ever made 
"Sep 21, 2021",positive,"Josh Whedon may not understand how to make a justice league movie, but he knows how to make a marvel movie. The movie have an overall great plot. The cast is as always perfect in their roles. The give us moments and oneliners that are iconic till this day. The action scenes are amazing. All the charectors feel useful and needed, right from brute strengh to a tactical overwiew of the situations the heroes are in.  It's just a must see movie."
"Sep 19, 2021",positive,"The 2nd best MCU film. Filled with likable characters, Joss Whedon really directed a great movie here (I wish I could say the same for Josstice League), and the best of Phase 1. Highly rewatchable, and great performances really elevate this movie. 10/10"
"Sep 17, 2021",positive,"Avengers is an absolute blast. Exhilarating action, great characters and a witty script makes The Avengers pure fun from start to finish. RDJ as iron man as usual he owns this role. Sam Jackson as nick fury kills it here as well, and all of the cast bring their A game. The Direction from Whedon is stellar and he really does a great job in bringing together this whole cast and the action sequences are filmed really well too. Overall this is my favorite out of Phase 1 MCU The avengers is a really fun time from start to finish and makes it a must watch for comic book fans. Grade A-"
"Sep 13, 2021",positive,"Where it all began, Marvel's The Avengers did what no other movie dared to do, having a large ensemble of heroes, a lovable villain and having an at the time original arc of having the team learn to work together. It's your average run of the mill blockbuster, but a hell of a one at that! Without a doubt this movie's greatest achievement is its all star cast and the chemistry they share, from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr, to the stoic and comedic Samuel L. Jackson, every cast member is perfect in their respective roles and the way they bounce off of each other is just remarkable! The VFX are also outstanding, most of them have aged rather well. This movie does have one glaring problem however, and that is the middle act. It's nowhere near as enjoyable as the other two, its incredibly slowly paced, and doesn't impact the plot is almost any way. All in All, Marvel's The Avengers is just phenomenal in every way. All you can do is marvel at this work of art."
"Sep 8, 2021",positive,THIS movie was seriously something else some awesome scenes i  love how you get a taste of evryone vs everyone for a brief moment awesome movie 10/10
"Aug 31, 2021",neutral,"Entertaining but there's absolutely nothing about these Marvel movies that puts them above and beyond. They are all over budgeted, over acted, over PRODUCED, and just worn out.. Marvel is nothing but clichés in cash grabs anymore— GET ORIGINAL.. I wonder who wins in the end?? Robert Downey Jr, please come back to real movies, you're so much better than this crap."
"Aug 30, 2021",positive,"Overrated. The gathering of everyone and action are breathtaking for the time, but the plot is too mainstream. Loki is definitely not as well-executed as in Thor. The pacing is unbelievably off, with both the slow parts and the battle taking way too long."
"Aug 29, 2021",positive,"Very good movie, but also very corny."
"Aug 25, 2021",positive,"In this epic culmination to the five films prior, you get everything from thrilling action to interesting character development. Easily, one of the greatest Marvel films of all time."
"Aug 25, 2021",positive,That was fun. I enjoy Marvel's ensemble stuff the most
"Aug 25, 2021",positive,"#6/25
Best Moment: The novelty of meeting each other"
"Aug 24, 2021",positive,Great action and a strong story about a team coming together and Tom Hiddleston coming into his own as Loki making this one the best films in the MCU.
"Aug 23, 2021",positive,*Avengers Theme Intensifies*
"Aug 9, 2021",positive,"80/100 GOOD movie, a Classic"
"Jul 26, 2021",positive,"An incredible film that has all aspects it needs to create a fantastic superhero team that compels you right from the beginning and till the end of the film. It has a basic yet smart plot with surprising scenes and ideas along with one of the best soundtracks, character connections and breathtaking sequences that seem hard to bring all in 2 hours, but this film does an incredible job in entertaining you from the story, comedy and action for the entire runtime"
"Jul 26, 2021",positive,"It was great to see Marvel bring back the original Avengers.  The movie was extra good in special effects especially the Flying Aircraft carrier. The only characters I never cared for was Hawkeye from Marvel and Green Arrow from DC, the reason why, no matter how many times they both shoot arrows, it appears as if the Arrows on their backs are always full!"
"Jul 23, 2021",positive,Smiled the entire time in the theatre.  Launched the MCU into a level it never came down from.
"Jul 19, 2021",positive,"The Avengers is a movie that could've easily been a mess and turned out to be a masterpiece thanks to Joss Whedon. The movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the MCU and gives all of the Avengers moments to shine. The action is fantastic, the visuals raise the bar for future MCU films, and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling. The script gives each of the Avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe. Loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the Avengers, and Tom Hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character, which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and one-liners as well. The acting in general is good, with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles. Renner is done a bit dirty in the film, but the big battle redeems that slightly and Renner makes the best of the screen time he has. Unlike some previous MCU movies, this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings. Overall, The Avengers was a fantastic first culmination for the MCU and set the bar very high for future movies like it."
"Jul 18, 2021",positive,"One absolute amazing feature film.
Thrill,  Action, intensity,  wit, tech and an evil character that you'll love to hate."
"Jul 17, 2021",positive,"The movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting.
It's a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the Infinity Saga, but I'll never understand why they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly."
"Jul 17, 2021",positive,"So a ""Lightening god"" Who takes orders from a man who is  ""extra strong"" and a man in a soup can suit._.How about the indestructible green guy? Oh wait there is a guy with arrows and a girl/Women with a me too hard on."
"Jul 16, 2021",positive,Electric and also rapidly nostalgic. It doesn't happen that often these days where you're finding yourself wanting more. Sequels usually are the demise of a very good original. This saga gave a lot  and could of done possibly more before it's End.
"Jul 16, 2021",positive,This movie came out with a BIG BANG!  Fans loved it and what really can I say about it that hadn't already been said.  Great Movie! Check it out!
"Jul 15, 2021",positive,"Such a fun movie, maybe not as good as later films, but the characters weren't as developed yet. The one that brought the group together and ""started"" it all though, classic."
"Jul 10, 2021",positive,"Awesome movie! Love the action. Surprisingly, I never once felt bored throughout the entire thing, even though the final battle is a good half hour or so, and the entire movie is pushing 2.5 hours. Other superhero franchises (if there are any left besides the DCEU) really have something to learn from this movie."
"Jul 7, 2021",positive,While a fairly easy to follow and pretty good special effects I couldn't find anything special about this movie. The cinematography is nothing great and just wasn't my thing but great addition if you follow this series and part of me thinks I could have appreciated it more if it was more my thing.
"Jul 6, 2021",positive,"it is a pretty good movie, loki is a good villain and the first meetings of the avengers are fun to watch"
"Jul 5, 2021",positive,Straight from the comics in many ways. Absolutely brilliant! This movie was a well oiled machine.
"Jul 1, 2021",negative,This was good at the time cause no one saw anything as big as this before but its lost its touch
"Jun 27, 2021",positive,"The original avengers movie was very popular and still is. Highly requested after you watch all the movies titled after the “original 6” before 2012. Compared to other MCU movies, this isn’t as good as a couple of them, since the MCU barely miss, and they definitely didn’t miss with this one. This brung one of the most popular marvel characters to this day. "
"Jun 22, 2021",positive,"Marvel (Kevin Feige) did a great job at doing and setting up this movie. They didn't rush into it like Warner Brothers did, they took their time and waited for the perfect opportunity to make and put this movie out. I stand by every decision that was made in this movie, except anything to do with Josh Whedon. Marvel will always hold a dear spot in my heart, and this is one of the movies that I will always think about when I hear Marvel!"
"Jun 9, 2021",positive,"A coming together of individual unique people with mind blowing capabilities, and a good story to tell while not getting too distracted by the eye candy, makes this a spectacular thrill ride you'll want to take again and again! EXCELSIOR!!"
"Jun 4, 2021",neutral,I used to love this as a kid but oh my god this is not good. It's not exactly bad either tho. It's just... empty.
"Jun 3, 2021",positive,"Great movie that brought the avengers and their incredible actors together in a movie with one of marvels top villains, Loki."
"May 26, 2021",positive,The Avengers was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The plot was good and interesting. Loki was the perfect villain for this movie. The avengers were put together perfectly. The score of this movie is good. The acting is perfect. There wasn't a single second that I didn't enjoy. All in all i give this movie a 5/5 stars.
"May 26, 2021",positive,Hulk was the best part of the whole movie 
"May 22, 2021",positive,One of the best superhero movies in existance.
"May 14, 2021",positive,Best super hero movie ever at the time of it's release.... just my opinion
"May 13, 2021",neutral,"This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Sure, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. It's not just because there is a lack of action because that's not true at all. In fact within the first hour or so there are four fight/action scenes. But the way they are brought about are almost laughable. 

The movie gets good once the hulk transforms on the helicarrier. Scenes aren't lit very well and it almost looks like a episode of firefly. But it's not. It's a huge action blockbuster with a budget in access of 200 million dollars.

You can say whatever you want about Joss Weadon. Whether you love him or hate him I just don't think he's cut out for these kinds of movies.

The characters have fine chemistry but they aren't given enough time to shine either on their own or as a team. Some of the action is fine I guess but there are certain scenes where I cannot tell what's happening at all. To prove my point watch the Thor and Loki fight scene on the top of Stark Tower. 

Overall Avengers is painful for about an hour and then slightly bolster for the remainder of the run time. Would have to wait at least three years to watch this again."
"May 7, 2021",positive,"This film was really fun. This was a start of something that no one really knew that it was even possible. Just seeing all of these guys teaming up together for the first time. There are some VFX that really hold up and there are some that don't. Any way or another the characters of this movie are just fun to watch and really are good throughout the films Loki was really the most fun Marvel villain that they had until they reached Phase 3 and there were finally some good challengers. This movie was the start of something that really could've not work. But the fact that it does really goes to show how much taking your time and plan things out really help you and could do you really good favors. This was actually the first Marvel movie that I watch, and i'm pretty sure this was everyone else first time too. I don't remember it specifically but I do remember watching it at home when it came out on DVD and I think it caught my interest. I of course didn't know who any of the characters are at the time but I remember being at the very least interested. But any way this movie was great. 10/10"
"May 7, 2021",positive,"Love it top 5 marvel movie
Ensemble that worked and didn't leave me wanting more of specific characters"
"Apr 30, 2021",positive,"Unlike DC, the Marvel filmmakers know how to make a ""team"" movie and cast the characters accordingly. The nice balance of so many lead characters mixed with a ton of information and action/comedy/sci-fi is something to admire starting with the writers. With epic camera shots and outstanding VFX, this film is one hell of a start to the Avengers franchise."
"Apr 29, 2021",positive,"Amazing action packed movie. This is exactly what I am looking for, a must see.
95/100"
"Apr 29, 2021",positive,"The film ""The Avengers"" manages to present us with a good script, although with one or two holes, it has a good costume for the time of its release, it has a good original song, the film's CGI is competent, with only a few lapses on the part of the Chitauri army, and in the end what saves the film is the final fight, which entertains the audience very well."
"Apr 29, 2021",positive,I'm not a 12 year old child so won't fully appreciate this movie but it passed the time adequately enough.
"Apr 28, 2021",positive,"The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal.

After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development.

There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie.

Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape.

The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot.

Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them.

The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double.

Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it."
"Apr 22, 2021",positive,"The avengers has one dope team of superhero's. while the sequences are epic as well The sequences with Thor, CA and the hulk are especially kick A and RD jr. is pretty good as iron man although I've only seen parts of iron man and not all the movies but I could tell he is good and is a bit humorous."
"Apr 19, 2021",positive,Excellence...The only improvement would be to re-cast Mark Ruffalo with any other person on the planet.
"Apr 12, 2021",positive,"Nonstop entertainment, but not much in terms of highbrow stuff."
"Apr 10, 2021",positive,"Great climax to the first phase with the culmination of all the previous films yet without feeling like an ending to the saga. Loki is a much improved character feeling more like a villain than a whiny little kid. I'm pretty sure everyone got goosebumps when watching them stand together to the amazing theme by Alan Silvestri. The near death of Tony Stark feels touching and is done well. My only real quarrel is how it leads onto Thanos too much even though Marvel had already made plans for the next Avengers film to be Ultron. This is the main reason that Avengers: Age of Ultron had such disappointing reviews. However, that aside, this is a great movie that finally delivered what all Marvel Comic fans wanted to see."
"Apr 9, 2021",positive,Top 3 superhero movie of all time 
"Apr 8, 2021",positive,"The Avengers stars amazing characters Iron Man,Captain America,Thor,Hulk,Black Widow,Hawkeye and Nick Fury and they must come together to defeat Thor's evil brother Loki.Marvel managed to put so many characters into one movie and it worked perfectly well. I love this movie with it's visual effects, the action and it was great."
"Apr 8, 2021",positive,The first meetup of our favorite heroes!  The conflicts between the personality and interests of the characters is interesting throughout and when they finally team up it's amazing!  A classic superhero movie for the ages!
"Apr 6, 2021",positive,The patience it took to set this movie up through the individual films really pays off. The character interactions are really what sets this movie apart from the previous ones – the conflicts at play are very well written. Loki as a villain is also a big reason for this. The action scenes are great especially in the end and Alan Silvestri's score really elevates the movie. An unprecedented cinematic triumph.
"Apr 2, 2021",positive,Joss did a good job balancing out the characters with each other. The story was above average but the awesome character moments make up for that. The VFX are top notch! Howe ever this film lacks cinematography or any good action choreography. Also Captain America's suit went from cool in his solo outing to really lame in this one!
"Apr 1, 2021",positive,"The movie that kickstarted an entire sequence of events of universes, team ups and inspired many creators to the idea that a team up live action comic book movie isn't just a great Comic book movie, but a great movie overall!"
"Apr 1, 2021",positive,"The only thing I can rate as a negative is the fact that Thor is a god, & should be treated as such. The fact that they think he would not finish Stark in a fight is laughable. That just tells me they are doing it for the fans & the fact that we liked RDJ."
"Mar 31, 2021",positive,"Saying this is a great movie is an understatement. Bringing together a great cast from wildly different movies and making it work under one cohesive narrative is a feat not many movies can pull off but the Avengers does! The acting, narrative, and action are outstanding. This is the greatest comic book movie of all time. It's a must see!"
"Mar 30, 2021",negative,"If not for the overly saturated and at times unnecessary moments that took away from the seriousness of this film perhaps I would be more at odds against the villain. However I found myself rooting for the bad guys to win. Avengers by Joss Whedon is an overhyped film made ""great"" only by the unity of several iconic characters. Its a shame that this movie couldn't even take itself seriously"
"Mar 29, 2021",positive,"AMAZING!!!

I RECOMMEND TO YOU ..."
"Mar 26, 2021",positive,Avengers is exactly what everyone was hoping for and more. It's the perfect conclusion to Phase 1 of this epic franchise.
"Mar 24, 2021",positive,"Still one of my favorite superhero movies by Marvel, or even by overall. This was an AMAZING introduction to the Avengers franchise, and I loved every second of it!"
"Mar 23, 2021",negative,Porquería de película
"Mar 22, 2021",positive,"The Avengers is a movie that on paper should not have worked, but in the end it manages to not only juggle its multiple characters effortlessly, but it is also one of the most entertaining superhero blockbusters ever made.  A comic book movie that isn't afraid or embarrassed to be a comic book movie, The Avengers is a delight from start to finish."
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"Very good superhero movie, I mark a before and after of this. Lovable and very well developed characters, Loki as a villain is the best there is in the UCM, the long-term work brought very good results for Marvel."
"Mar 19, 2021",positive,An overrated blob of shit that I fucking love
"Mar 19, 2021",positive,"Despite the avengers looking like a bunch of people doing cosplay in the most hilarious way, this movie did a pretty good job bringing this team together, although we didn't get back stories for 2 of the avengers the movie found an amazing way to cover up its errors and make it a pretty enjoyable film, comedy and cool battle scenes, the film really delivers to the audience, so I would recommend this film, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece because the shots were plain and simple"
"Mar 16, 2021",negative,What a shitty movie this is.
"Mar 16, 2021",positive,"Yes, Iron Man started it all and we can't be thankful enough to Jon Favreau for fighting tooth and nail for RDJ. But, before The Avengers, there were five movies, interconnected, it's true, but they were still separate, nonetheless. The average box office gross of those was 460 million (not bad, but nothing compared to present day MCU standards). And crossovers were at most ideas and desires. But then this movie came out and the film industry was never the same again. It was a game changer, a milestone and arguably the most important film (not the best, just the most important) since the original Star Wars. Now everybody wants to be like Marvel. Joss Whedon hit the mother of all jackpots with this one and he proved that it is indeed possible to do something like this."
"Mar 16, 2021",positive,The Avengers (2012) is the first time we ever saw all these classic Marvel heroes assemble for the first time and it pays off in a great way. This is an instant modern classic for the superhero genre.
"Mar 15, 2021",negative,did not like this movie at all . way to boring
"Mar 13, 2021",negative,"Great to see what it built up to, but very boring movie that does not hold up."
"Mar 8, 2021",positive,"An undeniably overrated film, it is a fantastic first ensemble superhero film."
"Mar 8, 2021",positive,Only Marvel can make me cry of awesomeness! Marvel's the Avengers is one of my favorite movies! That 360 shot of the team is and always will be one of the greatest scenes in HISTORY!
"Mar 1, 2021",positive,"One of the best superhero movies of all time. It has it all: emotion, strong story, action, comedy. The team up of all these characters is epic and so well done. Very close to a near perfect movie "
"Feb 28, 2021",positive,"OMG I love this film! It's goofy, amazing comic book fun that I'm down to watch any time. Everyone in this movie is a memorable, likable character with individual traits who I would watch all day (minus Hawkeye and a few side characters). The interactions these people have are just the most amazing thing. Loki is the perfect villain for this movie, he is intimidating and cheesy at the same time. But, the best part is the action. I can only describe the action as the inner 12 year old inside you jumping up and down screaming excitedly. The story is goofy and doesn't make a whole lot of scene, but The Avengers is still a great time that perfectly sets up what's to come."
"Feb 21, 2021",positive,"Outside of Whedon's stigma, which does linger in this movie in its own ways, The Avengers is a blast of a polarizing superhero movie. It sets up Iron Man as a true hero, while also introducing what causes his ultimate struggle. The tension in the team is palpable, and the fantastic cast make it work. Loki is such a cool villain and the special effects and jokes hold up well. A fantastic movie that is still a blast, with at least one subtle ""oh s-!"" connection to a later movie that I just noticed."
"Feb 19, 2021",positive,"Decent movie, recommendable."
"Feb 18, 2021",positive,"The first outing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ensemble of super hero's sees Hawk , Black Widow , Iron Man , Hulk, Thor and Captain America work together to fight against an alien invasion led by Loki ( Thor's [adopted ] brother ) who is intent on ruling Earth. The well shot action scenes as well as quick fire wit make for a joyous viewing experience."
"Feb 14, 2021",positive,"La película que unió este universo cinematográfico, algo que no se había visto antes, un suceso total, ahora hablando de la película en sí, la trama es genial, los personajes son geniales, pero más que nada, llega para robarse el show otra vez, Loki"
"Feb 12, 2021",positive,Solid fun film. The Best CBM ever? I wouldn't go that far but it's ambitious.
"Feb 10, 2021",positive,"although I think it has some defects, I consider it a very cool film, the film has a very active rhythm that makes it easy for you to enjoy watching it several times, all the characters are developed and has a charismatic villain, and of course we have to talk that the battle in New York and the soundtrack are really cool."
"Feb 10, 2021",positive,The Avengers at first when I did watch this movie I thought it was an alright movie I did not like a lot of things that happened in it but I just rewatched it and I enjoyed a lot of it u don't get bored when u watch it pretty much all the character are great but not Loki also Loki is one of my least characters I like that Nick Fury recruited the avengers in different ways that was cool also I am not a fan of bruce banner in this movie I wish we had bruce banner from The Incredible Hulk also two negatives and I think there It is a little bit too long but after that this is one of the best MCU movies made I am not  big on the MCU but this is a good movie what they brought us in 2012 the ending is the best part of the movie So all round the villain could of been better and wish that they brought back the other bruce Banner after that this movie is great so I give The Avengers a B+
"Feb 8, 2021",positive,Solid first adventures movie- Great acting and script. 
"Feb 6, 2021",positive,Ossum film I really love it must watch this film. In this film all superheroes are joined and loki just blow their minds 3rd best marvel film
"Feb 3, 2021",positive,"""The Avengers"" is an entertaining, well acted and strongly written Marvel movie, that successfully manages to bring the avengers together as a team."
"Jan 30, 2021",positive,"I've been a fan of the superhero genre since I was a child. Superheroes fascinate me because they have superhuman abilities and they can accomplish amazing feats that a regular human can't. And what I like more than a movie with a superhero is a movie with multiple superheroes! I love team-ups. When I first saw this movie back in 2012, it blew my goddamned mind. The scale of it, the number of superheros, the CGI. I honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it. In retrospective, I was of course wrong... Fortunately.

Not only is this movie very good on its own, but the fact that there was a build-up to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better. I watched all the other movies that lead up to The Avengers. I absolutely love the cohesion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jan 23, 2021",positive,Alot of great battles thru out the film only downfall is it wasn't filmed with a 3D camera so the effects are not very polish
"Jan 23, 2021",positive,7 years later and this movie is still so much fun. It's a little slow at first but it involves a lot of the characters meeting one another but over time the movie just gets better.
"Jan 22, 2021",positive,A really good action-packed movie. Feels really good seeing the Marvel heroes crossover in the big screen. Fun and very entertaining. Superb.
"Jan 19, 2021",positive,An awesome fun movie with great action.
"Jan 16, 2021",positive,The Avengers is a masterful culmination of Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!
"Jan 14, 2021",positive,"My first ever experience watching a Marvel film and although not my cup of tea, I was pleasantly surprised. Thought the film was a lot slower than I was expecting, but had some impressive battle scenes. For me, Mark Ruffalo was the stand out performer."
"Jan 4, 2021",positive,A great first movie for the Avengers.
"Jan 2, 2021",positive,A pretty good movie that starts off slow but gets better and better.
"Jan 1, 2021",positive,"The Avengers has very little story, yet I don't think that is what it needs to make it a good film. Since it is the pinnacle of Phase One of the MCU, being their first big crossover event, the character interactions, action scenes and humor make up for the weak premise."
"Dec 31, 2020",positive,The avengers is a good movie but with this film it got slow and boring in the first act . The second act was bit wasteful until shield helicarrier  fight but the third act was good. This movie would have been the best if Disney never bought marvel and we would have gotten Wolverine and Spider-Man in the first film and the story would have been more action packed and more serious
"Dec 23, 2020",positive,os vingadores de 2012 foda açao historia  maneiro
"Dec 22, 2020",positive,"Every Character interaction is amazing, with a smart and compelling villain (as well feels threatening) helps set up for an third act that really gives every hero a moment to shine with amazing performances from everyone."
"Dec 15, 2020",positive,Now this is how to make a good crossover film. Make one solo movie and another solo movie and you make a good crossover movie.
"Dec 7, 2020",positive,The perfect blend of action and comedy establishing the characters while finding a great way to introduce them to each other. Hiddleston's Loki is fully developed and devious. The cast chemistry was on point and hard to think how the movie could've been better
"Dec 1, 2020",positive,"A classic in the MCU. Marvels: The Avengers is a perfect end to phase 1. Every actor hits in this movie and it did not feel like any time was wasted. A perfect blend between the screen time of everyone. Also, the recasting of Bruce Banner sparked a new era for the character. Mark Ruffalo IS The Hulk. A beautiful ending and a post-credit scene that sets up the rest of the MCU as we know it. The CGI of Thanos in the post-credit scene was laughable, but that's ok. Grade: 98% (A+)"
"Nov 28, 2020",positive,Very good and funny.
"Nov 19, 2020",positive,"Brilliant film to bring all the characters together, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) being my personal favourite."
"Nov 18, 2020",positive,"The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. One of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character. Taking many characters and making an emotional arc and action packed expierience on paper seems like an impossible task, but what is done here is proof for the future of the MCU that the impossible can be done."
"Nov 5, 2020",positive,"When it was released, it was the first big crossover in Marvel Studios' MCU. Gifting us a movie filled with our favorite characters, amazing action secuences and some moments that were so epic, that we still remember them now, many years later. We see a threat that will demand the world's mightiest heroes to get reunited and fight with all their strenght to protect us."
"Nov 2, 2020",positive,easily the best phase 1 MCU film and one of the best in the franchise with awesome action and is generally just awesome to see all these beloved characters team up to kick ass.
"Nov 2, 2020",positive,"The action scenes are well thought out, yet the plot seemed to familiar to most movies."
"Oct 28, 2020",positive,Marvels the avengers pays off the first build up in the MCU with a fulfilling superhero film.
"Oct 27, 2020",positive,"The origin films built up to this extremely well. This is a fantastic team-up movie in every way. It's super funny, emotional, action-filled, exhilarating. Every minute of it is worth watching. Spot-on performances from everybody involved."
"Oct 25, 2020",positive,A huge movie at the time the start of a great franchise completely epic movie and good humor
"Oct 16, 2020",positive,"This is for sure one of the best superhero movies of all time along with Superman 1978, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, Logan, Guardians of the Galaxy, Infinity War and The Winter Solider. This is a must see film for Marvel fans."
"Sep 3, 2020",positive,"Joss Whedon can go a little too far with his own self at times, but The Avengers successfully gave all of this madness a point and a path."
"Sep 3, 2020",positive,Friendship & teamwork. Only one word: AMAZING!
"Aug 31, 2020",negative,"The half star that I gave this movie is honestly very generous. I don't take pleasure in negatively reviewing movies, but I have to be honest here. I really don't like this movie. I watched it in a full theater in 2012 and thought it was good (mainly because that's what everyone was saying about it), but I've come to recognize that I really think it's quite bad. I find it to be corny, boring, goofy, poorly directed, and poorly written. On the positive side, they have a cool theme song! 0.5/5."
"Aug 31, 2020",positive,"This movie is one of the best comic book adaptations around as it follows its source material perfectly without becoming cheesy. Great special effects and awesome CGI are the definite highlights, not to take away from the all-star cast and the characters they play. Combine all of this with a gripping story and you've got one solid film."
"Aug 29, 2020",positive,"I thought this was an awesome film. I really liked this film a lot. My 2nd favorite film of 2012 (1st being ""Skyfall"")."

"Jul 13, 2020",positive,"Overrated, but still has it's moments. Good kickoff movie for the Avengers team."
"Jul 12, 2020",positive,"Without a doubt the best MCU film that’s been made, this is the making of film history. While Avengers: Endgame had more characters, and films like Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman or Frankenstein vs Dracula started the shared universe concept, this is the biggest it’s ever been. The action is amazing, the actors are great, the stakes are there, the villain is great, and the characters are great. It’s a must watch if you love the genere."
"Jul 11, 2020",positive,This movie is just so much fun. It has one of two villains in the cinematic universe that has personality at the forefront.

"Jun 27, 2020",positive,Awesome film. I really liked this film a lot. My 2nd favorite film of 2012.
"Jun 23, 2020",positive,"They landed it perfectly. Feige's integrate planning of doing this crossover film with all characters having back-stories set up in the last 4 years. Choosing Joss Whedon who crafted a balanced film for all characters to shine. Everybody thought it was a big gamble and would fail as story will be all over the place. Feige ended up inspiring all studios to create their own shared-universe.

The movie is slow at start, but it builds effective foundation for character to bond relationships - Tony&Steve relation was played so greatly that looking back it feels like nostalgic ride of their past flaws - 'Everything Special about you came from a bottle',
'You are not the type of guy for the sacrifice play, lay down on a wire, let the other guy crawl over you'

Loki returns, his set up from Thor was perfect. He did play a good villain but could have been better thinking now that he has become kind of good, his movitations of jealousy was mere for New York destruction. Head canon of mind stone damaging his attitude could work. Loki using tricks to pit the avengers against, with Banner hulking out, was great.

Mark Ruffalo did Banner perfectly. His CGI is one of the best. Banner & Hulk relation was explored a bit. Him getting recruited to study tessaract(infinity stone) as it gave of gamma radiation was perfectly tied for future Blip Snap.

At first Natasha didn't feel that much but she kicked a tonne of ass. Her relation with Barton as friends was set up good. She did not feel any less dangerous than Thor at the end.

I liked Thor the least, yeah he was brother to main but he didn't add that much to the table. Taika & Russu did him much better cuz Hemsworth got to be himself.

The hour long action is great for fan service and assemble scene gives me goosebumbs time to time. For action fans this is great but I am more a fan of 'dialogue between actions'. Actions make this movie highly rewatchable as it has comedy spinkled away

Samual L Jackson nailed Nick Fury, Coulson's death was good for movitations. Acting wise, all got the job done, nothing special.

Comedy is much less in these movies than future but they do crack me up time to time, Puny God, We have a Hulk, Shawarma, Tony is god of giving nicknames.

Tony's character arc was good but future has much more for his character to evolve to. Thanos at the post credit scene was a great set up. 

A great entertainment some people, for me these are more than blockbuster movies, these have heart, great characters with storylines spending much more then 1 movie. Inherently rewatchable cuz I am a nerrrd."
"Jun 19, 2020",positive,"The big one they have been building up to. The visuals are great. The villains are good. All the performances are great. The Cap gives a better performance here then he does in his first film. The emotion is there with the death of SHIELD agent Colston. And the music is good. Some fantastic one liners and it's fairly memeable. This is pure Marvel through and through. 

""Now would be a good time to get angry."" 

Banner:  That's my secret Cap... I'm always angry."""
"Jun 17, 2020",positive,"Marvel's: The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, started a revolution for the superhero genre, being one of the most influential superhero films of all time! This is the first time we were able to see all of our favorite heroes in one film, fighting for the same goal, and it paid off tremendously, making 1.5 billion dollars at the box office! Whedon is one of the best directors the MCU has on the payroll, due to his understanding of what the MCU is about, while using his knowledge, and the films before to his advantage.

The plot is pretty straight forward, while allowing for many notable character moments. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, which works because there is quite a bit of cheese riddled through some of these scenes and pieces of dialogue, but Whedon still managed to create a fun, and cohesive narrative. The Avengers broke some barriers that the MCU has set in the past, by adding a few dark and grittier moments, but still managed to keep a steady tone, with a pace that's all gas and no brakes. The only thing that Whedon could've done, is give the team some type of vulnerability, so the stakes are higher, but other than that, this was a great showing of what the MCU is all about!

This is probably one of my favorite character based films! There is just so much talent on screen at all times, while equally sharing the spotlight. Every one of these top notch actors came to set, ready to play ball! Each character was fleshed & balanced out nicely, while everyone's emotional connection was well understood, while having great chemistry amongst one another. Robert Downey Jr. was of course, great in this film! Even though he's transforming into a team player, instead of a lone wolf, he still possessed that snarky, witty, and humorous charisma that everyone has come to love. His banter with Captain America is surprisingly a good twist, because of how genuine the dialogue and emotions feel as they deliver their lines. You can't help but admire Chris Evans as Captain America. If his performance in The First Avenger wasn't enough, he absolutely puts all of his doubters to rest with his performance here! Cap steps in as the leader of the group, while the writers added such a likable style to his character, by making him oblivious to the new age, and his subtle humor at times. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, and he is so much more likable this time around! He adds this sense of dominance in every scene he's in, while also having tremendous chemistry with everyone on set. We have to talk about the biggest stand out of this film, and that is the new comer, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Incredible Hulk. Ruffalo's take on the characters was a true breath of fresh air, undoubtedly being the best portrayal yet! He brings this charm and wit to the character, while also giving him some vulnerabilities, that the other Hulk's never had. Ruffalo is such a talented actor, with great depth and range, making a massive statement as to why he belongs in the MCU. With not knowing much about Black Widow, I wasn't too sure on how she was going to size up with the rest of the Avengers, but Scarlett Johansson puts on a great performance as Natasha Romanoff, having more to do than usual. She isn't afraid to get her hands dirty when it comes to the action, while also having a great mind for the team. We finally get more on Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and it's safe to say that he isn't really the most interesting out of the bunch. He has a few good individual character moments, and a few good scenes with Johansson, but he just doesn't fulfill that Avenger feel. Sam Jackson thrives as usual, having more to do, while having a bigger impact on the outcome. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, returns as our main antagonist, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in, bringing this mischievous persona, mixed with some deep emotions and sophistication! Loki poses a real threat, with a true motive, unlike every other villain we've seen already. The Chitari is fine for what they are, but they're nothing that memorable.

The screenplay by Joss Whedon (not Zak Penn) was the best yet! It had it's silly moments, but it was mainly filled with consistent humor and wit, with deep, emotional dialogues, that helped build all of our characters tremendously. Whedon added this amazing banter between all of the characters, that felt as genuine as can be.

The action through phase one was fine, but it wasn't really anything spectacular, but The Avengers wanted to go out with an ABSOLUTE BANG! From the middle of the second act and on, everything was so high octane, having memorable action sequences, backed up with one of the most well know scores by Alan Silvestri. 

Overall, Marvel's: The Avengers is one of my favorite movies of all time, let alone of the MCU! With all of these characters being fleshed out more, with great writting, and story telling, The Avengers made a huge impact on what's to come for the saga, and super hero films in general."
"Jun 14, 2020",positive,"Rewatching this movie I discovered foreshadowed heart and humor I had never noticed before, this was a turning point in the MCU for a reason. -Izzy Meth"
"Jun 10, 2020",positive,One of the best movies Marvel has ever done
"Jun 8, 2020",positive,"""The Avengers"" is one of the best MCU films. Managing to give protagonism to all the characters of the team and have epic scenes throughout the film that could not compare to annithing seen so far in this universe. With a soundtrack that makes the film even better, it manages to give importance even to secondary characters such as Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), not to mencion that it has one of the best villains that the MCU has ever scene."
"Jun 7, 2020",positive,Funny. Good action sequences. 
"Jun 4, 2020",positive,I love it. The first Avengers movie is also one of the best. Loki was the perfect villain for this movie. It is so fun to see the Avengers meet each other. The dynamic works. Their chemistry works really well too. Nick Fury was really good in this movie too. What a great start to superhero team up film.
"Jun 2, 2020",positive,"This movie is a masterpiece. This is Marvel fulfilling their vision of a shared universe. Joss Whedon brings all these heroes together in the most satisfying way possible. Whedon is an amazing director, and this movie alone proves it. This was no easy task. Many other studios have tried to copy this like the Dark Universe, or the DCEU. Even though this is a movie combining superheroes from 4 different franchises, how many movies do you really have to watch before watching the Avengers? The answer is: 0. The Avengers does such a great job on its own establishing these characters. It is also one of the most enjoyable movies. The witty banter between the Avengers works so well. Whedon does a great job of presenting the theme of how people are stronger together. This movie perfectly demonstrates how being a team is more than just a bunch of people that are always giving each other nonsense, its about willing to put your differences aside to work together. Loki is one of the best villains in the MCU. The final battle is amazing, with so many cool moments, especially when the Avengers Assemble for the first time to fight against the Chitauri. This is a blast to watch and never fails to entertain. The Avengers is truly a classic."
"Jun 2, 2020",positive,"The anticipation for this film was huge, and it toatally lived up to the hype. The action is intense and no character is forgotten or left out, each gets their own moment to shine, and Loki returning as the villan is even better and menacing than he was in the first Thor film and delving deeper in to Infinity Stone storyline. With iconic shots and tons of eye candy, The Avengers welcomes the next phase to the MCU, giving Phase 1 the ending it truly deserved."
"Jun 2, 2020",positive,Better than Captain America: Winter Soldier. A+
"May 30, 2020",positive,This was an amazing culmination to the anticipation of this amazing idea that started with the bombastic Iron Man movie.  This was everything I could have hoped for as a kid growing up reading comics.  Josh Whedon is on fire here not only meshing the heroes together but infusing great comedic moments to add levity to the action.  And the action moments created seemed to be ripped from the pages of those comics I grew up reading.  A fun movie our family has watched multiple times since sitting in that theater as a 43 year old but grinning and laughing like i was 12.
"May 27, 2020",positive,"A great expansion, the visual effects on the final battle are incredible, they never leave to surprise me"
"May 25, 2020",positive,Visually great of course and some great acting and characters...Not my favourite avengers movie for the simple fact that for me Loki is the worst villain in the franchise...dont get me wrong he is played well in the film...I just dont like him LOL
"May 24, 2020",positive,"This is a fun superhero film. It has great acting, dialogue, and effects, all of which are essentials for a superhero blockbuster. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and others all have great performances as various heroes and villains. Hiddleston's Loki is a great villain who doesn't overpower his opposition with brute strength, but with his wit. The script humanizes these characters and makes them all the more relatable to the viewers. The added moments of humor are a welcomed addition to an otherwise serious story. The set designs, whether CGI or practical, look great and help transport us into the heroes' world. This movie's action and spectacle are amazing. The fighting is well choreographed and often enhanced by context. This is not just a superhero film focused on big action, it has a lot of substance to it as well. Director Joss Whedon was able to craft a great comic book adaptation. Overall, I give this film an 8.5/10."
"May 24, 2020",positive,A nerd's dream come true.
"May 19, 2020",positive,this film really structuring the MCU does it extremely well IMO because of this film being the first ensemble film besides X men is so much fun 9.4/10
"May 18, 2020",positive,"Assemble! Putting together the complete might of the current characters and one of the best villains (Hemsworth), weadon shows us just how powerful these movies were going to become."
"May 18, 2020",positive,An amazing way to bring all of these heroes together. It is a really risky idea that in my opinion totally works.
"May 17, 2020",positive,"The Avengers defined the true beginnings of what we now call the MCU. This was the first film in this juggernaut universe that launched the 'nerd comic-book understanding genre' and successfully applied and propelled that philosophy and transversed upon and thereby assemalated the rest of most all of the normal movie-going audiences going forward. In this age, we are now all nerds. Joss whedon did an unprecedented job and the chemistry among the characters is some of the finest there is and set the tone and standard for what the MCU would be moving forward. It isn't a perfect movie. It has its issues, but it ultimately worked and broke boundaries in its wake-"
"May 7, 2020",positive,Pretty good but not great movie. Cool to see all the big name actors on screen with each other for the first time. Took a while for the movie to get going. 
"May 7, 2020",positive,"I still love watching this one to this day. It may not be as flashy as some of the other MCU movies but it was unreal to see these six on the big screen for the first time. No one knew if this could be possible. Having this many superheroes in one film. Loki is at his best in this one. I kind of miss the old, Avenger days."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"‪The visual effects aged horribly. That being said, still a textbook example of how to do crossovers right.‬"
"May 5, 2020",positive,"It was very interesting watching this movie again after seeing the conclusion to the MCU. Compared to the concluding films of the franchise, Avengers feels like it is cobbled together. A lot of the dialogue felt stilted this time around and very unnatural. I still really love this movie and it brought back a lot of nostalgia, but it isn't as good as I remember it being."
"May 1, 2020",positive,a excellent start to the mcu. the movie is an action packed movie that makes people love these movies.
"Apr 29, 2020",positive,Lived up to the hype!
"Apr 28, 2020",positive,Um dos melhores filmes de herói de todos os tempos.
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,A big over-the-top heroes uniting with explosions made realistic with characters with their unique but understandable individual struggles and reluctances.
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,"This is the first live-action movie where we've seen a group of Super Heroes band together to save the world. I saw it in theaters and knew this movie was revolutionary. We hadn't seen anything like it. Looking back on it now, the plot just kind of revolves around the heroes getting together, but regardless, it's a fun time. Sure it doesn't hold up as well as many people remember, but it's still a good movie. Not to mention, it was just the end of Phase 1 and the beginning of Phase 2."
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,"This is undoubtedly the best first team up movie in superhero movies. Only one of its sequels was better than it. It is amazingly well done with the action and comedy and breathtaking suspense. If I had to review this movie in five words, it would be I absolutely loved this movie."
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,"Solid with a capital S.  Definitely not my favorite of the MCU films, but it's up there."
"Apr 23, 2020",positive,"This movie is one of the best superhero  movie ever . It was such an amazing movie that got people excited to go see marvel films because of the first avenger film . It is action packed , amazing and fun this movie was.  but sometimes this film can feel a little bit slow and boring sometimes but over wall just a great movie it is."
"Apr 20, 2020",positive,"One of the best movies I've ever watched it had a great storyline and I just love how Marvel brought Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye together I'd give it 100%"
"Apr 20, 2020",positive,"Uma das melhores junções de heróis já feitas, com momentos épicos e uma atmosfera única.

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos.

Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver. A OST é marcante e funcional. Emociona e representa muito bem a equipe. Os efeitos especiais são excelentes para a época e convencem muito bem."
"Apr 16, 2020",positive,"The mcu really starts with a compelling narrative, stunning action sequences, character development, and anticipation for future mcu movies."
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,One of the top superhero movies with some good acting

"Apr 9, 2020",positive,This is a movie I saw years ago (2012) and still never forgotten about it.

"Apr 8, 2020",positive,yeah it is good but I belive endgame is better
"Apr 8, 2020",positive,"It is a film in which the SHIELD agency decided to recruit a team to save the world from an enemy capable of destroy everything.

"Apr 5, 2020",positive,"One of my favorite movies, it has launched one of the greatest franchises of all time. I find myself watching it every so often."
"Apr 2, 2020",positive,"This movie perfectly puts 4 franchises(Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America) into 1. Black Widow is awesome in this movie. The best thing about this movie is the action scenes that will blow you away."
"Mar 27, 2020",positive,While sometimes the dialogue can get a bet corny this film is incredible.
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"Can marvel make anything original? Marvel can't even come up with their own name. Stop riding DC's dick and make your own characters. Utter garbage. Captain America is Wonder Woman, Spiderman is Superman, Ironman is Batman, Hawkeye and Blackwidow is Green Arrow and Black Canary. Etc"
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"Now, what makes this movie the best film of the 2010s. Here's my list: Good acting, Josh Whedon's direction, amazing screenplay, good one-liners and some unique humor. I have nothing but awesome things to say about this movie. In fact, this movie helped expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the introduction of the aliens to Thanos himself. Overall, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the best movies of all time."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"The Avengers is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. The way it handled having all these different superheroes banding together against one villain, was honestly perfect."
"Mar 18, 2020",neutral,Memorable first assemble of the Marvel superheroes is powered by enthralling set-pieces but drags a little in the third act.
"Mar 16, 2020",positive,"Finally saw this movie! This one I definitely love the fighting scenes. First one, Captain America and Iron Man fighting with Loki. Second, Thor fighting with Iron Man and then Captain America. Third, Hulk fighting with Thor since Bruce couldn't control his power. And lastly, my favorite scene of all, Avengers fighting with the Chitauris. Not sure if they were called that. My favorite scene that made me laugh was when Hulk grabbed Loki and smashed him and called him ""puny god"". REALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS!!! THIS IS JUST AWESOME AND FUNNY!!!"
"Mar 13, 2020",positive,The base for the future glory.
"Mar 10, 2020",negative,I didn't like how almost all the characters just argued until the last third and then suddenly got along? It also bored me through most of it and the costumes weren't the best.
"Mar 8, 2020",positive,The thing that I hate about this movie is Captain America suit it sucks
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,"The Avengers is the culmination of everything the MCU has been leading up to. It's full of the action, humour, and just about anything that fans will certainly enjoy."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,I still think this is a better movie than Avengers ENdgame.
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,This is how you make a superhero team up movie. There is action and there is humor too (with wonderful one-liners) and there is a villain the audience knows and there are characters the audience cares about (and each of them has an important part in the storyline!). The final battle is visually great and the after-credits Shawarma scene is pure joy. :)
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"The first Avengers movie has steadily hold down the #3 spot on my MCU rank and after watching it again for the first time in a long time, that remains unchanged."
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,This is an amazing movie and was truly the first of it's kind (live action)
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"After introducing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye, Avengers Assemble features all of them in this thrilling blockbuster. The first large scale superhero team up movie, you can be sure that this cinema flick is packed with action, an interesting narrative and the forces of good vs the forces of evil."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"This is a top 5 movie on nearly everybody's list and for good reason too. The character chemistry is fantastic, it gives us one of the best third acts of a film ever and Loki is an absolutely fantastic villain."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,A very great movie. The team moments are the best.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,This is the best superhero film ever put together. The way they tied all the characters in this film up to this point is excellent. From start to finish just awesome
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,When this came out in 2012 I thought my expectations were so high that they could not be met but they ended up being surpassed. Forever a top 3 MCU movie 
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"Avengers is just a great, fun and amazing movie."
"Feb 7, 2020",neutral,"History will remember Avengers, but not because it's a good movie. It'll remember it because it was an incredibly ambitious one, succesfully managing to serialize cinema, make stand-alone flicks connect and form bigger stories. That's something worth applauding. What's not worth applauding is the movie's plot, for sure, which could be summarized in one sentence: ""a bunch of heroes team up to defeat a bunch of CGI aliens trying to take over the world""."
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"By making this, you take away from the individuality values of each super hero. As, beloved as this movie is, I put it in the fail colomn. I must prefer the stand alone films to the avenger films."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Really liked a lot of great story buliding
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,This doesn't feel as rushed or CGI filled as the more current Marvel cinematic universe titles.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"+ For better and worse looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Some really nice overall cinematography, even small scenes or FX heavy scenes look good. Even if it sets the series on a path of a fairly plain visual tone.
+ Also for better and worse has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon which means it's convoluted and painfully simple at the same time.
+ Effects still hold up. Particularly Iron Man.
+ The way the title card comes in is a stroke of genius.
+ Ruffalo plays a pleasant to watch, snarky, smarmy smart guy who's so angry that he's a dick to everyone. It's a good choice even if he's a bit wrong for the role.
+ Powers booth!
+ Effortless and pleasurable connective tissue in the opening recruitment scenes.
+ Cool de-suiting at stark towers.
+ Stark with Potts is a good combination, great chemistry and I want to see more.
+Coulson nerding out is funny still.
+ There is a plethora of excellent dialogue and refreshing takes on the tropes.
+ All the super fights are excellently choreographed slices of comic book action. No battle fatigue, inventive etc., even in the third act.
+ ""He's adopted?""
+ Science bros.
+ Dialogue really flows well, feels organic, important and full of character layers. The repartee particularly between Tony and Cap feels tense and equal and riveting at times.
+ Good use of aspect ratio. Appropriate.
+ Having to explain the nerd stuff to someone who enjoys it anyway means it hits both ways.
+ Much better than I remember. It has aged well.
+ Good closing shot. 

- Gift and curse of Whedon's dialogue is that sometimes it's brilliant and sometimes it's awfully cringeworthy.
- Some wonky or hacky directing.
- Sort of lame opening chunks before the team assembling.
- I just don't like Sam Jackson unless he's playing Sam Jackson. Here he's not. He's playing sneaky, grumpy Mace Windu in an eyepatch.
- Faceless, generic, blue-blooded fodder enemies.
- Quintessential sky-beam blockbuster third act. 

Early Post-Credits sequence review: 2/5: Thanos' reveal. Christ, I remember not knowing anything about this guy at the time. He looks ropey and doesn't say anything. Hard to love. Hard not to appreciate how much it changed things. 

Actual Post-Credits sequence review: 5/5: Shawarma. Now that's funny. Everone's so knackered, accomplished a great mission together. We've all been there. A good callback. Nonsense, but charming, and I love it. 

Stan Lee as: Old Man that doesn't believe superheroes are in New York. 5/5: Another perfect cameo, slotted in there well amongst newsreel and although it breaks the fourth wall a lot, it's a cheeky one delivered at the right time, the calm after the storm."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Another great film in the MCU
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Nothing anyone hasn't said already- just watch it. You won't regret it.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"3rd best MCU film. Still better than Endgame tbh.

"Jan 26, 2020",positive,This movie is very fun.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Incredible, just seeing them all together is a dream come true. "
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"This superhero movie is one of my all time favorites. It's full of action, comedy, and drama. The entire cast and crew did a fantastic job in making this movie. Everyone that starred in this movie were the right people for the characters they played. The story was well laid out and was very interesting. Whether you're a superhero fan or not you will love this movie. It'll blow you away and make you laugh. This is a definite must-see."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Avengers 1 is an overrated theme park. Theme park is a phrase which means the filmmakers focused more on special effects rather than story, and it made the movie boring and bad. The opening scenes were horrible and were weird. You couldn't understand anything going on. It just happened and it was confusing. Only people who read the comics would understand what happened. Thats not very good if you are trying to get non comic book readers into the superhero genre. The acting was bad except for Iron Man, Thor, and Loki. Chris Evans showed no emotion, Mark Ruffalo played Bruce Banner like an arrogant stressed out idiot, Scarlett Johannson didn't have emotion, and Jeremy Renner played Hawkeye where Hawkeye is very lame. However, Robert Downey Jr. did so good with Iron Man, and I can say the same with Hemsworth and Hiddleston with their roles. The movie was boring, the acting was mediocre, and it was an overrated theme park of a movie."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Another great marvel movie. Just amazing. Really good to see all the avengers together
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"When it came out it was awesome, now compared with the new movies it feels a bit too linear and trivial. Still it's a very important movie for the franchise and a really ambitious and well crafted project that comes to a first end. If you enjoyed the first phase movies sure you will enjoy this one more."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Though a bit corny and flashy, the character interactions, action, and plot all make it incredibly enjoyable."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The best best up movie that it's time
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"With horrible dialogue, shitty visuals, over the top goofiness and terrible detection marvel delivers one of the best MCU movies saved by the amazing acting and an engaging story, 9/10."
"Jan 3, 2020",positive,This movie is great. Absolute see for you
"Jan 1, 2020",negative,"If most people were honest with their friends and family, and themselves when discussing this movie they would have to admit: the movie overrated. And it was"
"Dec 31, 2019",positive,Its a great conclusion to Phase 1 by having 4 popular superheroes in a crossover Marvel movie.
"Dec 30, 2019",positive,"This is one of the best-made MCU films, it took 4 characters who all had introductory movies before, and 2 relatively unknown characters and put them all together in this epic team-up action movie, and Joss Whedon executed this to perfection. I am seriously surprised by how good this movie ended up being, it is funny, the action is amazing, the characters get great development and the script was perfect. This 6 superstar Hollywood actors work so well together and play off of each other as best as they possibly could have, the chemistry is real and you can feel that through the magnificent performances. Mark Ruffalo was amazing as the Hulk and he brought the quiet and shy supergenius persona that compliments the Hulk, he was a very good casting for this film. Robert Downey Jr. is just as good as ever, you really feel the struggle within him starting to pull the team apart and he feels like something should be done and he takes charge of re-uniting the superheroes, I was very pleased with his character in this movie. Chris Evans is very quiet until the third act when he organizes the team and kicks some butt with them, he is so very good in the serious roles that he takes and I loved him in this film as well. Jeremy Renner was underutilized way too much, he is mind-controlled for the first two acts and he does'nt get to do much until the epic final battle, but he gave a decent performance and his relationship with Black Widow was very intriguing, I think that they have a great history that is worth exploring. Speaking of which, Scarlett Johansson really made had her breakout role in this film, she is perfect as Black Widow and is a very strong female role model, I enjoyed her contributions to this film even if though both Hawkeye and she were both not used as much as they could have been. Chris Hemsworth is a very good actor and he never gets enough credit for what he does, but starting with this film, his character starts to get really uninteresting and unbearably dull, his character does things that really don't matter, and they're boring to watch, but this film was only the start of his downfall, he is still pretty good. Samuel L. Jackson was surprisingly very good, his character actually did things that he just talked about before, it was great to see how respected and talented he really is, and Nick Fury has many layers that are discovered quite a bit, I loved his character development in this film. Tom Hiddleston is incredible, he is truly evil and wants to see the world burn, you get to see him setting up and executing his evil plan and you get to see how mad and delusional he really is, but he also can toy with peoples emotions like nobody business which was really investing to watch. Agent Coulsen is a great character and his sacrifice was exactly what the Avengers need as motivation to fight, it was perfect and Clark Gregg was very good. I loved seeing Stellan Skarsgard back from Thor, he is a great actor who I would like to see again in the MCU. All of the action is amazing to watch and it is all very entertaining, I loved seeing Thor and Hulk kick ass together, almost a premonition of their relationship in Ragnarok. This movie never drags, it is constantly throwing new problems at you and it is fun to watch these superheroes learn to work together and save the day, the script was excellent really gave every character depth, I sincerely love what this film did for these characters and how this battle of New York would be a crucial building block for all of these characters futures. I love this film and watch it a lot, it doesn't get boring and the script and character development were close to flawless, this is truly the peak of team-up movies and makes me excited about the future of the MCU."
"Dec 30, 2019",positive,Phenomenal film 10/10. That is how you do a team-up movie. I love the chemistry with all the characters. it was slow at first to build up the team up but it was amazing. The action scenes are epic. Very fun to watch.
"Dec 29, 2019",positive,"i like it, it's good"
"Dec 24, 2019",positive,Wow what a superheroic team up movie really this movie created a new history
"Dec 22, 2019",positive,Action packed family fun film!!!
"Dec 21, 2019",positive,This movie was amazing. Just like other people I didn't expect this movie to work but it did and it was an amazing few hours
"Dec 21, 2019",positive,"Finally the MCU culminated into one movie. While campy at times, it was undoubtedly fun and enjoyable in the theatre and still holds up today."
"Dec 20, 2019",positive,"A revolutionary superhero film that has never been done this way. Great action, great villain, and a great cast. One of the top movies of all time in my archives, easily!"
"Dec 20, 2019",positive,I still get chills when the titular theme plays as the heroes band together for the final battle. It's an epic movie and if you haven't seen it you absolutely should. (A+)
"Dec 19, 2019",positive,"Great movie! finally brings our favorites together for a great action spectacle with thrills, chills, drama, action, heart and powerful story arcs! This was an accomplishment in the cinema."
"Dec 19, 2019",positive,"The Avengers..
Men Amazing movie Sets the Bar for the mcu
I love how they connected all the Characters together for a big showdown
I really liked the Music in this one
Its Filled with Action
And its a must see for Sure"
"Dec 19, 2019",positive,"The film that launched the MCU into the stratosphere. With fantastic balancing and equal story beats for previously built open well rounded characters.
This spectacle is tightly balanced with moments of levity intwined with awesome battle sequences. Amazing performances and a perfectly balanced story made this film revolutionary."
"Dec 18, 2019",negative,"In my opinion after their friend and ally is murdered by the villian, heroes simply do not go on to deliver extendeddddd playful beat em up scenes for the big baddie and his army of nerdowells who are in the midst of committing genocide.   It is not how storytelling works unless you're going for that Deadpoolesc style take.  

This film was essentially just close ups of every hero as they crack the lamest! one liners since Batman and Robin and smirk into the camera.  Between these close ups we are treated to slapstick comedy faceplants or bro on bro punches between the ""rage filled"" monster companion(the most embarrassing take on the hulk to date) and the god of thunder...... lame.

For the finale the alien army is just straight up insta killed in a single explosion for some reason.  The director/writers never bother to explain how this is even possible or to show the heroes working out a way it could be achieved, in fact they had no idea themselves.  There is no established link between the aliens and some sort of hive mind or central control hub or entity who is connected to them all delivering commands.  No just stark grabs a missle the government shot at New York(despite the portal being in the sky above it) and happens to fly it through the portal and it, by sheer luck, manages to hit a ship we haven't even seen before and BAM!!! planetary scale invasion immediately ended.   Coolcoolcoolcoolcool lets hope no one questions it.  I guess who needs narrative when thor can faceplant a window right xD


Next the mass murderer who stabbed their mate to death in the previous scene is comically interrupted mid temper tantrum(after all his entire motivations for being a villian in the first place is a temper tantrum with his adopted daddy who gave him a better life than he could ever of had otherwise) by the funny ""rage monster"" who leaves him in a ditch and cracks a lame one liner as he strolls off screen""pwunnnwy gwd"" :/.   The camera then zooms in for a close up of the big baddie who in turn, comically sighs with a bemused expression on his face and the heroes grab a quick bite to eat in a nearby half destroyed restaurant.......   if this wasn't the most angsty/edgy villian i have ever seen i dont know what is.


The franchise completely lacks the understanding of how to balance comedy with tragedy and shows no sign of improvement as it continues.  Storytelling takes a back seat to flashy action scenes and poorly timed one liners.  Romance and/or family relationships are barely more than an afterthought, if they are mentioned at all.   It all cumulates in a lack luster movie with 0 emotional developments or story points, disappointing narrative plot holes and an anticlimactic finale.  The characters have to be the most gimmicky collection of 2 dimensional heroes on the big screen in decades.  If it wasn't for their hammer or robot suit or fancy shield you wouldn't be able to tell one character from the other.

Overrated doesn't cut it for this movie how it crossed a billion dollars is, i don't know, the lamest miracle ever? hah"
"Dec 18, 2019",positive,Avengers Assemble? Yes sir.
"Dec 17, 2019",positive,"It was amazing seeing The Avengers team up for the first time in 2012, The whole thing is EPIC and started My Favorite Franchise of all time. It has amazing character development like all of the MCU, And The amazing Battle of New York."
"Dec 10, 2019",positive,"Count on the Avengers to make man-tights and capes look more fashionable than ever! With incredible fight choreography, it's hard not to be impressed."
"Dec 10, 2019",positive,The incredible mix of superheroes together with their personalities and powers is a guarantee to impress any sort of audience.
"Dec 10, 2019",positive,"If you're a comic book fan like me, you'd understand that usually, superhero storylines adapt a more straight, serious tone, but with the Avengers you have the great storyline of a superhero film and the comedic relief of banter."
"Dec 10, 2019",positive,I appreciate how they made sure to introduce each character before bringing them together for an epic fight to defend the Earth. It gives much more depth to each superhero.
"Dec 10, 2019",positive,Marvel really outdid themselves on this one. This is one of their greatest works to date and only a handful of films can compare to this one - and all of them have mostly been Marvel too!
"Dec 9, 2019",positive,"The title says it all, you will really MARVEL at the awesomeness of this film. Where else can you find a film with more superheroes than you can imagine working together to save the Earth?"
"Dec 9, 2019",positive,I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best superhero film of all time!
"Dec 9, 2019",positive,"I gotta admit I was not ready for all that shaky-cam action. I mean, you could clearly see that the choreography for the fight scenes was good enough for a superhero movie, but why did you have to add so much shaking and cutscenes?"
"Dec 9, 2019",positive,I appreciate how they made sure to introduce each character before bringing them together for an epic fight to defend the Earth. It gives much more depth to each superhero.
"Dec 9, 2019",positive,It was a great idea to bring together this group of amazing superheroes and at the same time amazing actors to create a top-class superhero film.
"Dec 1, 2019",positive,"Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye cooperate to defeat the forces of evil in this mightiest movie of 2012! It deserves an A+!"
"Nov 26, 2019",positive,"When you have an amazing team of actors with great chemistry both on and off-screen, a team of directors who are passionate about what they do, and a production crew that's always coming up with new ways to reinvent the superhero genre, then you'll get a successful film like this."
"Nov 26, 2019",positive,"It takes more than just great actors to make a successful film, so for the people behind the curtains making everything even more awesome, I want to give my thanks for providing us with this masterpiece of a film!"
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,"Awesome superheroes and excellent script as well. For an action-adventure film, the script was extremely detailed and that's what appealed to me the most."
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,This is not a good movie... It's a GREAT MOVIE! Filmmakers did an awesome job taking the storyline from the comic books and making sure that most of it were kept.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,Stan Lee cameos are the best! It's too bad he won't be around to do that now. It was one of the things I look forward to in each of the Marvel movies
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,The best thing about this movie is that it gave each superhero their own unique way of contributing to the team. It wasn't just another film wherein there's one superhero that stands out among the rest while the rest got overshadowed by this main character.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,"More than just a superhero film, this movie had a definite soul and smart plot as well. It's a guarantee that superhero fans will love it but at the same time, common moviegoers will find it entertaining too."
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,Are you a fan of epic adventure movies? Then this is your dream come true! Truly this is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's executed perfectly. Props to the filmmakers for taking the time to design it to be more than just a superhero film packed with action scenes and adding depth to each character.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,Good fighting sequences but fight sequences felt too crazy and made it quite difficult to fully enjoy the great choreography.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,Kudos to the fight choreographers who designed all the action sequences for this movie. They really did a good one!
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,"If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. This is one of the movies that need to be savored."
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,The cast really delivered. Sure they were playing the roles of superheroes but you can really see and feel a deeper level of emotions in their performance.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,One of the many things I loved in this film was the conflict between Iron Man and Captain America for leadership and how the two differ in their approach. A veryunique way of building a team of superheroes.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,One word for this movie: AWESOME. It's an amazing film and has everything a superhero fanboy hoped for and more.
"Nov 25, 2019",positive,I tried my best to avoid getting carried away by the hype of this movie because nowadays most of the movies that are too much hyped end up just being disappointments but I'm glad to say that I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED when this came out.
"Nov 25, 2019",negative,"Wow, Coppola and Scorsese were right."
"Nov 20, 2019",positive,absolutely bonkers fun superhero action comedy. And a very good villain. kudos to Marvel.
"Nov 16, 2019",positive,"I loved this movie! I didn't like Phase 1 that much, but this movie was a great way to end off Phase 1."
"Nov 8, 2019",positive,"When you have a bunch of flashy superheroes fighting supernatural, extraterrestrial villains from another dimension, it can get pretty hard to highlight each of their strengths,  but Marvel pulled it off with this one!"
"Nov 8, 2019",positive,Wonderful movie to watch if you want to be entertained and not think about the plot too much.
"Nov 7, 2019",positive,It's clichéd and we love it.
"Nov 7, 2019",positive,Perfect casting! You can really see and feel that the actors have great chemistry both in and out of their characters.
"Nov 7, 2019",positive,I found it creative of Marvel to introduce each character one by one. It really set the tone and had me looking forward to what's gonna happen.
"Nov 7, 2019",positive,"Definitely the greatest superhero movie of all time. Marvel has set the bar high with this one and so far, they're doing a good job of keeping up with that despite not being able to raise it higher!"
"Nov 6, 2019",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers delivers the purest form of entertainment ever put in a movie, and succeeds at making all of our heroes share the screen in a coherent way.  It truly is a revolutionary outing from Joss Whedon that ignited a new era of crossover comic-book movies."
"Nov 6, 2019",positive,"The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes. I love how each of the actors and actresses has portrayed each of the roles they were given."
"Nov 5, 2019",positive,"This movie it's literally a masterpiece, it showed the world that the Avengers are really awesome!!!"
"Oct 23, 2019",negative,How many movies did it take to come up with this mundane plot ?
"Oct 23, 2019",positive,#Avengers with the Best of 'Em All #IronMan #TonyStark What More Needs To Be Said.. The Dopest Fliest MF'r there is & The Rest of Marvel Avengers.
"Oct 22, 2019",positive,"The Avengers had changed the way that superhero ensemble films are made, with a great script from Joss Whedon including his famous quips and also his direction, he knew how he wanted to make the characters stand out. Of course the stand out performance is Robert Downey Jr. (as he is in all MCU films) the only main issue I have with this film is that is does start of slow, which might turn people away, however if your stick with it towards the end, then you get a epic 3rd act, which  at the time was the greatest on screen. So with it being full of action, humour, great superhero set pieces, the Avenegrs is a must see for all superhero fans... you will be converted when you see the greatest group shot along with the music still remains the best ever..... One of the best superhero films ever made off course."
"Oct 22, 2019",negative,If I had my hands on this movie it would of been excelsior.
"Oct 20, 2019",positive,"Great movie, great storyline with awesome action"
"Oct 18, 2019",positive,"Its... okay. The loki thing was a bit un needed. I understand how hard finding another enemy for the avengers to fight thats not thanos is, but there could have been a better villan."
"Oct 13, 2019",positive,Fantastic start to an amazing series. Love every one of them
"Oct 13, 2019",positive,Perfect start to an amazing series. 
"Oct 9, 2019",positive,Dictionary of a team-up movie.
"Oct 8, 2019",positive,Es muy entretenida y se puede disfrutar para toda la familia pero hay veces que la trama si aburre.
"Oct 8, 2019",positive,After years of solo hero movies we finally have the avengers come together to defeat lokey. Amazing to finally see all of our heroes teaming up. And see the direction the MCU is heading in (infinity gauntlet). All in all a great movie with great action. And decent CGI.
"Oct 8, 2019",positive,"Everyone is saying that and game is the better movie but it's like not even that good.  I mean it's a good sequel but not a good movie. There so many reasons why end game is not good. 1st of all why didn't  Tony just use the eather or reality stone to just cut all the chitari and thanos in half  and why don't they just use the time stone to go back before black widow died and just save her.  But with this movie it's  pure and everything is important they didn't and they couldn't add nothing could of been cut out. Also Robert Downey Jr. Is way better in this movie than he isn't endgame. Loki is also a really good villain he all like shakespearean and of like he talks in metaphors. Like  when Nick fury is like trying to steal the  tesseract and he and Loki have a conversation and when Loki says, "" I will make a world free"" then Nick says, "" free from what?""  ""free of freedom, freedom is the one lie we tell ourselves and once we accept that then you will truly be free."" that I the Nick's like,""We have no quarrel with your people"" he says an ant has no quarrel with a boot,""  "" do you plan on stepping on us?"" And the part where iron man thor and captain America are fighting is just so cool and Thor strikes cap's sheild and the forest basiclly explodes, just go watch the scene it's amazing. Snd also watch the movie."
"Oct 7, 2019",positive,"This film definitely lives up to the hype. The writing shows improvement since previous Marvel Studios films, making the dialogue purposeful and the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy. The choreography in the fight scenes is perfect, with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers. The CGI and visual effects are incredible, speaking of which, the Hulk's character model is improved as well, making him more realistic looking and actually resembling Mark Ruffalo, who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of Bruce Banner. Thor and Captain America seem to fit better as side characters in this film, and the interactions between them and Iron Man are full of chemistry. Robert Downey Jr. is on point as usual. Black Widow's character is improved, with Scarlett Johansson showing some emotional depth. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister. This film raised the bar for what Marvel Studios is capable of."
"Oct 7, 2019",positive,Excellently done movie
"Oct 6, 2019",positive,It was pretty good. You don’t go in expecting much and just some dumb action but then the plot is surprisingly well done. The action is good too btw.
"Oct 5, 2019",positive,A fun team-up movie with a few boring spots but a great way to build this universe.
"Sep 30, 2019",positive,"The avengers is one of the top 10 best superhero movies of all time . That assembles earths mightiest superheroes  in one blockbuster movie, with great action , humour and heart . This one of the greatest marvel movie of all time."
"Sep 28, 2019",positive,"I LOOOOVE all of the MCU movies, but the original Avengers film is one of my very favorites! It seems so simple compared to the intensity and complexity of Infinity War and Endgame, but it is rather refreshing, and is a great origin story for Earth's Mightiest Heroes. "
"Sep 26, 2019",positive,"The combination of well-developed characters and action makes for an exciting, if slightly slow-moving film."
"Sep 23, 2019",positive,All of your favorite marvel super heroes team up to fight bugs from outer space. 
"Sep 22, 2019",positive,"Its visuals are great, and it's plenty engaging, but maybe a little cheesy nowadays."
"Sep 20, 2019",positive,"Great banter , bland story . "
"Sep 18, 2019",positive,"This is the best movie team-up, by now it has become a classic movie of MCU: good story, perfect combo, nice resolve."
"Sep 17, 2019",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers delivers the purest form of entertainement ever put in a movie, and succeeds at making all of our heroes share the screen in a coherent way."
"Sep 16, 2019",positive,Probably the best MCU movie quite enjoyable.
"Sep 15, 2019",negative,los vengadores un poco aburrida y lenta no era lo que esperaba de esta película tenia mas expectativa y me lleve un chacos 
"Sep 15, 2019",negative,Massively overrated film and franchise. I don't like superheroes but this film really wasn't great. I didn't find it interesting or enjoyable to watch.
"Sep 15, 2019",positive,Por los diálogos cringe
"Sep 12, 2019",negative,"I get that you have to set the stage, but for how long the film was they could've made it a bit more exciting. "
"Sep 10, 2019",positive,"Absolutely amazing movie, that's all you need"
"Sep 9, 2019",positive,Revolutionary. Changed the way we see super hero films forever. An amazing story about a group of remarkable people who put aside their differences to become our beloved Avengers.(i know i used a nick fury line
"Sep 5, 2019",positive,"A perfectly fine movie, it didn't leave me feeling amazed as I'm sure it did onto other viewers, but it was an enjoyable movie. Loki's antics, and the action are what impressed me the most. The story was fine, but if you look at the Avengers' series of movie this was a build-up story towards Infinity War, and Endgame."
"Aug 31, 2019",positive,Great summer blockbuster team-up. Problem is that Hawkeye is criminally unused in this movie
"Aug 27, 2019",positive,"It's a very good movie, but for me it was a bit muddled up. There were simply too many things going on, and the CGI still doesn't look very convincing. However, it's definitely a solid entry in the MCU."
"Aug 24, 2019",positive,"The Avengers is an unmissable experience, which features an incredible cast, great entertainment, and compelling character arcs. Additionally, a great script and great pacing allow the Avengers to be rewatched over and over again. A must-see."
"Aug 20, 2019",positive,"An epic superhero masterpiece and conclusion to Phase One of the MCU, combined with Whedon's direction, the script he co-wrote with Penn, the performances of the cast, Silvestri's score, McGarvey's cinematography, Ford and Lassek's editing, Chinlund's production design, Zolfo's set decoration, Byrne's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, Marvel's The Avengers is a brilliant action-packed and super-powered blockbuster!!!"
"Aug 19, 2019",positive,This is where all the madness begun.
"Aug 18, 2019",positive,Not the best avengers movie but it's definitely up there
"Aug 17, 2019",positive,"Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies."
"Aug 14, 2019",positive,amazing super hero team up i like it
"Aug 12, 2019",negative,I honestly don't understand why people like this movie. I personally thought it was boring as sh*t except for the epic battle scene at the end.
"Aug 10, 2019",positive,After watching the finale I couldn't help but watch this again. 
"Aug 9, 2019",positive,"Greatest Film of All Time. Perfect, Perfect. I love everything about this film. "
"Aug 6, 2019",positive,"This movie does Character better than almost any other. Joss Whedon accomplished the almost insurmountable task of combining the six main characters and several side characters in a way that lets each of them shine unimpeded by the others. The brilliance of the one-on-one confrontations each main character gets with the villain that highlight the unique strengths they bring to the team cannot be overstated. It also contains one of the most dynamic and multi-faceted arguments ever put to film. It combined three existing character-based film franchises, reinvented a fourth, and added in two main characters to boot. And it did it so well that it became the gold standard by which all action films and all team-up films are measured.

Closest comparison: It's the super hero team up movie that started them all

Setting: Super hero
Plot: War Spy
Tone:  Action Adventure"
"Aug 4, 2019",positive,a flawless film from start to finish. bringing all these super heroes together in one movie made for a truly epic action packed story that had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. the acting is flawless and the characters are all memorable and captivating in there own way. the film is smart funny and full of heart and action. its a visual masterpiece and one of the best films inside the marvel universe.
"Aug 2, 2019",positive,Still one of the MCU’s strongest films even if it is slightly dated 
"Aug 2, 2019",positive,"This is a film that really shouldn't have worked, but it oh-so did. It is just so much fun with amazing performances, notably RDJ (obviously) and Tom Hiddleston, who knocks it out of the park as Loki. Marvel did the impossible. 9/10."
"Jul 31, 2019",positive,"I remember I was a kid back when this came out. I read the comics, and seeing it all come to life was amazing."
"Jul 27, 2019",positive,Highly entertaining.
"Jul 24, 2019",positive,"Just watched this for the first time, and it was very well done when you consider other offerings of the MCU at the time.  It is not as good as that last two movies... but it was just growing into the franchise it became.  Very good and worth watching again."
"Jul 23, 2019",positive,"So cool how the best superheroes in the world are in the same movie and team up. I love how the final battle is like, 40 minutes long!"
"Jul 22, 2019",positive,"The buddying around, rubber band cgi, and cheesy moments took too much away for me to enjoy this movie"
"Jul 22, 2019",positive,Watching 4 franchises come together is truly mind blowing.
"Jul 21, 2019",positive,"Still an amazing movie in my opinion is better than infinity war

"Jul 20, 2019",positive,A classic and one of Marvel's best. This movie set up all the rest of the movies to come. Endgame and Infinity War couldn't have happened without it. Even now it is definitely a top 10 Marvel movie.
"Jul 18, 2019",positive,"This is the best one out of the MCU.loved the villain.the story,and the whole thing.just all of it was the great"
"Jul 17, 2019",positive,"A film that exceeds expectations. The Avengers opened our eyes to the possiblities of the Shared universe, by giving us one of the best if not the best superhero film ever made. By putting emphasis on characters, action, visuals, and great interactions."
"Jul 15, 2019",positive,Every actor is amazing and it feels fresh
"Jul 13, 2019",positive,"Such a memorable and impactfull moment for not just the mcu, but all movies in general."
"Jul 11, 2019",positive,"THE AVENGERS is spectacular in several senses of the word. It is literally a spectacle, with people flying up into the sky, monsters plummeting out of it, airships flying through it and so on. However, the real dynamism here is in the character interactions, not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie, let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully.

Followers of Marvel Comics characters in the movies have already seen Robert Downey Jr. star in two IRON MAN films, Chris Evans as CAPTAIN AMERICA and Chris Hemsworth as THOR, the alien mistaken by the ancient Vikings as a god. Although Mark Ruffalo is new to the role, there have been two previous HULK movies in the last decade. (There have also been SPIDER-MAN, FANTASTIC FOUR and X-MEN movies, but those don't come into play here.) Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and the essential Samuel L. Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features, so THE AVENGERS comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story.

However, THE AVENGERS hits the ground running, more or less literally, and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything, without boring those who know. Director/writer Joss Whedon, working from a screen story co-crafted with Zak Penn, finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they can't help finding even odder.

The short version of the set-up here is that something is stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury reaches out to his operatives – some less enthusiastic than others – when it turns out that the Earth is imperiled by the object itself, the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons.

We know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet – they are, after all, super heroes, not super-shirkers – but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun. Most films in this genre – the X-MEN series being the notable exception – have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison. AVENGERS can't, shouldn't and doesn't do that. Here, everyone has a tactical function, but more, each one of the Avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can.

Whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each character's unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore that's what he's doing. There does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the Hulk, as well as some glorious physical stunt work by Johansson's Black Widow and Cobie Smulders' Agent Maria Hill.

We get the sense that Downey's Stark is first among equals here, perhaps because, of the main characters, he not only has the biggest arc, but is the most mercurial. His philosophical clashes with Evans' straight-arrow Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) are wonderful to watch because of their differences, but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk. There's something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men, used to being misunderstood or not understood at all, finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around.

A note of special appreciation about the Hulk here – not only does Ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times (the better to defuse his rage) and major self-imposed loneliness, but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the Hulk since Lou Ferrigno went green. We can still see Ruffalo's performance within the Hulk, rather than having CGI trying to impose a version of an actor's face on something that looks like a badly-proportioned videogame avatar (which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the Hulk).

Hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game Thor and Tom Hiddleston is elegantly wounded as Thor's spiteful stepbrother Loki. (One caveat – Loki's horned helmet doesn't look any less silly than it did in THOR. This bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well, but Hiddleston bears up under it nobly.) Johansson is coolly capable (and of course looks fantastic) as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow and Renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision. The entire cast is terrific.

The 3D doesn't distract from the film, although it seems unnecessary – the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down.

In summation, THE AVENGERS will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly.

By the way, sit through the closing credits. Just sayin'."
"Jul 10, 2019",positive,"This film is one of the greatest crossovers in cinema history, the action is amazing, the characters are likable and all have great chemistry and the story is clever and well written. This movie will certainly be remembered for many things. 10/10!"
"Jul 8, 2019",positive,"Some. Assembly. Required. Avengers Initiative! The Big Superhero Team Up! Four Lead actors, two previous Cameo appearances, formed by Nick Fury, and Shield Agents Phil Coulson, and Maria Hill.  Avengers is a celebration of the Superhero Movie Genre Past, present, and future. A dreamful, imaginative, innovative fulfillment of what a franchise, or modern serial could become. Officiating the term ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" , picking up from the end of Thor, with diverse backgrounds/abilities  of the core team, to Battle Loki and the Other's Chitauri. 
Best Superhero Team Movie of the time, arguably any. The spectacle made up for the weakest points of what you previously invested in for lower tier MCU films.  "
"Jul 8, 2019",positive,"With 6 superheroes introduced on the big screen, they finally come together in this non-stop action packed adventure!"
"Jul 7, 2019",positive,Somehow marvel was able to do the impossible. giving screen time to all its major actors to pull of well rounded movie that is tightly shot and unbelievable performances by all.
"Jul 7, 2019",positive,marvels first really big movie still amazing i absolutely love this masterpiece 
"Jul 7, 2019",positive,"A combined Avenger film directed and written by Joss Whedon has a lot of expectations, and it lives up to every one. Whedon brings his classic humour and humanising to the dysfunctional family of Avengers. It's such fun to watch them clash but inevitably come together. Epic visual effects continually upping the game in the Marvel universe. Also has some great Easter eggs. "
"Jul 7, 2019",positive,A great payoff that guarantees a fun time.
"Jul 6, 2019",positive,"Looking back at this now, it isn't the perfect movie I always made it out to be.  The humor is fine, but cuts into some of the more serious stuff (though not as bad as Ultron did), but even so it still brings together these heroes perfectly.  You get great scenes for each Avenger and it pushes them to the limits as a team.  It's not the perfect movie, but it was the start of something greater.  It kicked off the rest of the MCU and set up the rest of their team up movies to come.  "
"Jul 5, 2019",positive,"I couldn't stop laughing I theaters, this movie is just to good"
"Jul 3, 2019",positive,"What can I say? This movie is pretty great. It was the birth-movie of the Avengers, and it brought them together beautifully, in a way no movie had ever done before. The differing personalities of every hero, as well as their similarities, were shown excellently, and the tensions among them were developed well. Then, the final act did all of the characters justice. I've never been a fan of action, honestly, but it was pretty cool to see the newly found Avengers kick ass. "
"Jul 2, 2019",positive,A film with lots of superheroes and action
"Jun 25, 2019",positive,The superhero team up you won't shut up about.
"Jun 22, 2019",positive,"This is one of my favorite movies. It manages to give us well-rounded characters, quippy dialogue, and awesome action scenes. Five stars"
"Jun 22, 2019",positive,What a great start to my favourite part of the MCU universe. I'll give Marvels The Avengers an A
"Jun 17, 2019",neutral,"Worst avengers film of them all, felt like it ended in the middle of the film."
"Jun 15, 2019",positive,"The movie is really good, but I'm disappointed in that fact that the government send an atom rocket to kill all people who were still there. Now my trust level to the government is really low, they are violent people. "
"Jun 12, 2019",neutral,So generic and predictable. 
"Jun 7, 2019",positive,The best thing about the movie is the characters in it. With the amazing character development including one of the best villains Loki and fueled with mighty action it was one of the grand entry in the superhero genre.
"Jun 4, 2019",positive,"The plot is great, the action is fantastic, the bad guy is interesting. The movie is just great."
"Jun 4, 2019",positive,"One of the best classic superhero movies.
Avengers Assemble!"
"Jun 3, 2019",positive,"One of the best marvel movies and arguably the best of the series, Avengers finds away to set egos aside and let these hero's fight amongst one another and save earth from a great villain"
"Jun 3, 2019",positive,This movie was really good this action packed movie was amazing but the combo attacks were even more awesome to watch tom was outstanding in the role of loki 
"Jun 2, 2019",positive,A movie which can be enjoyed by previous viewers and newcomers to the franchise. Simply amazing
"Jun 2, 2019",positive,"Great script, thrilling action, a ton of fun. A huge achievement to make this work and made everything that followed possible."
"Jun 1, 2019",positive,Comic book movie fun!!!!!
"May 29, 2019",positive,Best avengers movie out of all of them. 
"May 29, 2019",positive,Couldn't of asked for and more of this movie.  It was great. 
"May 29, 2019",positive,"This movie is one of my favourite mcu movies.
This movie its awesome.
"
"May 28, 2019",positive,Loved it! This is the movie that sparked my love of the MCU and I've been watching every movie since. All the actors were great but I particularly loved Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. She is a bad a**!  
"May 25, 2019",positive,"This is a great movie that is a great way to start off with the original six avengers and also, Nick Fury is a vital role in this movie and you get to see the struggles that the Avengers face that will come back to haunt them in Captain America: Civil War. Also there is an important scene in Avengers:Endgame that you must see this movie to understand."
"May 22, 2019",positive,"The team is finally together. 

I will admit that going into this film I wasn't sure that Loki was the correct choice for an antagonist, but he astoundingly does an amazing job! I mean, he was the bad guy in the first Thor and for him to be the carry-over villain in The Avengers seemed like it would be stale, but he does a fantastic job. I will admit that I felt like the crew sort of come together with a little more ease than I thought they would. I'm not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way, but clearly, I'm wrong...because that's exactly what happened.

A fantastic movie will definitely watch again!"
"May 20, 2019",positive,"The movie is AVENGERS. The genre is aventure and action, the actors act good. It's an intense film.
  There are 6 people: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Arrow. The rating is 12. It has a little suspense. The sinopsis is very nice."
"May 20, 2019",positive,"Yeah, heroes! The story is shaping the world to their needs and we're in for a lot of action."
"May 14, 2019",positive,"The very first MCU movie I ever saw nd it is great. This is one of the best MCU film for me, the villain is one of the best.   
It has some problems, but it is great"
"May 11, 2019",positive,This movie was amazing. had the right balance between comedy and action.
"May 11, 2019",positive,"From the beginning it's amazing, showing an interesting plot in a pretty epic way. If you come following the previous films of the MCU you will love how they bring together several things. But in any case they present you with each character with well-written dialogues with which you can perfectly understand who they are and their motivations, without becoming over-expressive or boring.
There is a very good development of the team, which when they have problems that are arranged in a very natural way. The final battle is very good, and seeing the heroes meet for the first time is epic"
"May 10, 2019",positive,"Apasionante, alucinantemente guionizada, tremendos efectos. La mejor de la franquicia, sin lugar a dudas. Inolvidable."
"May 9, 2019",positive,"A geek's dream come true. Full of amazing action and great interactions from out favourite heroes. 

Loki, while questioned by many, is one of the best villians of the MCU... and definitely a good addition to this movie (although sometimes they play down his character for the sake of jokes a little too much)."
"May 9, 2019",positive,"not the biggest fan of the MCU, but for me, this is the best film I have seen from them. Undeniably entertaining adn amusing."
"May 4, 2019",positive,"Despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie, The Avengers is still pretty fun. It really was a risk trying to make this movie happen, and it really payed off.

I still preferred The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man when it comes to superhero movies of 2012, but I still really enjoyed this film."
"May 3, 2019",positive,"My favorite scene in the avengers movie is hulk knocking Loki down, before he said puny god. "
"May 2, 2019",positive,Good opening to the Avengers movies.
"May 2, 2019",positive,"With all of Marvel's most iconic heroes on screen at the same time, wonderful performances, excellent soundtrack, intense, immersive and fantastic action, spot-on humor, visually appealing status and total direction control by Joss Whedon, Marvel's first teamup movie centering around the awesome Avengers, this movie remains one of the highest grossing films of all time, as well as one of the finest films ever crafted."
"May 2, 2019",positive,"Filme muito bom, um dos melhores da Marvel."
"May 2, 2019",negative,Expected much better. Never thought I'd say this (except maybe first two Thor movies) but wish I could get my money back. 
"Apr 29, 2019",positive,"Cool movie, but it's more like an Iron Man 3 than an Avengers film..."
"Apr 28, 2019",positive,"This movie is one of the greatest things in the MCU to this day. I think that the assembling of the team in the first bit is a little slow, but it is completely worth it for the third act. This third act is one of, if not the best, to date. I think Loki is an extremely great villain who someone we can understand their motives. I think that the casting of Mark Ruffalo is interesting, because it makes the Hulk less serious, but at least he still Hulks out in the battle. This is one of the best movies in the entire MCU and I think every movie fan should watch this.
9.5/10"
"Apr 28, 2019",positive,"Avengers Endgame was a terrific ending to a beautiful a 11 years 22 movies saga. The final battle was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, it felt just like a comic book."
"Apr 28, 2019",positive,Thank you for making all my babies in one movie and it IS THAT GOOD. Thank you.
"Apr 27, 2019",positive,One of my top 10 movies of all time.  An instant classic!
"Apr 27, 2019",positive,This is one of the greatest superhero movies ever. It combines a great cast of characters that get a long very well. The actors also played their roles perfectly and the plot of this movie is great.
"Apr 26, 2019",positive,"The culmination of multiple solo movies and tie-ins, “The Avengers” showcases great actors in relatable roles discussing real world problems and human emotion, and at the same time is a story about superheroes fighting giant aliens. "
"Apr 26, 2019",positive,"Without the memory of the MCU and Infinity War, End Game might be remembered as a great science fiction epic. With the last decade of films in mind, End Game suffers for clinging to plots that already defined previous MCU films and delivering duds for some of the biggest cliffhangers at the end of Infinity War. To be fair, the film had its share of novelties and character developments, but a certain lack of creativity plagued the second half of the film."
"Apr 26, 2019",negative,"BANG! POW! SPLAT! BOOM!  the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe,  hyperbole much?"
"Apr 26, 2019",positive,"I remember not studying for my World History AP test in high school and failing it as a result to go see this movie, but it was well worth it, because 'The Avengers' is still one of the most satisfying payoffs to anything, ever. Somehow, every character gets their due with whip-smart dialogue and fantastic action that culminates into a phenomenal third act of pure superhero spectacle. You really couldn't ask for more."
"Apr 26, 2019",positive,the movie was good but the hulk that is used in the movie with ed norton is much better looking then this one
"Apr 26, 2019",positive,"This movie is what got me into Marvel movies. It's hilarious, action packed and just a really fun time!!"
"Apr 25, 2019",positive,"The epic start of one of the greatest eras of film in modern history. i will always be thankful to everyone involved in the ""Infinity Saga"" for keeping me here 11 years and not only providing life to these characters ive grown to adore, but give me laughter and heartbreak and determination with a quick binge. i saw this film in theaters twice and fully enjoyed. i hope to the same for Endgame."
"Apr 25, 2019",positive,"Action packed and fast paced, MCU as its best."
"Apr 24, 2019",positive,3rd best marvel movie next to infinity war and endgame
"Apr 24, 2019",positive,"If you forget about some of the cheesy themes and insensible plot, The Avengers is a solid team-up movie that combines past superheroes, creating an event that has raised the bar for superhero films."
"Apr 21, 2019",positive,"Fun, entertaining, exciting, interesting and extraordinary is what makes The Avengers the solidification of the MCU"
"Apr 21, 2019",positive,The Marvel movie was fantastic it had awesome battles and a awesome story. All the characters from the previous movies formed a team to stop Thor''s brother Loki. Loki is a cool guy. Awesome!
"Apr 19, 2019",positive,Memorable first assemble of everyone's favourite Marvel superheroes is powered by enthralling set-pieces but drags a little in the third act.
"Apr 17, 2019",positive,I don’t have words to describe how good this movie was and the way they set it up to be a 21 son 22 movie franchise was incredible
"Apr 16, 2019",positive,"Excellent movie, but I'm afraid Loki was just not good villain for it."
"Apr 14, 2019",positive,"Um... holy crap. This is a fantastic movie. It lived up to double what everyone was hoping for, or at least I thought everyone was hoping for it to be good. I guess I was wrong though, because some people didn't like it, and the only way you possibly couldn't like this movie is if you didn't care or didn't want to be good in the first place."
"Apr 13, 2019",positive,"One of the most iconic movies ever made. The amount of times I've re-watched this marvel of a movie is uncountable. However the only thing that restricts it from the five star rating for me is the amount of corny, out of place jokes along with the over-exaggeration of the unique quirks of our core characters (e.g. Tony's sarcasm, Thor's Shakespeareanesque and Cap's 1940's attitude)."
"Apr 9, 2019",positive,Joss Whedon brought all of our favorite superheroes together beautifully in this fantastic film!
"Apr 9, 2019",positive,"Joss Whedon strikes the door hard and what's visible is Kevin Feige's dream team.

The Avengers

Whedon is much better a writer than he is a director. On a scale of McQuarrie, disappointingly Joss Whedon, the director, wouldn't even qualify as one. For when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans, he takes things lightly a lot. Whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen, is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen. Too much cheese and too much sweet, his self-earned jaw dropping moments, are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom. Fortunately, these battles are here as the starters, the main course is the ""build-up"" to that battle.

Whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awe-gasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen. There lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old Whedon playing with his toys in his room, creating banal engaging scenarios between Captain and Tony. This crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybe-expected uplift from this chapter, as it managed to bring out every adored content, from humor to drama to juicy visual effects. The dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen.

Among all the triumphs of Whedon, his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown. Downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh, his performance isn't interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots, which it seems like it did to others. If aligned the priorities of the makers, the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling, is their way in, for this safe formula wasn't inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys, The Avengers, can avenge."
"Apr 7, 2019",positive,Probably the best film ever made
"Apr 5, 2019",positive,What a blast! Everyone was talking about it for weeks.
"Apr 3, 2019",positive,Now THESE are the heroes we needed. I'll take the Avengers over the Justice League any day of the week.
"Apr 2, 2019",positive,"A basic superhero plot is welcomed, and while it is understandably clunky in some parts, it's more than helped by the terrific cast and satisfactory action."
"Mar 29, 2019",positive,A little goofy and meh til the end but the alien army seems it could have been taken out by our military elites...so why do we need superheroes. Not bad but boring at times as it took awhile to see the characters truly work together.
"Mar 26, 2019",positive,"Almost two and a half hours of Iron Man ""Batman-ing"" his way through everyone around him trying to figure out things- oh, and Loki is apparently a big enough threat to bring the strongest forces on the government's super hero contact list together on an airplane-like china shop just so the Hulk can ""Hulk"".

Overall, Marvel's The Avengers is a great addition to the MCU with a bunch of fantastic one liner's from a crew that if all else fails, will at least ""avenge""."
"Mar 25, 2019",positive,Very Good Movie Loved it
"Mar 24, 2019",positive,"Marvel’s The Avengers proves you can have blockbuster smash hit of multiple heroes on the big screen, With defining character moments, action packed plot, and a well rounded cast ."
"Mar 23, 2019",negative,"entertains, but too many jokes"
"Mar 22, 2019",positive,This is still the best Marvel movie in my opinion.
"Mar 22, 2019",positive,A well deserve score for the best movie of all times!
"Mar 21, 2019",positive,The best 4K Avengers series transfer I have seen so far.4.5/5
"Mar 19, 2019",positive,"Loookii , oh plus his bro , plus the Capt. plus Tony ,plus everybody including the arrow (?) Yeah I'm not sure he is too strong , more like an optional avenger but who's combing the back of flies , he did his part good too. Loved it , utterly utterly irresistible"
"Mar 18, 2019",positive,"This movie was really something when I watched it seven years ago, and plus I really loved the action. First of all, some of scenes at the beginning were a bit dramatic, but it then gets to the good parts after that. So the Cinema is mostly normal, but there are some parts in it where its CG, and that's what really gets me going. As for the directing, I have to say that Joss Wheldon did a pretty good job at the acting, and the actors did very well too. Finally, lets just say the overall saying of this movie is that it is pretty sad, because one character dies in one scene, and in the end, it is mostly action scenes and I liked that part."
"Mar 15, 2019",positive,Trama buona. I parametri di giudizio sono tutti soddisfatti. La colonna sonora di A. Silvestri è buona ma non ottima. Bel film! Voto: 8
"Mar 13, 2019",positive,"One of the best entertaining Marvel movies.

"Mar 11, 2019",positive,beet crossover ever.
"Mar 10, 2019",neutral,"There was almost no story, most of the time it was only battles and fight. Felt like they wasted a lot of time on dumb fight even between the main characters. I expected more."
"Mar 10, 2019",positive,"This movie really brought the Marvel franchise to the forefront of pop culture. When my generation becomes old, we will always remember this film. This movie had good acting, great action sequences, and impressive CGI for its time. Props to Joss Whedon for being able to bring all of these talented actors together brilliantly for a wonderful film. Timeless classic!"
"Mar 10, 2019",positive,2018 October i watch this movie first and boy i like it. Reason why i wanna see this because everyone hyped Infity War so i do not have no choise.
"Mar 10, 2019",positive,Amazing combination of an established universe combining all characters together for the first time. Does feel that some of the hero vs hero fight scenes are forced for the film however.
"Mar 10, 2019",positive,One the best movies of all time
"Mar 10, 2019",positive,This movie is awesome
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"So exciting, ambitious, and bombastic that its myriad flaws are hard to see at first glance, the Avengers still stands as a strong kick-off point for the series, and a cinematic game changer for blockbuster films at large."
"Mar 9, 2019",neutral,"the start of the enterprise...the only thing is why haven't we had a movie about Hawkeye & Black Widow yet? The storyline is silly, and the villains, droves of aliens, just don't convince me the Avengers are that mighty nor fearsome...."
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"The First big team up in the MCU, and Still the best avengers film"
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,Who doesn't love to see earth's mightiest heroes team up? It was great as you would expect from Marvel.
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,An excellent film that brings together many different heroes for the first time and makes it work. Strongly recommended. A+
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,Great movie! I can't post how shitty Captain Marvel is on her movie so I'd like to give my 2 star review of Captain Marvel here. It's boring and it sucks.
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"This was fun, will be good to revisit in endgame"
"Mar 9, 2019",negative,Horrible crappy discussed
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,A perfect popcorn movie. Definitely a  great movie experience.
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,Hell yes!  Great fun movie. Every single character has their role and is given the limelight at some point. The Hulk going nuts in New York was probably one of the most exhilarating scenes in a movie in recent history.  This movie was worthy of multiple viewings for sure!
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"This movie is almost perfect. Extremely entertaining and left a deep impression for me. When I entered the cinema to watch this show, I was just expecting 2 hours+ of fighting and 'fireworks'. I was so wrong about it. The characters are so well potrayed and given a good balance of screen time. Beautiful masterpiece."
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"Such a great film. I am so worried that Brie Larson is going to give it all a downer ending by being a Deus ex Machina, and stealing everything these characters have earned."
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,"Though not all of phase one was perfect, ( I'm looking at you, Hulk ), This movie makes up for it. I'd say 95 was a better critical rating, but 92 seems deserving. The marvel cinematic universe stays true to the books, while being easy to follow."
"Mar 9, 2019",positive,Amazing....  Absolutely fantastic
"Mar 8, 2019",positive,"I remember the trepidation of going to see Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers. Could they really pull a team-up like this off? Could the whole really be a sum of some awesome parts? I wasnâ(TM)t sure. That trepidation turned into utter lack of interest. X-Men: The Last Stand left a bad taste in my mouth, but the Avengers crew was regaining my interest in the superhero world movie by movie. Good thing I gave the movie a chance because I ended up having the time of my life.

In Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers, Earthâ(TM)s mightiest heroes take on the evil Loki who is hell-bent on world domination.

Acting: 10

Beginning: 7

Characters: 10
The gangâ(TM)s all here and what a gang. I appreciate that each of these superheroes are battling their own inner demons which affects how their characters interact with the other heroes. itâ(TM)s what makes them a good team. They come to understand each otherâ(TM)s dysfunctions and deal with it. This is the first movie where you start to see the team use their strengths in tandem and work together as a team. Their initial lack of chemistry is hilarious to watch as they are forced into a unit.

Bringing all these characters on the big screen at once was a monumental accomplishment. It was a risk that paid off. A damn good movie was made here and deserves a ton of credit for setting a standard in the way superhero movies should be done.

Memorability: 8

Pace: 8

Plot: 10
The story weaves together the backstories of the other characters in seamless fashion. While there arenâ(TM)t many twists and turns to throw you off or keep you guessing, I would also argue that twists werenâ(TM)t necessary for a film like this. Tell the story you need to tell and if we can see some awesome superpowered battles along the way, great! Job well done here.

Resolution: 10
Solid ending capped off with some fun end-credit scenes that pave the way for films to come. The entire movie is meant to entertain and I was happy that they finished strong. Itâ(TM)s a capper that leaves you wanting to see these guys team up again.

Overall: 92
Seven years later and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still going as strong as ever. Iâ(TM)m going to see Captain Marvel tomorrow, a film that wouldnâ(TM)t even be possible without the success of The Avengers and other lesser-known properties like Guardians of the Galaxy. Seven years later and this movie still never ceases to excite me and make me laugh at the same time."

"Mar 2, 2019",positive,"It has great visual effects and its interesting to watch, but it has nothing new to show about superheroes world. It will be everything what you expect of a superheroes movie, nor more nor less."

"Jan 27, 2019",positive,"This is what started the reign of really good films in the MCU. It's because of Marvel's The Avengers (2012). It was action-packed, funny, and everyone has great onscreen chemistry."
"Jan 26, 2019",positive,All the buildup really pays off.
"Jan 25, 2019",positive,This is a fun film and it's actually suitable for the whole family.
"Jan 25, 2019",positive,The best super-hero film ever made in my opinion.
"Jan 24, 2019",neutral,"The movie as whole is not bad but at the end of the day, it's pretty much the generic superhero/comic book movie - lots of explosions with some semi-funny one-liners. The action sequences were nothing outstanding (they were actually less impressive than the first scenes in Thor). On top of that, the movie is a bit slow until the half-way point. Some characters felt out of place like Scarlett Johansson's character and that Phil dude. Hulk's reason for being on the team was very blurry as well. Overall, an entertaining popcorn flick watched with boxxy software app but nothing more."
"Jan 23, 2019",positive,"AMAZING
 it is one of the best films I have ever seen"

"Jan 13, 2019",positive,"The essence of 'The Avengers' is not, against all odds, in the accumulation of elements, but in the resulting dynamic of uniting them all"".

Qualification: Fresh 
Original score: 3.5/4"
"Jan 12, 2019",negative,"Never has so much money been spent to make a movie look so cheap.

Clearly the entire budget went on the CGI in the last act, because most of the first half of the movie looks like a TV series. Seriously. Look at how some of the shots are constructed. This is TV studio level direction.

Credit to Marvel for having the direction and commitment to bringing the MCU into existence and linking everything together into a payoff, but unless you have a massive investment in the characters this is not really anything special, with a by the numbers plot involving massive egos learning to get over their individual dick sizes and work together to defeat a common threat. Plus explosions.

I actually got bored and needed two sittings to actually finish watching this.

(also, Justice League wishes it was this movie)"
"Jan 9, 2019",positive,Surprisingly this movie doesn't hold up for me. The first half is just... boring. Which is weird having all of these interesting characters.But the fact that it's one of a kind in that it combined different movie franchises sucessfully makes this movie a triumph in that sense. But just as a standalone movie- nah.
"Jan 8, 2019",positive,The best one of them all
"Jan 6, 2019",positive,A movie that any Marvel Fan will love.

"Jan 5, 2019",positive,"Evil supervillain trying to conquer the world for some vapid reason (and, predictably, betrays people at every possible chance) and superhero avengers ganging up to stop him! I loved seeing my favorite characters and lots of action kept the movie going, but it lacked substance in plot."
"Jan 3, 2019",positive,this was an absoloute masterpiece
"Jan 2, 2019",positive,One of the ultimate comic book movies!
"Dec 30, 2018",positive,"As one of the first films I ever saw in cinema, this film is just great. It unified all what's good about all the previous films all in one film, cultivating into what is one of the best films of all time."
"Dec 29, 2018",positive,"My first review in inglish

Avengers, is an awesome movie uniting the great avengers of the comics,the movie works, the villain is incredible, although sometimes it decays and makes it tedious, but then we have a few minutes of pure confrontations of the Avengers Iron Man, Thor Black Widow Captain America fighting in New York. Then when the hulk arrives and if they all join, it is a work of art and even better the villain is very acceptable and his needs are noted and why he is fighting ... 10/10"
"Dec 29, 2018",positive,This is the reason multiple superheros can be in one movie. This is what made Marvel popular. This is action packed and the cast is great.
"Dec 28, 2018",positive,"In one of the most anticipated blockbusters in recent memory, Joss Whedon succeeds at combining this diverse and mighty heroes and faces them off against a compelling foe in Loki, resulting in a wholly pleasing and over-the-top action entry that binds together the separate storylines of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that raises the bar of its genre."
"Dec 27, 2018",positive,What an achievement. One of the best theater experiences in my entire life. To see all of these badass characters in the same movie was a monumental surprise. To this day Avengers never bores me and is still one of the best superhero movies in history. 
"Dec 27, 2018",positive,wonderful action and strong PERFORMANCES
"Dec 24, 2018",positive,Great movie and loved how all the superheroes came together. 
"Dec 21, 2018",positive,"Pure fun and entertainment from start to finish, Marvel's The Avengers is in my opinion the best film in Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Dec 20, 2018",positive,"*theatre moment* in this movie. 
Every character shines in their own way, and shares screen time evenly.
Definelty among the top of superhero movies.

"Dec 19, 2018",positive,"This is an epic adventure and Marvel does not disappoint! This was the true first of its kind bringing together so many characters in one great franchise! And finally a great movie with the Hulk!! The action, CGI, comedy, and all other aspects mix together perfectly. If Robert Downey Jr is smart, he will continue making movies as Tony Stark/Iron Man for the rest of his life!!!"
"Dec 14, 2018",positive,this was defining moment for comic book fans and it was good a solid entry for the mcu
"Dec 9, 2018",positive,This is the Marvel film that shows what true teamwork is all about.
"Dec 8, 2018",positive,"It was very epic to see the heroes united in a movie and the truth was something unexpected to see, but they focused on the comedy and Loki promised too much but he was humiliated and this if I dislike him a bit."
"Dec 6, 2018",positive,A real game changer for comic book movies
"Dec 3, 2018",positive,"I really loved the movie due to its action, characters (especially the Avengers), humor, and soundtrack, but I can concern that it is too soon to add characters that were barely introduced to, such as Hawkeye."
"Dec 1, 2018",positive,Uawewehahsksbsidneie
"Nov 29, 2018",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers throws it all together in a slap-stick, chuckle-worthy and clever action mish-mash. The direction isn't wound too tight for too long and the characters weave together like finely meshed fabric."
"Nov 27, 2018",positive,"Joss Whedon has brought us the movie that comic book geeks have been waiting for. Marvel's The Avengers. Robert Downey Jr. plays Iron Man, Chris Evans plays Captain America, Chris Hemsworth plays The Mighty Thor, Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow, Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, Mark Ruffalo plays The Incredible Hulk, Tom Hiddleston plays the baddie Loki and Samuel L.Jackson plays Nick Fury. The change between Mark Ruffalo and Edward Norton was actually the right choice to make because Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner and lot better than Edward Norton did. This movie was a real game changer because this was the first ever comic book movie when a group of heroes team up which made this film very unique and the best movie that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has produced. 

Loki, the adopted brother of Thor, teams-up with the Chitauri Army and uses the Tesseract's power to travel from Asgard to Midgard to plot the invasion of Earth and become a king. The director of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, sets in motion project Avengers, joining Tony Stark a.k.a. the Iron Man; Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America; Bruce Banner, a.k.a. The Hulk; Thor; Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow; and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, to save the world from the powerful Loki and the alien invasion. 

This film have amazing SFX and the entire New York fight scene was CGI and it look so real. This film has an engaging plot which is brilliantly acted and I would highly recommend that you watch it.
Rated PG for mild language and moderate violence
Grade A+"
"Nov 26, 2018",positive,"Instant classic. I sat down and watched this movie and couldn't take my eyes off it. The actors are all amazing, and the effects are good too. Highly recommend."
"Nov 24, 2018",positive,"A remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film. Out of the 3 of the Avengers films, this one is the best. This film shared flashbacks with past films. Which was fine. Mark Ruffalo made his first appearance playing the hulk as a re-cast and I'm glad to say he's much better than the last actor who played him, Edward Norton. Mark Ruffalo brought more mystery to the Bruce Banner character. All that Norton brand was put a random homeless character on the big screen. I didn't know this, but apparently, all of New York was CGI in the movie. 

It was great and not just the setting. The Hulk was as well. The Hulk scary chase scene was so horrifying. Jeremy Renner character was very creative and we didn't get much of Hawkeye in Thor. All we got is him drawing his bow and that's it. He didn't even shoot. Loki shouldn't of fake death at the end of Thor. Terrible twist. The relationship between Thor and Hulk was hilarious. The S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft was an incredible visual effect. This will boost the team based comic book movies a lot. Thanks to the film's success.

This film was definitely my favorite out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The aliens were quite interesting - and seeing Captain America fight again was exciting. Robert Downey Jr. was charming in his role. I love this film."
"Nov 24, 2018",positive,Awesome movie very well written. Action pack
"Nov 22, 2018",positive,A very epic crossover that made Hollywood what it is today. Even after all these years it still feels epic to see these characters come together for the first time. While the story may not be as strong as other marvel movies it still as amazing now as it was then to see them come together work off each other.
"Nov 21, 2018",positive,"Los Vengadores de Marvel es la película que hizo sentir a los fans de los comics el deseo de volver a ver películas de superhéroes otra vez. Es magnífica, esencial y reune de una manera natural de los hechos a los héroes más poderosos de la Tierra para protegerla de un peligro alienígena que fluye bien en la trama."
"Nov 19, 2018",positive,"This movie has everything that I want from a great superhero movie. Great characters, action and villain. Even tho the plot is a little bit thin it's still definitely holds up. But it feels a little bit slow in the beginning perhaps."
"Nov 19, 2018",positive,"The superhero film everyone dreamt to see, and it really does please people. Joss Whedon made a perfect film with Robert Downey Jr. adding his cool."
"Nov 17, 2018",positive,"Brilliant, just brilliant first outing for the Avengers, thrilling and exciting, and everything we had hoped and prayed that it would be.But what an opener,a and so hard to live up to for future movies."
"Nov 16, 2018",positive,"A great, poignant superhero film, funny and very enjoyable all the way through, uniting its heroes in a spectacular way."
"Nov 9, 2018",positive,"Arguably the start of a desirable Film trend, the first ensemble character film in the beloved mcu stands strong as a superhero and action movie for either buff's dramedic taste."

"Oct 15, 2018",positive,A real-seeming superhero film that makes you nerd out as soon as you see Iron Man and Captain America meet.
"Oct 13, 2018",positive,A modern classic that takes advantage of it's entertaining character dynamics among the character. Loki is definitely helps alleviate Marvel's bland antagonist problem. The action certainly matches the expectations built up from across several films.
"Oct 13, 2018",positive,"Stuff blows up, people argue, more stuff blows up."
"Oct 12, 2018",positive,I was hyped for this movie and it delivered.
"Oct 11, 2018",positive,"Before I saw this movie, I saw all the reviews of it and those reviews gave me huge expectations for the movie. And after I saw it, it was even better than the reviews said it would! It had a really good storyline and also did a great job at developing the characters throughout the film. And my favourite part was the third act. It was the best one I had ever seen. It had lots of amazing action and loads of scenes with the team together. And most importantly, it was memorable. This movie was not just good, but a perfect way to conclude the first phase of the MCU."
"Oct 7, 2018",positive,"One of the best movies in the entire series. The characters (even though their personalities felt kinda over-exaggerated) were all very fun and enjoyable. To add, Loki is definitely one of the best villains in the entire MCU."
"Oct 6, 2018",positive,"This is when how the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to work together as The Avengers. Bold, fearless, smart and above all. Miss those days when they were serious and not joking around every minute or two and focused more on saving the world. 2012 was the best year for movies back then. Awesome Marvel movie that had an interesting plot, suspense, and excitement."
"Oct 3, 2018",positive,"With wit, charm, humor and action combined along with the thrill of seeing all our beloved Marvel superheroes come together for the first time on film, this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more"
"Oct 2, 2018",positive,"The Avengers is the first team-up film in the MCU and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading Earth thanks to Loki opening up a portal.

Even when I watched The Avengers for the first time back in 2012, I didn't think that the story was all that special. This is a long film, and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk. There are a few action set pieces throughout the film, such as when Thor, Loki, and Iron Man (and Captain America) have a pretty awesome scuffle, but besides that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else. And it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting. The final battle in the city is cool, but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either. The story here is just...okay.

I will say that having watched the first Captain America film it was cool to see Steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend, and slowly realize that he's a bit of a douche. Steve and Tony's dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film (and possibly the MCU, which makes sense given the future these two have).

As to be expected by this point with MCU films, the cinematography is great. Of course, this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of The Avengers as they assemble on the battlefield, which was cool to see.

In the end, though, while everything in this film is solid, I don't find it to be particularly mind-blowing. And really a big part of the reason why I don't like to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time. There's nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2.5 hours and watch it, unless I'm doing an MCU marathon."

"Sep 23, 2018",negative,"Multiple superheroes in big set pieces and smart-ass dialogue don't make a good film. Yes, it's certainly cleaner than most blockbusters, but it's still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing."
"Sep 10, 2018",positive,"The Avengers lives up to all expectations and gives us the ultimate fight we've been waiting for since Phase One began, and Loki surprisingly carries the film on his own."
"Sep 6, 2018",positive,"How was this so successful? Was it the films building up to this? Cast chemistry? Who knows and who cares. This is what comic book fans have wanted since the first time up happened on paper. This is what summer blockbusters should be. Fun, smart, soul, and character development.

The characters, writing and delivery was great and everything you'd expect from these actors, all of whom are amazing in their respective roles. The only downside to the movie was the music, although the main theme was very good and is very memorable."
"Aug 1, 2018",positive,"The first Avengers movie brings all of the heroes we have seen in their stand alone films, (except for Black Widow and Hawkeye) and brings them all together to fight in the Battle of New York. The actors in this film appear to have great chemistry together and do great together on screen. The action sequences, mainly the end one, are amazing and show off what these Marvel movies can do. A+"
"Jul 28, 2018",positive,The best movie ever !
"Jul 25, 2018",positive,Amazing movie. Definitely one of the best superhero movies and best movies in general of all time.
"Jul 24, 2018",positive,"The Avengers has done what any superhero fan has hoped for in the past few decades: bringin' them all together. And it does with great action, a script that focuses on the flaws of all of the characters, and also having a great villain (and a great larger villain that won't be named but his name starts with a T, ends with and S, and is focusing on trying to make a gem covered gauntlet and wipe out half of all life).

"Jul 23, 2018",positive,since it was released this movie can be considered one of the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe
"Jul 18, 2018",positive,This is my favorite Marvel movie I think it's really cool how you can get all these characters from different franchises and put it all in one it changed how we do franchises nowadays it's just a lot of fun  and really funny Loki is my favorite MCU villain besides Thanos  I think Mark Ruffalo is better as  Hulk  and Bruce Banner then Edward  Norton Was
"Jul 15, 2018",positive,"Marvels The Avengers 2012 was truly a build up of anticipation. After each of our hero's solo outings we see the characters and personalities come together in such a way that feels realistic and grounded, despite the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the sky. Introduction and motivation to characters drives the movie, but beyond that we see that of course these individuals don't all get along at first. Why would they? The idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward. 
Director Joss Whedon takes he's experience from Buffy, Angel and Firefly and seamlessly builds the narrative with these already interesting characters. The action is nothing short of mind blowing and the CGI is seem less, particularly the work put into the hulk who's never looked better. 
Loki, our villain from the film returns after the events of Thor (2011) is the one we all love to hate. What we as the audience can take away from he's character is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion. Truly the best villain Marvel had done thus far. 
In conclusion, this movie has something to love for everyone. The pieces really did fall into place perfectly with this film. 
In the words of Nick Fury; ""Once there was an idea"" , and boy did the idea work. As close to perfect as can be."
"Jul 6, 2018",positive,More fun than expected and also one of the best 3rd acts ever.
"Jul 2, 2018",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the best superheroes to form The Avengers team from the comics. Marvel's The Avengers is my favorite movie of 2012, one of my top 10 favorite Marvel and superhero movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time. The visual effects and the action and fighting scenes were spectacular and awesome especially Hulk and the battle at the end of the movie. The acting was stupendous especially from Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, and Cobie Smulders. The costume designs were fantastic. The production design was terrific. The writing and screenplay were excellent. The story was really cool and interesting. A+."
"Jun 26, 2018",positive,I'd rate it higher but Jeremy Renner bugs the crap out of me.  I think I liked one scene he was in.
"Jun 26, 2018",positive,"The Avengers is a fun, entertaining and beautiful movie and it was a pleasure seeing all these heroes come together for the first time in a movie."
"Jun 25, 2018",positive,Definitely my favorite marvel movie ever released . I remember walking out of the theater mid blown. I saw it again later that day. Also it still holds up great and a must buy. 
"Jun 18, 2018",positive,"At the core of a great film is an even greater story. At the core of every great story are even greater characters, chemistry and a strong foundation of source material. The Avengers have been around since the early 60s, and the characters even far beyond that. Personally, in the midst of my parents divorcing, I decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew in March, 1982 while living in Broken Arrow, OK during one of my many, many trips to QuikTrip to either buy ice cream, donuts or penny candy while playing Ms. Pac-Man. It wasn't a wonder why I became fat around this time. Fast forward 2 years to May, 1984, when I purchased Avengers (Vol 1) number 243, mostly due to my being intrigued with Captain America. I instantly fell in love with comics, and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time. 

For the next 3-4 years, I was obsessed with comic books, which centered completely around the Avengers, like Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Secret Wars, etc. I read everything I could and became immersed into the years and years of Avengers history. Even as girls and music became more interesting to me than comics, I still always had an affinity for the Avengers. At one point, after beginning to earn a good living about 15 years ago, I tried collecting every issue ever made. I got about 95% there when comics started being graded by CGC and ""guaranteeing"" condition. I then sold most of my mediocre conditioned books and wanted to collect 9.2-10 (Near Mint-Mint) copies of every issue. Only, the expense far outweighed my dedication and, to this day, I only have a few. 

My heart has always been with the Avengers, though. My heart was broken when the first Avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment. Just a pathetic series. However, when the X-Men movies did well and other titles like Daredevil, Elektra and Fantastic Four started to be released, I was excited to eventually see, at least, Captain America, Iron Man, etc. on the big screen. Never did I think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt The Avengers as a whole.

Then came Iron Man...a B character, at best, perfectly cast Robert Downey, Jr. as a spot-on Tony Stark. And it was huge. Then came the news that Marvel had owned the properties again and had a strategy to deliver individual movies leading up to an all-encompassing Avengers movie. NO WAY, I thought. Oh this was BOUND to get screwed up. And, frankly, there was probably NO WAY to please me, a die-hard Avengers fan, on the big screen. Just no way. Especially after Ang Lee's atrocious Hulk movie. Surely Hulk would be left out of the mix. 

Then came Edward Norton as a superb Bruce Banner in the Incredible Hulk movie that hit all the right buttons, continued the Iron Man storyline, eluded to the Super Soldier serum, tying it all together with SHIELD. The final scene in the Incredible Hulk showed us a meditating Bruce Banner with an evil grin, seemingly embracing and enjoying the monster within, which told us die-hard fans that he must be in the control of Loki, Norse god of Mischief, as was the case in the classic Avengers #1 issue from the early 60s. Could they be setting up Loki and the Hulk as the villains of the Avengers movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book??

Then came Iron Man 2. A poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more Nick Fury, Black Widow and Avengers talk. Way too rushed, and thus what caused Favreau's exit as director. My interest was still high, but I became cautious as the humor of Iron Man began leaning this whole thing in a direction I had hoped wouldn't come to pass. Then, at the end of Iron Man 2, Thor's hammer in the middle of the desert sparked my interest, as designed, again.

Then came Thor. I was really worried about this one. A Norse god? Among all these high-tech, very human heroes? Given the extremely strong representation of Batman by the Nolan films, this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing into full-blown CAMP. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Introducing Hawkeye helped a lot as well. Then, at the end, with Loki seeing through the eyes of Erik gave us fans another glimpse of Loki controlling humans, which sparked the interest of the Hulk again. 

Finally, Captain America, perfectly cast Chris Evans and developed a near-perfect story around the Red Skull and the Cosmic Cube. The foundation was almost full strength and The Avengers movie was on the horizon. Could it meet the expectations of the film fans? Better yet, could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the decades of comic book fans?

Over the past few months, I've seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for The Avengers. I have been so worried thinking that the movie I've waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster. Trailer after trailer, it didn't look any better. Did Joss royally screw this thing up???

Well, I saw it opening night, tonight. The trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece. Sure, it's action-packed. It's expected to be. Sure it's got funny moments. It's expected to, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. as a leading man. What Joss Whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since Nolan's Batman series. The interaction between the characters, the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws, and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes. 

To most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film; a great kickoff to the summer movie season. To me, a die-hard, multi-decade fanatic of this comic, these films, these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and, honestly, impossible to achieve, in my eyes. Joss proved me oh-so-wrong. When I began seeing the very nigh praise, the 93% on Rottentomatoes, etc. my low expectations became super high expectations. How often are expectations like that ever met? Well, I can at least say they weren't met. They were left in the dust, exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured. Bless Marvel, Whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right. Sure, Nolan has become the gold standard, but Whedon showed everyone that Marvel can do it too. 

My only regret is that Edward Norton couldn't reprise his role as Bruce Banner. Of the 3 Bruce's, he was the best. Mark Ruffalo was the worst. I like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms, but Edward captured the intellectual, frightened and loner aspect of Bruce Banner perfectly. Hulk, however, stole the show. Without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie, I will just say that Joss' inclusion of Hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae. 

While I can't imagine them topping this one, I've been so strongly surprised, I would never say never. The setup at the end of The Avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go. I even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie, but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film. Bring it on, Marvel. Excelsior! Nuff Said!!"
"Jun 16, 2018",positive,my favourite marvel movie what an experience this was in the cinema brilliant
"Jun 11, 2018",positive,Just the experience and hype alone give it 5 stars. And the rest is infinite.
"May 31, 2018",positive,"If this film did not accomplish what it did, then there would have been no sequel, no civil war, no spider man (outside of sony) no infinity war."
"May 28, 2018",positive,"WOW! The Avengers movie is amazing, one to be remembered. It brought characters that have had their own solo movies and brought them together with good humor, witty lines and a hell ton of action-packed scenes."
"May 27, 2018",positive,"a very good movie. A fantastic main villain, a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie. One of my complaints is that the chutari don't really stand out to me. They just seem like an alien race that was added so the avengers wouldn't be killing tons of people. But overall a very good movie."
"May 25, 2018",positive,My favorite avenger is Ironman but I like the second Avengers more! 
"May 25, 2018",positive,"Avengers is an awesome superhero film and every adjective- loud, brash, kickass applies. All the actors gathered do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen. The action is top notch and you might get a bit woozy even with all the stuff that happens on the screen. This is a movie event and it should not be missed under any circumstances (must watch superhero extravaganza)."
"May 21, 2018",positive,"Surprisingly lithe for all its heavyweights and the enormity of its universe and narrative scope. The jokes are just clever enough without becoming themselves overwhelming, the action remains in service of the story, and the plot keeps things relatively simple. Perhaps not as good as you remember, but better still than you might expect.

REWATCH: Placed in the context of the overall Marvel arc, with the first phase of films still fresh in the memory, the movie, though still formulaic, feels somehow more spontaneous and full of life---once again, explicitly even, what matters is not the overwhelming spectacle of different superpowers, but the common humanity of these characters joining forces, discovering who they can become and what they can overcome when put together."
"May 17, 2018",positive,"Definitivamente Marvel's The Avengers quedará en la historia como la película que hizo que la montaña Marvel creciera en cuestión de segundos. Inició todo un boom, hizo que varios sean fans de los cómics-si es que ya no lo eran desde Iron Man 1- y definitivamente por ser el primer megacrossover de franquicias superheroicias y el excelente trabajo de Josh Whedon, siempre tendrá un lugar en los corazones de cada cinéfilo. Avengers Assemble!"
"May 16, 2018",positive,The first Avengers is an excellent composition of characters that essentially launched the ensemble craze we see today.
"May 16, 2018",positive,Everything built to this..All the movies before this...and this movie justifies it.a great experience.
"May 13, 2018",positive,The Avengers combines great action while achieving a great superhero team up film.
"May 12, 2018",positive,"Following four years' worth of movies building up for this moment, ""The Avengers"" is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, by bringing together some of Earth's mightiest heroes. When the Asgardian prince Loki makes a deal with the leader of the Chituari army to subjugate Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury has to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this Alien threat. That includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and Hawkeye all teaming up to save the world, as hard as it might be interacting with each other, due to their different personalities. But this team-up works. The ensemble cast is perfect, especially Robert Downey Jr., which reprises his role as playboy-genius-billionaire Tony Stark. Joss Whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes shine. The characters are as complex as it gets, the humor is on point, the action is otherworldly and the most impressive at the time this film came out, the stakes are high and it just delivers on every level, living up to the expectations and the promises its predecessors created in the minds of the fans. All in all, it's pretty much the perfect comic book/superhero movie and the epitome of how all blockbusters should be made, filled with a little bit of everything to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for decades to come."
"May 10, 2018",positive,"I just went back and watched the original Avengers film and it is still Excellent!  I forgot a lot of the story and I'm very happy that I watched it again.  It also marks the first appearance of Thanos in the end credits.  Plus, I forgot the Avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some good fights between the heroes."
"May 9, 2018",positive,"OMG MOVIE OF A LIFETIME
SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. This movie has the exact amount of action, character development moments, interesting plot, smooth direction, and pumped up music. The only minor flaw is the technical errors in plot and 2% too much humor at uneccisary moments."
"May 6, 2018",positive,Best superhero team ever!
"May 5, 2018",positive,Still the greatest marvel movie of all time
"May 4, 2018",positive,Without any doubt the first best superhero movie...
"May 2, 2018",positive,So much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 1, 2018",positive,"As I've said for years, comic-book films struggle once they've told the origin story. This one is good--less of a ******* Batman story, but that's what some are looking for...the deeper more serious tale. Batman for adults, which is fine, but it's not what we're getting from Marvel films. Nolan has knows his ancient westerns civilization with his allusions to ancient Rome. I give it a solid B"
"Apr 29, 2018",positive,Still great after all these years to see them unite for the first time. 
"Apr 29, 2018",positive,"The first avengers movie, brings the classic heroes together, a little better than the sequel."
"Apr 29, 2018",positive,One of my favorite Marvel movies.
"Apr 28, 2018",positive,"It is difficult to underscore how special - epic, funny, and well executed - this movie was, especially for MCU fans. A compelling story and humour made this movie highly enjoyable to behold. And for anyone in love with this universe, it was all our childish dreams made real. Epic. Thank you, Marvel."
"Apr 27, 2018",negative,"DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE
I grew up with Marvel and have usually enjoyed their movies...unitl now. This movie is DARK and FULL OF DEATH. There is no happy ending and no heroes that come to the rescue. I can't imagine the impact it has on children who watch as Spiderman becomes fearful of his impending death, and I plan rthe greed of the producers who simply want to have a sequel and make more money. As for me, Marvel is dead in my book."
"Apr 27, 2018",positive,Excellent “popcorn” Adventure
"Apr 26, 2018",positive,"A first in superhero movies, a team-up story that triumphs and makes you feel like a kid again when you watch."
"Apr 26, 2018",positive,Great movie. Full of great characters and an amazing script 
"Apr 25, 2018",positive,Yeh how can you not love this movie. The one and only thing bad about it was Captain America's outfit and even that looked decent when he wasnt wearing the helmet. The way Weadon made these characters react with one enother was briliant. the action scences were spot on cool and Loki is still the Best MCU villian and he just made this movie awsome. The way the story played out so that the heroes didnt originaly come together as a teem but in end knew that the only way to stop the threat on earth was for the group of reemarcible people to come together. this movie was smassing.
"Apr 25, 2018",positive,An all around AWESOME MOVIE!!!
"Apr 25, 2018",positive,"pEOPLE ACTUALLY CRIED IN THE THEATER i WAS, QUITE GOOD INDEED."
"Apr 24, 2018",positive,"This will always have a special place in my heart, loved this movie"
"Apr 23, 2018",positive,A powerhouse film that brings superheroes to life in a way that could only be imagined in the pages of comic books before it.
"Apr 23, 2018",positive,"The very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this, and they nailed it, and it still holds up really well 6 years later. The characters have great chemistry and really feel like an actual team, the acting is perfect in every sense of the word, the action is great, and... yeah, theres really not much else I can say. While its almost guaranteed to be surpased by infinity war (which the reason I decided to watch this again is because infinity war is literally right around the corner at the time I'm typing this) its still a great superhero that is absolutely worth watching if you somehow haven't already."
"Apr 23, 2018",positive,"Strengths: It was always a crazy ambitious plan, but Marvel made the Avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined. Joss Whedon was the perfect person to write and direct this, as he seemed to fully understand what needed to be done. The movie juggles so many vital characters and none ever feel like an afterthought. Robert Downy Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), and Chris Hemsworth (Thor) are as great as they always are. Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk) steps in and provides an upgrade over Edward Norton. Speaking of the Hulk, this was the first movie to truly feel like it understood what the Hulk is supposed to be. He gets to absolutely wreck stuff. Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow) is honestly kind of a show stealer, while every scene she shares with Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye) is great. It's the kind of thing that was only put into the MCU during this film, yet worked very well. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is also a great villain choice, as he and the character have the charisma to line up next to his co-stars. The story has just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys. The conflict is not only against Loki and his army, but among the Avengers themselves. Two of the best scenes involve the members arguing on the ship, as well as fighting in the woods. As noted, each character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff, but the film also makes sure to give the fans what they want. Battles between Cap/Iron Man, Thor/Hulk, Thor's hammer and Cap's shield, etc. were all given attention. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is witty, and there are several laugh out loud moments, making it one of the funniest Marvel films ever. Of course, there's also the action, which is tremendous. There are several huge action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie. The final battle against the aliens in New York is grand, breathtaking, and features incredible team ups. 

Weaknesses: I'm sure it sounds weird to say, but I couldn't find any. This is the epitome of what the big blockbuster superhero movie should be. 

Overall: An incredible achievement. They handled so many moving parts with grace and the end result was the greatest superhero movie in history. The action, writing, performances, and way they respected the source material and characters were all done perfectly."
"Apr 23, 2018",positive,This is everything that a superhero movie should be. They really struck gold with this one. Then just copied the formula for all the Marvel movies after it.
"Apr 17, 2018",positive,Best superhero crossover movie ever!
"Apr 14, 2018",positive,"This movie was great,but overrated."
"Apr 12, 2018",positive,"One of my favorite movies of  all time and one of the best movies, period."
"Apr 10, 2018",positive,Dopest Movie!! Fight Scenes are good! Plot were excellent! The only thing I hate is that they killed off Agent Phil Coulson. I which he could've been part of the other MCU moives.
"Apr 9, 2018",positive,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that."
"Apr 4, 2018",positive,"This was everything we've been waiting to see plus more. Since they rolled out the first Iron Man in 08 they have been building towards this movie this moment and in my opinion it was better then anyone could ever imagine  that it would be, This is the best  comic book movie that is out right now(with the age of Ultron super close to being better).The storyline was great the look of the film can't be touch even though it was most of it was cgi. The action was just outta of hand great.Infinity wars is less then a month away and from the trailer its looks to be good but I will say that the first Avenger set the bar very high."
"Apr 3, 2018",positive,This is where we knew that we were just begieing our inrcidable MCU adventure!
"Apr 2, 2018",positive,"What a fantastic movie, from start to finish. What a thrill "
"Mar 31, 2018",negative,This seemed like a TV movie. I lost all love for Marvel movies because of this. I can't wait for a reboot.
"Mar 31, 2018",positive,"(92/100)
Finally, after five movies it is here: The Avengers. The way this is set up over a period of five movies is amazing and the movie really builds on these previous movies, providing some great character interactions and character moments. The dialogue scenes were so well executed and directed, Joss Whedon really knows his stuff. The action scenes were also fun and engaging without lacking stakes. The CGI was a bit noticeable in some areas but it stayed pretty consistent throughout the movie. Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is just phenomenal, not only the theme but the little motifs really give the score a distinct feel that goes along with the movie: The two cannot be separated. I really like that the movie continues the character's stories and fleshes them out even more, especially Bruce Banner and Natasha. We get a real insight into their characters. This is what the Marvel Cinematic Universe is all about: character, and they do it very well. Loki was a pretty one-note villain: conquer the Earth, it is my destiny, blah, blah, blah. But he did give the Avengers a difficult villain to fight, he was almost always one step ahead of the Avengers. Overall, The Avengers is a great entry in the MCU and definitely in my top 5 MCU movies for now, I would also consider it the best of Phase One."
"Mar 31, 2018",positive,Excellent. Great action. Great graphics. Great acting!!
"Mar 25, 2018",positive,"Overall, I loved this film when I first saw it nearly 4 years ago, and love it possibly even more now! It is a brilliant film, and really fives us all a taste of whats next to come in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Because of this, I am giving the film a 8.5/10."

"Mar 19, 2018",positive,Great way to finish phase 1! 
"Mar 17, 2018",neutral,"Cookie cutter film making at its most mediocre.  Same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world story that's been done over and over again to death.

I guess the dull masses don't mind seeing the same tired story again because this time, OMG, it's the Avengers!!

Aliens attack Earth en masse, but are repelled by a group of 6 exclusively white people, 2 of whom don't even have super powers (or a super suit).  LOL."
"Mar 16, 2018",positive,An epic and well constructed crossover event.
"Mar 13, 2018",positive,Reigns Supreme as the best Marvel movie
"Mar 12, 2018",positive,Great superhero film
"Mar 11, 2018",positive,I have a soft spot for team-up movies and this one had a lot of good teamwork action scenes. The Hulk and Thor fiasco is fun. Cap is a boy scout. Tony is a dick. Hawkeye and Black Widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times. Loki was an okay villain posing a big threat. It was fun.
"Mar 10, 2018",positive,"I absolutely LOVE this movie!!! My favorite MCU movie to date and tbh, I don’t think any other movie can pass it. It has a great storyline combined with awesome heroes and LOKI!! Need I say more? "
"Mar 10, 2018",positive,the most unexpected move by marvel. it is so well made and synchronized and the the timing of the movie's release was definitely right.  movie itself can feel overwhelming with the number of characters.

"Mar 2, 2018",positive,By far the best movie I've ever watched.
"Feb 26, 2018",positive,"My favorite marvel movie ever, everything about this movie is spectacular (except CGI hulk, Coulson’s fake death, and Nick fury being black (not racist, just not like comics)). Loki is a great villain but I definitely think they should have found a way to make him super powerful cause on his own he can’t beat Thor let alone the avengers, even with a random alien race on his side and a mine controlled scientist who has very little impact on this movie as opposed to the first two Thor movies"
"Feb 24, 2018",positive,Always will remember the first time I saw it in theaters will always find a place in my heart.
"Feb 21, 2018",positive,"An impressive screenplay allows the audience to become completely invested with characters that are given the right amount of time to be developed. However, despite the blisteringly entertaining action and impressive effects, I don't understand why people believe Loki is such a great villain. He's good for sure, but not the best the MCU has to offer. Doesn't change that this film is about as good as the MCU gets.

"Feb 14, 2018",positive,"Considered a modern classic by many, 'The Avengers' might be the most important comic book movie to date, and it's surely gained the love it's been receiving since its release date back in 2012. The cast is perfect, the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie couldn't be more satisfying. It is Marvel's biggest piece of art. Amazing."
"Feb 14, 2018",positive,The best superhero film I have ever seen! Delivers without fail on all fronts. ✓
"Feb 12, 2018",positive,all time best superhero movie.
"Feb 12, 2018",positive,"Despite some arbitrary plot points and a slow start, ""The Avengers"" is a creative, exciting, fun film that was definitely worth the wait."
"Feb 12, 2018",positive,A revolutionary film that set the standard for superhero films after it. It's excellent story only adds more to these pre-developed characters and entertains nerds and non-nerds alike. It aslo has one of the best villains proving that marvel can have good villains if they try.
"Feb 11, 2018",positive,"The team up of all the marvel heroes that we have been waiting for. In a move that I didn't think would work actually did. All these characters and egos working together seamlessly. Sure, there are flaws and plot holes, but they still work out to make an enjoyable movie going experience. With the Iron man leading up a team of reluctant heroes in order to save the world from Loki and his band of mindless minions. The three main heroes, Iron man, Captain America, and Thor, all shine through. The real surprise though is Hulk. Mark Ruffalo calls in a memorable performance to bring a smile to any comic book fan. His one liners and erratic behavior makes to an enjoyable performance. The one that is held back by the crowded lineup is Hawkeye. Set to be a mindless drone that does Loki's bidding for a majority of the film. This is a real waste of the talent of Jeremy Renner. The man can act with the best of them and he is assigned to a role that is forgettable. The directing style of Joss Whedon is felt for sure. His mannerisms and comedy is felt throughout this film. It feels like Firefly mixed with Buffy. Whitty dialogue mixed with great action set pieces. A must see. "
"Feb 10, 2018",positive,"One of the greatest superhero movies ever made. This film is undeniably beautiful, from the intriguing villain to the iconic assembly of The Avengers. The music is great with on point acting and a fantastic story. One of the strongest MCU movies, a well deserved 94%."

"Feb 2, 2018",negative,Rubbish. Who cares fight with gods
"Feb 2, 2018",positive,"This is the film that sold me to MCU forever. Everything was just perfect. Acting, performances, dialogue and especially the visuals. Not a single badly done CGI scene. Loki was a good villain. They still crack some silly jokes at serious moments, but I guess I can live with that since it has always been the Marvel formula."
"Feb 1, 2018",positive,A great beginning story for a team of characters with a great story and amazing actors
"Jan 26, 2018",positive,"Love, love, LOVE!! Great story, awesome characters and actors, and Loki.. need I say more? "
"Jan 26, 2018",positive,"After some of Marvel's previous movie attempts were big set ups for this movie, Marvel defies all expectations of people saying ""no way a superhero team-up movie could be successful and become the fifth highest grossing movie of all time"". Well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is what turned Marvel into one of the most recognisable studios today. ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a movie that succeeds in all ways."
"Jan 24, 2018",positive,Probably the best superhero movie I've seen to this day. I still get goosebumps from the new york fight scene.
"Jan 21, 2018",negative,"Maybe I gotta watch this again, but I literally couldn't keep my attention on this movie.  Cast seemed good, then I don't know what happened."
"Jan 20, 2018",positive,"This was the movie to either make the MCU or destroy it. If this was bad the MCU would be finished but if it was good we would be provided movie after movie. Thankfully it was the latter. This was a great movie. The movies before it were not the best. In fact the only truly great one was Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Thor just kind of failed. Captain America First Avenger was good but not great. The Avengers was even better than Iron Man, thankfully. It seemed that Kevin Feige finally understood not to overstuff the movie. In this movie there are many different superheroes on the screen at a time but it never feels overstuffed with plot like Iron Man 2. Sure everyone is dealing with something but it never makes the main plot feel insignificant. Also, unlike most of the MCU movies before it this movie has a good villain. It brings back Loki. Also this movie is directed by Joss Whedon who previously directed Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He did a great job. The plot of the movie is kind of stupid. Basically there is a giant beam in the sky and The Avengers need to stop it but the movie also is filled with great little moments that make it all better. Robert Downey Jr. as  Iron Man is great again. Chris Evans is good. Fortunately Edward Norton as the Hulk was replaced by Mark Ruffalo. The MCU has done a very good job with replacing actors with even better ones. Mark Ruffalo does a great job. Chris Hemsworth is again alright. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a great villain who is funny but also psychotic. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is a lot better in this movie than in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye actually has more than five lines now, unlike Thor, so I guess he is better but he is still everyone's least favourite Avenger. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Nick Fury. Clark Gregg as Coulson makes for an emotional thrill ride. The whole movie is just amazing. The first act is not great but it gets better very fast. Overall it is a great movie. Thumbs up."
"Jan 14, 2018",positive,The avengers are getting ready to work as a team to stop Loki can they do that and save people find out! Just a ok movie 
"Jan 7, 2018",positive,Best movie I have ever seen.
"Jan 5, 2018",positive,"As ""beginning of the end"", The Avengers is a powerful start. Less fun than others  maybe, but action packed and amazingly well crafted."
"Dec 31, 2017",positive,A movie that soars. one of the best marvel movies. and thats saying something.
"Dec 29, 2017",positive,"This is an amazing film with a future that will strive and never get old, plus its incredible cast makes this movie 5 stars!"
"Dec 29, 2017",positive,"Every MCU film raises the bar, both in terms of action and special effects, and in terms of the probing of what it means to be a human hero.

I like that my grandsons enjoy this, especially because it gives us shared entertainment and occasionally shared topics about what a ""hero"" is."
"Dec 28, 2017",positive,"This is how you make a successful movie franchise, an all star cast of Marvel characters hit the screen in the Avengers and pulls it off brilliantly, this film offers an action packed yet light on its feet, engaging plot, with lots of laughs, and a great ending.  Avengers is one of the best of the Marvel movies and shows how to do superhero actions films the right way."
"Dec 28, 2017",positive,"There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more...

The Avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off, bringing together some of Marvel's most iconic heroes. Incredible fun and humor throughout. In my opinion, the greatest comic book movie to date."
"Dec 25, 2017",positive,"First and best assemble up to this point. No, Civil War doesn't exceed this. Not even close. A summer flick done right. I will rave and defend this one forever."
"Dec 24, 2017",positive,"The 2012 Avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever, with the possible exception of the Dark Knight - really depends on what you want from your superhero movies.  A concept like this shouldn't work, but it does, and is so satisfying.  The interplay between these characters coming together for the first time starts out with them grating against each other, but eventually coming together to work well.  I don't think you could have gotten a better director to pull this behemoth off than Joss Whedon, who is very accustomed to large ensemble casts of very disparate characters.  This was a love letter to the fans, a self-congratulating showcase of an experiment that shouldn't have worked, but worked so well that every other studio is trying to find their own franchise universe, and a flag planted that nerd culture is on top and is planning to stay there for the forseeable future."
"Dec 24, 2017",positive,Loki's plan was terrible. The movie was hella fun to watch though. Marvel has this thing with faceless/robot armies... be more creative please.
"Dec 22, 2017",negative,"As an adult I can't say this was very enjoyable, but if you're a parent this might be a great one for the kids. There does seem to be a bit of violence though that may not be suitable, depending on strict your guidelines are.

Couldn't take this film seriously with grown men flying around in capes and costumes, and it seems a bit much for a kids film, so I have to give this a low rating."
"Dec 22, 2017",positive,"a very entertaining popcorn flick for everyone to enjoy! Funny, exciting and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more."
"Dec 21, 2017",positive,"For bringing in such big name characters from other movies and putting them together, it was pretty well done. There were some odd lines of humour that fell flat. Not crazy about the recasting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but a great cast otherwise. Pretty cool actions scenes especially at the climax of the film."
"Dec 21, 2017",positive,a great culmination that really pays off.
"Dec 20, 2017",positive,This is the movie that proved that the MCU worked. From beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre.
"Dec 20, 2017",positive,"I like this movie just fine, but I LOVE the second half of it with a passion. After the first hour of pretty interesting set-up, this movie takes off and never lets up for a minute, making it incredibly entertaining"
"Dec 19, 2017",positive,"After five stand-alone movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally adjoins to have six World War II, Norse mythology, and modern-era superheroes band together to fight alien-looking monsters with an iconic score blaring in the background. In other words, the first superhero crossover movie is finally here. After many movies behind its back, this movie is set to make five times the money. For too many years now, the concept of them banding together was nonexistent. There is no question why that scene of them standing in a circle, loaded up in the heart of New York, ready to fight for humanity was ever so important. If you are not sure why that is so meaningful to the audience of the movie, you may have not seen the post-credit scenes to every film beforehand (particularly Iron Man and Thor) as Samuel L. Jackson recruits members to his team.

Beforehand, it would have been clear not to anticipate the film. But now we can only thank director Joss Whedon for creating such a fun-filled thriller of a summer blockbuster. Whedon had previously been known for creating TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and can now claim his right to balance large-scale projects as a coherent piece. Having been trusted by such a project though, he seems to have forgotten the millions of Joker fans counting on him to make this entire film work together and instead saves space for Wizard of Oz, playing cards, and Asgardian family jokes. But the fact this still works makes you only love the film even more.

The amount of millions Hollywood has spent reintroducing these characters in movies may seem unnecessary. It is. Robert Downey Jr.'s character, Iron Man, is basically a billionaire tech-geek who owns an iron suit. Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Chris Evans's Captain America are both super-soldiers from non-modern times who have received the spotlight recently so they don't need stand-alone movies. In fact, the central Avenger who steals the show in this film has actually not been introduced before, at least not with this actor, is Bruce Banner, who has rage issues and turns into a green monster known as the Hulk.

These team members assemble with Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, an agent for Nick Fury, and Hawkeye, an archer for SHIELD portrayed by Jeremy Renner, who just came off of the smashing success of The Hurt Locker, in order to defeat an Asgardian known as Loki, who has come down to invade Earth. Loki is played by Tom Hiddleston and spends much of the movie demanding humans kneel before him without very dark intentions. It is almost a shame that this is the threat the Avengers are facing against.

As this cast and crew are set into action against this script and threat, a MacGuffin-type power cube which tends to always show up in any sci-fi action movie, The Avengers begins to follow its earlier themes and genres: a buddy-cop comedy. The fighting amongst the members of the Avengers in this film actually turns out to be rather refreshing, turning two-dimensional comic book characters into three-dimensional big-screen superheroes. While the script seems to be weak at times, it wins itself back through these conversational exchanges.

It is the action sequences that truly make this film what it was meant to be, while being easy to follow in the process. In a beautiful scene, SHIELD's helicarrier takes off into the air and in a similarly breathtaking action sequence, it gets destroyed by Loki's forces. They then return in the third act as Manhattan gets wrecked to pieces in an effort for the world to be saved.

The battles won seem reminiscent to our fantasies of superheroes saving us from external threats and avenging our world in outstanding action scenes. The film's title certainly displays avenging. While this is probably not the case, the film gives us a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the old-school light way. The nostalgic route the film chooses gives more heart rather than fear and plays well just at that, granting comic book fans their dreams. Even Hulk is granted heart as well as anger. The audience will feel the same way."
"Dec 18, 2017",positive,"Marvel Studios has managed to do the unthinkable and delivered a kick-ass movie experience. This movie is definitely one of the best works done by Marvel. Full of extraordinary action, well-timed humor, fleshed out characters with differing ideologies, and an actually compelling villain. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner and does a better job of bringing the character to life compared to Edward Norton's portrayal. This is how you do a team-up superhero film!"
"Dec 16, 2017",positive,"Puntaje Original: 8.5

Una historia emocionante y personajes magistralmente trabajados en una historia llena de heroísmo y magno entretenimiento."
"Dec 16, 2017",positive,"A simple story, but a stunning movie."
"Dec 12, 2017",positive,"It's the Avengers... It's amazeballs!!! (Appearantly I hadn't rated this, now I have)"
"Dec 5, 2017",positive,"One of the most original superhero films ever made. Marvel puts all these characters into one movie, and delivers great action scenes and a plot that doesn't fail to recruit the members in a logical way. Great movie and very watchable!"
"Dec 3, 2017",positive,"Great superhero movie. Just great. Even tho it’s got Iron Man in it. Clearly the worst Avenger. But apart from that it was funny, great action."
"Dec 3, 2017",positive,"The Avengers is an amazing movie. Seeing all these heroes come together after their 5 solo films. Seeing them interact with each other for the first time is great. I loved Joss Whedon's direction here, this movie is fun and action packed. Would recommend to anybody, even if they aren't a comic book movie fan."
"Dec 2, 2017",positive,"The apex of what a superhero story should look (and feel) like, this ensemble film is undeniably entertaining and fun while still exploring themes of loss, collaboration, and ego."
"Nov 30, 2017",positive,THIS WASSSSSSSSSS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GUDDDDDDDDDDDD
"Nov 25, 2017",positive,"this is a good movie with overall good story, characters, and relationship building."
"Nov 24, 2017",positive,"Not taking itself to seriously, and therefore allowing for a self aware fun time, Avengers is about as good as superhero movies should be"
"Nov 23, 2017",positive,This movie has grown on me a lot but there's still something about it that just bores me to death and keeps me from loving it.
"Nov 22, 2017",positive,Amazing! One of Marvel's best films!
"Nov 21, 2017",positive,"A fun team up movie that for some reason feels very shallow to me, I am one of the few who may have liked Age of Ultron just as much if not more. It is still a fun superhero romp and loved Downey's performance as well as Evans, Ruffalo's too.Some classic super hero movie scenes, like the Puny God and the superhero showdown near first 3rd/middle of film."
"Nov 20, 2017",positive,The Avengers creates a great story combining Marvel's greatest characters.
"Nov 20, 2017",positive,"Buena pelicula, la union de los superheroes mas importantes de Marvel, lo hacen de una forma grandiosa que deja al publico encantado."
"Nov 19, 2017",positive,"In a spectacular feat, ""The Avengers"" pulls its iconic franchises together for one of the most grounded, funnest, and all-around best superhero films ever made."
"Nov 19, 2017",positive,"I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.

The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional ""team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho."" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work ""the other side of the fence"" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.

The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.

I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE."
"Nov 19, 2017",positive,"This movie was fun, entertaining but not as good as they say. Marvel is overhyped. "
"Nov 18, 2017",positive,"great movie haha everytime i watch this, i laugh my ass off because Cap looks ridiculous in his spangley outfit, wtf joss haha"
"Nov 18, 2017",positive,"The Avengers is the culmination of all the past efforts of the MCU, and it pays off. Each actor captivates their character perfectly and have brilliant chemistry with one another. The movie also features the triumphant return of the franchises greatest villain, which then leads to nearly an entire third act of action, special effects, and witty humor. The Avengers is by far the start of an ever growing world that shows no sign of stopping."
"Nov 15, 2017",positive,"Nada original, mas de lo mismo"
"Nov 13, 2017",positive,BEST MARVEL STUDIOS FILM EVER.
"Nov 11, 2017",positive,Probably the best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie
"Nov 9, 2017",positive,The Avengers is a Marvel Movie done right!
"Nov 8, 2017",positive,All around great movie.
"Nov 6, 2017",positive,This one takes the cake!!! And I really like this flavor. Probably the greatest Marvel film to ever reach the screen!

"Nov 4, 2017",positive,"Action packed from start to finish, full of laughs, and wonderful to finally see everyone come together as a team. Also, Mark Ruffalo is the perfect Banner!"
"Nov 2, 2017",positive,"'Marvels The Avengers' have assembled for people to see
     Based on Marvel Comics The Avengers has finally hit the theatres with great quality and a excellent plot to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The director for this movie is Joss Whedon with actors Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner), and many other actors.  
     Messing with a source, of unlimited power: the tesseract, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings forth Thor's evil bother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  Now stealing the tesseract, he threatens to bring war and destruction unlike the world has ever seen.  With no choice, Fury calls upon a group of heroes to stop Loki for completing his plan and save the world from mass destruction. 
     What really drew me into watching this film was the drama that went with this plot also the action that made me wonder what would happen next.  Them bringing to life the comic that we loved so much to the main screen made me want to see if it would be like the comics we grew up reading or just garbage that people made to boost their rating.  As the movie began, I was already put into suspense with its beginning dialog and partial clips of an army getting ready for war.  Trying to bring together a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and never worked together can cause turmoil between them and start a fight between them.   
     I think the actors really played their parts well, with some slide remarks and being serious when the time came. Being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like that they really cared; not fake tears that you know they are faking it and don't care.  I really felt their struggle through the movie that they had to go through trying to work together as a team and being able to save the world from Loki. It made me feel like that if one of those characters died, I would have become sad because I felt connected to them and I would have felt their pain. The special effects in this movie were very excellent with the designs of the helicarrier and with the effects of every power that everyone had.  Even though that they were effects, the actors played though all the stunts and made it look like all the special effects were there and apart of them in any case that they needed to.  I feel that even if I didn't know the story beforehand or didn't read the comics, the story itself was a thriller in my eyes and pulled me in regardless if I didn't know anything about it. 
     The movie I think was way beyond its time and made a huge excess in all aspects of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that asked me. It gave me a thrill of excitement with the action and drama all in one movie. It made me never want to look away for a second because of being afraid of missing out on something. Therefore, I think that the movie The Avengers have assembled for everyone to see and to be excited for."
"Oct 31, 2017",positive,"Joss Whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up Pahse One of the MCU, brining all the heroes from previous instalments into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time. And he pulled it off flawlessly."
"Oct 29, 2017",positive,The Avengers: Marvel Skillfully builds from thier preveious predeccesor's to an action packed hollywood piece. One that keeps the idenity from their characters and is full of storytelling.
"Oct 24, 2017",positive,"The Avengers. A maniacal Marvel ensemble pinata party. Skip the obvious fun-ness of a solid lineup of charismatic heroes of well-made solo franchises, this is a good flick and not a great movie. I hate harping on ""believe-ability"" especially pertaining to sci-fi movies but there are massive, blazing plausibility issues within this story. Is a meager squadron of slow, un-stealthy, poorly armed aliens flying chariots through a single 100 ft. bottleneck over NYC, which is located in the United States, the largest and most dangerous arsenal in the world really an existential threat to the World Security Council, SHIELD, The Avengers, planet Earth? Thanos & Loki must have been high when they cooked up this plan. The Avengers were equally misguided in showing up for this fight considering the whole problem could've been solved by a single surface-to-air guided missile battery. Especially when the enemy can apparently be put down with punches, arrows and pistol caliber rounds. It wouldn't take Stonewall Jackson to stop this silly raid."
"Oct 23, 2017",positive,This movie is a great movie and is the best movie I have ever seen.
"Oct 15, 2017",positive,Yes Yes Yes! Perfection!!!
"Oct 13, 2017",positive,"The best. Loved how well they handled the characters and their personalities clashing against each other. The final battle in New York is breathtaking, only surpassed in my opinion by the final battle in its sequel."
"Oct 13, 2017",positive,"One of the best superhero movies of all time, The Avengers lives up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way. The acting, action, and special and practical effects are all superb, along with everything else."
"Oct 7, 2017",positive,COOLEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
"Oct 7, 2017",positive,The perfect superhero movie. Everything came together in this amazing comic book movie masterpiece.
"Sep 30, 2017",positive,100 percent amazing !! :)
"Sep 30, 2017",negative,Yes it's entertaining at first but it's ultimately forgetful and a movie for a low IQ audience with no thought or meaning.
"Sep 27, 2017",positive,Mind.........blown!!!!
"Sep 25, 2017",neutral,"Lots of great action and acting, but the story had a lot of illogic.  Kept driving me crazy."
"Sep 20, 2017",positive,this movie is a lot of fun and kicks off what we had been building towards in phase 1 great movie
"Sep 16, 2017",positive,"Even as a nearly lifelong comic book fan, when Marvel Studios first announced that they would be producing an Avengers film, I was skeptical on how it would turn out. Granted, they had just scored a hit with the wonderful first Iron Man film. However, since superhero movies until that point had mainly focused on a single character, how would Marvel flesh out six different heroes within one film? Flash-forward nearly four years later, and Marvel and Joss Whedon managed to construct not only one of my favorite installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also one of my top theater-going experiences of all time. I cannot add anything new to all of the praise that has been given to the performances of the leads, as they each give it their all. However, I would like to single out Mark Ruffalo in his first go-around as Dr. Bruce Banner. Though Edward Norton gave a capable performance in 2008's The Incredible Hulk, he wasn't necessarily overly memorable, in my opinion. Here though, Ruffalo truly conveys the pains and struggles experienced by Banner in his coming-to-grips with being the Hulk. Another positive that somewhat flies under the radar in this effects-driven film is its action scenes. Despite such a fantastical concept, the action appears believable and is tons of fun to just watch. It was the best action in the MCU to date, having only been rivaled by 2016's Captain America: Civil War in my book. The only weakness here is the invading Chitauri army that arrives in the film's third act, as they are largely an uncharacterized/faceless opposition. However, they utilization as an almost endless and unbeatable threat forgives this, as they help illustrate the residence of our heroes. All-in-all, The Avengers not to be missed by any fan, as it was the culmination of what the MCU was becoming and the springboard for everything else that was to come."
"Sep 11, 2017",positive,"For what it is, it is perfect."
"Sep 10, 2017",positive,MARVEL AT THERE BLOODY BEST!!!!!!!
"Sep 8, 2017",negative,"Audiences and critics loved that the Avengers are all white.  Thank God there are no minorities in the Avengers.  All sarcasm aside, this was such a mediocre movie -- a bunch of good guys get together to fight the bad guys and save the world.  Never seen that before.  Predictably, the good guys don't get along at first but they eventually come together to defend Earth from some seriously bland and generic aliens who aren't intimidating at all.
 
Coulson's death was supposed to be a pivotal moment in the film, but absolutely no one cared about him so that just totally fell flat.

Tom Hiddleston gave a very limp-wristed performance as Loki.  Apparently he reasoned that Loki sounds like ""low-key"" so why not play the character that way?

The action sequences were all lackluster.  Like all the other PG-13 comic book movies, the fights are all sanitized of blood, gore and anything that would be too violent.  Therefore, the fight scenes all suck.  But hey, at least the Avengers are all white, am I right?"
"Sep 7, 2017",positive,To this day I still enjoy watching this movie. All of the heroes have good pieces for each of them.
"Sep 6, 2017",positive,"I'll give ""The Avengers"" an A+, a 10/10, five stars ... evertthing. I'm not a Marvel fanboy. I like Marvel very much, much more than DC, but there's just something about this incredible franchise and universe. Joss Whedon knew what he was doing. ""The Avengers"" might be the best Marvel movie ever, at least from the Walt Disney era. I mean, couldn't we get better than this? This movie shows us how a blockbuster should be, how a super-hero movie should be done. The action and the CGI are fundamental, of course, but while we have these amazing characters, dialogues, music choices and conflicts, we'll be satisfied."
"Sep 5, 2017",positive,"""The Avengers"" is one example of how to make a perfect crossover movie, not too. All references and easter eggs were merged into this film. They are tied up every connection, interconnection, even the little detail, they show it and display it into one movie. Each of the shot, the visual effect, and the performance are quite brilliant except the script that doesn't kick too much. ""The Avengers"" is like an orgasm of each of the nerdiness. Everyone who watched this film, both Marvel's loyal fans, the comic books fans, the moviegoers, or even those who watched it from ""Iron Man"" would experience an orgasm of a nerd. What a great job by Joss Whedon."
"Sep 2, 2017",positive,"Marvel finally Mad a movie with all of the Avengers where they meet each other they must face Loki that would be Thor""s brother now it's time for Captain to give orders to the Avengers if they want to win! See this movie remember they made avengers 2"
"Aug 30, 2017",positive,I thought Avengers was a good one. The action and adventure is good. It is a good one in the Avengers Franchise.
"Aug 28, 2017",positive,Most likely the greatest superhero movie of all time.
"Aug 15, 2017",positive,"Despite arriving at a very early start for the MCU, ""The Avengers"" mark a point and separate for the modern era of cinema. The effects, performances and the excitement of seeing the most important heroes of Marvel make us enjoy more than 2 hours of footage as if to read a comic is about."
"Aug 12, 2017",positive,This is a really great movie.
"Aug 8, 2017",positive,"Standard formulaic superhero movie. It delivered on it's promise for action, comic relief and heroics."
"Aug 7, 2017",positive,"Great story, action, cgi and fantastic villian. This is my favorite comic book genre film all time!"
"Aug 6, 2017",positive,The action was great even though there was some down time.  Long but didn't seem too long
"Aug 5, 2017",positive,"Do you know the saying, know your audience??
Joss Weadon really gave the fans everything they've ever wanted in the first marvel team up."
"Aug 2, 2017",positive,"First off, where the heck did Loki come from? I really enjoyed the opening title music. I like the scene where they recruit Captain America to the Avengers. I liked how they cut from hero to hero in the recruiting process in the beginning, giving us a glimpse at what each hero was up to during their ""break"". I like how cap stays old fashioned. Captain America and Iron Man coming together and meeting for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at Civil War. The writers did a good job showing how they have to have altercations before they come together and they finally come together after a well needed push (Phil Coulson's death). One of the best scenes in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the Avengers as they come together before war. Also I really enjoyed when it cut seamlessly from Avenger to Avenger each fighting their individual battles in the war. Great ending to the end of MCU phase 1. I love Marvel because it combines the world we all know with that of a fictional universe to aid our imaginations in creating fantasies about a combination of these universes where anything is possible.

In the mid-credits scene the Other speaks to his master (undoubtedly Thanos) about the failed attack on earth.
In the end credit scene the Avenger are eating shawarma.

Stan Lee makes his appearance in a short news interviews saying ""Superheroes in New York? Give me a break""

Stone Tracker: The Tesseract is used by Loki in this film and now is in the hands of the Asgardians, it is known as The Space Stone."
"Aug 1, 2017",positive,"If i had to describe it with one word it would be:
MASTERPIECE."
"Jul 26, 2017",positive,It's just that: the Best Super Hero movie to date!
"Jul 20, 2017",positive,Pretty much all of it is good or amazing nothing bad or horrible. The one down side is captain Americas outfit looks ugly which is a shame since he is my favorite hero
"Jul 20, 2017",positive,The Avengers is the movie that all the Marvel movies have been leading up to and it lives up to the hype. I would give it a 9.3 because there is almost nothing wrong with it. Only a couple of minor details is there to complain about. Each of the characters are done so well and the story is just as interesting. If you have been living up to the hype in the past movies you have to see this movie.
"Jul 20, 2017",positive,"The Best Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ever it has everything to make a Comic Book die hard fan love it has a good story,great character interaction,good direction and a Great Soundtrack. Thank you Josh Whedon"
"Jul 20, 2017",positive,"A brilliant film, just seeing all the characters interact with each other is well written, the action scenes are incredible and Loki is a great motivational villain."
"Jul 16, 2017",positive,I really enjoyed it. A satisfying end to the beginning.
"Jul 14, 2017",positive,The Avengers is packed to the gills with action.  TO THE GILLS.
"Jul 13, 2017",positive,A childhood dream becoming true.
"Jul 13, 2017",positive,Probably still the best comic book movie of all time.  Thanks Joss!
"Jul 12, 2017",positive,top 3 or 4 marvel movies
"Jul 11, 2017",negative,Bad film like the rest of the Marvel universe.
"Jul 9, 2017",positive,The best superhero movie of all time.
"Jul 9, 2017",positive,"Oh yes, Phase One of the MCU goes out with one of the greatest movies of all time."
"Jul 9, 2017",positive,"Its great fun - a star studded cast that's clearly having a blast making this movie.

But I do think its a bit overhyped.  You know exactly how the movie will play out before you see it, and I didn't find the exploration of the characters to be as satisfying as I would have liked."
"Jul 8, 2017",negative,this is their best? it's still childish comic book nonsense even though i admit i've enjoyed the ironman movies.
"Jul 8, 2017",positive,Loved it! Lots of amazing and intense action.
"Jul 1, 2017",positive,A Marvelous and Outstanding movie.  The Avengers stands to be one of marvels greatest achievements.
"Jul 1, 2017",positive,Amazing Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo  Jeremy Renner Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were amazing
"Jul 1, 2017",positive,"For Marvel, it is probably its best effort in superhero films, if you like what family-oriented, standardized blockbuster's are all about."
"Jun 30, 2017",negative,I didn't think the Avengers movies can get any worse than the first one but it succeeded in that! Whoever writes these movies needs to pick up a freaking comic book and read it! All it is is special effects and with bad writing with bad acting! Hollywood you need to stop making bad comic book movies and start making some decent ones therefore I give this movie a F!
"Jun 25, 2017",positive,"9.5/10  Ambitious, well acted, and exciting, The Avengers is a breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking."
"Jun 24, 2017",positive,"It's funny, thoughtful, but also colorfully chaotic, The Avengers is that perfect super-sized team-up feature that benefits from years of build-up."
"Jun 17, 2017",positive,The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.
"Jun 14, 2017",positive,LOVED THE MOVIE.Good job marvel
"Jun 11, 2017",positive,"Seeing all these characters come together for the first time is great and the cast works really well together. Loki and the villain was great as well. I had a lot of fun watching this film. It is one of the best superhero films.

9.2/10"
"Jun 7, 2017",positive,This movie lived up to the hype!
"May 31, 2017",positive,"This film definitely lives up to the hype. The writing shows improvement since previous Marvel Studios films, making the dialogue purposeful and the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy. The choreography in the fight scenes is perfect, with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers. The CGI and visual effects are incredible, speaking of which, the Hulk's character model is improved as well, making him more realistic looking and actually resembling Mark Ruffalo, who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of Bruce Banner. Thor and Captain America seem to fit better as side characters in this film, and the interactions between them and Iron Man are full of chemistry. Robert Downey Jr. is on point as usual. Black Widow's character is improved, with Scarlett Johansson showing some emotional depth. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister. This film raised the bar for what Marvel Studios is capable of."
"May 31, 2017",positive,"In The Avengers, Marvel pulls off what no-one thought they could: They assembled the Avengers on the big screen. All five movies lead-up movies culminate in this ground-breaking film that actually works on nearly every level, and leaves you wanting more."
"May 30, 2017",positive,The Avengers is an almost perfect film that gives every single character their time to shine. A
"May 28, 2017",negative,Peccato per mia madre che mi ha chiamato sul finale!!!! Che fine ha fatto Loki???
"May 27, 2017",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't say more
"May 24, 2017",positive,"The Avengers is an amazing movie that has almost everything. It has action, good acting, good cinematography, and good wit. Overall, it is a definite recommendation of mine."
"May 23, 2017",positive,"'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all.

The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.

As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.

Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.

The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good.

This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy.

In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.

"May 14, 2017",positive,"Despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie, The Avengers is still a ton of fun. It really was a risk trying to make this movie happen, and it really payed off.

I still preferred The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man when it comes to superhero movies of 2012, but I still think this film kicks ass. 

9/10"
"May 3, 2017",positive,another amazing marvel movie.
"Apr 28, 2017",positive,"This film is a spectacle that leaves us dazzled the first time and entertained at-most with repeated viewings. The cast (most notably Johansson, Hiddleston, and newcomer Mark Ruffalo) are the highlights of this film, and are accompanied by great humour and entertaining action sequences. However, there is little-to-no plot to the film, and is really only a bunch of action sequences and quippy dialogue strung together to make an entertaining, popcorn flick."
"Apr 19, 2017",positive,Best comics book movie period. A++
"Apr 14, 2017",positive,"Funny, thrilling, smart, action-packed, and very cool to see. Great performances and Marvel smashing action. Even a few funny moments, too."
"Apr 1, 2017",positive,"A bit too crazy and didn't live up to my expectations as much. It was great, but could have been better"
"Mar 30, 2017",positive,"Kein Meisterwerk, aber sehr, sehr unterhaltsam!"
"Mar 28, 2017",positive,Greatest super hero movie ever!!! Don't fight me on this
"Mar 25, 2017",positive,"Grand, giant and perfectly connected movie (instead of Age of Ultron whereby there is a lack of connection). Just second to iron man 1, not easy to top."
"Mar 24, 2017",positive,Watching this movie multiple times may have dented my appreciation for how good it actually is. The characters all feel like they get their own part of the film and not over-shadowed by the others. Some genuine laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters. Maybe this was the time when a big swirling thing in the sky was a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale.
"Mar 23, 2017",negative,I kind of remember this movie. But none of it was any good. Long and boring.
"Mar 20, 2017",positive,"Although not the first super hero team up , but still this movie was better than X-men 1 and this also had great sense of humor and great performances by the actors."
"Mar 18, 2017",positive,"Incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2 due to its join up of other MCU characters. Therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies, The Avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my book. This is what marvel was building up in the MCU, and they showed up!  My Score: 99%"
"Mar 8, 2017",positive,"Although, at the time, it was nice seeing a number of superheroes in a single film for the very first time, the enjoyment wears off rather quick and The Avengers isn't all that entertaining."
"Mar 7, 2017",positive,"One of my favourite movies of all time.
Marvel pulled off what many thought couldn't be done. 
Just a fantastic film through and through. 
Though this isn't the longest review I have done, it is just I could go on for a very long time about how awesome this film is. Acting, action, everything is very, very good. 
95%."
"Mar 6, 2017",positive,"A fun romp, but don't expect anything more."
"Mar 4, 2017",negative,"Fabulous production of a mishmash of heroes where the villain has to be top, otherwise why call all of them? Superman, spiderman, batman are missing. Probably because they work for another government, or franchise. I thought that was a bit much in comic book form and I agree with myself in film form. It's already a stretch to live in one superhero world, mixing them make it so preposterous. It's like drinking wine and milk at the same time and that is for two. Add cognac, cranberry juice and tea and I feel like puking. A marvel of special effects though. Much too much."

"Mar 2, 2017",positive,This was a good movie
"Feb 26, 2017",positive,"The Avengers makes the best of what's come before and presents us with an epic comic book movie with well-developed characters, glorious combat and a worthy villain. The little character moments in between give this film a lighthearted tone."
"Feb 23, 2017",positive,Doesn't hold up and is somewhat a struggle to get through.
"Feb 21, 2017",positive,"A vast cheesy pizza, very loud, very long, making little sense, and with some very earnest and stiff acting. If only writer-director Joss Whedon had been less indulgent the whole thing would have been twice as much fun. Having said which, it's fine and exactly what any teenager would expect."
"Feb 20, 2017",positive,Best Marvel movie ever seen
"Feb 14, 2017",positive,"Fun, Lighthearted, Creative, Well-thought, and overall a great superhero film. They have been setting up for this since 2008 with the release of Iron Man and the final product of the set up turns out to be a great film. This is going to be a classic in the near future. Great example that you can make a comic-book accurate movie with great storytelling and designs."
"Feb 3, 2017",positive,"Me arrependo, um pouco."
"Feb 3, 2017",positive,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of those movies where you don't have to know a lot about the character's history to understand the movie. The actors do a good job with the characters, especially Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. With its gripping plot and talented cast, the first Avengers movie definitely set the tone for MCU"
"Feb 1, 2017",negative,"Superb acting, costume design, sets, etc... Unfortunately for me, my eyes could not stay open."
"Jan 28, 2017",positive,"Fun, hilarious and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has you engaged from beginning to end"
"Jan 25, 2017",positive,Very enjoyable. The avengers are not my favorite but this was awesome.
"Jan 23, 2017",positive,a little too corny for me. too many lame jokes but solid movie.
"Jan 18, 2017",positive,"This movie just doesn't hold up to repeat viewing. Lot of noisy action, a few jokes that work the first time, a character death that is later reversed, and worst of all, a silly argument that somehow leaves the high tech SHIELD base undefended. The three stars is for the fun of the first viewing."
"Jan 7, 2017",positive,This is a great movie! It has a great storyline and great action scenes! Loved it!
"Jan 6, 2017",positive,Easily one of the best superhero movies of all time.
"Jan 1, 2017",positive,"Did The Avengers Deliver? Yes, but it also gave us a fun ramped up experience with much to love about these character portrayals who we have seen(Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is the only changed choice who is still great). Tom Hiddleston delivers his signature move as Loki, the action is guys tossing each other(in a good way), and we also got funny moments. The plot holes may have sometimes bothered me,but not TOTALLY! We still haven't gotten to my favorite MCU Movie(can you guess?), but this is possibly #3 or #4.I hope you love this blockbuster!"
"Dec 30, 2016",positive,"Fantastico, una sceneggiatura stupenda degli effetti speciali e un cast perfetto, finalmente un Hulk degno del nome"
"Dec 21, 2016",positive,So amazing! I'm not huge on super hero films but I really enjoyed this. Also hulk is the best
"Dec 15, 2016",positive,Avengers is a cinematic block busters experince  aggregating all the previous marvel movies and turning it into a massive grandious movie making both fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material
"Dec 14, 2016",positive,The first assemble of the Avengers is groundbreaking but has it's faults.
"Dec 7, 2016",positive,amazing that joss got this to work and it rocks lol
"Dec 4, 2016",positive,"Fun, but let's be honest, it doesn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action."
"Dec 2, 2016",positive,"the avengers was my favorite superhero movie at the time it came out but at that time, I haven't seen the dark knight. the film was new at the time but  now that we've gotten the same thing over and over again, it's not a masterpiece anymore. the actually battle at the end is great but the rest of the buildup is boring and takes way too long to set up each character instead having the audience watch the previous marvel films instead of being an asshole to the fans.


Owens grade: B-"
"Nov 30, 2016",positive,"Entertaining, a total crowd-pleaser, and everybody is clearly having a good time; but the whole affair is directed like a television show, and Whedon's ideas can never overcome the framework the studio has placed the story in."
"Nov 30, 2016",positive,"Still my favorite Marvel movie! The action, plot, acting, and set pieces are just magnificent and well-done!! Highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet!!"
"Nov 23, 2016",positive,One of the best superhero movies.
"Nov 22, 2016",negative,i h8 how batmman is not here :(
"Nov 12, 2016",positive,I suppose when you're juggling so many good guys the bad guys become an after-thought? Outside of Loki this was very much cannon-fodder bad guys again but the balance between the Avengers was so well done you almost don't notice.
"Nov 12, 2016",positive,"What an incredible movie. An AMAZING cast, who all give great performances, wonderful special effects, a good score, and a truly amazing story, The Avengers set the bar for super hero films, while doing something never really done before: a multi character crossover--that worked. Bringing together 5 films of mythos, this movie accomplished the impossible, bringing the heroes from each film together and making them work in an action packed, suspenseful, terrific film."
"Nov 8, 2016",positive,Greatest superhero film of all time. Nuff' said.
"Nov 7, 2016",positive,"Iron Man is humorous, Captain America is cool, the Hulk is awe-some and this movie is my favorite superhero movie!"
"Nov 4, 2016",positive,Awesome best movie of the year. Must see this.
"Oct 29, 2016",positive,Marvels best movie ever
"Oct 28, 2016",positive,"A movie that we thought we be impossible to make, Whedon makes every comic book fan's dreams come true as he brilliantly portrays Earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen. Bravo Mr. Whedon."
"Oct 22, 2016",positive,"4,5/5 Ratings for The Avengers 
F: 92%
R : 8%
Science Fantasy Action"
"Oct 16, 2016",positive,Great fun for fans of the characters
"Oct 14, 2016",positive,AN AMAZING SUPERHERO MOVIE & AN AMAZING CROSSOVER MOVIE! A MUST WATCH! IT'S AWESOME!
"Oct 10, 2016",positive,One of the best comic book screen adaptations ever. There really much else to say.
"Oct 10, 2016",positive,One of the greatest films of all time
"Oct 9, 2016",positive,one of the best super hero movies ever
"Oct 5, 2016",positive,"This movie is great. It's funny, it's action packed, and when it needs to be serious, it handles being serious very well."
"Sep 26, 2016",positive,"The Avengers is so amazing, it's everything I wanted it to be and more. avengers is a really great movie, this is the best marvel movie, the avengers is a masterpiece, the story/writing/directing/script are great, the characters/acting and dialogue are great, the action is amazing, the visual effects are amazing, the soundtrack is great, it's just perfect, this is the best summer movie, it's so fun, but there are problems, the first 5 minutes aren't that good, but we're alright, the action scene saved it, and the last problem with the movie is that it's not the movie that you could rewatch, but it works fine. But besides that, the movie is great, it's very entertaining, very fun and everyone who has seen the movie loves it even I love it."
"Sep 24, 2016",positive,"The pay-off after years of waiting for Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Widow, and Hawkeye to join forces. If you didn't like it, the 5 seconds of hulk smash puny god makes this a unique movie, that no other character, or director could have pulled off. Highly enjoyable."
"Sep 21, 2016",positive,Fun and action-packed.
"Sep 17, 2016",positive,"This movie was not only great on first watching, but it keeps bringing me back to view my favorite clips and sections. The characterization is what really drives the movie. Yes, the CGI work is very good and the musical score is excellent. But it's the little details that make the characters feel real and involved that bring you along for the ride. One of my favorite tiny moments is the ""I don't...I don't see how that's a party"" line from Black Widow. In that one line, we're given a brief reminder that this is a very skilled human used to fighting very skilled human spies, who's now fighting aliens and monsters of epic proportions without the benefit of the near invulnerability of the super-powered individuals around her. Other brief favorites: the moped. ""Hulk...Smash!"" ""Puny god"" "" I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that."" So many great moments that tie things together."
"Sep 8, 2016",positive,"As a big Marvel fan, this will probably be a bit biased, but I absolutely loved this movie. This was the movie that really got me into the Marvel franchise, with its great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best thespians in the business. The fact that it was also the first multi-superhero movie was the cherry on the cake for me. I also appreciated the humor scattered throughout that lightened the mood just enough."
"Sep 8, 2016",positive,How nostalgic can it get.
"Sep 5, 2016",positive,"The movie event of our generation has some flaws, but is some of the most fun you'll have at the movies"
"Sep 4, 2016",positive,"The ultimate comic book movie. Better than Dark Knight in my eyes. It was funny, the villain is great, and it's the definition of fun."
"Sep 4, 2016",positive,"Tested the limits of how many superheros can be in one film without combusting, and it passed with flying colors."
"Sep 3, 2016",positive,"The Avengers is considerably overrated when it is claimed as the ""greatest superhero movie ever!"" It's praised for being smartly thought out and having verve and precision with it's execution, but in reality, it's not all that clever or even that great it is asserted to be. The Avengers is a key example of ""style over substance."" It possesses idealistic action sequence that are stunning to behold, but it's overall writing interpretation -- which is the most important aspect -- feels wooden and dull. However, it created a pleasurable experience for me at the movie theater as it's level of enjoyability was at the peak of the mountain."
"Aug 31, 2016",positive,"I think the ratings should be higher than 92%, but that's my opinion. You have to remember that this movie came out with so much hype and it definitely delivered in my book. Not quite 5 stars but 4.5 stars is about right."
"Aug 28, 2016",positive,"Tracking Shot. Everyone who worked on this movie needs a T-shirt that says ""I piss excellence."""
"Aug 27, 2016",positive,"Not what I was expecting at all! I honestly wasn’t expecting such immense troubles forming the Avengers, but after they were formed, after overcoming their differences, they were simply E P I C. The ending fight/action scene was amazing, and I enjoyed it very much! The powerful team that they formed was terrific, and the way they demolished the opposition and style of writing, and witty humour made this film worthwhile to watch. After all, this was a very anticipated film when it came out 7 years ago in 2012. :)"
"Aug 26, 2016",positive,Really good with they had hulk from 2008
"Aug 21, 2016",positive,"Visually dazzling, action-packed and even packed with humour to lighten the mood a little, The Avengers is not only an amazing conclusion to Phase One of the MCU but it is also one of the best Marvel films to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun in the highest-grossing film of 2012."
"Aug 17, 2016",positive,"Spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast. The Avengers delivers on essentially every level to provide an engaging story with likable, distinguishable characters."
"Aug 13, 2016",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers will be forever known for raising the bar of superhero films to unprecedented levels, it's also one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie."
"Aug 10, 2016",positive,"Tom Hiddleston and Robert Downey Jr. simply carry this movie that do not have much to hold it down, the special effects are flawless, the script is ingenious and the performances fit the whole perfectly."
"Aug 10, 2016",positive,"The generic wipe-out ending for the 'Chitauri' perhaps should of had the technological/biological space-headquarters merely render there weapons and gadgets useless, rather than the default death they received."
"Aug 9, 2016",positive,"It's literally a comic book come to life, and by that I mean one of the great all time comic stories. It has everything you want and much much more. Whedon shows not only his writing genius but his genuine LOVE for the genre, bringing comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece. Quite literally the Star Wars of superhero movies."
"Aug 8, 2016",positive,"There may never be another film moment like the Avenger's together defending New York City, and it's wrapped inside an intricate story with complexity and heart."
"Aug 8, 2016",positive,"An epic,marvellous,humorous,meaningful,spectacular movie.. This is the movie we deserve..This is the best in the MCU and bringing out the Avengers together was done in an outstanding way."
"Aug 7, 2016",positive,"If you like 'Iron Man', you'll like this movie. If you like 'Thor' you'll like this movie. If you like 'Hulk' you will like this movie. Overall... you will love this film."
"Aug 7, 2016",positive,One of the best superhero films to date with great chemistry between the casts. Worth a watch for any superhero fan.
"Aug 6, 2016",positive,Muy buen comienzo para unir a los superhéroes.
"Aug 5, 2016",positive,Not as good as the critics said.  But a good action movie.  4 stars.
"Aug 4, 2016",positive,Superhero team movie done right. Whedon makes even the most fantastical conversation sound real and natural and weaves it organically into an action blockbuster.
"Aug 4, 2016",positive,Best movie of all time
"Aug 3, 2016",negative,Overrated. First half is dragging and boring. Some action scenes are recycled from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Superman Returns. Marvel's 2nd choice actress Scarlett as Black Widow is pathetic. She lacks the athetlicism and physique to pull off Black Widow. Marvel should've made it work with Emily Blunt.
"Aug 3, 2016",negative,"Cookie cutter story. Recycled themes and characters from previous Marvel films. Weak new characters. Annoying old characters. All with a climatic fight against generic, forgettable alien robots. Do yourself a favor and never see this waste of film."
"Aug 3, 2016",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is that one ""awesome"" superhero movie that gives a lot of action and storytelling to characters that have been building up for the past 5 movies."
"Aug 2, 2016",positive,"one of the best superhero movie's I've ever seen, sure it might be ever so slightly dated at this point, but the reason its so iconic is because it revolutionized Hollywood for better or worse, the avengers and films like the dark knight segmented their place in comic book movie history."
"Jul 31, 2016",positive,I liked it a lot. There was lots of awesome action and comedy
"Jul 26, 2016",positive,This movie brings the most famous Avengers of the Marvel Comics to on screen which lives up to the hype of the movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes.
"Jul 25, 2016",positive,Avengers is an unbelievable action film!
"Jul 25, 2016",positive,Avengers Assemble! This is an instant classic and it sure does deliver
"Jul 24, 2016",positive,Forgettable but enjoyable.
"Jul 17, 2016",positive,Not bad at all there Hollywood
"Jul 14, 2016",positive,Fantastically fun way to launch the superhero ensemble idea. I loved the way starks ego centric nature just runs away with it as the others find their ground around him. Best thing in the whole thing is Loki ofcourse. Still Marvels best vilian; such a fun character and hiddleston clearly is having a ball. Set the bar and showed if you approach it right. A multi character super hero film can work
"Jul 13, 2016",positive,"In the summer of 2012, I saw this movie 5 times in the cinema with my friends."
"Jul 10, 2016",positive,5/5.  Even better that I could have hoped for.
"Jul 10, 2016",positive,"The Avengers is a fun action packed movie with great characters and a good story. All of the heroes must come together to fight off the destruction of Earth. Loki is a great villain again. Despite the fact this film must find a way to balance so many larger than life characters, it still manages to be a great film."
"Jul 10, 2016",positive,"With the MCU becoming more and more seasoned with it's films, I feel that none of it can compare to the very zenith of the franchise: The Avengers. This film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the all-time great movie villains, impressive set pieces, tied  together by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what it means to be a true hero."
"Jul 10, 2016",positive,A decent enough film to hold the attention and entertain. Much more enjoyable having seen the preceding marvel films.
"Jul 6, 2016",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Jul 3, 2016",positive,The best movie ever!
"Jul 1, 2016",positive,Marvel's The Avengers is action-packed and entertaining. Marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in one great battle. This movie couldn't be more perfect. I would very much suggest this movie.
"Jun 30, 2016",positive,An enjoyable film you won't want to miss.
"Jun 28, 2016",positive,"The humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most entertaining parts. Giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a giant hole in the sky provided targets for the superheroes display of fire power and muscle. Team work is good but in the end, only ironman must take the prize to save the day."
"Jun 25, 2016",positive,I was left expecting more from an ensemble cast of characters that mostly had their own movies.  I mean shouldn't they have had ample time to practice and prepare?  The pacing was also a little janky.
"Jun 23, 2016",positive,Redefined modern cinema in such a great way. Amazing movie. Nothing more can be said.
"Jun 23, 2016",positive,"""The Avengers"" is basically everything you'd want it to be. Dazzling special effects, supercharged action, delicious dialogues, an excellent sense of humour that borders on witty self-parody and, at the heart of all this, a bunch of individually interesting superheroes who, despite their personality clashes, eventually manage to pull off some tremendously glorious team work. Whedon and co. go for it from the first second up until the last and set a prime example for grand superhero flicks."
"Jun 22, 2016",negative,Mis-matched abilities.
"Jun 20, 2016",positive,One of the best avengers movie better than age of ultron
"Jun 12, 2016",positive,"This  movie is what you'd think it'd be like, awesome and kick ass. The movie is filled to the brim with action, clever humor, and one liners that, in the end, each play beautifully of eachother. The only problem I have with the movie, however, is it's plot isn't really the best nor memorable, but it's way overshadowed by everything else in this movie that, thankfully, makes it one hell of a ride that you can watch ovar and over and over again."
"Jun 11, 2016",positive,big battles lots of hero's enough said
"Jun 9, 2016",positive,"Possibly the very definition of a comic book movie, The Avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that pays off in every way. Probably the best decision they made in this movie was to recast Edward Norton as Hulk. Ruffalo blows him out of the water and then some as the green giant."
"Jun 8, 2016",positive,"My 3rd favorite MCU movie, this cast....effects....it's so much to handle! This movie got MCU on the the map!"
"Jun 7, 2016",positive,Good story; liked when the Avengers formed!
"Jun 7, 2016",positive,"The third-best MCU movie, The Avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that all pays off. We got seriously lucky that this film was as good as it was. When I first saw this in theaters, my immediate thought was ""Let's see that again."" It's only gotten better with each viewing."
"Jun 6, 2016",positive,I love this movie! but black widow could have been better!
"Jun 5, 2016",positive,"MARVEL STUDIOS... I LOVE U! BEST MOVIE STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD!! If people didn't LOVE this, something is wrong with them!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!"
"May 28, 2016",positive,This movie is great! The Avengers are assembled!!!!
"May 27, 2016",positive,"94%     The Avengers is more proof that marvel always delivers, and this movie set a new standard for superhero films. It is as fun to watch as are the characters, and is action packed, at times funny, and united the team of ass-kickers with brilliant results."
"May 25, 2016",positive,A film with every chance to fail on every step in bringing Earth's mightest heroes together on screen surprisingly shows nice balance and dinamics.
"May 25, 2016",positive,"One word: Awesome!! my 2nd best marvel movie. I admit, it is a little overrated. But the positives are stronger than the negatives for this movie. It's Action-Packed, funny, and convincing. It didn't feel overstuffed at all. Definitely worth the wait and hype. I watched it maybe like 4 times now and still ain't bored of it.

Overall score: 9/10 (Amazing).
As a fan of superhero movies, I'd probably rate this a 10/10
but from a filmmaking & casual movie go-er's perspective (Meaning realistic) I'll stick with a 9/10, Highly recommended for everyone to watch."
"May 24, 2016",negative,"Visually it is a marvel (pardon the pun), but it feels generic and flimsy."
"May 22, 2016",positive,before civil war came out his was my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done.
"May 18, 2016",positive,"The Avengers is no doubt the best Avengers movie and is very close to the best Marvel movie and the best comic book movie, has all the elements required for a box office success and a movie to make the mainstream audience happy, the comic book fans and the MCU fans."
"May 17, 2016",positive,Perfect in every way!
"May 17, 2016",positive,"Marvel set up years of crafting The Avengers and building a unique and vastly more dangerous universe than ours. And Joss Whedon helms this behemoth of a film to continually stun and amaze audiences around the globe that something based on comic books can be dealt upon, and you can make modern masterpieces from them. Albeit the film is not perfect, but so are our heroes who actually do care for people and they think and work together to keep the world safe. Once again with solid performances, a deceptively amusing villain, group-sized action against a seemingly unstoppable horde of baddies, and more...The Avengers is pure definition of marvelous."
"May 16, 2016",positive,An amazing film that changed comic book films forever
"May 14, 2016",positive,"Marvelous in every way, Marvel's Avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the (if not THE) greatest superhero movie(s) of all time."
"May 14, 2016",positive,"Witty and brilliant, The Avengers has been built up by Marvel since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008, and will continue to amaze viewers for decades to come. This is a movie any comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see."
"May 14, 2016",positive,"Finalmente possiamo gustarci quello che tanto aspettavamo, vedere i famigerati Avengers operare tutti insieme in un unico grande film. E' un tripudio di azione ed effetti speciali che riesce a divertire e coinvolgere con estrema facilità. I singoli film precedenti vengono collegati e ricostruiti alla perfezione, con una sceneggiatura intelligente e complessa, con personaggi già noti e quindi ben re-integrati: il modo perfetto per chiudere questa prima fase di film, che ha avuto i suoi alti e bassi. Per ora resta senza dubbio il migliore film della Marvel, che dimostra di essere riuscita nel suo intento di dare vita ad una serie di fumetti così interessanti."
"May 12, 2016",positive,It was so cool can't wait for the next movie
"May 11, 2016",positive,"Finally!! It's here, this film was absolutely everything I wanted, the superhero chemistry was spot on terrific, perfect plot and end to Phase One, the avengers are now assembled, and can't wait for Phase Two!"
"May 10, 2016",positive,"Pat Kiernan, along with many other reporters, discussed the Avengers and the Battle of New York, and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared."
"May 9, 2016",negative,it was dumb no real plot except for iorn man having bad days.
"May 9, 2016",positive,"Have you ever felt like solo films like Superman and Batman solo films are getting old, if so Marvel's The Avengers is the movie for you. Director Joss Whedon unlocks the future of Superhero team ups, LIke Batman Vs Superman."
"May 8, 2016",positive,"Fun film, but Loki doesn't make that great of a villain for this super hero squad."
"May 8, 2016",positive,"There's no arguing that this was the best Marvel movie up until this point - and up until Captain America: Civil War happened. With surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast, it may not be the revolution in Superhero film which was the Dark Knight, but nonetheless tries its best and still produces a very good movie for everyone to enjoy.
Verdict: A"
"May 6, 2016",positive,"The Avengers is very exhilarating in action and definitely amazement! From the solo movies of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor, the Avengers plays a huge part in the MCU.

"May 5, 2016",positive,An almost perfect superhero movie.

"May 3, 2016",positive,Well balanced action and character development. Stark's sarcifice emotionally worth it. Decent amount of each character plot as well as pure entertainment time.
"May 1, 2016",positive,"You can say, that this is the best crossover in the history of super hero movies, aaaaand you're god damn right ! ECIT (07/05/2016) : Civil war just beat it sooo it's the second best croosover"
"May 1, 2016",positive,"When it comes to movies, the Avengers is the best one out there. It's funny, dark, fun, and still an epic action movie I don't know how Avengers Age of Ultron will top this, but if it does I'm going to cry. With tears of joy. So if your looking for a good action movie, comedy, or superhero movie. The Avengers will do all that, and more."

"Apr 29, 2016",positive,fantasticly fun way to launch the superhero ensemble idea. I loved the way starks ego centric nature just runs away with it as the others find their ground around him. best thing in the whole thing is loki. such a fun character and hiddleston clearly is having a ball
"Apr 28, 2016",positive,"The Avengers was so much fun and Marvel absolutely nailed it! Let me explain what I loved!

Positives:
1. The characters; this is a no brainer! Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film!

2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie.

3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them. If these characters hadn't been characterized properly, and it didn't have a well made story then this film would've probably turned out like a Transformers movie. Thankfully that was not the case and all the action was awesome!

Overall:
I have no cons with this film that I can think of. The Avengers is one of the best comic book films I've ever seen! It is by far one of the best things Marvel has ever done and it was one of the most fun I've had watching a movie! Even if you aren't a comic book fan I guarantee you will enjoy this film! Don't go into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like Transformers, this film is a lot more deep than that."
"Apr 28, 2016",positive,"Joss Whedon did an amazing job bringing Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America together. The final battle does a masterful job bringing the team together. A phenomenal end to Phase 1."
"Apr 26, 2016",negative,"Ah! The Avengers! How I hate this movie! It is overrated and over-popular beyond words and has nothing which makes a film great. The only things it has are good special effects and a nice soundtrack - factors which are only superficial in nature and cannot make anything good. It's story is filled with plot-holes and characterization and character development is below sub-par. The story doesn't even try to explore any themes and the whole thing is just one huge galore of special effects.

On the other hand, there are good films of the same genre such as The Dark Knight and The Incredibles which do not receive the same fame and popularity such as this one ,despite the fact that they are far better in terms of storytelling, characterization, theme exploration and have far more innovation. The Avengers, on the other hand has zero innovation and it's story is full of plot holes.

The visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing about the movie which is good. The explosions, spaceships, villains, weapons, Iron Man's suit, everything looks realistic and wonderful. Of course, that is to be expected with the technology of today. The sound section is also nothing to complain about. The sound amplifies the action and makes one excited about it. Other than that, I found it quite forgettable. The acting is decent. Robert Downey Jr. as always, speaks as fast as a cheetah runs which is why people who are not so great at English may need subtitles. Not that the things he is saying is deep or meaningful.

Now that I've finished with the good parts of the movie, I can now explain why the story and characters are s**t. I have already said that the story has zero innovation and is totally formulaic. The story is about the trademark superheroes fighting a villain bent on conquering the world with the power of a magical object. So original, right? The heroes find the villain who separates them but they come back together almost immediately and fight the villain and his huge army in a large metropolitan city. 

Even if you have not seen the movie, you should be able to tell how the movie is going to end. Of course, our heroes are going to win and our villains are going to lose. As mentioned earlier, there are a large number of plot holes and plot conveniences. Those who haven't seen the movie may skip this although I don't know why you would want to (after all the movie was released four years ago).

:-I'll begin with the most obvious, why was Banner able to transform into Hulk? If he is ""always angry"" as he says he is, why isn't he constantly in the Hulk form? Also, he got angry earlier in the movie, due to which he turned into Hulk. Totally not a plot convenience. 
:-Why do the Avengers start fighting just because SHIELD is making weapons using the Tesseract? In fact, seeing all the extraterrestrial things in this world, that is the only logical thing to do! That's no reason to fight! They should instead be looking for it and helping SHIELD create the weapons!
:-Why didn't Loki run away when Thor and Iron Man were fighting each other? Scrap that, why didn't he fight Iron Man and Captain America together? Don't tell me it was his plan to get captured. First of all, that's directly taken out of The Dark Knight and secondly, the plan was flawed. Don't tell me he made that s***ty plan in ten seconds!         
:-Where are Spiderman, Fantastic Four, DEADPOOL, Daredevil and most of all, the X-MEN! At least they could've given a one line explanation on this! Why didn't they bring the X-Men? They were fighting an extraterrestrial WAR for god's sake! You don't send six soldiers into a war! Not even when one of them is a god! Even Magneto would probably help them!
:-If Loki really wanted to take over the world, why didn't he just hypnotize all the important people (e.g. The President of America) as well as all the Avengers to do his bidding? He could've taken over the world in an instant!
:-After the invasion, in a post credits scene, the Avengers  are seen together in a shawarma stall, eating! WTF! An extraterrestrial invasion just happened and a shawarma stall is still open and serving it's customers! I know that was just for comedy, but seriously! WTF!
:-The villains are defeated, the invasion is over, and Nick Fury gives the Tesseract and the villain(Loki) to Thor to take to Asgard for imprisonment. It's a very strange thing that there are no protestors on the road protesting to kill Loki in Earth itself. Nobody has done anything to the Avengers to make them compensate for the losses done to New York city because of them. How is that possible? There should be a mob below the Stark building demanding the death of Iron Man.


And this movie was nominated for Best Writing in a particular award ceremony! In fact, one whole hour was spent in pointless battles and the destruction of a major city where only the ending mattered. The ending was a total cop out which saw the death of an entire army due the destruction of a single spaceship. Why? Because the movie has to end sometime! That's why! 

Now that I've established how bad the story is, I will talk about the characters. It may seem that the movie has no need of character introduction and development as each character has a movie of it's own. This is partly true. However, the characters are STILL not developed. The Avengers include - a billionaire who fights in iron suit, a god, a soldier from the times of World War II and a scientist which can go Super Saiyan an becoming angry. How relatable!

In each of their respective movies, they have to fight a villain having similar powers as them (yes, they have similar powers) while building their romance with girl X. They do not face any other problem such as getting divorced, going bankrupt, etc. Any such problem will only be a backdrop. The end of the movie will see the villain defeated , the hero victorious and the hero and the girl in a strong relationship. The hero will not be seen in any other problem such as failure(except if they are fighting the villain for the first time), loss, change,etc. All problems mostly revolve the external force(i.e.the villain). This makes them completely unrelatable.

In case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie, The Incredibles had it's main character fired from his job and The Dark Knight saw Bruce Wayne's ideals being challenged. No such thing is    
seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I'll admit that Iron Man and Thor had development. However, they were the only ones. The characters then developed into very similar archetypes. As individual movies, that was very good, but they were a part of a larger universe. Thus, characters being fully developed there was a bad thing because it finally made the characters (in the Avengers) quite boring as they were all good and had absolutely no bad qualities. The heroes were just 'good guys' and that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie.      

The villains are mostly faceless mooks who are only there to cause destruction and be defeated by the heroes. It is not even known who they were. Loki ,on the other hand, is the best MARVEL movie villain. That's a great thing, right? No. No it isn't. He's just the best looking thrash in the garbage bin. Having more backdrop and personality makes him better than the rest of those idiots who were just there to be defeated by the hero.

And the s**t still doesn't end there! I can go on about how everyone's powers are broken (yes they are broken!) and how Loki was an idiot for keeping the main energy source on top of Stark Tower and how the heroes grieved over the death of a secondary character saying ""He never showed you his Captain America Vintage Card Collection"". That character too was bland beyond words and received no fleshing out or development (except maybe in the T.V. series)

VERDICT
So as you've come to know from my review, Avengers is the greatest masterpiece of the 21st century! NOT! It's s**t and doesn't deserve any of the popularity it gets! The applause it deserves is for it's visual effects (which is the only thing for which it has gotten awards). Other than that, it is bad and I would not recommend it to anybody!

"Apr 24, 2016",positive,"Besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride, The Avengers is a fantastic translation of the Silver Age of comics to the big screen."
"Apr 24, 2016",neutral,"Fun movie, with fun action scenes, but is a meh movie."
"Apr 24, 2016",positive,"With an excelent balance between the whole cast and characters, respectin every detail stablished in the prior movies and overall respecting the comic escence from everyone, ecxelent action sequences, humor, special FX, score, acting, etc...  Avengers became the best Superheroe movie ever delivering what we were expecting since Iron Man in 2008. Joss Whedon made history here! AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!"
"Apr 23, 2016",positive,the one thing that no comic movie has ever done has finally happened and holy crap it did not disappoint saw this movie more than once and it was well deserved it did not disappoint and made me look forward to see what's coming up next!
"Apr 21, 2016",positive,Eat your heart out Michael bay!!!
"Apr 21, 2016",negative,Parafernalia visual sin ningún tipo de contenido ni valor de entretenimiento. Es una pena que esto sea lo que triunfa en el cine actual.
"Apr 19, 2016",positive,One of my favorite movies. Period. The Avengers couldn't have been brought to the screen any better. Pulling this off was a small miracle.
"Apr 17, 2016",positive,"This was cinematic gold, finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time!!!"
"Apr 16, 2016",positive,"Great actors. It's genius how a superhero doesn't overshadow another superhero. And also, a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist. Tom Hiddleston once again delivered a perfect performance on this category."
"Apr 14, 2016",positive,The perfect end to Phase One.
"Apr 12, 2016",positive,"An entertaining movie, with lots of actions and jokes. With 5 movies length of trailer, Marvel' had delivered a fantastic blockbuster that live up to its hype. Be it the quarrel between the superheros, or joking at each other, or the action scene, this movie keeps our eyes on the screen all the time."
"Apr 12, 2016",positive,Every comic books fans dreams come true in this movie
"Apr 10, 2016",positive,"This is my all time favorite movie, combining all marvel's top heroes, it's spectacular."
"Apr 9, 2016",positive,One of the Greatest Comic Book Movies of all time. Hands down
"Apr 8, 2016",positive,"Marvel's 'The Avengers' is one of the most overrated films in the history of cinema.  Preceded by the critically acclaimed 'Iron Man', the disappointing 'Iron Man 2', the acceptable 'Captain America: The First Avenger',  the odd 'Thor', and the intense 'The Incredible Hulk'.  Loki is back in all of his 1980's hairstyle glory as the most overrated supervillain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  I mean, honestly, what is so amazing about Tom Hiddleston's character?  Mullet... check.  Creepy demeanor... check.  Total pansy... check.  English accent... check.  Loki is literally laughable in the epic superhero roundup.  The budget was clearly spent on the cast for the film rather than the actual film itself, and the storyline is hardly thought-provoking.  This film is socially acceptable because it was the first time ""we had multiple major superheroes in one film and we pitted themselves against each other"" which caused the comic ultra-fanboys to go stir-crazy.  Captain America looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a Power Ranger.  After Iron Man takes the nuke into space, how does fall back through the wormhole?  YOU CAN'T FALL IN SPACE!  But my BIGGEST complaint was Bruce Banner's line: ""I'm always angry.""  Angry = Hulk... hello?  The entire equation for the presence of the Hulk monstrosity is now entirely in question, people!  That literally make zero sense.  Okay, my rant is over.  Despite it's flaws, it was a fun movie.  If you overlook it's major defects, as most people have, it can exciting to see."
"Apr 6, 2016",positive,One of my favorite superhero films and just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion. This is one of the highest standards set by Marvel.
"Apr 3, 2016",positive,"Of all of the massive financial hits in history, The Avengers is one of the few I would not classify as ""overrated"". The film is honestly so much fun and deserved all its success!"
"Apr 2, 2016",negative,This is bull shot movie i have ever seen
"Apr 2, 2016",positive,"There wasn't much to Avengers. Iron Man, Couslon, Loki and Fury seemed like the only characters' with distinct personality (luckily I believe this was fixed in future installments). I was disappointed that Marvel got rid of Edward Norton as I believed he was very strong. Generally I think this film was entertaining (for a couple of watches) due to the mere fact of seeing the Avengers on the big screen."
"Apr 2, 2016",positive,"This movie has a great cast, great action, and a great villan. It would be five stars if it wasn't for the fact that the first hour is boring."
"Apr 2, 2016",positive,"Scenes of action look spectacular, which really adds to the great action in the film. Some parts of the storyline lacked, however."
"Apr 1, 2016",positive,A good movie but a bit overrated
"Apr 1, 2016",positive,"This movie and the Dark Knight are the two best superhero movies ever made, bar none. At one point, I liked Man of Steel better, but after watching that movie a couple of times, I saw the flaws (though I still liked it). This movie is still a great one to watch."
"Mar 31, 2016",positive,One of the best comic book movies of all time. A lot of magic and chemistry. The hulk steals the show.
"Mar 31, 2016",positive,"The avengers was the definite momentum for the marvel series, bringing all of the heroes together for one movie was hyped up for a while.... And the movie delivered! Action packed, full of emotion as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together to defeat the evil Loki and his Armie of Gitari. This film showed sinister and powerful Loki really is after a not so well done performance in Thor. All in all, this film is one of the best marvel movies ever made."
"Mar 29, 2016",positive,"This is without a doubt the most well-made movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. With the great visionary known as Joss Whedon at the helm and with a lot of rich characters already set up previously in their own solo films (with the exception of Black Widow and Hawkeye, who appeared as secondary characters or cameos in the previous films). It is one of those movies that is always worth watching again and it's definitely deserves the title of one of the highest-grossing films of all time."
"Mar 29, 2016",positive,"LOVED this film. Mark Ruffalo did an AMAZING job as Hulk.
Hawkeye and Hulk were my fav's in this film!"
"Mar 29, 2016",positive,"A movie filled with CGI and action set pieces, this film manages to fulfil the hopes and dreams of Marvel fans by assembling the Avengers onscreen for the first time ever."
"Mar 28, 2016",positive,Very long but had more good moments than bad.
"Mar 28, 2016",negative,Jingoistic mishmash of CGI mediocrity.
"Mar 27, 2016",positive,one the most epic movie of all time! I love all the action and the script was great too! Fantastic movie it's a must see.
"Mar 27, 2016",positive,One of the best superhero movies of all time!
"Mar 26, 2016",positive,"Thank's to Joss Whedon's brilliant scripting and directing, The Avengers succeeds as both a stand alone picture and a great ensemble crossover for the fans. The action is non-stop, yes, but after 5 movies of build up I think it's warranted and accepted."
"Mar 26, 2016",positive,Certainly great movie.
"Mar 26, 2016",negative,good movie but had some flaws
"Mar 26, 2016",positive,"its a Good Marvel movies, i atcually i like it,, finnaly got to see the moment where heroes united"
"Mar 25, 2016",negative,Just a piece of crap popcorn flick with little to no redeeming value.
"Mar 25, 2016",positive,"boring as hell, it was 2 hours and 22 min of my life wasted, id rather go to church than watching this just teasing! it was ok "
"Mar 25, 2016",positive,This is a superhero movie we never thought we would ever see but thanks to marvel we did. The avengers is a very good film and one we would not forget for a very long time
"Mar 23, 2016",positive,Whedon made it work!
"Mar 22, 2016",neutral,"I find it funny that ""critics"" claimed that Man of Steel strayed into 'Generic blockbuster' territory and then praise the Avengers when it has the most generic action movie plot and layout in all of Hollywood..."
"Mar 22, 2016",positive,"So after re watching this movie it wasn't nearly as epic as I remembered it.  However, there were moments I genuinely laugh out loud and enjoyed myself from beginning to end."
"Mar 22, 2016",negative,"Whilst undoubtedly entertaining to the eyes, The Avengers offers little. The film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone, and doesn't have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging."
"Mar 21, 2016",negative,"So so, story line is expected."
"Mar 20, 2016",positive,"Es una pelicula que esperabamos y queriamos por mucho tiempo y lo hacen excelente,las actuaciones,el soundtrack,todo el tercer acto y lo efectos son muy buenos.la importancia de hulk en esta pelicula me gusto y logro transmitir lo que son los vengadores en los comics"
"Mar 15, 2016",positive,"Marvel the Avengers is one of the best marvel entry. Its unique blend of action, story driven , very good character development ,and humour makes thias definitely one of top 10 best  marvel films ."
"Mar 12, 2016",positive,"A great adaptation of this iconic superhero team. Great humor, acting, and storyline make this one of the best Marvel movies."
"Mar 12, 2016",positive,The movie that Marvel will try to top but fail because of the thrill of seeing these heroes together for the first time and the great dialogue and exhilarating action!
"Mar 10, 2016",positive,"The movie did not disappoint. Between the action and the character interaction, The Avengers is definitely a movie you have to put on top of your ""must-watch movie"" list."
"Mar 10, 2016",positive,"Being a film that could have ended up being a mess, Marvel's The Avengers balances all of its huge personalities out wonderfully, and has a great action packed story. Also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an all-out nerdgasm."
"Mar 10, 2016",positive,"Although its plot isn't really that well thought-out, everything else about this movie is great. I have watched it 5 times and I'm still not tired of it. The action is awesome, some of the best in any movie of recent memory, the characters are all unique and amazing in their own ways, and of course the directing by Joss Whedon is really his best up to today."
"Mar 10, 2016",positive,"In the post credits scene of Iron Man (2008), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and says ""'I am Iron Man'. You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet."" Of course, Fury is alluding to the ""Avengers Initiative"". It is a key moment for the Marvel Cinematic Universe since it reveals Marvel's plans for the first Avengers film. Naturally, comic book fans rejoiced everywhere at the news. I was one of them. Iron Man is also the first film in Marvel's Phase 1 that culminates in Marvel's The Avengers. Iron Man is followed by The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. As each of the movies are released, my doubt grows in regards to whether an Avengers movie can be good. How will all these great characters and strong personalities come together in a film? Is it too many characters? Will it be a complete mess like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3? Ironically, my fear becomes the strength of the movie. The Avengers works because these heroes really do not gel well together. In respect to being a team, they are dysfunctional at best. In the words of Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, ""I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb."" However, the conflict among the group is the primary reason the film is entertaining to watch and compelling. The clash of egos is epic. It is great theater to watch these heroes bicker and quarrel before overcoming their differences to become a phenomenal team. Director Joss Whedon does a marvelous job with the film. He manages the superstar cast very well. The story is paced well and the flow of the movie is fluid. In addition, he has an excellent sense of humor. The dialogue is awesome and I really enjoy how jokes are set up with clever lines delivered earlier in the film. The Avengers is a very difficult film to direct and Whedon totally comes through.

Despite a large cast of commanding characters, the film does not become a mess because Tony Stark/Iron Man and Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow are the dominant personalities that drive the plot. Of course, Iron Man is the natural center of attention. He is the most popular Avenger. His cocky, wise cracking personality keeps the tone of the film fun. Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Stark is perfect. In many ways, he and the first Iron Man film set the tone for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Natasha Romanoff enters the universe in Iron Man 2. While she is a strong supporting character in that movie, I love her extended role in the Avengers. It is great seeing a strong, female badass as an equal to a group of alpha men and key driver of the story. Moreover, Scarlett Johansson is my favorite actress and does an excellent job as the character. Another plus aspect of this film is a great villain. Tom Hiddleston delivers an intriguing performance as the power hungry, psychopathic Loki. As the god of mischief, he is the perfect instigator to exploit the problems the Avengers struggle with as they try to come together as a team. In addition, he is a tremendous trash talker really knows how to rile up the heroes. Similar to Iron Man, he is an entertaining character who helps keep the movie fun.

"Jan 17, 2016",positive,"One thing to stay about this movie, ONE OF THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIES OF ALL TIME."
"Jan 9, 2016",positive,"The 4 film build-up was great, but looking back, the Avengers is kind of bland. Good, but bland. Filled with mindless action and a generic and forgettable score. Personally, I believe it to be the 5th worst Marvel film (as of Ant-Man's release)."
"Jan 8, 2016",positive,One of the best marvel movies out there and bringing the comics of the Avengers to life. Loved it. A mix of the classic avengers and the ultimate line.
"Jan 8, 2016",positive,"One of the best superhero films of all time! Everyone works so well together, the action is the kind which makes you holler and cheer, and for the sugar on top? The humor works extremely well too! 
One little flaw, and it's not too big here, is the villian Loki. After coming off of the movie Thor, I have a hard time trying to understand what his quest for power is all about. Don't get me wrong, he works really well here, but he didn't have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with. Marvel always struggled to make a good villian, but Tom Hiddleston gave this his all in order to be a threat, not only to our band of heroes, but to the rest of the planet! So, I'll give him some props for that."
"Jan 7, 2016",positive,"The avengers is one of the best superhero movies it's awesome, funny and has a memorable cast of characters"
"Jan 6, 2016",positive,"When Marvel made the Tobey Maguire Spidey movies I was happy well atleast until the 3rd one and then I figured thats all thanks Marvel you did decent, then Marvel Studios had a bigger vision and that was a Marvel Cinematic Universe that started with Iron Man and evolved into Avengers,  I was a late bloomer with Marvel and comics. Batman Begins happened and threw the shade on Marvel anything. Then 2008 came and Iron Man changes everything setting the foundation for something I even being novice I was couldn't see a Live Action Avengers move. This is my favorite movie of all time"
"Jan 2, 2016",positive,"This movie really shows you how far CGI has come.
Even Robert Downey Jrs emotions are computer animated"
"Jan 1, 2016",positive,"A really well made movie that has good acting throughout the whole film, lots of good humor and a great cast."
"Dec 30, 2015",positive,"The Avengers is a brilliant movie with an all star cast, a spectacular villain and action. The Avengers made supehero movie history for teaming up these heroes together at once."
"Dec 25, 2015",positive,The best movie of 2012
"Dec 22, 2015",positive,"After years of world building, movie setting and blood stains from trying to stand out in the cinematographic scene, Marvel finally achieves to make an epic superhero tale that pleases audiences, fans and critics, with a film that'll stand as a classic superhero film for the years to come."
"Dec 22, 2015",positive,"Well... what can i say?... are the AVENGERS 
I love this movie that's it

I  love how Loki is involved in all this invasion thing, the post-credits scene reveals THANOS, it's a great movie"
"Dec 20, 2015",positive,"Good story, menacing villain, fun movie."
"Dec 20, 2015",positive,Very entertaining and boasting a timely and playful sense of humor as well as excellent action pieces and chemistry between the cast.
"Dec 17, 2015",positive,"The Avengers has its moments. However, the great action scenes can't completely overshadow the dialogue, which is at times plodding."
"Dec 16, 2015",negative,"It was everything I'd come to expect from bad action movies with overblown special effects that don't blow the mind. I'd seen this movie before, even though I hadn't watched it. I usually expect better from Joss Whedon, but anyone can produce a clunker every now and then. I may be in the minority, but I wasn't impressed."
"Dec 5, 2015",positive,"12/6/15: 3* ------

1/13/22: 3.5* - I didn't jump into the MCU until late 2015 and can't imagine what this first Avengers film would have been like in a theater. This is only my second time watching many of these Marvel movies and since I was never a comic book fan, I am definitely enjoying picking up on so many more references, in addition to the foreshadowing, that went over my head the first time through. Even the mid credits scene that just played would have meant nothing to me in 2015 as I had no idea who that character even was at that point.

It would be hard for me to pick a favorite Avenger in this one but I have always loved ""team up"" movies where diverse groups of agents, criminals, or in this case heroes, are all introduced as individuals and then have to bring their unique skills together to achieve a goal. While there are definitely some I have liked better, there is no denying this is the ultimate ""team up"" movie, solidifying itself as one of the most popular franchises the world may ever see.

I love the way this film ended too, introducing some of the nuance that make these films so much more interesting by adding dimensions not normally explored in the standard, straight forward superhero plots. 7.5/10

Samuel L. Jackson Binge: Nick Fury was in the driver's seat for much of this film, quarterbacking most of the action after greenlighting the plan to assemble his super team. I am not sure if Jackson will ever have a more important role in the context of film history, and that says a lot considering he was also a member of the Jedi Council.

"Dec 5, 2015",positive,5 stars just isn't enough for this movie.  one of the BEST superhero movies ever.  totally lives up to the hype.
"Dec 2, 2015",positive,"good film, great performances and great directing, with a good climax and conclusion, and the picture is just great. A great movie"
"Nov 30, 2015",positive,"O perfeito filme de super-heróis! Cheio de humanidade, conflitos, um vilão irretocável e um arco final que é pura ""extravaganza"", Os Vingadores é soberbo em conseguir reunir 7 personagens distintos que mal se conhecem no início e ao fim da película, são uma equipe que salva o mundo!
Espetacular mesmo passados 3 anos."
"Nov 28, 2015",positive,The dream became reality!!!
"Nov 26, 2015",positive,Truly an amazing beginning for the franchise and an perfect setup for an awesome team to unite and defeat evil. Another superior film just like Iron Man.
"Nov 23, 2015",positive,"One of the best superhero movies ever, with Joss Whedon successfully bringing all of these Marvel heavy-hitters together"
"Nov 16, 2015",positive,"So I've seen ""The Avengers"" about 4 or 5 times now, but have never given my thoughts on it yet. Considering I've never been in love with the Marvel movies (I've really liked them but not enough to let the mistakes pass), I feel the need to address that this movie does have its issues, but is still awesome. 

Just seeing all these characters that we know and love on the big screen in phenomenal. All of them are great actors and Joss Whedon manages to deliver a witty and comical script. Considering most of these characters have had their stand alone movies, we are already attached to them and we have a pretty good sense of their background.

 Phase One of the Marvel movies definitely had some rough patches (The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man 2), but it came with some pretty solid films overall. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely the most quick-witted character while having a lovable, smart-ass attitude. Chris Evans does a great job as Captain America, and he might be my favorite character. His strong personality and his leadership are admirable, and he always wants to do the right thing. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is also great, and although I really didn't like the first Thor movie, I still admire his character. Mark Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk, and even though Edward Norton was good, Ruffalo is the new face of The Hulk. I also thought that even though these were more minor characters, Black Widow and Hawkeye were outstanding here. 

As for Loki, I thought he was a great villain, but he honestly wasn't that memorable. Yes he was menacing and evil, but when you really watch the movie, The Avengers never actually fight him. They have a quick 2 minute scuffle with him near the beginning, but they never actually fight him in the end. They fight an army, but he ultimately gets taken out in a few minutes. I thought that that was pretty lame and a waste of a villain. I felt like his intentions were more menacing than what he personally did. Although it's nice that he was the brains and commander of this whole operation, it would've been cooler to see him in the front lines.

 The story overall is absurd, but still highly entertaining. You do feel like there's a lot at stake and these guys have a lot to fight for. When I'm digging deeper into every scene, there were definitely things that didn't make sense or were just too unrealistic. (Example) Realistically, no air-craft carrier of that size would be able to entirely cloak. That is saying that they are taking the environment around them and mask everyone there in order to blend with their surroundings. Honestly, multiple planes would probably crash into them. Also, when Bruce Banner suddenly turns into The Hulk near the end, that was the most convenient plot point I have ever seen in my life. There's no explanation as to how he can suddenly control his anger when he had no such ability 2 hours ago. There's a lot of small things in the movie that were so off, that it detracted from the film a bit. 

Even for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie, it felt really short. I feel like this movie was compressed (Ultron felt that way too) and that they probably could've extended it by about 20 or so minutes. The CGI at times also looks a bit spotty. For such a high budget movie, sometimes the backgrounds and aliens looked pretty bad and it just didn't look real at times. But that's not saying all the CGI was bad. Probably about 80% was doing great, but the other 20% lacked compared to the rest. 

This movie also does a great job with building tension between characters. I liked how all of these powers couldn't stand each other until the very end because by building that tension, it felt like it paid off by the time the finale hit. This movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens. When emotional moments occur, they always have to throw in some comedic line or some comedic relief. I wish they didn't do that as much, but for the most part, the movie had a great sense of comedy to it.

 In the end, the action was pretty entertaining and it was just great seeing all these beloved characters all on the big screen at the same time. It's not my favorite Marvel film ever and it never will be, but it is still a fantastic film. The comedy and action are riveting, but there are too many little mistakes and plot conveniences that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. I don't love this movie, but if it did a few things differently, I probably would. In the end, it's still an awesome Marvel movie and a great ending to Phase 1."
"Nov 15, 2015",positive,"How does one stuff simple one movie with six superheroes and make it work? This movie shows you how: The heroes have to rub each other the wrong way, and then put aside their petty problems to save the world from an alien army. Simple, effective, engaging. 
Robert Downey Jr's performance is the heart and soul of the movie (and perhaps the entire Marvel franchise), and you can understand this movie without having seen any of the other superhero movies, though they provide a richer context."
"Nov 6, 2015",positive,"This movie was a dream for me. 
Being a mega comic fan I loved having all the Earth's Mightiest Heroes come together for an action-packed and hilarious movie. 
The cast was also couldn't be better for every Avenger.

"Oct 26, 2015",positive,"It's obvious that this is the best MCU movie and the 2nd best superhero movie. I'm not going to go in depth, because you all know why this movie rocks. I'm just going to list it. I loved the cast, the action, the plot, the villain, the CGI, the pacing, the characters, and the end credit scenes. Need I say more? The Avengers is a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece."
"Oct 24, 2015",positive,Just Marvel can do something like this.
"Oct 24, 2015",positive,"Definitely one of the best and also funniest super hero movies I've ever gotten to see, along with Guardians of the Galaxy. And the sequel ""Age of the Ultron"" is not too far behind."

"Oct 10, 2015",positive,Joss Whedon does a wonderful job of bringing all these heroes together for one blockbuster film.
"Oct 6, 2015",positive,This movie is outstanding seeing all of everyone's favorite marvel superheroes come together is amazing . Loki is the best bad guy for this movie I can think of Robert downy Jr. Was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this it's a modern day classic
"Oct 5, 2015",positive,spectacular! one of the superhero movies ever
"Oct 3, 2015",positive,This movie is one of my favorite.. This movie is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies.. The next avengers is going to be part 1 and 2 spoil alert oif u haven't watched yet: thanos ( the most powerful person in the universe with the gems beside one) is going to go after the avengers to take them down. Captain America is going to die and Bucky is going to be the new captain America instead of winter solider like in the comics.. For ages 12+

"Sep 15, 2015",positive,"Esta es una de mis pelÃ­culas de mi pelÃ­cula favorita del 2015.
La mÃºsica es muy memorable y pegajosa. La fotografÃ­a es muy buena y los efectos tambiÃ©n. Me gusta como los personajes interactÃºan,  es un momento muy agradable ver a nuestros personajes favoritos juntos en una pelÃ­cula muy bien echa. Su villano es muy bueno. Me gusta mucho mucho la pelÃ­cula."
"Sep 14, 2015",positive,"Seeing the Incredible Hulk's strength in clear daylight is seeing the difference between a lump of green dough with no shadows to something realistic where mother nature's elements are added for ultra-realism - maybe my wild imagination on advanced visual effects may be a little too technical to understand, then again a simple moving object such as a flapping sun umbrella on a sunny beach should give you an idea on wind movement and shadows affected by the sun. This movie is definitely an improvement despite the mindless alien creatures with no ""future outcome"" expected intelligence to outwit the Avengers ::"
"Sep 14, 2015",positive,Good starting movie left areas to grow
"Sep 14, 2015",positive,"I love it. It's the gathering of our favorite Marvel heroes.

"Sep 12, 2015",positive,This film was great fun! Definitely in the top 3 of the MCU series so far! It was awesome to see all of the Avengers in one film! I want one of those S.H.I.E.L.D. sky bases so bad! I wonder where they will take the MCU after this epic adventure...
"Sep 9, 2015",positive,Amazing movie!!! U should watch it!
"Sep 9, 2015",positive,"Believe the hype, Marvel's The Avengers skillfully manages to combine the elements of what made its predecessors so good before and interwoves them into one film."
"Sep 8, 2015",negative,"Couldn't hold a candle to Martin Campbell's Green Lantern, not even if it tried."
"Sep 8, 2015",positive,"Los héroes más poderosos del mundo (y más populares del cine) se unen finalmente en este film lleno de entretención luego de presentarnos sus aventuras individuales.

Luego de que el semi-dios Asgardiano Loki declare la guerra contra el planeta tierra al ganar el control del ""Teseracto"", el director de la organización S.H.I.E.L.D. se ve obligado a reunir a un grupo de seres tan excepcionales como disfuncionales para defender a la humanidad. De esta forma, Iron Man, Capitán América, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow y Hawkeye unen fuerzas para derrotar al villano y salvar al mundo.

El film comienza en la base de S.H.I.E.L.D. donde se nos presenta inmediatamente al villano de esta entrega, Loki. Empezando con una efectiva secuencia de persecución, la película establece el tono que dominará la historia durante las más de dos horas de duración: acción y entretención. Y es que el mayor punto positivo que tiene este largometraje es que ataca en el sentido de maravillosidad y asombro de los espectadores al recordarnos que estamos viendo esto por primera vez en el cine. Incluso si nunca fuiste fanático de los cómics, esta película debe prender aunque sea una pequeña chispa de asombro y felicidad al verla, pues estás presenciando algo sin precedentes en la historia cinematográfica.

Yo puedo contar con los dedos de una mano los cómics que leí cuando pequeño, y mi conocimiento de los superhéroes no sobrepasaba el de una persona normal. Conocía a Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Hulk, La Mujer Maravilla, Los X-Men y Los 4 Fantásticos. Ahora, tenemos a muchos superhéroes más salidos de la nada y tremendamente populares a nivel mundial. Por esto, lo que ha hecho Marvel Studios en el cine ha sido espectacular al montar este universo compartido al que tantos estudios le han tenido miedo a lo largo de los últimos años. Y la culminación es esta montaña de entretenimiento.
Pulgares arriba para Joss Whedon y Zak Penn, quienes son capaces de apretar tanto en una sola película. Al escribir el guión, lo que no debe haber sido una tarea fácil, se le dio a cada personaje una motivación clara y una función a lo largo de la historia. Es muy difícil pensar en un MVP (most valuable player: jugador más valioso), ya que cada uno tiene su momento para brillar, ya sea demostrando su habilidad en una escena de acción o simplemente con una línea ingeniosa. Y es que líneas ingeniosas y humorísticas hay por montones, pero no es excesivo. Esto ayuda a que la gravedad de la trama sea percibida de manera más liviana y a que la película no se tome a sí misma con más seriedad de la que necesita. Factor clave al momento de ejecutar las líneas rápidas es la química entre los actores. Y en este film, eso se ve reflejado al 100%. Absolutamente cada uno de los intérpretes se ve cómodo en sus escenas, cosa que es imprescindible para realizar personajes con relaciones interpersonales tensas y complejas en este equipo. Kudos también para Joss Whedon, quien demuestra ser altamente efectivo como director de actores al momento del desarrollo de la trama.
¿Y qué es una película de superhéroes sin acción? Por suerte, este film tiene toneladas de secuencias de acción bien coreografiadas y bien hechas. Los efectos especiales, naturalmente, dejan sin habla. En especial el Hulk de Mark Ruffalo. La tecnología de captura de movimiento nos entrega por fin a un Hulk con carisma y sentimientos desde el de Lou Ferrigno. Y cada escena en la que está presente el gigante verde se roba la película.
Un importante punto a favor de esta película es la presencia de un tema principal con personalidad y poder, cosa que ha brillado por su ausencia en las recientes películas del género. Debido a esto, una buena parte del crédito va al compositor Alan Silvestri, quien compuso no sólo un tema que está a la altura, sino que es memorable.

Y también con la música de Silvestri es que salto a los puntos negativos del film. Es cierto que hasta los mejores compositores como John Williams, Hans Zimmer y Michael Giacchino muestran predilección por ciertas melodías y ciertos instrumentos. Esto hace que pistas dentro de la banda sonora de una película suenen muy similares a las de otra. La diferencia con este caso es que ellos las hacen mayormente para películas buenas. Lo que personalmente me sacó un poco del film fue escuchar melodías muy parecidas a las de La Momia Regresa, Van Helsing, G.I. Joe y Una Noche en el Museo, películas que no han sido precisamente obras maestras. Pero bueno, no es un punto tan negativo como para matar el film.
Así como hay líneas brillantes y puntos de la trama que son inteligentes, también hay algunos que son bastante básicos y líneas que resultan forzadas. Por ejemplo, pareciera que en alguna parte necesitaban tener desconfianza entre los personajes, por lo que ponen a Tony Stark diciendo: ""¿Por qué Fury nos reunió ahora? ¿Por qué no antes?"". Yo te lo puedo decir, ¡porque ahora hay un extraterrestre loco amenazando con aniquilar a la humanidad! Por eso.
Tampoco se aprecia el uso de puntos argumentales básicos y pobres como el control mental, el portal mágico que se abre en el cielo, un ejército de alienígenas digitales. En especial el ya gastado argumento de que se mueran todos al destruir la nave principal. Sabemos que eres más inteligente que eso, Joss. Pero buen trabajo. Porque la verdad es que las pocas fallas que se puedan encontrar en esta película no son nada en comparación a sus aspectos positivos.

Personalmente, veo esta película por lo menos una vez al mes, así que puedo ser algo subjetivo en mi opinión. Pero cada vez que pongo play, recuerdo la emoción que sentí cuando estaba por ver el film por primera vez y no puedo parar de sonreír. Es para mí, sin duda alguna, la mejor película del género de superhéroes. Y aquellos que no lo crean, arrodíllense ante Loki..."

"Aug 25, 2015",positive,"Full of action sequences & epic CGI which makes the film great. a lot of characters need re-introducing in a short period of time obviously for first time watchers, therefore it does feel a little squeezed in spaces but Joss Whedon does well. Don't let this stop you from enjoying this quality addition to the MCU with an avenge-ful bang."

"Aug 20, 2015",positive,great action scenes and the one liners are killer's.  loved it.
"Aug 19, 2015",positive,"This movie finally does what we always wanted: action, tons and tons of great action. Instead of losing more than an hour talking about the heroes and how they and their enemies came to be, this movie could just skip all of that and give us 2.5 hours of non-stop fun and thrill, and good acting as well."
"Aug 18, 2015",positive,6/5 stars!! Rarely does a movie just blow me away like this one! The Action never lets up for a second!
"Aug 14, 2015",positive,"Solid plot, characters, and visuals. Long action sequences."
"Aug 14, 2015",neutral,"The first time I saw it, I thought it was awesome. The more I watched it, the more I realized it didn't do anything much different from the previous films. The only difference is all the characters in it. Turns out it is just an average comic film."
"Aug 13, 2015",positive,One word: AWESOMENESS!!
"Aug 12, 2015",positive,Amazing movie. Enough said.
"Aug 12, 2015",positive,This movie was really good. First off the super Hero's everyone really played their part really good. The villain (Loki) was also really good at playing his part.
"Aug 9, 2015",positive,"Great assemble team up movie, it's awesome!!"
"Aug 9, 2015",positive,"Doing a wonderful job at combining a handful of superheroes into one movie, The Avengers shows that you can have too many characters in one movie and still be excellent."
"Aug 8, 2015",positive,"The greatest superhero film of all time.
Nothing else to say.
A+"
"Aug 8, 2015",neutral,"The movie had terrible dialogue full of bad jokes, the tone was bad, it had plot holes, bad/unthreatening villain, boring action scenes,and the plot is just unoriginal and overused. Can't see any reason you should see this. The only reason I didn't give it a lower score is because the characters had a good chemistry and it had good visuals. Overall, I didn't like and found it overrated."
"Aug 8, 2015",positive,An amazing movie based on Marvel comics. A movie that brings the Marvel heroes together.
"Aug 7, 2015",positive,"After five films that help set up this one, The Avengers is a masterpiece filled with top-notch acting, action, humor, and chemistry between the ensemble cast. While the plot was pretty predictable, that doesn't make it bad! This is a must-seen comic book movie!"
"Aug 6, 2015",neutral,"I really wish people would stop praising this movie. It's not that good. Yes it has some good and memorable scenes, but that's it. Honestly if this movie didn't have Marvel's name and characters on it then people would criticise everything from the story to villain. It's alright, but this is nowhere near the best Marvel's ever done, let alone one of the greatest superhero movies of all time."
"Aug 3, 2015",positive,"Although there could've been more Action, The Avengers is one of the most fun movies you will see for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes around without it being cheesy and boring."
"Aug 1, 2015",positive,"Lots and lots of action, explosions, fights and the whole mess. The heroes are initially shown to be men - and for a time feels good. But one can't help feeling that given these movies rely on CG and explosions, this would only be a minor blip on the whole franchise.
But yeah, Robert Downey Jr, is brilliant at his worst.
Ok to watch."
"Jul 31, 2015",positive,"High paced, pure superhero fun with enough kick-butt action to keep it genuinely hilarious, but still mind-bogglingly detailed without having it explained as a lot of superhero films fail to do today."

"Jul 28, 2015",positive,Most fun in theaters I have ever had!
"Jul 27, 2015",positive,Awesomely awesome. Amazingly amazing. Get the point?
"Jul 27, 2015",positive,The awsomes movie ever.
"Jul 26, 2015",positive,"It is amazing various directors or filmmakers in general were collaborating to bring together a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie. Never have we seen a good live- action movie with this many superheroes. The only superhero movie better than this one before its release was definitely The Dark Knight, but this is a film that is much more fun and exciting.

In the very first few scenes with Black Widow, we understand the film will have a very comedic tone to it while staying true to the action/adventure formula. I've only seen this film a few times, but every time I do I find myself smiling a lot, especially in scenes with my favorite avenger - Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. pulls the role off perfectly for every film involving Iron Man - even in the not-so- good Iron Man 3. If all this great comedy wasn't in the movie it would be a fest of eye-candy at the end and that's about it, which is not what I look for in a movie.

In the scene where all of the avengers are arguing with Fury, I feel like Stark and Banner could have accessed the information earlier and asked about it, and in that way they could have avoided the feud all together, but I guess this movie needed tension of some sort. It is also a little unclear if Loki manipulated their thoughts since his intention was supposedly to have the avengers tear each other apart from the inside.

If people are going to complain about this movie being cliché, guess what - it's based on comic books. These types of films are meant to be fun and exciting, even if that means reusing formulas for action films. If the movie serves its purpose, it is a good film, and The Avengers' purpose was to entertain."
"Jul 26, 2015",positive,"Quite fun, basically a kids film with lots of explosions.  Iron Man steals the show, which make you wonder why they don't just keep to stand alone super hero movies!"
"Jul 23, 2015",positive,"Overrated because it brought together the Avengers, this film is well written, but sacrifices all the action it could have had for witty yet slow going dialogue."
"Jul 23, 2015",positive,"One of my favorite movies of all time, this blockbuster is like my Star Wars. (Don't worry I still Love Star Wars more) Not only did this film make me interested in the MCU, it made me interested in films period. Filled with amazing action scenes, wonderful visuals, Great direction, and a superb cast, this will hands down be one of my all-time favorites no matter what."
"Jul 22, 2015",positive,I watch this one about every month. Hard to say enough good about it!
"Jul 22, 2015",positive,"Great movie, with great character development."
"Jul 21, 2015",positive,"amazing. very fun movie to watch, especially in the 3rd act."
"Jul 20, 2015",positive,"After 4 years of buildup, the Avengers finally assemble and the result is the most breathtaking, genuinely funny and exciting chapter in the MCU thus far. It even made me like Captain America."
"Jul 20, 2015",positive,Its Marvel and Its The Avengers Enough Said
"Jul 20, 2015",positive,"WHAT I LIKE: 'The Avengers' defines the comic book movie. It's explosive, fun, action packed pop-corn entertainment taken to the next level. The confrontations, the jokes, the teamwork; it all feels so real and so brilliant. But it could have easily been a failure. Why wasn't it? Well, the acting is class A stuff, but what really makes it is Whedon's expert direction that is nothing short of amazing. He makes a film of this scale feel human and personal thanks to a mix of character interactions and action that blend seamlessly together.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Some bits are a teeny bit cringe-worthy if I'm honest like the goofy costumes, cheesy lines and the odd bit of bad CGI. But it arguably adds to it's ballsy comic book charm.
VERDICT: It might not be flawless, but I haven't felt this way since Star Wars. It's monumental in how it makes you feel - proud, thrilled and downright happy."
"Jul 19, 2015",positive,"Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. Great blend of action and comedy. Then again, I am a comic book fan so I might be biased"
"Jul 19, 2015",positive,phase 1 puzzle was perfect cant believe how it came together
"Jul 19, 2015",positive,Perfect in every way!
"Jul 18, 2015",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is packed with incredible CGI, exhilarating action, and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as the right amount of humanity in each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie. 
Rating: 100%"
"Jul 17, 2015",positive,Easily one of the best Superhero movies ever made. Whedon's witty dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences make for about as much fun as you can have in a movie.
"Jul 15, 2015",positive,"I'll probably be in the minority but I really didn't think that ""The Avengers"" was that great of a movie. It did have some nice points but after a while I thought maybe they could break up the violence with some dialogue.  Okay, they did that at times and James Spader as the villain had some good quotes that sort of sounded like his character Red from ""The Blacklist.""  I actually find all the avengers interesting, but when they all get together sometimes it gets convoluted.  Great cast of actors, too bad we can't let them catch a bit of breath to show their craft a bit more.  My theme for this movie as often in many action flicks of today, sometimes less would be more."
"Jul 9, 2015",positive,"The climax of nerd culture was reached with The Avengers, and I don't think anything will be quite like it again."
"Jul 9, 2015",positive,I don't think you can watch The Avengers and not have a huge smile on your face the entire time. The film succeeds on every front and delivers a great fun time. Loved it!
"Jul 8, 2015",positive,"The avengers is by far the best crossover film Marvel has to offer! At a runtime of 143 minutes, the movie delivers action-pack performances by Mark Ruffalo, overwhelming action and of course, great fighting  sequences!"
"Jul 5, 2015",positive,This movie changed the cinematic universe
"Jul 1, 2015",positive,The ultimate superhero movie.  Marvel has set the standard for superhero movies.
"Jun 30, 2015",positive,Enjoyed but too long.
"Jun 29, 2015",positive,Amazing film just such a good movie. It amazes me how  many characters we see on screen.  The chemistry between actors are great action is amazing SGI is great too my only problem is first 20 minutes they are just boring as heel but the Overall movie is great
"Jun 29, 2015",positive,"Personally, I actually didn't like this movie. It had a few parts that I really enjoyed, but sometimes, when a film asks you to suspense your disbelief with a story like this, it gets too far-fetched for even a marvel movie."
"Jun 22, 2015",positive,Amazing collaboration of the MCU where everyone gets their equal share of screen time. Just absolutely brilliant all the way around!
"Jun 21, 2015",positive,the avengers has very effect
"Jun 21, 2015",positive,Really fun to see all of these character together on the the big screen.The scene near the end where you get to see the avengers showcase all there powers & abilities really is some thing to see.It was the first time some thing like this was done  really well though I did like second movie a little more & it drags a little in the middle it still was a great film & really open up the doors for bigger & better things.
"Jun 21, 2015",positive,"Great movie overall. Marvel movies have been killing it. Stan Lees stories always unveil in such a creative and unique way no matter what movie it might be about. Spider-Man's (Newer ones) along with the new X-Men First Class and Days of future past.  and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy which turned out to be one of the greatest films. On top of that, all the movies leading up to this originally were Iron Man, Thor, Captain America & Hulk I guess was just thrown in their with Tiffani who kills it along with scarlet who plays the black widow in captain America and from Thor, you have Jeremy rennet who does a great job playing the character he should play. Putting them all together. Hit the trifecta. The movie isn't the greatest by any means of any marcel film but for what it's worth. It definitely is."
"Jun 19, 2015",negative,I am worn out from the CGI superhero formula
"Jun 18, 2015",positive,"It lives up to high expectations. I wonder if I would like this more if I'd seen it before The Winter Soldier. I loved all the fight scenes, and seeing everyone's role in the battles. Nobody is useless."
"Jun 17, 2015",positive,"One of the most original storys and great action sequences with amazing actors, superheros and great directing by Joss Wheadon."
"Jun 15, 2015",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is Fantastic!

Originally written July 2, 2012--
Wow! What can I say. I've seen this movie four times now! I went opening night, saw it a couple more times over the next two weeks, and then again the day it crossed the $600 million barrier! Joss Whedon has created a masterpiece! I honestly can't say who my most favorite character in the film is, nor who utters the best line, because the entire thing is just AWESOME! I felt like a kid again watching Saturday morning cartoons as Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) team up to defeat Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the Chitauri army from invading Earth. The idea of taking all of these superheroes and putting them together in one movie was not only a brilliant one, but a timely one as well. Honestly, Marvel Studios took a huge risk, but it has paid off BIG TIME! What an incredible movie! And judging by the amount of money it has made thus far, I'm not the only who feels this way! Well done Marvel!"
"Jun 15, 2015",neutral,"1. Poorly edited. There are several times where the film cuts away from a character,  does something else for 15-20 minutes, then cuts back to the character who apparently has done nothing but wait patiently for the camera to return.
2. The old knock to the head undoes mind control trick. Twice.
3. What's the point of having a centrally controlled invading army if each individual entity is going to act without a central plan? Oh, the old kill all the bad guys with one hit to the uni-mind trick.
4. Sir, enemies are pouring through a portal into the city! Should we attack the portal, sir?
Nah, just nuke the city and we can all be home by dinner."
"Jun 15, 2015",positive,"The Avengers are epic, they need more chicks though, huge sausagefest."
"Jun 14, 2015",positive,Best super hero movie
"Jun 13, 2015",positive,A little bit over-hyped.  Action and comedy was pretty good.
"Jun 13, 2015",positive,"A fast paced action, super-hero slam dunk. It's great."
"Jun 12, 2015",negative,This movie SUCKS it's so boring and dissapointing ugh!
"Jun 11, 2015",positive,"Really good movie. This movie brought 6 superheroes together and made it work, which I give the movie credit for."
"Jun 10, 2015",positive,"6.3/10 — ""Okay""/""Decent""/""Watchable""

-(Seen on 3/5/21)"
"Jun 6, 2015",neutral,Many people may disagree with me but I think this movie is extremely overrated and that Avengers age of ultranationalist is better because I think The avengers is slow I the beginning and the last 20 minutes is actually the best part in fact this movie may have been 1 stared if not for the fight scene being as good as it was.
"Jun 6, 2015",positive,"The only weaknesses i see are that Hawkeye has too little development, and the aliens are too easily disposable"
"Jun 4, 2015",positive,"If only anyone could see my review in this flood of positive comments on this movie, never been done before, it's just wonderful, everyone coming together into one film, just a mess of greatness, so glad it will continue! Marvel is too good for my comments though, it will continue to flaw, but it will not stop! Way to go above and beyond marvel!"
"Jun 3, 2015",positive,I love marvel movies
"Jun 3, 2015",negative,Standard predictable superhero sass
"Jun 2, 2015",positive,"Chock full of some of superhero film history's most iconic fight scenes and lush graphics, The Avengers adds another worthy entry in the roster of hero flicks."
"Jun 1, 2015",positive,"7/10
Joss Whedon is great at writing characters and their interactions with each other. The scenes of just these characters talking to one another are full of entertainment. However, I still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little jumbled. Still a fun movie."
"Jun 1, 2015",positive,"Avengers Assemble is a monsterous blockbuster of a movie. I was precarious going into this that having all the characters together wasn't going to work but they have played it brilliantly. Its still not perfect as Loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to his army, a little forced I feel yet its full of action, humour and cinematics. I enjoyed the clash between egos, captain america taking the lead and the hulks edge. Its a superb action movie which cannot be missed."
"May 31, 2015",positive,"Superheroes together in glorious action, and shawarma."
"May 31, 2015",positive,A action film full of character in comic book style.
"May 30, 2015",positive,Avengers past all of our expectations Josh Sweden does an amazing job directing and the cast look like they are having an amazing time shooting this. This movie is definitely the best marvel movie so far
"May 25, 2015",positive,"Ugh, what can I say I finally watched ""The Avengers"" and it kind of matched my expectations: It's big, it's epic and the action is just really cool.
But it has the same problem that pretty much every Marvel movie has: It's bright and clean. That may sound like a weird criticism, but my personal taste is a lot darker. That's probably why I like Batman or Watchmen better."
"May 24, 2015",negative,"when I went to the theater I had to park a mile away as it was on the release night, when I started the first 30 minutes I was wondering how anyone could sit thru this terrible terrible movie. seriously ive only walked out of 2 movies in my life out of maybe about 1000, after 1 and a half hours of this rubbish i walked out, seriously the cheesiest, boringest,lamest worst utter dispicably bad movie ive ever seen in my life. cant believethe tomatometer gave 92% good on this one and so bad on vanilla sky which I actually really loved.this is the last time i trust critics reviews.there was nothing to say that was good about this movie, terrible acting, cheesy as heck lines, boring going nowhere fast plot,bunch of senseless action that had no intrigue or suspense. rated 0 out of 10, worst movie of my life. seen far better bad kung fu movies from the 70s  ahahahaha after seeing this I lost all respect for marvel movies tho one of my fav all time movies is iron man 1 , not to mention the later x men movies as well.im hoping the avengers 2 will be far better, it cant possibly be any worse, one thing is for sure I wont be seeing it the movies....RENTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahaha"
"May 24, 2015",positive,A great superhero movie. Love the cast and the plot. Lots of action and special effects as well.
"May 24, 2015",positive,"This is far one of the best superhero movies created. A great joyride that balances every character. A great story line, character development, fight scenes combined into one beautiful rampaging movie."
"May 21, 2015",positive,"Marvel make an almost perfect film with humor, action and thrills."
"May 19, 2015",positive,"That, my friends, is a whole new level of greatness. I thought the Marvel movies were incredible but The Avengers is somthing else entirely. Enjoyed every bit."
"May 18, 2015",positive,"A film great, very funny and entertaining, with great fight scenes and special effects, a good story, just thought a negative point is the imbalance of the importance of the characters in the movie, I thought the Iron Man and the Hulk stood out far more than Captain America, Thor and the Black Widow. And has the Hawkeye that was one of the main characters less important, but ultimately the film is very good."
"May 17, 2015",positive,"Positives 
- beautiful action scenes 
- amazing pacing
- great characters 
- great villain
- great dialogue 
- perfect run time 
Negatives 
- Hawkeye didn't have a purpose 
- first 40 mins was good but was weaker then the rest of the film"
"May 16, 2015",positive,"A breath of fresh air in the ""superheroes"" movies. Overall great movie."
"May 16, 2015",positive,"Smashing, explosion, fights, fire and bullets...I can't stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie. (Tom Hiddleston is so pretty...""Shakespeare in the park"", hahaha! There are some hilarious moments.)"
"May 15, 2015",positive,"One of the best superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast together and a epic score, Also just the Avengers .So cool."
"May 15, 2015",positive,Arguably one of the most fun movies ever produced. Mark Ruffalo is a revelation.
"May 15, 2015",positive,The film shines when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their development as a team. It is unfortunately let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence.
"May 14, 2015",positive,"Still one of the best and most entertaining movies I've seen. Packed with top actors, special effects, fun storyline, and excellent directing, the Avengers still does what most entertainment can't."
"May 13, 2015",positive,"This movie finally gives what we fanboys always wanted-Marvel's main superheroes all in one film. And they do it so perfectly! scripted and directed by Joss Whedon (God of the Nerds), where could you possibly go wrong?"
"May 13, 2015",positive,A good movie that you could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.
"May 13, 2015",positive,Action packed from the get-go!  3D and special effects are excellent!  We really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it!!!
"May 13, 2015",positive,Great! Can't Wait For The Second!
"May 13, 2015",negative,"I don't know. I didn't really enjoy it. Maybe because I watched it on bootleg. Maybe I need to rematch it again. This film got a lot of praise, but I just wasn't feeling it. It has some great action and special effects. In addition, some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie, but I didn't like it."
"May 12, 2015",positive,Five stars when you first see you at 4 1/2 third time you see you in three when it comes out on Blu-ray this film creases its value as time goes on
"May 12, 2015",positive,"Avengers' Sci-Fi premiss and War Movie feel had me walking away giving it four stars, but as I have since re-watched Avengers many times, I must now admit that it deserves five.  Although I was a comic book collector as a teen, I have not been a fan of the superhero genre as an adult.  I saw this one because Joss Whedon was involved.  If it was not for this film, the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would have passed me by.  I realized that Kevin Feige's corner of Marvel's Multi-verse was rooted in a reality closer to our own and have since watched everything in the MCU.  Because of Avengers, after twenty years, I am once again a fan of the superhero genre."
"May 12, 2015",positive,"one of the best films i had ever watched,"
"May 11, 2015",positive,"Clever, funny, and action packed, The Avengers is great fun for movie goers and comic fans alike."
"May 11, 2015",positive,"Joss Whedon, conocedor del mundo del cómic y creador de las series de televisión de culto ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" y ""Firefly"", tiene a su cargo la dirección del mega-crossover, ""The Avengers"", una cinta se superhéroes que implica conocer el universo de Marvel Comics o haber visto previamente dos muy buenas películas de ""The Hulk"" (protagonizadas por Eric Bana y Edward Norton), dos muy buenas películas de ""Iron Man"" (protagonizadas por Robert Downey Jr.) una buena película de Thor (protagonizada por Chris Hemsworth y la más floja de todas las nombradas) y una muy buena película de Captain America (protagonizada por Chris Evans).  Todos esos personajes, unidos a Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson),  Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) y Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), se enfrentan a Loki (Tom Hiddleston), el enemigo de Thor quien pretende dominar el mundo.  La historia es simplemente un pretexto para unir a todos estos superhéroes, lo cual es el sueño húmedo de todo fanático del cómic.  Joss Wheddon logra, a partir de la poderosa química entre los actores, generar una dinámica que hace de ""The Avengers"" una película muy divertida y emocionante, lejana al despilfarro tecnológico y la estupidez inherente de sagas como la de ""Transformers"".  Sorprendentemente, quien se roba el show es Hulk, esta vez interpretado por el gran Mark Ruffalo, quien  con unos acertados apuntes cómicos, logra ganarse el corazón del público.  ""The Avengers"" no es una obra maestra, pero es una película que no insulta a la inteligencia y que tiene corazón.  Vale la pena."
"May 10, 2015",positive,"It's has all of the textbook material for a good film, but I honestly did not enjoy it nearly as much as I hoped to."
"May 9, 2015",positive,"Marvel sets out to do what no one has dared or even thought to do before, and not only do they do so, but they ace the s***! This film is absolute, grade A superhero action/comedy as best as it can be. The huge lead up from the supporting films does not disappoint in any way and only sets up a bigger and brighter future for what's in store. Without a doubt one of the best superhero film's in history amongst the Dark Knight and Iron Man. (92%)"
"May 7, 2015",positive,"it was ok, funny in places which made it worth watching"
"May 6, 2015",positive,"Joss Whedon handles the big set-pieces deftly, but the script really shines when the characters are bickering amongst themselves. A fun comic book movie that rightly doesn't take itself too seriously."
"May 6, 2015",positive,Great Acton packed film
"May 5, 2015",positive,"The best film of 2012, it's a fun, energetic, and action packed roller coaster ride from start to finish!   A+"
"May 5, 2015",positive,"Whedon was able to do what has never been done before, and turn it into one of the best action movies, superhero or otherwise, that has ever been made. The chemistry between the cast is great and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners. A must watch whether you are into the whole superhero verse or not."
"May 4, 2015",positive,Fun movie... Not especially compelling.
"May 4, 2015",positive,Great movie! Definitely recommend to friends!
"May 4, 2015",positive,"This film is fantastic. After little bits showing that the Avengers are coming, we finally get to see them on the big screen. The film shows them coming together and having to stop Loki from conquering Earth. Everyone is perfect for their roles and Joss Whedon did a great job. The only flaw I have with this movie is that the Avengers coming together takes a little bit longer than I wanted it to. My review for Marvel's The Avengers would be an A."
"May 4, 2015",neutral,"Independance day with superheroes. Lots of noise. Some fun stuff. Some good bits, 1 hour too long."
"May 4, 2015",positive,"Re-watch. Loved all the Marvel flicks leading up to this so, it was great to see them all together and no make a balls of it. Loki is a right nasty piece of work. Ruffalo was great in his debut as The Hulk. Would really like to see a solo flick with him as Banner. The action is top notch and was delighted to have caught this at the cinema on its original release. A serious twitch off Black Widow."
"May 4, 2015",positive,"The Avengers is truly one of Marvel's greatest achievements on film, bringing together this group of extraordinary people that have been so well built up the past few years and they did it with style. Joss Whedon directs and writes a fantastic eye-popping script and dynamite performances from the entire cast all the way around make The Avengers eligible to watch over and over. Downey, Evans, and Hemsworth are all great in their roles, and Mark Ruffalo steps in for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner and does a phenomenal job. The Avengers shows that patience is a virtue, and that development of characters instead of rushing them is the way to go."
"May 4, 2015",positive,"Outstandingly directed and written by Joss Whedon, with magnificent performances and dazzling special effects all over its 142-minute running time and full of superpowers, humanity, emotion and sense, 'Marvel's The Avengers' is the MCU best film to date, one of the best superhero films ever released, and one of the best motion pictures ever made."
"May 4, 2015",positive,"Avengers was directed by Josh Whedon it was a fantastic film. Robbert Downer was Iron-man, Chris Evan in Captain America and Mark Ruffalo in Hulk. To recap, Loki and The Other was ally. The Other was the leasder of the ""chitauris"" they are extraterrestrial. The other want too keep a ""tesserack"" (cosmic cube) with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the Planet Earth?"
"May 4, 2015",positive,"Whedon's witty script keeps this undeniably overflowing sugar-rush afloat. Although I had a headache afterwards, I very much enjoyed it at the time."
"May 3, 2015",positive,"An intensely fun, upbeat, superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of replay value. The movie does a fantastic job of bringing these characters together and pinning them against their greatest threat yet."
"May 3, 2015",positive,"The best true superhero movie of all time (I exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy, as I don't see those as ""true"" superhero movies). This movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers. The fact that the movie manages to effectively bring together so many characters makes it a success in itself. However, its well-paced plot, great action scenes, and a villain that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with. Very entertaining movie that sets the bar high for things to come at Marvel."
"May 3, 2015",neutral,"Entertaining, yet flawed. Joss Whedon did a great job with the characters and developing them here so that it wasn't just a batch of one-dimensional characters. The problems I have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here. The one-liners get stale rather quickly and aren't as charming or funny as they were in the original Iron Man. Also the army and fighting near the end were kind of boring. Don't get me wrong, Loki was awesome but his army felt pointless since they weren't developed. The Avengers is a fun enough movie and I can see why people love it, but for me its just alright."
"May 3, 2015",positive,Only thing I didn't like about it was that age of ultron did not come out Tue next week from this one!
"May 3, 2015",positive,"Reuniting the most epic superheroes of the 21st century created a striking, powerful and exciting movie. Thanks to ""Marvel's The Avengers (2012)"", the MCU suddenly seems to make a lot more sense and the strong fictional team is well supported by its incredible actors.

The beginning, the final fight scene and the ending of the story simply have everything to please the Marvel diehards. It's a genius, marvellous motion picture and the inauguration of an outstanding, action-packed franchise!

""Avengers, Assemble!"""
"May 2, 2015",positive,"I've waited for this movie for a long time. This is the best summer movie! This is one of those movies that has to be seen in theaters. The Avengers is very good, the mixture of action and comedy both blend in very well together. I liked this movie a lot but I do have some problems. The movie is boring as hell for the first hour! The Avengers are no where to be seen! I actually forgot I was watching a movie about badass superheroes during the first act. The second act is fun but could've been better if there was more of the Hulk. The third act is amazing, it pays off. The action is filmed so well, everyone in this movie gets a chance to show what a badass they can be. NOTE: STAY TILL THE END CREDITS. The only reason I'm giving this a 4/5 stars is because the first and second act could've been a lot better but other than that I think Loki is an awesome villain and The Avengers are badasses! 

The Avengers: 4/5 stars"
"May 2, 2015",positive,"It's very action-packed, and a fun movie. Story?  Not really.  It was really predictable, and any potential for character development was quickly thrown out for very contrived reasons.  But you know what? That's ok.  I enjoyed seeing my comics come to life, on the big screen.  If there was anything real complaints, it's the total under-usage of Hawkeye, Thor & Iron Man fighting for no reason, the fact that Thor seemingly tried to kill Captain America for breaking up the fight, and the complete contrivance of Banner suddenly being able to Hulk.  Joss Whedon was the perfect guy to bring this to fruition. I cannot wait to see if it gets better the second time around."
"May 2, 2015",positive,"It will certainly be a classic not only marvel, but also the genre of superheroes. truth, Joss Whedon manager did an excellent job in this film."
"May 2, 2015",positive,"Funny, fast paced, exciting, and well directed. What more could u want from an Avengers movie?"
"May 2, 2015",positive,A MUST SEE AND MARVELS BEST FILM. WAY BETTER THAN THE SEQUEL.
"May 2, 2015",positive,"It may be better as a piece of sci-fi action than actual storytelling, but it still delivers what fans had hoped."
"May 1, 2015",positive,"It is the Avengers. THE AVENGERS. When I saw this movie for the first time three years ago, I was shaking in my seat and had such high expectations, I thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy. Oh boy, oh boy, I not only walked away happy, but I walked away speechless. This movie is the definition of a comic book movie. Trust me, I love me some Dark Knight however, this movie is more fun and entertaining to watch. For that reason alone it wins the spot of best comic book movie ever made on my list. What Joss Whedon did seems almost impossible. It is rare to see an action movie where the scenes when the superheroes are fighting are just as enjoyable as the ones when they are just conversing with each other and Whedon's clever and witty dialogue makes for just that. 

These heroes are so drastically different, this movie is really about how the Avengers form. Besides a character arc that occurs with Iron Man, there is not much more development with the other characters. This is not a big problem because this film focuses on the team aspect and what it takes to have these individuals work as one. The true arc is in the team rather than in the characters, almost as if Whedon treated the team as a character itself. 

From beginning to end this movie holds the audience in close and never lets them go. One of my favorite aspects of this film is the epic feel. Right from the title card, this does not feel like any ordinary film, every scene is shot with such a grand appearance that adds immensely to the overall feature. 

As you most likely know, Hulk stole the show. Mark Ruffalo played Bruce Banner with perfect finesse capturing the geeky scientist better than any other incarnation of the character. Once raging into the hulk, it is a whole other story that takes over the screen with every punch. He really is the spotlight with later in the film delivering one of the best ""wow"" moments I've ever seen on the big screen.

To get into minor negatives, Captain America was not as badass as he should be and becomes in future films. This is understanding of course since he only recently awakens from an icicle that he has been immersed in for decades however, I still would have liked to see him show more value to the team. Once he starts making the orders most is forgiven but until that point he just falls slightly. Hawkeye as well is not given the greatest role. Once he actually becomes Hawkeye in the ending battle, he does become pretty damn awesome it just may not be enough to make up for his absence for the entirety of the film. Lastly, As amazing as Loki was, honestly playing a perfect first villain to unite this team, I wished he used his frightening abilities he shows in the beginning of the film, on the Avengers at the end. I hated to see him practically give up once his army no longer existed. Loki is very powerful and could have put up a decent fight and I was sad to not even see him try.

The pros definitely overweigh those minor bothers with a comic spectacle written all over this one. Being a perfect summer blockbuster, it definitely makes it incredibly difficult for Age of Ultron to up the scale. The final battle alone is one of the most fun, action packed, and exciting finale's I have ever seen. I can't wait to see what Joss has in store for us next."
"May 1, 2015",positive,"It may surprise you to know that I've only seen The Avengers once (in its theatrical run) so before checking out it's bigger and badder sequel, I thought I'd revisit the film that so many seemed to love. And it's still overrated as all hell.

First off, props go out to writer Joss Whedon for actually understanding these characters and what seems to work with them. He clearly has a lot of fun watching them bounce off one another (literally in some cases) and it makes for an enjoyable experience, for the most part. He gives them a reason to band together (we'll get to that in a moment) but tends to use humor as a crutch. The film's more humorous tone works, but it's hard to take things seriously when shit goes down. It's as if the characters are too self-aware of their situation to give them the weight necessary. I'd be okay with this approach if the flick was an hour and half, but alas, that's far from the case.

As for the reasoning for the team-up, well, we have Loki who's an entertaining villain, but far too incompetent to take seriously. Anywho, he partners with some aliens because . . . well, why not? The aliens are something out of a Power Rangers film, and no, that's not great. When they pour into New York through a portal in the sky, it's shrugged off in moments and not really brought up again. I know this is a world with super heroes exist, but films like Iron Man and even Captain America are somewhat grounded in reality. I digress. Given that they're mostly CG, the bloated finale is just watching a bunch of humans fight against a bunch of CG shit. And this goes on for nearly 30 minutes. It is REALLY tiresome. Here's a finale that should have taken the less-is-more approach.

As for every other action scene in the film, it's one Avenger taking on another. It's as if there was a checklist of who fights who and Wedon was sure to check every single box. His direction is decent, but feels like TV. This is undoubtedly the biggest budgeted cheese-fest cinema has ever seen.  A little cheese is fine every once in a while. This, on the other hand, is two and half hours worth.

At the end of the day, The Avengers proved to be an entertaining, but exhausting comic book film. The buzz from seeing you favorite comic heroes on-screen together wears off quickly and all the quips in the world don't make up for the fact you're not invested in the characters or the ridiculousness of the finale.

Whedon got a lot right, and fans commend him for that, but I've never seen so much praise for a film simply because it didn't suck. Thankfully, movies like Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy proved what Marvel can really do with a license. I'm hoping Whedon kept that in mind with his follow-up, Age of Ultron."
"Apr 30, 2015",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is now one of the most influential events in movie history.  It has greatly impacted all of cinema forever.  It was the first time a big budget live action movie came out in theatres featuring multiple superheroes on screen at once sharing the spotlight.  The five movies leading up to it made a big difference as well because now most audiences who saw the lead-up movies didn't have to worry about character introductions or development or anything like that because it had been done already so they could just sit back and watch their favorite heroes kick ass and that's exactly what they got.  
As an event The Avengers is very good (though not perfect) but as a movie it is far from perfect.  A movie on its own, in my opinion, The Avengers falls behind many of the other Marvel movies.  I'll explain why shortly.
The plot really doesn't need a run-through since it's so simple.  Loki attacks Earth in order to get the Tesseract which was the McGuffin from the Captain America lead-up movie.  That item will play an even bigger role later-on when we get to Avengers 3.  Loki plans to use it to summon a huge arm supplied by Avengers 3 villain Thanos.  Nick Fury assembles The Avengers to stop him.  That's all there is to it.  The only thing deep about it is the relationship between Fury and the Shield council members but that doesn't go anywhere until Winter Soldier.
I initially complained of how simplistic the story is here.  However, I think for this film they made the right call after thinking about it.  This was the first time a team of iconic heroes like this would be assembled to one movie.  If they tried to incorporate a layered and complicated story on the level of something like Batman Begins in there it would've detracted from the main selling point of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass.
Now that this film has been made and done fairly well there will be greater expectations for future installments story wise.  With how much darker and sophisticated these films have gotten since The Avengers I wouldn't be surprised if Age of Ultron and all future sequels won't be more deeply layered.  In fact, I'll be disappointed if they aren't.    
Like I said, as an event the film is quite good.  Having all these iconic superheroes together has never been accomplished on this scale before.  From a production and acting standpoint the film is a work of genius.  The effects are all on-point.  The action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the third act is amazing.  All the actors do a spectacular job in their respective roles as they did in their own films.  The score is also quite catchy and gets you pumped when things start to go down.
However, as a movie itself I think Avengers falls short in a few areas.  First of all, since this is an event that has been built-up to for years it's not a film you can really watch on its own.  If you want to really know what's going on, who these characters are, who the villain is, or what the Tesseract is you really need to either have read comics or watched the lead-up movies.  The average moviegoer might be rather lost if they simply viewed this without seeing the others.
Also, I feel it lacked a suitable threat until the end fight.  Now, I like Loki as a villain, especially in Thor.  However, for the Avengers, I feel like he just doesn't cut it.  I feel like any one of the Avengers (the main four) by themselves could take Loki.  The guy throughout the entirety of the movie gets beat-up by pretty much everyone from Thor, to Iron Man, to the Hulk, Hawkeye, etc.  Also, his plan in the second act didn't make much sense to me.
At the start of the second act he allows himself to be captured for really no reason.  You could say he was really trying to turn the Avengers against themselves and release the Hulk, but they really did that on their own. When Black informs everyone in front of Loki that he intends to release the Hulk he has this surprised face that says ""no that's not my plan but that's good; I'll run with that.
Also, the second act becomes a little boring.  It just consisted of Fury and the Avengers trying to find the Tesseract while being paranoid and disorganized assholes.  It provides good set-up for future movies like Winter Soldier or Civil War but I didn't really care much for it hear.  Like I said before, Loki's plan is quite questionable there.
There are also a couple things that don't make any sense to me.  How did Thor get back to Earth in the film when the bridge between the worlds was destroyed in his movie?  Also, the Hulk makes little sense here.  Bruce arrives at the final battle and says ""I'm always angry"" as the reason for his success in controlling the Hulk.  Then he Hulks out of his own will and seemed to be in relatively complete control throughout the entire fight.  So, if he could control it so easily then why did he need to hideout in the first place and why didn't he have control of it in the airship.  
Overall, The Avengers is a fun popcorn film and a fairly worthy four-year payoff fans had been waiting for since the first Iron Man film.  For comic book fans who longed to see this iconic team on the big screen for so long you shouldn't be disappointed.  For average movie goers who wish to be entertained then there is plenty to be had here."

"Apr 27, 2015",positive,"Larger than life characters in a world-ending scenario, yet somehow it doesn't lose grasp of itself. Joss Whedon can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much. Overall it's just one of the best damn action blockbusters there is."

PROS 

great ensemble with great chemistry 
fantastic action scenes 
great cameo from andy serkis 

CONS 

got a bit lost around the middle 
used thor too much 
could of been a shorter running time"
"Apr 24, 2015",positive,The best comic book movie ever made. One of the most entertaining movies ever made. Simply stellar.
"Apr 23, 2015",positive,"A film that stood the test of time, good performances all around and a storyline that kept you hooked from start to finish. Marvel managed to make an epic action-adventure film out of a superhero movie which has never been done before, thanks to the brilliant and artistic minds of Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige. This is a film that will always hold up no matter what age you are."
"Apr 21, 2015",positive,Slow build up with excellent pay off
"Apr 21, 2015",negative,"Extremely overrated with lots of love, a rudimentary plot, predictable story and development, plagued with bad acting, and not nearly as entertaining as one might have thought or some of its predecessors that led to this gigantic waste of time. The Avengers was a great disappointment and visually it looks like a TV movie."
"Apr 20, 2015",positive,"I don't care what people say about this movie for me it is perfect because after the six years of waiting and the trailers and tease's. Unlike many other movies this one lived up to four years of hype and it had great characters, because having a room full of six different heroes plus Samuel L. Jackson (who is also a superhero in real life) their are going to be arguments and possibly fights. I have to say that this movie was the best of marvel and my favourite movie of all time"
"Apr 20, 2015",positive,"one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, not only in the marvel universe, but this competes with The Dark Knight for best superhero movie of the 21st century"
"Apr 19, 2015",positive,"Todo el proyecto cinemático de Marvel cobra sentido con The Avengers. Si bien por momentos el guión se ve forzosamente alargado (esperamos mucho por la batalla de Nueva York), está bien articulado y entretiene. Quizás el personaje de Hawkeye y su cambio de bando ""sobra"" un poco, pero en lo demás todos son presentados en su justa medida, con excepción de Loki, quien se vuelve a robar la película con su excelente actuación. Buenos efectos especiales y dinámica, la recomendamos."
"Apr 18, 2015",positive,"Marvel gets everything right in their power house super bowl of a film as everything is brought together as the Avengers Assemble. Marvel does an excellent job of tying things together from all their previous films and setting up the future of their cinematic universe. The viewers are graced with an amazing storyline, amazing action sequences and realism. The Avengers has depth and so many memorable scenes that will be remembered for many many years."
"Apr 18, 2015",positive,"this a awesome movie! everything is prefect from beginning to end, I just love it really, really, love it! great action, good characters, and the best crossover ever so you better check it out."
"Apr 16, 2015",positive,"I've always thought this was a great movie, but I was disappointed to some extent because I think they could have done more. With the new one coming out, I am hoping I will enjoy it even more than this one. I felt that it was uneven, and served more as a premature Iron Man 3 than an Avengers movie. Looking at the productive things the Avengers do, it's amazing how much Iron Man actually does. They capture Loki (Iron Man), fix the ship (Iron Man), defeat some of the Chitauri whale-ship things (2/3 Iron Man), and stop a nuclear weapon from destroying NYC (Iron Man). He has arguably the coolest shot in the film with Captain America's shield deflection, and the main battle takes place on a skyscraper with his name on the side of it. He has all the best lines (though Hulk is a close competitor with physical humor). He runs the show. Looking at the others, Black Widow relieves Hawkeye of Loki's control (thank goodness, since he's such a huge help later on) and closes the portal. Nick Fury shoots down one of the nuke-carrying planes and assembles them all, in his defense. Hulk saves Iron Man, which is constructive because without him, who knows what Ultron would be like. Captain America saves some civilians in a bank and gives instructions, so I understand his value. Thor shows up, and Hawkeye kind of does too. However, it's so heavily Iron Man that I found it distracting. Thankfully, Iron Man is my favorite (I think that Marvel knows Robert Downey Jr. is the financial safety glue holding this thing together) so I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it was all it could have been."
"Apr 16, 2015",positive,"This movie was a lot of fun, and there were tons of character interactions, which was the major high point for me! The low point: the movie wasn't very serious. But it doesn't have to be. This movie successfully brings the Marvel franchise together, and it is worth seeing no matter your level of fandom."
"Apr 14, 2015",positive,"It has it's flaws, but overall, it's a very enjoyable film and is one of the best comic-to-film adaptations ever."
"Apr 13, 2015",positive,78% on my Tomatometer.
"Apr 13, 2015",positive,just absolutely amazing! but Coulson dies :'-(
"Apr 13, 2015",positive,"Brilliant movie, one of the best from Marvel.
Up to Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"Apr 12, 2015",positive,good movie I want to watch the sequel
"Apr 8, 2015",negative,"Words can't describe how much I hate this movie. Of the 2  hours this film consist of, about 20 minutes are solidly entertaining. With exception to RDJ, Ruffalo, and Hiddleston, the acting blows and is unintentionally campy. Then again, with dialogue as bad as what this movie has, you can't blame the actors. When ""I'm always angry"" is a film's most memorable line, then it's probably a bad movie. I might like this movie more (or dislike it less) if it wasn't so overrated."
"Apr 6, 2015",positive,"Even better than I thought it'd be. The introduction of Loki in the beginning was fast-paced and exciting. Then it slowed down quite a bit into a well-acted drama. More good action and then slow drama again. Finally, the last quarter was action-packed! The movie gives all heroes involved good time to shine and neglects none of them. I was totally sold at Loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie Thor."
"Apr 6, 2015",negative,Unless you are bias towards the characters this is just more Transformer filth
"Apr 6, 2015",positive,A whole bunch of immense action and explosives. That's really all that anyone wants. And they achieved it.
"Apr 3, 2015",positive,This movie is going to be cool
"Apr 1, 2015",positive,"Tough, big and slick. A great summer slice of kick ass action and an ambition fulfilled. Marvel has raised the bar to a new standard."
"Mar 29, 2015",positive,"Now, I rarely rate films a perfect score. But, The Avengers is a film I truly love even though I know it is not a perfect film, it is for me.  The cast is great and works perfectly together, the action draw dropping, the effects great, and it is also surprisingly hilarious at times. It truly feels like a comic book plastered onto the screen in the best way possible."
"Mar 29, 2015",positive,Great Movie. Can't wait for sequel!
"Mar 27, 2015",positive,"The movie was good, but it wasn't that good. It's the stuff Saturday morning cartoons are made of. There's nothing to really say about the movie just like there's not much you can say about an episode of Ninja Turtles. The characters were there. They did stuff. Stuff got done to them but they got their stuff back and kicked the stuffing out of Loki, the God of No Distinguishable Features. I laughed. I cried. I learned a little about myself. Then I went home and fantasized about a 50 foot tall Scarlett Johnansson terrorizing Tokyo and fighting Mecha-Johnansson on top of the Empire State Building."
"Mar 24, 2015",positive,Best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Mar 24, 2015",positive,"I'm no comic book aficionado, but I liked the original Iron Man film a lot. Thor left me mostly cold (except Loki), and Captain America was OK... and, though it pains me to say so about Samuel L Jackson, I really don't care about Nick Fury. WHY is he there?

So this was... fine. I still really like Iron Man, and Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as HULK, while Joss Whedon did a pretty good job of keeping me entertained and interested for so long. But the climactic 35 (felt like 350) minutes, crashing and bashing and destroying a whole city (without apparently hurting any actual people), and thwarting this 'worst threat to the universe' in barely half an hour was simply beyond stupid.

Great moments and scenes, but plenty of filler and rubble in between. Should have been shorter. Except for the post-credits surprise. That was beautiful. Can I just watch the highlights next time?"
"Mar 22, 2015",positive,"No birds, no planes, and definitely no Optimus Prime here. Just a great big grab bag of intricately synchronized action scenes, and I must say pretty darn good humor, and it's all for our entertainment, so live it up when you get in that theater. 

(SPOILERS) The Avengers are all sommuned together to stop the diabolical and power-hungry (adopted) brother of Thor, Loki whom has brought war upon our precious, constantly threatened planet, Earth and he is not above bringing along an alien army to bring the human race to it's knees. This is a plan that is not in the favor of our heroes, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and, um ............... The Black Widow??? I'm still trying to wrap my head around why she was included in the bunch, but I digress.

The film is a champion made up of champions each in their own right. Only a few of them, as few as they already are, seem to get along with each other. Captain America, Hawkeye and the Black Widow are each soldiers so the play by the rules very well. Thor, and Iron Man, not so much, and well, -oh I'm not going to ruin those goofy scenes for you. The only universal character here seems to be Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, whom never picks a side with anyone, he is only there for his research, and not the OTHER guy. But I fear have have already said too much. As there are some films you should read up on first, mainly sequels we've been watching previously for the last 4 years, The Avengers is logistically a great payoff and is definately earnest of a thorough lookover, but no more spoilers.

Unless you expect Loki to conquer the human race and defeat The Avengers and anhihilate the S.H.E.I.L.D devision, a world where our heroes all die and our apocolypse is brought on by yet another Michael Bay installment and his fierce Transformers. These hopes and requests shall all be honored in The Avengers..........just saying'. 

That being said, I leave you with a quote from film critic David Edelstein in New York magazine regarding the relentless action scenes from The Avengers, ""Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms.""

Have fun boys....."
"Mar 22, 2015",positive,"Quite simply the best superhero movie ever. Joss Whedon, the master behind Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Firefly, put together all of these epic characters without it feeling forced or weird. Each character maintains their own individuality, and somehow it all works together. The balance of humor, seriousness, and action was just right."
"Mar 21, 2015",positive,"This ultimate hero-team up is spectacular in every sense of the word. It is a visual masterpiece, action-packed, brilliant performances, engaging storyline and provides the necessary amount of comic-relief from the characters we love to make it a film to be enjoyed by a wide-range of audiences."
"Mar 20, 2015",positive,the 2nd best superhero film ever amazing film.
"Mar 20, 2015",positive,"This movie is neither as good nor as bad as its hype.  For starters, there are not too many characters to keep track of, because each one has gotten their own movie in the past, therefore eliminating the need for backstory. Also, the use of Loki as a catch all villain is charmingly anachronistic (how does Loki fight the hulk? He doesn't).  More than either of these things, however, is an overall lack of energy. The movie is designed like a video game or military campaign with very little explanation of what Loki did wrong or why we should care and the first casualty of all the comic book violence is the audience's attention span."
"Mar 20, 2015",positive,"The Avengers has a perfect tone, it's dark when it needs to be dark, it's funny when it needs to be funny. This movie never loses pace or goes over the top with anything. Everything this movie has to offer is handled perfectlyð???ð???"
"Mar 17, 2015",positive,Awesome movie with good special effects and legitimum to the comics
"Mar 15, 2015",negative,people complain about the transformers movies so much but this is the same shit
"Mar 13, 2015",positive,Great movie by Marvel and Disney. I really loveed the storyline.
"Mar 13, 2015",positive,"Some of the buildup takes a little long, and the plot can be a bit flimsy at times, but the spectacle here is amazing, and the actors are typically strong. This was the first Marvel movie I saw in the theater, and it has stuck with me for a while. My expectations are high for Age of Ultron. Verdict: A-"
"Mar 13, 2015",positive,"'Marvel's The Avengers' is fantastic, after setting up the universe with 'Iron Man' (2008), 'Iron Man 2' (2010), 'Thor' (2011) and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011), this is definitely worth the wait. 

Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo have great chemistry and great fun playing their respective roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are great as Black Widow and Hawkeye, and they definitely kick some ass. Tom Hiddleston makes a great villain as Loki, menacing and just plain evil...do I dare say he's as good as the Joker from 'The Dark Knight' (2008)?

A movie worth waiting for, definitely the best summer blockbuster of 2012, cannot wait to see more Avengers movies coming up."
"Mar 12, 2015",positive,The Worlds greatest heroes still owned by Marvel and not in DC are together and they kick ass in a great well directed movie
"Mar 11, 2015",negative,"Such A Disappointment, After All The Hype Built Up, The Avengers Fails To Hit The Bar. Its Underwhelming, Poorly Written, I Never Gave A Crap About Captain America, Black Widow, Or Hawkeye, Hell The Guy Playing Galaga Was More Interesting. Every Scene Ends In Some Sort Of Suspension And That Element Gets Really Annoying Faster Than Nick Fury Yelling At The Avengers, And Don't Get Me Started On The Score. The Avengers Is Over Rated!"
"Mar 9, 2015",positive,"Joss Whedon sure knows how to make amazing movies with this being his grand opus film. The effects are outstanding and they did a great job making the Hulk look realistic. The soundtrack is really good, and the acting is terrific with Mark Ruffalo being the best Bruce Banner/Hulk to date. The plot may seem similar to Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but unlike Transformers, this movie actually has a brain and it doesn't rely on the action. The action scenes are exciting to watch, and it has some hilarious scenes that we thought couldn't be any more funnier. The interplay between Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Thor, and Captain America is surprisingly well done and is also funny which I thought it couldn't be done as movies tend to rely on one character instead of many characters. The direction is great, and it has a very well written script that has some memorable lines that people are going to say. The movie develops the villain more and also develop Hawkeye which is really cool. Marvel's The Avengers is my favorite Marvel movie and I'm excited to see what's in store for Avengers: Age of Ultron."

-Marvel after releasing this movie and shattering the box office."
"Feb 24, 2015",positive,"One of the best movies to come out for a long time. There is actually a plot, unlike many current action movies. They did not buy into the lie that there needs to be constant fighting and an explosion every thirty seconds to keep an audience's attention. The characters were well rounded and they flow well with the other Marvel movies. The references are great and well timed, but if you have not seen the other Marvel movies, the film still makes sense. The one liners and back and forth banter are tasteful and well timed. There is plenty of intense action and fighting, but not too much as to be over the top. The visual effects are stunning and the sound meshes with the action perfectly. It is all mostly believable allowing for the suspension of disbelief as there are aliens and a hulk. The lighting is spot on, dark when it needs to be, but never so dark as to be confusing. The consistency of jokes and bringing things back later in the movie to further the plot is brilliant. The effects as Hawkeye wakes up from Loki's control are stunning. The camera angles are all around good and there is no unnecessary hokey camera shaking as is now inexplicably popular yet tasteless. This movie is undoubtably a classic. This is a movie you can Marvel at.
I am both excited and nervous for Age of Ultron to come out. Excited because I am an Avengers fan, and nervous because I am afraid that the directors and producers will follow the pattern of the Captain America series where the first one was great and the second one had little plot value and meaningless explosions every thirty seconds with an overly convenient Deus ex Machina. I have been following movies for a while now and with very few exceptions (i. e. How to Train Your Dragon) the sequel is either terrible and desperate or ruins the first movie! We shall see."
"Feb 22, 2015",positive,"Amazing!!! The action, affects even the cliff hanger!!!"
"Feb 21, 2015",neutral,A bland 2 hour toy commercial with no story or conflict between the characters. Remind me again why Joss Whedon is a good director?
"Feb 20, 2015",positive,"Sensational film that brings infamous Marvel superheroes to life! Definitely one of the films that has changed cinema history. Joss Whedon has successfully created what is my favorite film by far with an outstanding cast, including Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johanson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Colbie Smulders, and Samuel L. Jackson. An amazing storyline with great subplots as to how the heroes all join together to defeat the villainous Loki and obtain the cosmic cube/Tesseract."

"Feb 4, 2015",positive,"Great. A genuine block buster, perfect for 11 year olds looking for an introduction to the super Hero genre. The performances are nothing special, neither is the plot. But that's not what these kind of films are about. The characters are fantastic, it's entertaining and it made my day. I think in this case that's what really matters..."

"Jan 30, 2015",positive,Assembled with incredible style. Full review later.
"Jan 29, 2015",positive,"Fun superhero movie combining all the strengths (and maybe some weaknesses) of all the recent Marvel movies. All the heroes are actually well represented here.. even Hulk, who hasn't had anything recent, gets a decent storyline going. The only quibbles I had about this is that it gets itself wound up in mythical and technical gobbledegook at times, making us pause and twiddle our thumbs."
"Jan 27, 2015",positive,"Enjoyably engaging and humourous. If you can forget that there is actually a world outside Manhattan in the showdown, then it also manages to draw you into a surprisingly credible fantasy world."
"Jan 26, 2015",positive,best superhero film ever
"Jan 26, 2015",positive,"Probably the second best Marvel movie to date, I personally feel, right after Captain America: WS."
"Jan 18, 2015",positive,"From the stunning visual effects, it's thrilling action setpieces, it's well-rounded and developed cast of characters and it's impressive scope; Joss Whedon's Avengers shine and dazzle throught and make this nearly 2 hour and a half rollercoaster ride worth watching over and over again."
"Jan 18, 2015",positive,"Visually great, burns into your mind that these actors are superheroes."
"Jan 17, 2015",positive,"While providing visually stunning action sequences, The Avengers is a great film that will exceed expectations."
"Jan 16, 2015",positive,"The best superhero movie ever made. With a cast of characters so likable and familiar, thanks to the great writing and jaw-dropping directing. Makes it a visual treat and a true comic book movie assembly ever!"
"Jan 16, 2015",positive,Loki manipulates Thor into taking him back to Asgard.

"Jan 14, 2015",positive,Great movie right up to the finale. At that point it went full transformers. The New York battle seemed a bit too ambitious as it turned into a goofy CGI fest.

"Jan 9, 2015",positive,Everyone knows this movie is a masterpiece.

"Jan 8, 2015",positive,Even the non-fans from superhero movies love it!
"Jan 8, 2015",positive,The movie that proved that different superheroes CAN be in the same live action film. DC has big shoes to fill.
"Jan 8, 2015",positive,"If you give a friend a copy of this movie, and he was a fan of the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America movies as well as the Hulk, and he had no idea this movie existed, he WILL shit his pants. No exaggeration."
"Jan 8, 2015",positive,Brilliant high action film.
"Jan 8, 2015",positive,Cannot believe critics give it 5stars
"Jan 5, 2015",positive,very hard to find fault in this the most epic of all the marvel cinematic universe with this amazing ensemble cast great humor some suprisingly good acting aswell as well as a director who clearly knows what hes doing the only problem I had with this is that with such a multitude of characters there often is not  enough screen time to go around
"Jan 4, 2015",positive,"""Los Vengadores"" 4 guiones asociados en 1. Fantástico y un trabajo de imágen para resaltar realidad en la proyección increíble. Buenos efectos. Actuación de Samuel Jackson impresionante y Robert Downey Jr. imponiendo su estilo para darle un gesto divertido a la película. Esperé más del personaje del Capitán América, falto ampliación e imaginación con Chris Evans."
"Jan 4, 2015",negative,"Just lots of explosions and a one-dimensional story. Bad guy is bad, amazing! Lots of people found this enteraining, at least, but personally I was bored."
"Jan 4, 2015",positive,"Grade: Low 8/10

Avengers Assemble is a marvel movie that produces what you expect, epic
action, massive effects and a crazy villain. Yes the Avengers come
along very welcome to the film industry and produce one film that truly
is worthy of such a comic book based piece. There were times I didn't
feel it was quite as good as some feel it is but nevertheless felt it
to be a safely fine film and here below is why so.

The story is big, lots of things go on and It does really draw you in
well. It contains some good old action and even though the effects are
overused, the fight scenes do look good and produce thrills. I enjoyed
the fact that it used comedy to ease us through the movie and it really
comes in handy with characters like Iron Man who just has the best
lines and can make even the more serious moments funny.

The acting on show is well, class. Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is by
far the best and although I am glad the movie gave everyone a fair
amount of screen time, a bit more of him wouldn't have gone a miss. I
like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson contributes
rather well to the cause as well. Tom Hiddlestone does do well although
the overall crazy idea of his costume makes him hard to believe and
almost as if they were trying to make literally look like he is in a
comic.

Joss Wheedon directs and co writes rather well and does try hard with
his trade and all credit goes to him with the not just the fight
scenes, but also the quick one liners we see so often in this. The
special effects are probably the biggest thing about this film and
after a while they did seem to make me a little dizzy if not just sick
of constant effects, this movie must have had a hell of a lot of green
screens.

I guess when it comes to my criticism the effects do get a lot of the
flak(there isn't too much flak by the way). I didn't like the parts
where SHIELD were involved and I felt they make this movie almost too
silly, the superheroes get away with having style but SHIELD for me
drag this film down just a little tiny bit.

If you like your Marvel or for that sake comic book themed movies then
you may like this more than any before seen. It has all the things I
would say you need in a superhero movie and with the heroes of
different movies converging together, it makes for an exciting start.
If you feel like me and don't like to see constant effects then give it
a miss, they aren't bad by any stretch, they are some of the best ever
but appear too much.

Overall I gave it a low 8/10 and felt it was safely there, not quite near
being a high 8/10 but the film is still an impressive show. My review may seem
very negative but in truth this film does grow on you and as the story
goes a long you not only warm to the cast and characters but also you
feel you actually want to be there experiencing all the madness. Yet
again Marvel have made a movie that people like and if they continue
like this well it wouldn't surprise me if people look back and call
these classics."
"Jan 3, 2015",positive,"The Avengers has much to offer in action, character struggles, and story, and it entertains people everywhere, including me. Not 100 percent substance, though."
"Jan 3, 2015",positive,"Chris Evans really rocks as Captain America in this movie and I can't wait to watch the other movies where he plays this role.

The acting was good, the writing, special effects and score didn't miss a beat!  

In the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, cameo by Stan Lee was fitting!"
"Jan 1, 2015",positive,"Action sequences worth the price of admission, but the rest kind of drags."
"Jan 1, 2015",positive,The physical manifestation of a product that screams out 'FUN!'

"Dec 27, 2014",negative,"This is not a completely bad movie. But it does get a little silly towards the end, also with the amount of violence, I would question the film's classification."
"Dec 27, 2014",positive,"Simply epic in no manner of a lie - funny, spectacle and heart all rolled into one almost perfect film that will be hard to beat in the years to come."
"Dec 26, 2014",positive,Decent (like most MARVEL films).
"Dec 26, 2014",positive,"Spectacular special effects, and all round brilliance. Happy days!"
"Dec 26, 2014",positive,"Slow to get going, but once the SUPERHEROS appear, it's a fair watch.. Hulk is funny!"
"Dec 26, 2014",negative,"When the powers of nonsense combine....well, this is what you get. 
Samuel L Jackson in, ""dicks on a plane"".
A big budget banquet of bullshit."
"Dec 24, 2014",positive,The Avengers is the best film 2012. The ensemble cast assembles a nice mix of action humor and endless charm that will last for years to come. Joss Wheadon brings together the best elements of the Marvel Universe to produce the grandest spectacle that the screen has seen in years.
"Dec 21, 2014",positive,"Marvel 's Iconic superheroes assembles in one amazing Movie.The Avengers is a great film in general with amazing heroes and fantastic actors portraying with awesome visual effects,Good story and great character development.The Villain,Loki,is a great villain ,Tom Hiddleston did a great job portraying his character.The Avengers is a great summer blockbuster!"
"Dec 21, 2014",positive,Excellent superhero gathering
"Dec 20, 2014",positive,"Pretty interesting! Thank goodness there wasn't much Pepper and I STILL hate Hulk (not a Mark Ruffalo fan either), but I thought everyone else was pretty damn good. The gag reel is hilarious & I found it pretty interesting that Hulk managed to find his pants in that rubble. Clean pants, no less. LOL!!! Looking forward to the next installment..."
"Dec 19, 2014",neutral,"Marvel's the avengers further exacerabtes marvel's reliance on humdrum, generic plotlines that fall flat of anything. As usual, the villains are wasted and used to dismal effect and there are moments with heroes simply standing in a massive battle so that the camera can get a long shot of them well, just standing. This film does have its pleasures: Robert Downey Jr as iron man, Mark Ruffalo as bruce banner (not hulk), Samuel L Jackson and probably Downey Jr some more. I mean, everyone, including MANY critics, said this was a fantastic superhero movie. And, from what I can see, I'm not entirely sure why. I mean, some people have been calling this marvel's answer to The Dark Knight. Maybe the film actually has a power to turn your brain to mush. Thats the only explanation. Thank the lord I'm immune. This mash-up is overstuffed, overlong and overly derivative. Frankly, watchable is pushing it"
"Dec 16, 2014",negative,"Incredibly predictable, corny, and clichéd."
"Dec 16, 2014",positive,"Great superhero movie, they put it all together in this one."
"Dec 14, 2014",positive,this movie is good like the cars awesome movie
"Dec 13, 2014",positive,"Overhyped and overrated, The Avengers fails to offer anything that builds on or expand any of its characters previous cinematic entries."
"Dec 13, 2014",positive,Well done action film with a respectable enough character development.
"Dec 13, 2014",negative,I don't get the popularity of this film. It's just a load of explosions with very little in the way of story. It's a very forgettable picture.
"Dec 11, 2014",positive,"Apparently dreams come true! Marvel's The Avengers is probably the best superhero movie, with lots of humor, great fighting sequences, and a fantastic story.With earth's mightiest heroes fighting to restore balance, but also having difficulties working with each other at first, almost every member of the audience is in for a treat!"
"Dec 9, 2014",positive,The best explosion movie ever
"Dec 7, 2014",positive,"This THE superhero movie that everyone wanted to see, everything is well done, it has few mistakes (but they are solved in the other movies, and the explanation is pretty well sustained), all the characters are balanced in terms of screen time and the action sequences are cool and flashy."
"Dec 6, 2014",positive,My favourite movie. Lots of action and a great script! Cast was amazing!
"Dec 6, 2014",neutral,Absolutely love the graphics and artistry behind this movie. There's no doubt that this movie is excellent but I really just cannot get into fantasy.
"Dec 4, 2014",positive,"This is not a bad movie at all, but I do not see why people say that this is one of the greatest movies ever. Is it your favorite movie of all time? Fair enough! Just choose your descriptive words carefully to not confuse me. Is the story good? Yes. The acting? Good. Music? Good. Direction? Good. Action? Great. But I am not as entertained by this as most people in general. Let me get it out of the way; I am not a Marvel hater/DC fanboy. I love both Marvel and DC, it is just this movie I am a little iffy about. Overall, it is an entertaining movie and I do enjoy it."
"Dec 2, 2014",positive,"I have pretty much zero interest in super heroes and find it annoying that adults obsess about what are essentially children's characters. But, especially having watched all Marvel films up to this one in succession, for what it is, I can't fault it it all. And this is speaking as someone who doesn't know or care anything about the history of the comics and characters. Really well made and really really fun to watch."
"Dec 1, 2014",positive,great classic super hero film! Bbc one are great for showing it this Xmas! been waiting to see it for ages but it was worth the wait!
"Nov 30, 2014",positive,"A fantastic ensemble of characters, all having their own interesting dynamics with each other."
"Nov 26, 2014",positive,"Mess with the best, die like the rest. Not great, but enjoyable."
"Nov 25, 2014",positive,This was an awesome action packed film with all my favorite super heroes.
"Nov 25, 2014",neutral,"Okay for me, review to come."
"Nov 23, 2014",positive,Marvel's The Avengers is an excellent film. It is about Earth's mightiest heroes who must come together and learn to fight as a team if they are to stop the mischievous Loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans give amazing performances. The screenplay is well written. Joss Whedon did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure. Marvel's The Avenger is a must see.
"Nov 23, 2014",positive,"This film is just fantastic. It is a modern day wonder to behold how perfectly balanced the characters, their journey, and the action set pieces are."
"Nov 21, 2014",positive,"This is the quintessential comic book movie, being as the majority comic book fans didn't think it would ever happen. And now that it has, it has become an instant classic. It's a piece of filmmaking that strives to capture the imagination, nothing more or less, and it does that with a flawless ease.

Joss Whedon has made something thoroughly impressive here. Not only is it a fun summer blockbuster, it's just a genuinely well made film. This is our generation's ""Star Wars,"" because it's a talented filmmaker working with rich and creative source material, unbelievable visual effects, an all-star cast, and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere.

I couldn't have possibly enjoyed this movie more. It's one of the best summer movies I've ever seen!"
"Nov 21, 2014",positive,Great movie wonderful effects and cgi. A really good plot and the conflict between the villain and also some internal conflict between the main characters was really entertaining. I love seeing the earths mightyist heroes fight against a charismatic and joking villain. Very nice. SUPERHEROES IN NEW YORK??!?!?!!?
"Nov 21, 2014",positive,"Incredibly awesome, and entertaining. This movie showed what the entertainment is all about."
"Nov 20, 2014",positive,"This movie is good, although it is nowhere near worthy of all the praise it gets. For all of it's goofy and fun dialogue the film suffers from severe problems including an over reliance on a macguffin and an ending battle that seems to come out of nowhere. The film seems to rest on it's laurels too often on the fact that it's a huge crossover event. For all the buildup Samuel L Jackson's character seems underused. 

It's not all bad, it's actually pretty good fun. The movie definatly knows how to strike a good balance between drama and comedy and I did genuinely enjoy the characters. It's not a great movie but it's not a bad one either. It's the definition of a three star movie."
"Nov 18, 2014",neutral,"It's really not good, I love marvel but I hate all the dumb shield stuff! Couldn't it just be superheroes??! With no shield!!!"
"Nov 17, 2014",neutral,"Generally entertaining.  

Are people not tired of regular humans being thrown around like rag dolls and not even getting a scratch.  I walk to get a coffee and take on more damage than these assholes that are thrown from a build and hit by a bus.

Its so so so so unrealistic.  Its too much,"
"Nov 17, 2014",positive,"This movie is slightly overrated, the ending is amazing although the first 90 minutes are actually quite boring."
"Nov 16, 2014",positive,"In my opinion the best comic book movie ever with great action and effects, one of the best movie experiences ever."
"Nov 16, 2014",positive,"Marvel Studios at one of their best efforts. The Avengers is a movie that the fans of the classic heroes will surly cry for. The first time I saw this, I pretty much didn't really see any of the other separate Marvel movies before this one. But I got to say, this is one rare movie that really focuses on and mixes great action, swift camera movements, and hilarious touches of humor in one package. For a movie that's well over two hours, there isn't very many slow scenes (except maybe some action sequences) and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick. All the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts. As with the other Marvel movies, it's always fun to spot Stan Lee. From the Avengers getting together to the battle in New York City, it was a fun journey while it lasted. All I got to say is that the Hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie. It is a swell film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Nov 16, 2014",positive,Absolutely Incredible
"Nov 15, 2014",positive,I think a lot of people have this movie overrated but it was good enough to get four stars.
"Nov 15, 2014",positive,"Fun film, but highly overrated. I can't believe this made more money than the Dark Knight or the Guardians of the Galaxy."
"Nov 15, 2014",positive,"While the plot is nothing revolutionary, Marvel's The Avengers is packed with balls-out action and bright humour to make for a heroic spectacle."
"Nov 11, 2014",positive,Hands down the best Marvel movie ever. It has great action and story.
"Nov 10, 2014",positive,"A great way to start off such a new kind of superhero movie that was so sensational. It had tremendous action, stunning visual affects, and an outstanding score."
"Nov 8, 2014",positive,"This movie was crazy good!I never thought I would have liked it so much!An amazing cast,combined with spectacular action scenes,a team of interesting and very different superheroes,a good story and a scene-stealing villain is what made this movie a must-watch!I enjoyed every minute of it from the very first till the very last.You certainly will have your favorite superhero but still you will realize as they have already done so,that in the end only if they work together they will achieve their goal.Great movie.I will probably watch it many more times!"
"Nov 7, 2014",positive,It's exactly what it should be and everything more.
"Nov 5, 2014",positive,"Great film; can't say it's one of my favorites, but I still think it's a lot of fun! Like a lot of Marvel films, Action > Story, but this one is still pretty fun: deep as a kitty pool; but you can have a hell of a good time in one."
"Nov 5, 2014",positive,"The kind of film you can just watch over and over again. Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have really outdone themselves with the latest MCU instalment and the first live action Avengers film. Great performances are given, although a bad story you will never not be entertained. 
One of the best films for me, in the 21st century.

Bring on Age of Ultron!"
"Nov 5, 2014",negative,Comic books are awesome. Superhero movies are not when they're mass produced and streamlined with a subpar script and overwhelming effects that only seek shock value.
"Nov 4, 2014",positive,The best marvel and superhero movie of all time
"Nov 2, 2014",positive,There could have been a little bit more action but I love how everything was staged and it kept me interested.
"Nov 2, 2014",positive,"I enjoyed this more than the other Marvel superhero films. But, I still prefer the Christopher Nolan style of comic book movie."
"Nov 1, 2014",positive,"Keeps getting better with every viewing! Really fun (and funny) entertainment - Whedon has taken the aspects of superhero films which are weaknesses, and has made them highly likeable and enjoyable."
"Oct 30, 2014",positive,"A very long film could of done with a big edit, it really does drag then it pulls you in then drags on again. Its good, colorful but dull in places."
"Oct 29, 2014",positive,"Great, characters, epic action scenes, and a kick ass villain make this one of the best superhero films of all time."
"Oct 29, 2014",positive,The Avengers film manages to have exceptional visual effects and a great strong plot to drive the film in the right direction but the cheesy jokes just make the film feel a bit like a kiddie flick.
"Oct 24, 2014",positive,awsome sperhero movie
"Oct 24, 2014",positive,Best superhero movie ever. Epic ending to Phase I of Marvel!!!
"Oct 23, 2014",neutral,"So this movie was a huge disappointment. Joss Whedon, a usually great writer/director, gave us one of the most unexpectedly generic blockbusters I've ever seen. How could a movie starring not 1, not 2, not, 3, but 6 superheroes be this average? It's got every cliche one could expect; from a giant battle in NYC to end the movie, to an absolutely idiotic plot hatched by the (cheesy) villain, to the minor supporting character's death ""motivating"" the heroes to win the climactic battle. However, this movie isn't all bad. The Hulk is animated beautifully, and Robert Downey, Jr. gives a solid lead performance. In addition, the movie doesn't feel overcrowded at all, despite the large ensemble cast filled with one note characters. All in all, I didn't hate this movie, but I have to say it really wasn't outstanding or unique in any way other than the fact that it did manage to successfully connect the larger universe. I'm probably giving this a higher score than it deserves, but what the hell; it was really cool seeing Iron Man fight Captain America, and the Hulk smashing the crap out of Loki was genius. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't that great. 5/10"
"Oct 22, 2014",positive,This movie was hilarious and intelligent and a credit to all the earlier movies it draws upon. HIGHLY recommend.
"Oct 21, 2014",positive,"A one of a kind superhero film with the best superheroes ever with terrific performances exhilarating action scenes and some great dialouge a terrific film not to be missed what so ever
Grade A"
"Oct 18, 2014",positive,One of the better Marvel adaptations.
"Oct 18, 2014",positive,"Good! Real good! But not up to the hype. Still, a worthy member of the Marvel Superhero group."
"Oct 15, 2014",positive,Good but it's igsactly same as all the other marvel films really cheesy
"Oct 13, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is one entertaining as heck blockbuster that will please all audiences thanks to endearing performances, lots of fast action, and great effects."
"Oct 13, 2014",positive,Saw it in the theater on opening night and loved it!
"Oct 12, 2014",positive,Sharp writing and great action and camraderie of the main cast make this a true must-see!
"Oct 11, 2014",positive,"This was funny, action, and had awesome superheroes from individual movies that came together. This was one of the best movies I've seen"
"Oct 10, 2014",positive,"A film many thought would be hard to pull off. Joss whedon not only manges to accomplish this  but does so compellingly with this huge cast just about everyone gets their chance to shine (well except for Hawkeye). Avengers has it's issues just like any other film but manages to keep you entertain and has bit of something for everyone, I could watch Hulk smash over and over again!"
"Oct 9, 2014",positive,"At the core of a great film is an even greater story.  At the core of every great story are even greater characters, chemistry and a strong foundation of source material. The Avengers have been around since the early 60s, and the characters even far beyond that. Personally, in the midst of my parents divorcing, I decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew in March, 1982 while living in Broken Arrow, OK during one of my many, many trips to QuikTrip to either buy ice cream, donuts or penny candy while playing Ms. Pac-Man.  It wasn't a wonder why I became fat around this time.  Fast forward 2 years to May, 1984, when I purchased Avengers (Vol 1) number 243, mostly due to my being intrigued with Captain America.  I instantly fell in love with comics, and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time.  

For the next 3-4 years, I was obsessed with comic books, which centered completely around the Avengers, like Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Secret Wars, etc.  I read everything I could and became immersed into the years and years of Avengers history.  Even as girls and music became more interesting to me than comics, I still always had an affinity for the Avengers.  At one point, after beginning to earn a good living about 15 years ago, I tried collecting every issue ever made.  I got about 95% there when comics started being graded by CGC and ""guaranteeing"" condition.  I then sold most of my mediocre conditioned books and wanted to collect 9.2-10 (Near Mint-Mint) copies of every issue.  Only, the expense far outweighed my dedication and, to this day, I only have a few.  

My heart has always been with the Avengers, though.  My heart was broken when the first Avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment.  Just a pathetic series.  However, when the X-Men movies did well and other titles like Daredevil, Elektra and Fantastic Four started to be released, I was excited to eventually see, at least, Captain America, Iron Man, etc. on the big screen.  Never did I think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt The Avengers as a whole.

Then came Iron Man...a B character, at best, perfectly cast Robert Downey, Jr. as a spot-on Tony Stark.  And it was huge. Then came the news that Marvel had owned the properties again and had a strategy to deliver individual movies leading up to an all-encompassing Avengers movie.  NO WAY, I thought.  Oh this was BOUND to get screwed up.  And, frankly, there was probably NO WAY to please me, a die-hard Avengers fan, on the big screen.  Just no way.  Especially after Ang Lee's atrocious Hulk movie.  Surely Hulk would be left out of the mix.  

Then came Edward Norton as a superb Bruce Banner in the Incredible Hulk movie that hit all the right buttons, continued the Iron Man storyline, eluded to the Super Soldier serum, tying it all together with SHIELD.  The final scene in the Incredible Hulk showed us a meditating Bruce Banner with an evil grin, seemingly embracing and enjoying the monster within, which told us die-hard fans that he must be in the control of Loki, Norse god of Mischief, as was the case in the classic Avengers #1 issue from the early 60s.  Could they be setting up Loki and the Hulk as the villains of the Avengers movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book??

Then came Iron Man 2.  A poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more Nick Fury, Black Widow and Avengers talk.  Way too rushed, and thus what caused Favreau's exit as director.  My interest was still high, but I became cautious as the humor of Iron Man began leaning this whole thing in a direction I had hoped wouldn't come to pass.  Then, at the end of Iron Man 2, Thor's hammer in the middle of the desert sparked my interest, as designed, again.

Then came Thor.  I was really worried about this one.  A Norse god? Among all these high-tech, very human heroes?  Given the extremely strong representation of Batman by the Nolan films, this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing into full-blown CAMP.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Introducing Hawkeye helped a lot as well.  Then, at the end, with Loki seeing through the eyes of Erik gave us fans another glimpse of Loki controlling humans, which sparked the interest of the Hulk again.  

Finally, Captain America, perfectly cast Chris Evans and developed a near-perfect story around the Red Skull and the Cosmic Cube.  The foundation was almost full strength and The Avengers movie was on the horizon.  Could it meet the expectations of the film fans?  Better yet, could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the decades of comic book fans?

Over the past few months, I've seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for The Avengers.  I have been so worried thinking that the movie I've waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster.  Trailer after trailer, it didn't look any better.  Did Joss royally screw this thing up???

Well, I saw it opening night, tonight.  The trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece.  Sure, it's action-packed.  It's expected to be.  Sure it's got funny moments.  It's expected to, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. as a leading man.  What Joss Whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since Nolan's Batman series.  The interaction between the characters, the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws, and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes.  

To most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film; a great kickoff to the summer movie season. To me, a die-hard, multi-decade fanatic of this comic, these films, these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and, honestly, impossible to achieve, in my eyes.  Joss proved me oh-so-wrong.  When I began seeing the very nigh praise, the 93% on Rottentomatoes, etc. my low expectations became super high expectations. How often are expectations like that ever met?  Well, I can at least say they weren't met.  They were left in the dust, exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured.  Bless Marvel, Whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right.  Sure, Nolan has become the gold standard, but Whedon showed everyone that Marvel can do it too.  

My only regret is that Edward Norton couldn't reprise his role as Bruce Banner.  Of the 3 Bruce's, he was the best.  Mark Ruffalo was the worst.  I like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms, but Edward captured the intellectual, frightened and loner aspect of Bruce Banner perfectly.  Hulk, however, stole the show.  Without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie, I will just say that Joss' inclusion of Hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae.  

While I can't imagine them topping this one, I've been so strongly surprised, I would never say never.  The setup at the end of The Avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go.  I even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie, but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film.  Bring it on, Marvel.  Excelsior!  Nuff Said!!"
"Oct 8, 2014",positive,very good marvel film all the charterers were paid well though true marvel fans might not like the story. The new hulk was epic
"Oct 6, 2014",neutral,"I didn't enjoy ""The Avengers"" nearly as much as other recent Marvel movies."
"Oct 2, 2014",positive,While there solo adventures on film are good by there own right Marvel brings The Avengers to film with the help of the only person that can bring misfist and in this case superheroes together than Mr. Firefly himself. Awesome movie.
"Oct 1, 2014",positive,"Enough colourful action to make your inner eight-year-old squeal, and enough wit to keep your more reserved side entertained. Top-job Whedon."
"Oct 1, 2014",positive,"Really well-written. An action adventure comic book on the big screen. Joss Whedon does a great job of bringing together a group of super heroes, having their personalities clash as egos collide, then unifying them against a common enemy, to save the Earth. well done!"
"Sep 29, 2014",positive,"Now with all this hype, I have come to watch it in cinemas because it has its early release here. I completely say this is the most perfect film as a summer blockbuster. This is a comic Super Hero film at its perfection. The perfect film in terms of characterization. They did make each and every character very memorable. The humor in this film is top notch. They have one liners that are very catchy and very funny. I freaking love the pace, the camera shots are magnificent. There's no shaky bullsh*t or whatsoever.In terms of characters, I love the improvements they did on this. I love the rivals going on between each other's intention. The last part is epic. I love the part where each Avenger is fighting on a a one take shot. That was bone chilling. And by the time, when Iron Man tells everyone he's bringing up the party. And Capt. America says to Hulk. ""Now it is the time to become angry"". I freaking love that part. I love the details in terms of visual effects. You can see a very detailed CGI Hulk compared to the previous Hulk films. This film is not all about the story telling, but this is a perfect example of an awesome characterization. Everyone just proves their roles thus Joss Whedon gave a marvelous job on how roles can be fitted with all these all star casts in a 2 hour film. Some say it has a familiar 2nd half of the last transformer movie. Who cares, Whedon does the exact execution than Michael Bay's trash. It has more heart, a lot of love. Great execution, great pacing, great humor. What can I say more. Joss Whedon is on everyone's radar as he is our new savior. A superhero extravaganza that surpasses every single Marvel film up to date. Still, my heart goes to The Dark Knight as my favorite superhero flick, but then Marvel's The Avengers exceeded all the CGI blockbusters which is really beyond imagination. Superbly an amazing experience. 5/5"
"Sep 28, 2014",positive,"I don't give a five stars review simple because the second time that I saw it, I did not get as excited as the first time. Really entertaining and action-packed."
"Sep 28, 2014",positive,"....a modern movie, about superheroes, that actually knows that people don't want special effects but instead seek inter character relations...this movie is a masterpiece."
"Sep 26, 2014",positive,"Often a movie does not live up to its fan expectations. This one did. Big time. People will argue that the first 20 minutes are boring but it is all for the sake of character development and this is well balanced by excellent humour throughout (""Puny God""), fantastic action (The Battle of New York) and excellent acting from the entire cast, even the characters and actors we are seeing for the first time (Mark Ruffalo). This movie is worth everything you pay to see it. PLEASE let the sequel be just as good."
"Sep 25, 2014",positive,"Marvels The Avengers
By: Jeff Meckstroth
	If somebody gave me one word to describe the movie Marvels The Avengers, It would unquestionably be loud. Not the kind of loud that makes your ears bleed though, the kind of loud that makes a room swell up with excitement. Josh Weldon directs a fantastic film from beginning to end. With big explosions, and vivid images, as well as touching twist you wouldn't expect The Avengers is a thrill from beginning to end. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention this blockbuster includes not one, not two, but four major superhero's as well as your kick-boxing, bow shooting, kick ass shield agents. This movie truly holds nothing back when it comes to saving humanity.
Two superhero's has been done before, but packing so many personalities on one side of the good/bad line is one bold move. This movie will leave you choosing sides between the superhero casts. Captain America (Chris Evans), a WWI superhero, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), a inventor-industrialist, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Pagan God of Lightning, and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a scientist with a slight anger problem. Marvel did an excellent job of casting these superheroes, as they all provide just the right characteristics in their roles. I truly feel this movie would not have been complete without the casting of Samuel L. Jackson as the Nick Fury the leader of SHIELD. As a huge fan of Samuel Jackson I found this to be one of his better action film performances. His badass persona on screen was a perfect fit for this commanding role.
	Marvel had a genius and bold idea for this movie set back into action in the first Iron Man movie, and did an excellent job of carrying it out. In no such way did I feel you had to see every Marvel movie that lead up to this movie though. Marvel did a great job of making the movie suitable for newcomers as well as long time fans. From the start they did an excellent job of introducing every character at the perfect moment. Weldon was able to introduce each character as well as their personalities all at once. Weldon did a fantastic job of using Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in every which way a villain could be used. Loki, the god of mischief was truly just that during this movie. His ability to twist personalities, emotions, and egos all against each other was what made this movie more than just special affects and action. This touch of emotion gave this big budget film just the right amount of perception.
	Everybody knew what they wanted to see from the beginning of this movie, the epic battle scene with everyone of the mighty superheroes special powers gelling together to kick bad guy butt. The final battle scene in downtown Manhattan may just have been the scene everyone was anticipating entering this movie. This scene included everything from hulk smashing anything in sight, Iron Man leading air raids on giant fly slugs, and Captain American being, well Captain America! This battle scene could not have possibly been this epic without Josh Weldon's ability to gel all of this super heroes characteristics together.
	From start to finish this movie was jam-packed full with all the action every fan new it would be. What really separated this movie from others like it was the touching emotions displayed by the actors and a twisting plot line. So if it's a Friday night and you can't decide what superhero you want to watch kick butt. Marvels The Avengers will satisfy everyone of your bad guy butt kicking needs"
"Sep 24, 2014",positive,Entertaining and action packed.
"Sep 22, 2014",positive,Still awesome and one of the MCU's finest movies of all TIME!!!
"Sep 20, 2014",positive,"Hulk smashes, Thor hammers, Iron man is....well, Iron man. Action-packed, witty, and funny. Arguably the best super hero movie ever."
"Sep 20, 2014",positive,Amazing movie! One of the best superhero movies ever! I've seen it a million times by now and I still love it so much!
"Sep 20, 2014",positive,"The Avengers takes our Marvel heroes and slap it into one movie where they all have fun and kick ass. Along side the visual action there is a decent story, which is enough for a superhero movie."
"Sep 18, 2014",positive,"The best movie of the summer of 2012. Just hope they improve the Hulks look in Age of Ultron, no more of that apish stance. He looked a lot better in the Incredible Hulk 2008 film, more fearsome and realistic, someone I would be afraid of. The Avengers Hulk I did not feel any fear from him, I just couldn't take him seriously, he was small, flabby, weak, he kind of had this dumb look on his face. Although he was fun to watch he was very underwhelming. The fight between Thor and hulk was WAY! to short, and it did not deliver the excitement the Thor and Ironman fight had. Black widow was overpowered fighting those aliens that would crush cars as they fell. To much screen time went towards tony stark than the others, mainly Bruce banner and Captain America. Bruce never got a scene alone, he was always in a scene with another avenger or shield agent. A flashback would have been nice to see for Bruce, general Ross and Betty and how he is struggling with that. But it's a good film overall."
"Sep 16, 2014",positive,"With plenty of great action and lots of good characters and funny jokes and one-liners, the avengers is a popcorn action flick that will leave you wanting more."
"Sep 15, 2014",positive,A M A Z I N G ! ! ! !
"Sep 14, 2014",positive,best superhero movie ever
"Sep 13, 2014",positive,"The only downfall is that the avengers don't seem to break a sweat. However, who gives a flying piece of the Stark tower?! This one will be in textbooks 200 years from now, if in fact, we still consume knowledge that way."
"Sep 13, 2014",positive,"Chris Hemsworth & RDJ...yes, please!!!!! That's all I have to say about that!"
"Sep 13, 2014",negative,I still don't understand what people liked about this movie. The plot is weak and the jokes are flat.
"Sep 12, 2014",positive,"I'm not like a huge fan, but it was a pretty good movie."
"Sep 11, 2014",positive,"Apparently dreams come true! Marvel's The Avengers is probably the best superhero movie, with lots of humor, great fighting sequences, and a fantastic story.With earth's mightiest heroes fighting to restore balance, but also having difficulties working with each other at first, almost every member of the audience is in for a treat!"
"Sep 8, 2014",positive,Great movie just great
"Sep 8, 2014",positive,"I like Marvel's movies when I was small. Every Marvel's movie I did watch them all.  The hero's movie makes me feel like I am escaping the reality. This kind of movie can relax me a lot so I decided to watch Avengers. In this movie, there are a lot of hero's join together appear on one screen. It fascinates me a lot. I arouse my curiosity to buy the ticket. 

In the movie of Avengers, there are a lot of heroes. First of all they don't know each other but then they meet so soon. They joint together to fight with their same enemies. However, in this movie, I think the movie don't have much relation between each of the hero. Although they meet each other, they don't have a big relationship like they are individual. The part of how they meet is the most interesting part of this movie and it create so jokes that can entertain the audience.  The fight of these heroes is really great. The post- production of this movie is really great. They spend much on the effect so it is quit attractive. 

Overall, Avengers is not bad. I think Avengers can create more interesting stories such as build more new relationship between those heroes. I hope it will have Avengers 2 later on."
"Sep 7, 2014",positive,Everyone gets to have their piece of the cake and eat it too in this superhero ensemble flick.
"Sep 7, 2014",positive,whole family loves this film.
"Sep 7, 2014",positive,Great and all but I can't give it a perfect 5. I won't get specific but I was let down when I saw the movie as people spoke of it like rj was a game changer. Honestly just exactly what I expected of a superhero team up movie. Nothing really blew my mind.
"Sep 4, 2014",positive,All the previous marvel movie's featuring each superhero were good. Put them all together and you only expect the Avenger's to be one thing: epic. And it was. An exciting action movie with a generous dose of laughs.
"Sep 4, 2014",negative,soooo boring... it did make me want to watch Ironman... because I didn't care about anything that was happening
"Sep 3, 2014",positive,"A film that gave us more than what we wanted, Avengers is great and did not dissapoint. People waited for this to happen for decades, and they felt lucky."
"Sep 2, 2014",positive,"This movie really kicked some serious alien tush!  It was so good to watch, esp. on Labor Day weekend.  I really enjoyed it, as much if not more than Thor 2, which I saw in theaters.  I would definitely recommend it and plan on seeing the next Avengers movie!!!"

"Sep 1, 2014",negative,"All the clever banter and expensive CGI in the world can't save these heroes, who work harder fighting each other for screen time than fighting Tom Hiddleston for the generic comic-book epic McGuffin. Of course, no one came to see a legitimately well-made film, as is usually the case with sueprhero movies these days. Writer/director Joss Whedon is painfully aware of the wittiness of his characters' one-liners, but the sass reaches an unbearable level of pomposity within the first half an hour. And there are five half-hours in the film, each one longer than the last. It is, after all, the same plot you've seen a zillion times, this time with no focus and even less dignity."
"Aug 31, 2014",positive,"Has there ever been a more highly anticipated or more intensely hyped blockbuster than this? As a lifelong and proud comic geek, this flick sort of represents the true assimilation of comic book culture into pop culture, and this both excites and troubles me. Part of me is so happy that the superhero is finally such an accepted and popular genre. The other sees something that was very intimate to me and my childhood becoming a big popular spectacle. All in all though I'm cool with it, because 15 years ago I couldn't have imagined something like 'The Avengers' in my wildest dreams.

This is the culmination of the last 5 years of Marvel films. At the end of the first 'Ironman', when the idea of an Avengers project was hinted at, it had the feeling of a glimmer of hope for something far off in the future that would probably never happen. But then 'The Incredible Hulk' did the same thing. And then 'Ironman 2' hinted further, throwing out hints to Captain America and Thor, bringing the full on and awesome realization that 'The Avengers' was an impending reality. 

For the longest time, I was actually very worried about the project. How does a studio live up to the insanely sky-high and probably unrealistic expectations of a film like this? It seemed almost too big to succeed. Add that to the fact that I am not Joss Whedon's biggest fan, and that 'Ironman 2', 'Thor', and 'Captain America' were all somewhat underwhelming, and I had some real doubts about whether Whedon and Marvel Studios could deliver on something so built up and so huge. Then I saw the first trailer, and I was sold. 

Upon finally seeing it, I can say that my expectations were healthily met. The fact that all the major characters have already had their own solo movies enables this film to already have established back stories and character development, and can therefore jump right in. Not only that, but many parts of the plot have already been set up and mentioned by the prior films. Because of this, I would highly recommend seeing the above mentioned movies if for no other reason than it will really enhance the characters and the story.

The special effects are of course amazing. Perhaps the most impressive ever seen on screen, and I don't say that lightly. Highly impressive action sequences chalk-full of awesome comic book action with plenty of nods to the source material. 

The script is hit and miss. The opening few scenes are pretty shoddily written I won't lie. Some pretty wooden dialogue makes it feel very stiff at parts, but for the most these moments are few and far between. The vast majority of the script is seriously funny and witty. Honestly, this movie is funnier than just about any comedy I've seen in the last couple years. There are tons of big laughs that had the theater just about in riots. While the humor was great, I found it as a bit of a negative as well. The plot of the film is a pretty big one that involves some pretty Earth shattering implications. Its a bit hard to balance the seriousness of such things with such funny writing. That's not to say that it is unsuccessful in any way, but the seriousness of the film is somewhat lessened. 

As far as the acting goes, pretty much everyone is rock solid. Evans, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are all more comfortable in their roles a second time around. Newcomer Ruffalo is great as Bruce Banner and the Hulk. He really conveys the intelligence of the character as well as his inner torment. Jeremy Renner is also very good in a dual villain/hero role. The whole idea behind this film is the cohesiveness of its characters, but if there's one character that really personifies 'The Avengers', its Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. He's defined the character twice already, but he is even better here. His smart ass dialogue and banter really seem to give the film its tone and its overall feel. As much as I hate to say it, Samuel L isn't particularly good as Nick Fury. He just seems to deliver a one note performance. Scarlett Johannson is also not super awesome. She just seems a bit out of her league and is overpowered by more assertive characters.

The direction, score and cinematography are all very solid. Some exceptions include a couple of dizzying shots and a couple of overpowering moments with the music, but again, very minimal flaws. For the most part, it is an expertly constructed and presented film.

All in all, what 'The Avengers' has done is nothing short of amazing when you think about it. Christopher Nolan did not have to deal with these sort of expectations when working on his Batman films (save the uber anticipated 'Dark Knight Rises'), and neither did Sam Raimi with his original Spider-Man film. The fact that the spotlight was on Whedon from minute 1 and he managed to deliver in such a resounding way is really pretty impressive. Great acting performances, witty dialogue, incredible special effects, and its just plain awesome coolness combine for a must see experience. As a lifelong Marvel fan I enjoyed this tremendously, but this isn't just for us fanboys. A few flaws with the script, minor acting and some questions about its seriousness knock it from flat out awesome territory, but this is a seriously good and action packed extravaganza that has more than lived up to expectations."

"Aug 21, 2014",positive,"A fun film to be sure but the action is to over the top and at the same time lacking. While the writing and production is top notch, as is the acting, it is the direction and pacing that really hampers The Avengers."
"Aug 21, 2014",positive,'Nuff said. This movie is spectacular and displays what Marvel is all about. One of the greatest superhero movies of all time! The Avengers redefine what a superhero movie can be. It makes the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer!
"Aug 20, 2014",negative,Disappointing. I expected more. Downright dull in places.
"Aug 20, 2014",positive,"Magnificent! The way they managed to bring together all the best actors to give great performances. No actor tried to outdo the other, they bounced off each other beautifully. Story line was awesome as well, and did the comic book movie fan proud."
"Aug 19, 2014",positive,"I have seen this film multiple times but went back on rotten tomatoes to add to my rating to, yes, my favorite movie of all time. I love marvel and have been a huge fan all my life. I enjoy everything about it. The Avengers I feel is a sum of marvels overall creativity, imagination, and inspiration. This movie follows the most infamous superhero team, the mighty avengers. An all time favorite movie of mine, and will probably continue to be."
"Aug 18, 2014",positive,absolutely love this movie all the fighting parts were so dramatic
"Aug 17, 2014",positive,"There really is no reason why this movie should be as good as it is, it is almost miraculous!  With all of these superheroes in one film it should have been a soupy, unfocused mess of a disaster.  Instead, we get one of funniest and action packed superhero films yet.  

Marvel's greatest heroes (minus Spider-Man and the X-Men) come together to take down the demigod Loki and his alien co-conspiritors who aim a hostile takeover of Earth with a convenient little wormhole created by this weeks maguffin.  Of course getting all of these egos to get along isn't an easy job, but Nick Fury takes advantage of a unfortunate situation to get the team emotionally on the same page.
Your favorite comic books come to life on the screen in the most epic battle to ever occur in a superhero movie.  The Hulk really steals the show in this movie.  He doesn't have much to say or be very interesting, so it isn't surprising that his two previous movie incarnations were rather underwhelming.  Here though, there is just enough Hulk sprinkled through the film to make you want more of the the jade giant.  Mark Ruffalo also helps as the most well rounded Bruce Banner yet.    Watching the Hulk battle Thor and then the alien horde will definitely get your nerd sense tingling with joy!  

Another thing worth noting is that no character is left behind in the storytelling.  Everyone has their own storyline and moments to shine.  (The Black Widow/Hawkeye subplot will certainly be played out more in Avengers: Age of Ultron).  Iron Man in particular really turns the page on how much he is willing to sacrifice for his fellow man.  He proves he isn't just a cocky billionaire playboy in a metal suit.  A film that will be enjoyed years into the future.  Score: 10"
"Aug 17, 2014",positive,"Why am i Reviewing this film when i should  be watching it! Avengers Assemble is one of the best films i have ever watched, action packed, witty and keeps you on your toes throughout, can we expect anything less from a Marvel film? Excellent five stars!"
"Aug 17, 2014",positive,I really don't understand why this movie is hated by people i honestly believe this movie should be loved not hated the movie has no flaws fully capturing the characters besides Hawkeye and Black Widow but we knew their place. The movie got me feeling the tensity at the end and made me feel childish with the action and yet thought about the characters but my favorite was Loki and Tony Stark/Iron Man and how they had the most character development which I think lots of people wanted because they act very well not at all did I think they were out of character or more like they were them. The music scores playing really were awesome except for the opening score and in the end it makes you want more and makes you want to explore their set up world which will do very well for now

"Aug 14, 2014",negative,"Were it not for Robert Downey Jr. and the much needed self-distance his character brings to the table, I honestly wouldn't have made it halfway through Marvel's The Avengers.

"Aug 13, 2014",positive,It blew me out of the back of the theater.
"Aug 13, 2014",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers, or as it's known here in the UK, Marvel's Avengers Assemble, is brilliant. It is the first Marvel superhero crossover film, combining Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America as they join together to save the Earth from Thor's brother Loki. The acting is brilliant, as are the actors (especially Tom Hiddleston. I love Tom Hiddleston), the plot is great, and the fight scenes are awesome. This is an unmissable experience that pushes the barrier for superhero movies forever."

"Aug 6, 2014",positive,"Great fun, but it has a lot of faults. Not best casting choices (I'm looking at you, Scarlet Johanson), faulty writing, clumsy storytelling. It's no masterpiece, but you'll probably enjoy it."
"Aug 5, 2014",neutral,"Visually stunning but overly- simplified plotwise, and  with an absence of the kind of human and relatable depth that it's director is known for bringing to even the silliest premises, this epic blockbuster forgoes it's potential to be "" the Citizen Cane of Comic-book movies"" and  settles for a pleasing romp,  it falls short of its five movie build up and will leave you lamenting that Joss Wheadon  could have done so much better and produced what could have been the first Oscar-winning comic book move

In the end, it feels like yet another prequel to future sequels instead of the culmination it was billed as, which may be better for the MCU as a whole, but it leaves a lot to be desired as the trademark post-credit scene  fades to black, not because of what we got , but  because we feel robbed of what we could've had."
"Aug 5, 2014",positive,A quite disappointing film.
"Aug 4, 2014",positive,The best comic book film of all time.
"Aug 4, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is a fantastic movie. Make no mistake, the massive budget is on full display here with truly high powered graphics that drip expensive and look it too. The cast is excellent, with Thor's occasional missteps and Hawkeye's boredom totally glossed over by a top notch Ironman, Captain America, Black Widow and Loki performance that really carries the film and defines it from its super-team predecessors. The action scenes are truly epic as well, combining the things that make Michael Bay's movies sell any tickets with the storyline and characters that make everyone else's movies sell tickets. The Avengers is not all good however. Despite being the most polished superhero movie to date and despite the all-star cast, the movie fails to add anything new to the genre, instead choosing to merely refine it, a move that is acceptable but a bit boring in a world now dominated by the Marvel superheroes. The match-up is all too predictable, as is the outcome. New York is destroyed yet again, aliens come through portal and a team of flawed heroes comes together at the last moment to end the threat. Character development is limited solely to a deeply traditional superhero arc. Hawkeye is a downright pathetic character. Don't misunderstand, the Avengers is an excellent movie, it just isn't a particularly original one, although it is one you should see all the same."
"Aug 4, 2014",positive,Best comic book movie in my opinion

"Aug 4, 2014",positive,"Great plot, Awesome characters, Outstanding special effects. The Avengers is a film for people of all ages with humor action and plot development"
"Aug 3, 2014",positive,"In my opinion, this film might be a bit too overrated. The dialogue is funny, the action is very good actually. But the whole movie itself is almost kind of boring. And it actually rather annoys me on how totally unbelievable this is. When I say that, I'm not talking about the superheroes and what not, I'm talking on how the superheroes life's are affected and how the civilians life's are as well. But I think that is too deep for me to get into. And isn't it bad how this movie didn't get me pumped up? I mean, c'mon, it's supposed to be one of the greatest super hero movies ever made- but it did not live up to expectation for me. Not bad, but totally amazing."
"Aug 3, 2014",positive,"during this film, like bruce banner's anger, my penis was constantly erect. you can tell this is a whedon film because black widow is a strong independent woman who don't need no man and totally not a sex symbol. would smash with the force of a thousand mjolnirs. 5 star norcs"
"Aug 3, 2014",negative,"The most over-rated movie of all time. The Avengers is made to make the movie makers money. Loki was stopped by Thor in Thor, who would think it's a good idea for him to be brought back as the main antagonist again but against all the Avengers? No one but since all the nerds get a stiff from Marvel, it's universally loved. There is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out. Its plot isn't new. It's acting is average. It's theme is typical. This movie is just lame and simple."
"Aug 3, 2014",positive,"Another awesome Marvel film filled with action, superheroes, villains and witty jokes, however, still provides some heart as well. Only downside was that it kinda felt like it was merely filling in the gaps of other movies in some parts and was a bit too long in my opinion."
"Aug 2, 2014",positive,Put multiple marvel super heroes together and you get a great movie.
"Aug 2, 2014",positive,Greatest Marvel Film Ever Made
"Aug 2, 2014",positive,They should have kept the hulk from the 2008 movie. And Jeremy Renner sucked as Hawkeye. Dolph Ziggler would have been a better choice
"Aug 1, 2014",positive,It's the Avengers need I say more.
"Aug 1, 2014",positive,"A fun time, but nothing special."
"Aug 1, 2014",positive,a 2 hour geek fantasy was worth my time
"Aug 1, 2014",positive,Loved every second of it. Brilliantly acted with special shout out to Mark Ruffalo as he suprised us all with his banner. Loki is awesome once again however did feel it was lazy using him for the villain in two marvel films. Superb film and a must watch
"Jul 31, 2014",positive,One of the best superhero films I have EVER SEEN! :) Another one of my faves! :)
"Jul 31, 2014",positive,"ð?
This may just be a classic."
"Jul 31, 2014",positive,best superhero movie ever made
"Jul 30, 2014",positive,not enough rating stars to do it justice
"Jul 30, 2014",positive,"If you include this with phase 1, this would be my 3rd favorite of the phase. This doesn't say much because I didn't like Thor or Captain America: The First Avenger that much. I tried to watch this film seven times in a week trying to like it and only enjoyed on the 8th. The 9th and 10th times. My opinion went back to the way it was. The same thing about this film is what fatigued me in The Amazing Spider-Man 2; all plot, no story. This film is not particularly bad, but disappointing to say the least. I heard great things about it when it first came out and now I rarely watch reviews about movies I want to see for myself unless I've already seen it. I credit Joss Whedon for balancing all of the characters relatively well and the script isn't complete trash, and it doesn't feel like a total insult to my intelligence. The narrative is pretty weak, but nobody is at fault there. This film has little depth and no underlying themes that you leave thinking about. I personally like films with a strong narrative if not awesome portrayals of my favorite characters, which this does not have (because my favorite Marvel characters are Punisher, Spider-Man, and Deadpool). With that said, the Hulk and Iron Man were awesome in this film!"
"Jul 30, 2014",positive,An extremely fun superhero movie that perfectly brings together Marvel's superheroes perfectly. It definitely lived up to the huge hype built around it.
"Jul 30, 2014",positive,It's all the best super heroes in one movie. Of course it's going to be awesome.
"Jul 29, 2014",positive,Show More Hulk in the 2nd movie
"Jul 29, 2014",positive,"A bit overrated, but a great film none the less."
"Jul 29, 2014",positive,GREAT movie! â??â??â??â??â??
"Jul 29, 2014",positive,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is the most fun I have ever had or probably will have in a movie theater.
"Jul 29, 2014",negative,"At least an hour and forty minutes too long. Trying to give a complex backstory to a bunch of cartoon characters is an exercise in futility - and boredom. Watched to the end - no surprises here - only for the CGI, which does not a movie make, but does have some entertainment value. Really having trouble understanding how this got such high reviews, unless of course the reviewers are all 12 year old boys."
"Jul 28, 2014",positive,"This is one of the best, if not the BEST superhero film ever made. I thought it was a really awesome film. If I had an award show for every superhero film, this would win the best superhero film ever made."
"Jul 28, 2014",positive,"As a longtime Marvel nerd, The Avengers was everything I could have hoped for. I loved it and even if you have never picked up a comic book in your life, you should watch this film.
Marvel's going to have one hell of a problem trying to top this."
"Jul 28, 2014",neutral,Great Movie But All This Talk About it is not worth it It Was Half But Not Something I Would Worship
"Jul 28, 2014",positive,"A quirky, smart, and funny movie about characters learning that is necessary to ASSEMBLE! With a great casting, great soundtrack, script, and directing by Joss Whedon, this movie plays with the ideia of make a super hero movie, and is one of the best yet."
"Jul 28, 2014",positive,"I seriously thought this movie would fail. There was no way whatsoever it could live up to the expectations of five movies, cram this many big-name characters in it, and still be both coherent and clever.
I was completely wrong. Joss Whedon should be given a medal, because he did what I believed would be completely impossible. Is it still a dumb, silly movie? Absolutely. Is it funny, clever, and well crafted from beginning to end? Without a doubt."
"Jul 25, 2014",positive,This film was amazing
"Jul 25, 2014",positive,Best superhero movie I've ever seen
"Jul 24, 2014",positive,Hard to get so many big characters to fit into one movie.  But I loved it.  The appearance of Thanos at the end left me looking forward to future movies.
"Jul 24, 2014",positive,Universally enjoying for everyone. It makes me feel like a kid who wants to be a superhero.
"Jul 23, 2014",positive,"It's funny, great story, great acting, I give it five stars."
"Jul 22, 2014",positive,Avengers is a comedy and action movie all in one that you will never forget.  Six well known superheroes must team up to save the world.  You'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time.
"Jul 21, 2014",positive,"The Ultimate Marvel Geek fantasy that not only is good with its humor,script,awesome effects,and never forgetting its heroes and villains,but is a great addition to the marvel canon,and let casual and hardcore fans have a good popcorn flick."
"Jul 21, 2014",positive,This I my favorite superhero film ever it is action packed as we'll does it have a great story joss weden made a monster hit with this tremendous film well done!!!!!!
"Jul 21, 2014",positive,It's hard not to get excited at seeing all the heroes together at last.
"Jul 21, 2014",positive,Something that's never been done before and the only film I could watch over and over without getting tired of
"Jul 21, 2014",positive,Perfection. I love what Marvel did with this one. Great job.
"Jul 20, 2014",positive,The perfect comic book film of all time. Still wish Daredevil and Spidey could join the team.
"Jul 19, 2014",positive,"Action Comedy Adventure Brohood All in one! 
Loved it!"
"Jul 19, 2014",negative,"The Avengers is your typical patriotic superhero film. Big, dumb, and forgettable. The only thing worth watching was the Hulk smashing things up."
"Jul 18, 2014",positive,Best Marvel Movie Ever!!! The Avengers are finally a movie! Love the comics!! I bought it on DVD. That's how good it is.
"Jul 17, 2014",positive,"a great way to end phase one this movie is great. I had a couple of problems with the movie. For one it kinda starts out slow but still has great dilogue to fill the gap of action. Captain america's costume was a little cartoony to me. And and some moments some of the jokes didn't stick and came off a bit cheesy. Having that been said I still loved the movie, and can't wait for it's sequel."
"Jul 17, 2014",negative,"Although, The Avengers is an entertaining, blockbuster, popcorn flick. It's not really too much more than that. It appears as though it's a film for 10 year olds. The plot is weak and there is nothing that really keeps you fixed to the screen. From an artistic perspective, The Avengers certainly wouldn't rank high in my books."
"Jul 15, 2014",negative,"Overrated.  Here's the movie in 5 seconds, talking, talking, talking, Hulk Smash, Talking.  The end.  There's so much talking and yet no development somehow"
"Jul 15, 2014",positive,Such a great movie all the way around. Some how they are able to put in all of these larger than life characters and somehow not over crowd the movie: the pacing is great and the special effects are prefect. It's really amazing how marvel was been able to put four summer blockbuster movies and combine them all together and still make it more than just the novelty of seeing these larger then life Hero's on the big screen. For my money it was the best time I've had at the movies ever and Josh will be hard pressed to do it again with Avengers 2.
"Jul 14, 2014",positive,"A tremendously enjoyable marvel superhero movie. Incredible entertaining action and special effects, combined with witty humor that does not detract from the seriousness of the film's narrative."
"Jul 14, 2014",positive,"A bit messy in the first half, especially with their inevitable ego clashes, but got better when they finally fought together. Was fun to see each Avenger meet the other and to observe the dynamics. Notes : Agent Coulson died, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was interesting, Tony Stark talks to thin air a lot and had wit."
"Jul 14, 2014",positive,"All of the famous Marvel superheroes in one whole movie. Epic. I can't say anything else, just absolutley spectacular. Action packed and full of suspense and humour, I don't know what Marvel fans could really ask for more. This film definitley had me on the edge of my seat."
"Jul 12, 2014",positive,The Marvel movie's Marvel movie.
"Jul 10, 2014",positive,Good but highly over rated! Plot was eh. Monsters were eh.
"Jul 10, 2014",positive,"One of my favorite movies! ""I am a god"" ""puney god"""
"Jul 10, 2014",positive,If you dont like this movie. Your an idiot.
"Jul 9, 2014",negative,This movie is lame!!! It has such a lame story. I really don't care about this movie.
"Jul 7, 2014",positive,"Great movie, defiantly 5 stars"
"Jul 7, 2014",positive,"A great, funny, action-packed roller coaster that is deserving of all the praise it gets."
"Jul 6, 2014",positive,A Once in a lifetime idea that only delivers after the first hour
"Jul 6, 2014",positive,"Love it! Love it Love it! Marvel has done a phenomenal job bringing this incredible cast of characters together, while forming an inter-connected ""Universe""! This is how it's done! As always, Make Mine Marvel!"
"Jul 6, 2014",positive,"Harmless surface entertainment done with immense bombast and a budget that could sink countries. Remarkably, the film manages to tell a comprehensible story despite its ensemble cast of super-characters, and wraps it all up with decent humor and a bravura 20-min action scene that is at the top of its class."
"Jul 6, 2014",neutral,One of the most overrated films of all time! I have no idea how this film made many people's top 10 list of 2012. The only thing good about it was the action and everything else I couldn't care less.
"Jul 6, 2014",positive,best superhero movie
"Jul 4, 2014",positive,"Fun, exciting, this film manages to be the film that Marvel has been building up to, in a great way. And while it isn't my #1 favorite comic book film, it is however, my #1 favorite Marvel film."
"Jul 4, 2014",positive,"There is always that time when you hate Disney. I hated them when they bought Marvel, but thank God they did. Now we're getting Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers 2, Ant-Man, and many, many more. And what they did with this movie, was awesome."
"Jul 4, 2014",positive,What an awesome movie
"Jul 3, 2014",positive,"DC has The Dark Knight, Marvel has The Avengers. While it's plot may not be extraordinary, everything else is. No Marvel movie has been this fun in years."
"Jul 3, 2014",neutral,"A Glorified Kids' Movie
Average acting, try-hard humor chatter, one liners, terrible villan, and weak of character development. 
The only reason people overlook these problems is because of its colorful action sequences that are less than satisfying."
"Jul 3, 2014",positive,ROCKS!!! I wish there where a better way to represent the Hulk in these as apposed to complete CGI animation. I like Ruffalo and Banner a lot though.
"Jul 1, 2014",positive,One of the best movies all time
"Jul 1, 2014",positive,Good superhero movie.
"Jun 30, 2014",positive,"I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel movies but I can sit through them and they provide decent entertainment. The Avengers is an action packed adventure with great effects, a well written story, fine performances and great direction from Joss Whedon. While that being said, this film doesn't offer anything new to the Marvel franchise, the concept of this is very repetitive. I feel it's the same as every other Marvel movie. I just want something new out of a superhero movie instead of the whole ""rinse and repeat"" cycle. The movie itself is good and Joss Whedon does stay true to the source material and he has always showed that he had a knack for creating something great and stylish."
"Jun 30, 2014",positive,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is an entertaining ride of amazing action, acting, special effects, and pretty much everything fans want for a Avengers movie, it's a delight!"
"Jun 29, 2014",positive,This is a genuinely great movie despite the fact that they're always talking into ear prices that don't exist. The half because I've seen it too many time.
"Jun 29, 2014",positive,"The people behind the Marvel Universe are geniouses, (I'm obvisouly not because of spelling), but I love the way they tied the movies together and even tied a tV show into their universe, can't wait for upcoming movies."
"Jun 29, 2014",neutral,"I am not going to say the movie was bad, but at the same time, there was nothing making it amazing.  The whole movie is predictable, and generally boring"
"Jun 29, 2014",positive,One of the best films of all time
"Jun 28, 2014",positive,All in one =) what a kick!!  Exciting movies=)
"Jun 28, 2014",positive,The best superhero film I seen.
"Jun 28, 2014",positive,"Marvel's new offing titled The Avengers is how a superhero movie should be like. Action packed, full of CGI, loud but never lousy."
"Jun 27, 2014",positive,Very gOOd mOvie! Entertaining tO watch! Can't wait fOr part 2!
"Jun 27, 2014",positive,"One of the top grossing, best movies of all time. I loved it. There's only one better superhero movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier."
"Jun 27, 2014",positive,One of the best summer movies ever. As funny as it is thrilling.
"Jun 26, 2014",neutral,So generic. Nothing interesting happens just mindless action with no emphasis on characters whatsoever. A very basic and cliched plot where bad guys want to rule the world and the good guys have to stop them. Very predictable. Entertaining and funny in parts I guess
"Jun 25, 2014",positive,The Best of the BEST!!!
"Jun 24, 2014",positive,best marvel movie ever
"Jun 23, 2014",positive,"Avengers is something that doesn't happen often. This had a lot riding on it, knowing that that the stand alone films have all been setting up to this, and it does not disappoint. Avengers puts everything right with the prequels and puts it into one movie. A lot of characters but making them all work together is to treat them like there in there own movie, and every stole the show. Everyone had something to do, you could even see character development through the movie. Now that being said, its insane that about three quarters of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier. There are also some minor plot points that aren't explained. But in all, this movie is all about fun and sets up the future of cinematic universe almost perfectly. (8.5/10)"
"Jun 23, 2014",positive,great superhero movie that has just about everything you want in it
"Jun 23, 2014",positive,one of the best movies of all time
"Jun 22, 2014",positive,Comics come to life. Brilliant
"Jun 21, 2014",positive,I really enjoyed this movie. It is action all the time and the humor is in the right places.
"Jun 19, 2014",positive,All great movies with just one.Now a whole group. Very good movie. MArvel keeps doing its job.
"Jun 19, 2014",positive,Marvel is just amazing.
"Jun 19, 2014",positive,"I have an army . We have hulk . A great movie with action,comedy,And adventure ."
"Jun 18, 2014",positive,Awesome hero movie of all time.
"Jun 18, 2014",positive,great superhero movie with good chemistry between the characters and mind blowing action sequences. this movie was epic.
"Jun 17, 2014",neutral,Love how they play in one movie together.
"Jun 17, 2014",positive,"Too awesome, must see!! Can't wait for next"
"Jun 17, 2014",positive,good adventure  movie.
"Jun 17, 2014",positive,One of the best movies around........
"Jun 17, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is not only one of the best superhero films ever made, it is one of the best movies of the last 10 years. This is the superhero movie I have been waiting for my entire life, and my high expectations were greatly exceeded."
"Jun 16, 2014",positive,"This film is undoubtedly, the biggest film of the decade. It brings together great characters who are portrayed by great actors and actresses. The only problem was that it seems that they could have done a lot more with it. When you go see it you expect it to be all fighting and action. But you have to remember that they have to introduce the characters to each other and explain why they brought then together. In the end it leads to an epic battle which could either save the world or end it."
"Jun 13, 2014",positive,"Best super hero movie ever made. It managed to please the fans of the source material, while pleasing critics as well. Not enough big movie adaptions get away with that."
"Jun 13, 2014",positive,"If you haven't seen it, go; now!  This movie has it all; if you're any kind of Marvel fan, you can't afford not to see this!"
"Jun 12, 2014",positive,"The first two-thirds are typical Joss Whedon goodness with great character development and a lot of kickass fight scenes. Unfortunately during the last third, the movie succumbs to Michael Bay-itis, and the film forsakes character and instead focuses on superheroes and aliens crashing into things. The movie's good, but it could have been so much more."
"Jun 12, 2014",positive,What is not to like about this extraordinarily well written superhero team up?
"Jun 11, 2014",positive,Hollywood Ã  son meilleur.
"Jun 10, 2014",positive,One Of The Best Movies Ever!!
"Jun 9, 2014",positive,ALL AND MORE! I'M THRILLED!!
"Jun 9, 2014",positive,Best Superhero Movie!
"Jun 8, 2014",positive,"Best superhero film to date, Ruffalo stepped in nicely and RDJ stole the show as always."
"Jun 8, 2014",positive,Why doesn't this have a perfect score? The greatest superhero movie of all time became fantastic! It doesn't make any sense.
"Jun 8, 2014",positive,Best Comic Book ever!. The only movie that make me go to the theater 7 times! Yeah i saw this movie 7 times and every time i enjoy it love it!! this movie is a entertainment epic action fun experience!
"Jun 7, 2014",positive,"Just as funny as Iron Man was thanks to Joss Whedon and his top notch team! Whedon has done no wrong! He brings his lingo, his wit and his sassy style to bring together The Avengers in a fun campy way to tell a story of immense proportions! We comic nerds have waited a long time for this story to be told and yet you can nitpick the not so comic things they ""miss"" you easily replace them with some of the best action to comedy scenes in all of blockbuster history. As long as Marvel is smart enough to compromise with Whedon unlike they did with so many others they will prosper ever more and not flounder out like Iron Man 2/3 seemingly do! Thor 2 did! Etc and ya theyre certainly notches above DC ie green lantern (waste of money) but it doesnt take much to slide off the top of the mountain!"
"Jun 7, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is the one of the best superhero movie you will see. The much awaited team up of the Avengers was pretty good, as the back and forth conversations between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are very entertaining. The action is stunning, and Mark Ruffalo is obviously a huge step up as Hulk."
"Jun 7, 2014",positive,Can't wait for the second one well worth the watch
"Jun 6, 2014",neutral,"As incredible and intriguing as the Marvel universe is, the team of superheroes didn't ultimately live up to all the hype. While the action scenes were pulse pounding, there was no real evidence of any loss or risk. When you're dealing with so many heroes who are seemingly invincible, their flawless fighting style seems to drag on as a bit repetitious. With the story drawn out for over 2 hours and then conveniently tied up in 5 mins, the film surprisingly lacks explanation."
"Jun 4, 2014",positive,"This movie is amazing!! This is the best marvel film to date!! Slightly even better than the winter soldier,but still amazing!! IMO the best comic book movie ever"
"Jun 3, 2014",positive,Absolutely Jaw dropping.
"Jun 3, 2014",positive,love this movie to the death
"Jun 2, 2014",positive,"Marvels The Avengers directed by Joss Whedon, is an action packed movie about superheroes. This film was based on the widely popular Marvel Comics about a superhero team. The main characters in the film are Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye all together they form the Avengers. They all come together when Loki, an evil super villain threatens global national security by stealing the Tesseract.  The Tesseract, is a power source that could be very dangerous if put in the wrong hands.  It was taken away from Nick Fury the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peacekeeping organization.  That is why Nick Fury built up a team to help save the world. The rest of the movie is about all of The Avengers trying to come together to get the Tesseract back.  One of the major themes that I took away from this movie was teamwork. Without working with others or working like a team you cannot solve anything. This was shown in the beginning of the movie, when all of the superheroes had big egos and refused to work together. None of the superheroes where better than the other, but when put together they are unstoppable and can save the world. That's why when they accepted one another and worked together like a team they were able to accomplish a lot more things. My favorite quote from the movie was when Bruce Banner said 'my secret is that I am always angry' before he transformed into The Hulk. I liked this quote because it was so unexpected and it really stood out in the movie. Overall, The Avengers was an awesome movie filled with action and adventure. It had a very interesting plot and it was nice to see all of the superheroes in one movie.  That's why, I would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend it to anyone that's 13 years or older because it is rated PG-13. Other than that, it never had a dull moment and had a little bit of everything for everyone."
"Jun 2, 2014",positive,You can't not like this movie.
"Jun 1, 2014",positive,"My personal favorite--this film truely defys what these ""superheros"" are willing to due to defend humanity; with the script, amazing cast, and incredible special effects. Not sense star wars have we ever had such a spectacle"
"Jun 1, 2014",positive,A predictable masterpiece.
"May 31, 2014",positive,"Christopher Nolan's Batman series are the better films. But I can tell The Avengers is a movie I will rewatch many, many times. It has the polish and smarts of the Batman movies, but with a great sense of humor to bring it down to earth. Joss Whedon is a master and this is one of his finest hours."
"May 31, 2014",positive,"The best superhero film in years!!! Loved seeing an ensemble cast that combined Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner from previous Marvel films against Thor's evil brother Loki and his alien armada. Great action, strong character development, and an amazing story that brings a great group of characters together which has never been done before. Amazing!!!"
"May 31, 2014",positive,"Arguably the best superhero movie ever. 
Definitely the most epic."
"May 30, 2014",positive,"ZzZzzzZzz WHAT? HUH? Oh jeez... You woke me from my nap... Oh? What? Oh, the movie, yeah.... ZzZZzZzz."
"May 30, 2014",positive,Decent superhero film but Loki is a shite bad guy. Hulks class in it tho
"May 30, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon spearheaded the daunting task of fitting four demanding superheroes on the big screen, and he made it look easy. Outrageously funny and simply spectacular, 'The Avengers' succeeds on all fronts. Each character gets its due justice, and when they are occupying the screen at the same moment, it's quite marvelous. 'The Avengers' sets a high standard that all Marvel movies should adapt to."
"May 29, 2014",positive,Don't mess with the Avengers.
"May 29, 2014",positive,SECOND BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 28, 2014",positive,"Cool action scenes and great fx, but...where's the script? There's no story on The Avengers, a five-year-old boy could have invented the plot to this movie."
"May 28, 2014",positive,Marvel completely nailed it. I have watched this movie so many times and I keep enjoying it.
"May 28, 2014",positive,It's was a good movie but I think they coughed have done a little better
"May 28, 2014",positive,"Truly awesome , a must see."
"May 28, 2014",positive,"Dude. Dude. DUDE. This movie... DUDE. Oh it had some pacing issues but anyway DUDE.
... Yeah, see it."
"May 26, 2014",positive,An action movie you watch for the cast and humor.
"May 25, 2014",negative,"Incredibly boring movie, no point. But there was some great parts."
"May 25, 2014",positive,Great movie! Hilarious and action packed!
"May 25, 2014",positive,Joining together a selection of marvel characters produces a spectacular blockbuster. The story has its flaws but the dazzling special effects & action make up for it.
"May 25, 2014",positive,"Hands down the best comic book movie ever made, Marvel's The Avengers manages to have each of its caracters shine thanks to the simple-yet-powerful script by Joss Whedon and the incredible acting provided by the cast. If you've been following this characters since Iron Man came out in 2008 then this will be like Christmas to you"
"May 24, 2014",positive,"This could have been a disaster that had way too much going on, but director Joss Whedon balances everything out perfectly."
"May 24, 2014",positive,"I was amazed by the special effects and story, dazzled by the effort they put into combining 4 successful franchises (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America) into one. Cannot wait for Age of Ultron!"
"May 24, 2014",positive,Who cares about logic when a film is this fun?
"May 24, 2014",positive,Never been done before so therefore it was awesome
"May 24, 2014",positive,The Best Superhero team-up film ever! Ties for #1 with The Dark Knight for me. Only one is a solo superhero film & the other is a team up film. It never gets old no matter how many times I see this movie. The feeling I had when I first seen it was overwhelming joy & cannot seem to be reproduced. Make mine MARVEL! Excelsior :) Nuff said.
"May 23, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is a fun filled action adventure film.
This film is a fun ride from beginning to end, while not consisting of a plot that will make you think deeply about the film once it's over The Avengers accomplishes what it sets out to do.
The action can be over the top and needless at times and the humour can be quite silly but the acting from the main leads is very strong. 
The script handles the characters well, the film never feels to over crowded although some fans may feel their favourite characters do not get enough screen time. 
The special effects are fantastic and add to the film.
Overall a good action adventure film that is for people who want a good two hours of escapism and pure entertainment."
"May 23, 2014",positive,ONE OF THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIES EVER!!!!!!!!!
"May 22, 2014",positive,Not my favorite marvel movie but it was still good
"May 21, 2014",positive,A movie you can watch over and over again when your bored and have nothing to do
"May 21, 2014",positive,Awesome! epic movie:)
"May 21, 2014",positive,An exceedingly fun time for movie goers of all ages.
"May 20, 2014",positive,I think this picture did well considering all of the stars involved.
"May 20, 2014",positive,"The superhero film that sets the bar for all superhero films to date, I have no doubt that The Avengers will be as remarkable twenty years from now as it was in 2012."
"May 18, 2014",positive,Great fun if a bit shallow.
"May 17, 2014",positive,Another great superhero movie
"May 17, 2014",positive,The Avengers movie that we've all been waiting for! Best Marvel movie ever made!
"May 16, 2014",positive,Best superhero movie of ALL TIME!
"May 16, 2014",positive,Great movie but could've done better if there were more scenes with the Thor and Loki rivalry and could have more known marvel characters like spider-man and some X-men and cant wait for Avengers 2 with Thanos and the infinity gaunlet
"May 15, 2014",positive,I don't know but there was a bit of a lack in the color grading and the picture just looked a but faded but the movie was good
"May 14, 2014",positive,Love it can't wait till the next one. Thor and Iron man are bad ass.
"May 14, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is a lot of eye candy and fun. I mean, unlike the shitty Shitformers movies, it is good fucking dumb fun!
Now the plot is all generic stuff. There is some complex stuff about the Tessaract, and  well The Avengers have to save the day! Now although a lot of people will this this as a shitty Bay film, DON'T WORRY! This movie is directed by Joss Whedon, who can ACTUALLY MAKE FILMS. And it shows. All the actors are  good in their roles. Thankfully SHiaLaDouche comes nowhere near this and that's a plus. The movie is just fun. Yes, there is a bit too much hype on it but it is cool with brilliant action and good acting and it (almost) lives up to the hype."
"May 14, 2014",positive,Medicore at best. Too much characters to focus on while having a generic plot centered around a glowy cube thing that holds the fate of the universe. 6/10
"May 13, 2014",negative,over use of CGI makes this movie terrible. Movie does not make sense. How did thor return?
"May 12, 2014",positive,"A great payoff to one of the most anticipated movies ever. The Avengers gives nearly everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster with its great cast, witty dialogue, Joss Whedon's writing and direction, layered characters, and some awesome action sequences."
"May 12, 2014",negative,"There's no history here. Only explosions and smashs. Really, if you're a 8 year old. You're gonna love it. If not. Just pass."
"May 12, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon at his best. The special effects were incredible, awesome, and amazing. The visual effects were spectacular, stunning, phenomenal."
"May 11, 2014",positive,"One of the greatest comic book/superhero movies ever made. People FLOCKED to the theaters multiple times to see this and you can definitely see why they did. Again, bless you Marvel. BLESS YOUR HEARTS :)"
"May 11, 2014",negative,too much superheroes makes it bad and not as awesome spider man movies
"May 10, 2014",positive,This movie made my dick rock hard!
"May 10, 2014",positive,Best superhero movie of all time. Period.
"May 9, 2014",positive,"The story isn't even really there, if not subtlety, but it's a dream come true and gives anyone even remotely interested a nerdgasm."
"May 9, 2014",positive,"Marvel gets serious and finally conquers the world with this enormous blockbuster and final installment of Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase One (2008-2012).
Six dispair personalities, including an egoccentric, genious millionare, a patriotic soldier with a dad-caring sense of responsibility, a Northern, brute God, a guy with problems to control its greeny and chaotic anger and a pair of meticulous assassins meet to face what is presumably the greatest superhero final battle in film history. Watch half of the end credits to get an astonishing final surprise for the sequel. Pure entertainment, pure epicness. An instant classic."
"May 7, 2014",positive,Wish I could give it a higher rating. This movie is just 'WOW'. A definite MUST WATCH for marvel movie fans!
"May 6, 2014",positive,"Despite a basic storyline, The Avengers respects both its characters and its audience with its amazing cast, spectacular action scenes (most notably in its climactic half hour), and eye-dazzling visuals."
"May 5, 2014",positive,"An outstanding movie that includes action, drama, and comedy. Very entertaining to see many superheroes. Something that  everybody will enjoy. A great job by Whedon."
"May 5, 2014",positive,Is there anything to say? Really? ITS THE FUCKING AVENGERS
"May 3, 2014",positive,Great movie all around
"May 3, 2014",positive,"the avengers is not only a good superhero film, but a good anything film. it's got  action, a plot, a cool villain, even Samuel l. Jackson!"
"May 3, 2014",positive,"With 5 movies leading up to the hype The Avengers delivers with a satisfying, often funny, and exciting comic book film"
"May 2, 2014",positive,mjaa I don't know may be
"May 2, 2014",positive,with a good blend of comedy and action avengers will please all but the biggest film snobs.
"May 2, 2014",positive,Awesome movie!!! Bravo joss whedon!!!
"May 1, 2014",positive,"I have problems with people calling it the greatest superhero film ever. Heck I even think that Captain America 2 is a better flick that this one and I personally believe that Superman 1 (Christopher Reeves) is still better. 

with that out of the way, Avengers gives you a thrill ride, from how they tried to kill each other and how they worked together.. The story on the other hand doesn't give you much, but that's how it worked."
"Apr 28, 2014",positive,A good watch more than once!
"Apr 28, 2014",positive,"If you look at the credits after watching this (and you really should for the extra endings), you'll see Joss Whedon's name attached to screenplay, story, and director. Whedon has his fingerprints all over this film; so it pretty much lives or dies with him. 

Well, this film not only lives, it thrives. This is the mighty Marvel team-up 10-year-old boys in the Seventies and Eighties have always dreamed about happening on the big screen. I have a sneaking suspicion that Joss Whedon was one of those ten-year-old boys.

Of course, to call ""Marvel's The Avengers"" a genre film would be a disservice for the mass appeal this film received at the box office. Young, old, male, female... it didn't matter. This film appealed to everyone on a massive scale, as the $1.5 Billion box office would attest. Some watched it for RDJ, some watched it for Hemsworth or Hiddleston, but overall, the actors had a mass appeal that crossed genres and conventions.

It also helped that the dialogue cracks like a whip, and there's not a single bit of throwaway dialogue.

The real question is, is this the best superhero movie ever? Well, my experience has been yes. Some people point to ""The Dark Knight"" as being a better film, but the only reason why that film is memorable is because of the villain, not the hero. I guarantee you that the heroes are the ones who shine in ""The Avengers""; and aren't sidelined to make way for the villain; although I must say that Loki makes a damn fine villain.

In closing, I don't think the 10-year-old Joss Whedon would have ever in his wildest dreams believed that he would not only helm, write, and screenplay a film that he always dreamed would happen, but how successful and fruitful that endeavour has been for him career-wise. In all likelihood, it's a dream come true that has made scores of former ten-year-olds green with jealousy."
"Apr 28, 2014",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers had very high expectations and it seemed impossible that it would live up to them, but Joss Whedon surpassed these as he created a fun, comical, and action packed film that gave each character an important part to play. Avengers: Age of Ultron will have to be truly amazing to match this entry."
"Apr 28, 2014",positive,The theater experience was 2nd to none in my lifetime..Awesome!!!!
"Apr 26, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is a fantastic superhero film that utilizes the abilities of their fantastic list of actors and isn't ever trumped by the music or the usual loud, obscene sounds that dominate most superhero movies."
"Apr 26, 2014",positive,that's what I am talking about :-)
"Apr 25, 2014",positive,"The long awaited super hero film begins with Loki from the Asgard and a diabolical plan to bring earth to his knees, and only assembling the Avengers can come close to stopping him. The Avengers consist of Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow, all of which had individual movies prior except for the last two. The previous movies help piece together the Avengers tale, but it is not required to really understand this movie. Avengers is full of action of it and all of it is clean crisp well directed and looks fantastic. The ending sequence was quite entertaining as well and shows has only through team work could the world be saved. Avengers really is the pinnacle of super hero movies right now and did not disappoint."
"Apr 24, 2014",positive,Great story and some of the best CG I have ever seen. rewatchable.
"Apr 23, 2014",positive,"Ahhh the joy. 
Five different Marvel movies, with teasing post credit scenes, lead to this mega spectacular film! It pulls together so well. 
The film starts with a bang, and the action is fairly unrelenting throughout. tthe reluctant team meet, fight, argue, and whine... all while the Villain Loki maipulates them like chess pieces. When the Shield Heli-carrier is almost destroyed, agent Colson is killed, and the heroes are embarrassingly outwitted, only then do they start to prioritize their focus and energy. 
Iron man- stark is hilarious, Hulk is both scary and believable, Captain America is the heart and moral center, Black Widow is manipulative and skilled, Thor is conflicted yet determined, and Hawkeye... well, he get's the short end as a Loki puppet for half the film. 
So many great scenes. Loki ordering the crowd to kneel... and the old guy who won't. Iron Man and Thor fighting. Hulk and Thor fighting. And when the heroes form their circle on that New York street... wow.  
The only complaint.... the drone like ineffectiveness of Loki's alien army. Six Avengers must of killed thousands of them... pathetic little minions. And when their base of operations is destroyed, they drop like the idiotic robots in ""The Phantom Menace."" 
Who among us can forget Loki ordering Hulk to stop, arrogantly announcing that he is a god... only to be repeatedly slammed into the floor like a rag doll. It doesn't get any better."
"Apr 23, 2014",positive,"Good movie for those that love nothing more than mindless action. For those seeking messages and insights, you're out of luck."
"Apr 23, 2014",positive,"Nice, even funny at times, but I don't see what all the rave is about."
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,Looking forward to this sequel
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,This instalment of the series brought together the disparate stories we've seem dancing around each other into a current narrative that showcased each character and gave fans both new and old something to enjoy.
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,Prachtig hersenloos vertier!
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,I couldn't hear half of it on the plane but I doubt that would have changed much.
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,Great move. And the actor who played Bruce Banner did an amazing job. The best Bruce Banner by far. Even better than the original.
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,"What can be said about the Avengers Assemble? It's full of cheese, fun and a massive budget, marry that together with some top notch actors and iconic characters and you should have a match made in heaven right? Well kind of, see the problem stems a bit deeper, this film is best when the entire cast are talking to each other, not while being super heroes. Of course, there is the odd scene here and there that warrants an interest, mainly surrounding Tony stark, Downey Jr, or the Hulk, Ruffalo. But the majority of this action is quite soulless and 1 dimensional, unlike the effort being put in by the cast. The story revolves around, now bear with me here non comic book fans, the Tesseract, which is a mythical power which has been taken under the power of a group called SHIELD. The Group, run by Nick Fury, Jackson, and including Black Widow, Johanssen and Hawkeye, Renner, aims at protecting the earth against other worldly beings. So one day Loki, Hiddleston, decides to recruit an army and go after the Tesseract, gaining it and causing a mass disaster, setting in motion SHIELD, recruiting our favourite super heroes, the hulk, iron man, captain america and thor, in order to act as a force against the impending threat that looms. Of course everything goes tits up and before you know it CGI madness ruins about 40 minutes and a city. Where to begin, dont bother watching this before you have watched at least iron man 1, captain america and thor, other wise your just going to be completely lost, fair enough, those films have all been building up to that, however the director knows in the back of his head that a large demographic wont have seen those movies and decides to include tid bits of back story at the begining in order to pull everyone up to speed. It reeks of big budget studio but ill let it slide. The acting is super dooper awesome, now when i say its awesome i mean you have a very good cast of people trying their best with some very cheesey script writing. The best performances come from Downey and Ruffalo, hands down, in fact their entire relationship throughout this movie actually takes it up half a mark due to it being that entertaining to watch. Loki is a threatening enough villain but so is anyone who can pull an evil grin and get angry in a subdued manner, im not plunging daggers into Hiddlestons performance, its just hard to look both him and hemsworth in a serious way after the collosally crap film that was Thor. Chris Evans pulls Chris Evans out of the bag for captain america, which works but hey ho. Scarlet and Jeremy are merely 1 dimensional robots going through the motions. And Jackson... He just showed up on set really. The effects are hit and miss also, yeah from time to time some of it works and the hulk is pretty entertaining to watch reek havok but its all a bit stale otherwise. Typical CGI bombast over actual solid thrills. Its camp, its big and its loud, just what you'd expect really, but i cant say that im overly impressed with its final execution. Although ive never seen eye to eye with Joss Wheedon. Entertaining when our cast are all in one room talking or the occasional block busting scene, souless hack and slashery most of the other time. kills a few hours."
"Apr 22, 2014",positive,"One of the best superheroes movies ever, being fast-paced and funny."
"Apr 21, 2014",positive,"What more can you say? This movie is great fun, there isn't really much more to it than that. Terrific special effects and wonderful interplay between the various Marvel heroes. I find it particularly interesting that most onscreen adaptions of the Hulk have been pretty flawed (particularly the recent ones) while here he totally steals the show (well, second to Scarlett Johansson's cat suit anyway). Maybe Hulk is just better served in smaller portions of Gamma ray fueled brutality, or something.It's the terrific writing which really holds this one together though and provides the solid spine that makes it one of the best super hero movies of all time."
"Apr 20, 2014",positive,"Really enjoyable, entertaining Superhero movie. Best movie that the Hulk character has been involved in in my opinion. The Black Widow should definitely get her own movie showing her past. Very interesting background for her."
"Apr 19, 2014",positive,"Good, but I thought it could have been better considering all the star movies out on each of these characters individually"
"Apr 19, 2014",positive,Best Movie Marvel has made so far. Period
"Apr 18, 2014",positive,this was such a bad ass  movie lots of great action and such good looking guys oh yummy thor and iron man are so fucking hot .I own theses movies cannot get enough
"Apr 18, 2014",positive,Awesome as hell. best superhero movie ever.
"Apr 18, 2014",positive,great movie keep then coming
"Apr 18, 2014",positive,Marvel has gone mad!
"Apr 17, 2014",positive,"Ever since Dark Knight, super hero movies desperately tried to be ""deep."" Avengers is loyal to the original purpose of hero films yet brings no disappointment."
"Apr 16, 2014",positive,"I love that this movie is full of action and the fact that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film. Well done, Marvel, well done!"
"Apr 16, 2014",positive,"The Avengers was probably the best movie of 2012. It had more great actors than any movie in the past decade and it succeeded in keeping the audience entertained throughout the entire film. The story was good but the action and special effects were out of this world. On top of this, the comic relief is abundant and never disappoints. Robert Downy Jr. has never been funnier than he is in this movie. The back and forth between him and the Hulk is truly incredible."
"Apr 15, 2014",neutral,"It was awesome,i guess."
"Apr 15, 2014",positive,Almost as good as Star Wars!!
"Apr 14, 2014",positive,Great movie! I saw this 5 times when it was in theaters. Definitely a must buy.
"Apr 13, 2014",positive,Very cool to see all of them come together. Really entertaining.
"Apr 13, 2014",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers had the opportunity to let us down, but it didn't. Instead of wasting the cast and plot line, on a goofy story line, The Avengers beautifully mixes the dynamics of each film, to create on giant masterpiece, that is both visually stunning, and great epic fun to people of all ages."
"Apr 13, 2014",positive,"The Avengers kick backside. This movie is everything I expected and more. It is funny and full of action, a must see for Marvel fans."
"Apr 13, 2014",positive,It s a badass movie and I think people should go watch it and buy the movie!
"Apr 13, 2014",positive,perfect!!!!! ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME
"Apr 12, 2014",positive,starts of slow but once it gets going be prepared for some serious awesomeness because this film rocks as well as being action packed the quality of comedy is pretty high
"Apr 12, 2014",positive,It's a wonderful juggling trick they've all pulled off--Everyone gets their moment to shine! The excitement in the theater was palpable.
"Apr 12, 2014",positive,"""There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could."""
"Apr 11, 2014",positive,best hero movie that I ever watched!
"Apr 11, 2014",positive,A must see for ALL superhero fans!
"Apr 10, 2014",positive,I thought it would be a disappointment but it turned out to be a great marvel movie one of my favorites.
"Apr 10, 2014",positive,"If this doesn't make the 8-year-old inside you feel complete joy , you're probably dead inside."
"Apr 10, 2014",positive,Fantastic one of the best marvel films ever made.
"Apr 10, 2014",positive,"The greatest strength of this movie, aside from the unstoppable Incredible Hulk, is the humour the script brings.  The chemistry of the 4 superheroes is evident and easy to watch.  Enjoy action?  You'll struggle to find a better movie to satisfy that crave."
"Apr 9, 2014",positive,"I'm not a comic book reader. That said, this movie it's great. I love the humor and action."
"Apr 9, 2014",positive,packed with action and slams to keep your eyes pilled
"Apr 9, 2014",positive,Marvel & Whedon set a new benchmark for Comic Blockbusters. A must see.
"Apr 8, 2014",positive,"Great movie. Action packed, great plot. Marvel empire is taking over!"
"Apr 8, 2014",positive,"Great movie. Action packed, great plot. Marvel empire is taking over!"
"Apr 7, 2014",positive,Awesome best super hero movie ever!
"Apr 7, 2014",positive,One of the best comic book movies ever
"Apr 7, 2014",positive,IT WAS LEGENDARY!!! MARVEL'S FINEST
"Apr 6, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon does his job in bringing together everyone for one big, goofy, awesome, pile of fun."
"Apr 6, 2014",positive,An overrated superhero popcorn flick with indisputably stunning CGIs.
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"The Avengers is GREAT! I had that awesome feeling like I just watched Star Wars: Ep. IV for the first time. I cannot say enough for this one. Joss Whedon proves he's brilliant, again. Love it!"
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,This movie had everything you love about the characters because of everything you love about Joss.
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,Smart mix of comedy and action! Very enjoyable!
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"I have a whole list to describe how awesome ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is. But if I had to describe this movie in only four words, it would be this: Best..superhero...movie...EVER!!!"
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,Entertaining blockbuster.  Fun.
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"1,000â­?ï¸?s if I could"
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"EXCELLENT!!  EXCELLENT!!  EXCELLENT!!
A wonderful adventure with grouchy heroes that are just as human as the rest of us, just watch out for their Bark and BITE!  will be seeing this again and again!"
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"In world filled with dark and gritty comic book movies, Marvel's The Avengers is a breath of fresh air due to its light hearted tone, and fun. The Avengers knows what it is, where it came from, and not for one second does it back down, or try to suppress that it is a comic book movie. In short, The Avengers is pure movie fun, and in many regards, a truly epic Super Hero movie."
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,Very good movie. The script is fun and smart at the same time. The comedy feels forced sometimes. I'm very pleased with this movie but they could've done things better. Such as the dynamic between Thor and his brother or the relationship between Natasha and Clint Barton.
"Apr 5, 2014",positive,"Yes the movie has its flaws, but most great movies do. It's a superhero movie and its a fantastic one at that. Though really overrated, this blockbuster is sure to give the audience thrills and those of the comic book Greek world will love it. Some people overrate this and some underrate the film. I would be in the middle and say its pretty great, but don't go in. Thinking your mind will be blown. 9.2/10"
"Apr 4, 2014",positive,"Fun movie lots of good laughs, lots of great action! Great cast, and ya fun to see all the Hero's coming together! I only wish they kept the same actor as the other movie to play the hulk!"
"Apr 4, 2014",positive,"A handful of comic heroes team up to save the world--saved from what really doesn't matter. All that matters is that Iron Man and a green honey badger called The Incredible Hulk appear on screen together and invoke laughs and destruction. These two were the movie. Movie downgrade for excessive ""Transformer"" mayhem and probably 1-2 characters too many...both accomplices to the 2 hr, 22 min running time. But a smashing time in the end. Grade: B"
"Apr 4, 2014",positive,"First twenty minutes had some effy production value and I didn't care for Captain America's costume. However Whedon does great with an ensemble cast and the movie has a great balance of action, story and humor."
"Apr 4, 2014",positive,Because it has a Hulk!
"Apr 3, 2014",positive,"I have to say, initially I didn't know what to expect. I already love the marvel movies. But my background with comic books is rather fuzzy. I knew the avengers was going to be something special when I walked in. But for a marvel movie to defy my expectations and deliver what is probably the most satisfying movie experience I've had since the 2000's, is something that was beyond my wildest dreams!

If I could sum up The Avengers in one word, I would be envious of myself. The Avengers is impossible to describe in just one word. Because if that were possible, the movie would have to feature just one hero. But the Avengers takes every marvel character of the last four years, with the acceptation of Edward Norton's Bruce Banner who has been replaced by Mark Ruffalo, and collaborates them all into one kick ass epic story/character driven action extravaganza that rivals the Sci Fi classic status of the first Star Wars.

The Avengers does something that has initially been done several times, mostly in tv crossovers, but never has the movie collaboration concept taken it's potential to the level that Joss Whedon took to this masterpiece of true blockbuster entertainment.

Unlike any collaboration movie or show, The Avengers allows for all nine characters, including the villain, to have a chance to breathe. Most would look at the Avengers as an excuse to bring in the Benjamin's by trying to jam several characters into one movie and falling down the same path as every other movie that tries to do the same thing. But this movie does the unthinkable and gives us time to relate with each character. This is something that has never been done successfully in the history of movies!

In addition to revolutionizing the bar of which comic book movies are made, The Avengers also boosts the best writing, the best directorial eye, and the best acting of any movie of its genre since The Dark Knight. Joss Whedon is certainly no stranger to Sci Fi and dedicated fandoms. And this movie only boosts his popularity that was already concrete with his short lived tv show Firefly. You know this is a Joss Whedon movie the second the first line of witty dialogue appears from Samuel L. Jackson's flawless take on Nick Fury, who has a much larger role here than in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films. Every scene in this movie has at least one line dialogue that you will carry with you long after the movie is done. And the action is just as memorable. The final battle of Manhattan could be considered a movie in its own right. The acting is top notch as well. Robert Downey Jr. Does wonders with the character Tony Stark/Iron Man. And most of the hilarious dialogue, courtesy of Joss Whedon, comes from him. Captain America is the perfect fish out of water character. His methods of heroism collide with Iron Man's in some of the more dramatic and character driven moments. And Chris Evans is brilliant. Much better than the still very good, but also kind of silly 2011 Cap America film. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston also reprise their roles as Thor and Loki. And their complicated brotherly relationship provides the film with a much needed Shakespearean level of drama. They have some of the best scenes of the movie. And of course, Tom Hiddleston is the show stealer here. His performance as Loki is the most entertaining villain work in recent memory. He is certainly a great actor whose charisma will be the notch that makes his acting consistently memorable. Hemsworth is great too. His Thor is the only Thor. As I mentioned before, Mark Ruffalo has replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk character Bruce Banner. But don't be disappointed because he's just as good if not better than Norton. He adds a level of depth to the character that wasn't as present in the 2008 movie. And when he turns into the hulk, he TURNS INTO the Hulk. I have to applaud the visual effects team for their work on the Hulk and to Joss Whedon for his brilliant writing of the character. And his directing for making the hulk the single greatest crowd pleaser in Marvel history. As another critic put it, ""never under estimate the entertainment value of the HULK SMASH!!!"" Filling out the principal cast is Samuel L. Jackson who is, as I mentioned, the perfect Nick Fury. Scarlett Johansson is nice to look at as Black Widow, but maybe her acting has room to improve. But her presence does not detract from the movie at all. Every character has their own shining moment. And Jeremy Renner plays the conflicted Clint Barton/Hawkeye, who has a pretty good aim with a bow and arrow that would make Katniss Everdeen's jaw hanging in suspension.

As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece of blockbuster entertainment. If you want Oscar quality film making, then you should go and watch The King's Speech or The Artist. Because to compare this movie's quality to that of those movies is biased and unfair to people who actually enjoy these movies as well as cinematically accomplished Oscar gold.

I wasn't a comic book enthusiast before I saw the Avengers. But I certainly am striving to learn more about them now that I've experienced the greatness of comic book movie making first hand with the epicness of Marvel's The Avengers. GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!!! And don't let snobbish minority groups tell you it's terrible. Because there's a reason why they're in the minority."
"Apr 3, 2014",positive,"This movie thought me a valuable lesson, never go watch a movie with sky high expectations. Now don't get me wrong this was a good movie overall but fans and critics were praising this movie left and right and saying this is a great movie and a must see. It was a good movie but it had nothing special, just your generic superhero action movie. That scene where Hulk just grabs Loki and smashes him may have been funny but it showed us that Loki was a weak villain."
"Apr 2, 2014",positive,That it works us astonishing! Great time had by all!
"Apr 1, 2014",positive,possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life!!!!!
"Apr 1, 2014",positive,this movie broke a word record for how many people saw it. marvel has taken its next step into phase 2
"Apr 1, 2014",positive,"An action-packed movie with a sprinkle of humor that is interesting for a while, but then grows dull after the 5th time watching it."
"Apr 1, 2014",positive,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!! BESIDES IM A SUPERHERO  FAN AND THANKS JOSS WEADON FOR MAKING THIS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER !!!!! IT  HAD AN AWESOME STORY LINE AND GREAT CASTING TOO!!! GOD I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!!!!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR AVENGERS 2!!!!!
"Apr 1, 2014",positive,Do I need to say anything?
"Mar 29, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon has put Michael Bay and every other action-bandwagon director to shame. Between its stylistic directing, witty banter, and supremely cinematic one-hour climax, everything about this film worked in a spectacular fashion. It's going to be near impossible for any other superhero film this year to top this blockbuster masterpiece."
"Mar 29, 2014",positive,"Amazing
This movie is perfect, all the heroes have great chemistry, awesome action scenes, great special effects, hilarious moments and just a goddamn entertaining movie
I'm glad marvel got it right."
"Mar 29, 2014",positive,Fantastic action with some very funny humour .
"Mar 28, 2014",positive,Best action in a comic book movie yet!!
"Mar 25, 2014",negative,It was okay kind of redundant. 
"Mar 24, 2014",positive,"Rolig, snygg, spektakulär, tempofylld och mot slutet hyfsat spännande superhjälteorgie. Det enda problemet är väl egentligen att skurkarna blir fullständigt överglänsta av hjältarna (frånsett Thor). Men det är, förstås, ett underordnat problem. På det stora hela: en grymt underhållande film för ögon, öron och smilgropar."
"Mar 24, 2014",positive,"Probably the most powerfully structured movie I've ever seen. What I admire about The Avengers is that it doesn't go in guns blazing from the start, it doesn't open with the Avengers themselves but with Nick Fury and Maria Hill, who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever, charged with explosive action, mind blowing spectacle and big laughs. When the world is threatened by Loki and his army of alien Chitauri, the Avengers Initiative is activated and a team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens, New York is a playground for jaw dropping action, stunning camera shots and immersive 3D, Joss Whedon's ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other, and with whip smart writing and a powerhouse story this is the ultimate Marvel adventure. Would I watch this again? A dozen times and more, this is a perfect choice for a movie night, a family night in, and the cast are better than ever playing these superheroes we've come to love over the past few years."
"Mar 24, 2014",positive,Perfect balance between humor and action.
"Mar 22, 2014",positive,Pretty close to perfection
"Mar 21, 2014",positive,"It's a fun ride upon the first viewing, but it doesn't hold up to the re-watch treatment.  Every next viewing reveals more and more of its numerous plot holes and hiccups.  After that, it remains only okay."
"Mar 21, 2014",positive,Not as good as everyone says ... To much nonsense
"Mar 21, 2014",positive,"Had the perfect amount of action, storyline, and thank-for-the-break humor to feel like you're flipping the pages of a (really loud) comic book."
"Mar 18, 2014",positive,I love this its amazing
"Mar 16, 2014",positive,One of those rare movies that exceeded my expectations!
"Mar 15, 2014",positive,Awesome movie with awesome action and an awesome story.
"Mar 15, 2014",positive,"better than I had expected... great job, whedon."
"Mar 15, 2014",positive,superbbb .i am loving it.
"Mar 14, 2014",positive,"This movie is like the holy grail of geekdom it's amazing. I'm a big marvel fan and seeing all these great superheroes saving the world makes me want to kick ass or something. It's a good story,good acting and very good direction by joss whedon  . It's my favourite marvel film yet and I can't wait for the sequel"
"Mar 14, 2014",positive,"The term action-packed is a major understatement when it comes to this incredibly well-balanced movie. In short, ""The Avengers"" does not disappoint!"
"Mar 13, 2014",positive,"The Avengers was the best superhero movies in the Marvel Universeity. 
The setting looked real, the acting was fantastic, and the fight scenes were incredible.

Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye did
a great job of saving the world. Tom Hiddleston who played ""Loki""
was one of the smart villains that led his army to destroy the
world. Samuel L. Jackson as ""Nick Fury"" was his best role ever. 

The space scenes looked beautiful, the action scenes were fun, 
and the aliens looked strong.

What a great way to end the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 1""!!"
"Mar 13, 2014",positive,"From beginning to end, the action keeps on coming, and for not one moment are we bored or tired, instead, we have our eyes glued to the screen."
"Mar 13, 2014",positive,Good performances from the already established characters and excellent directing from Joss Whedon along with great effects and an intriguing villain and story Avengers is a very fun ride that sets the bar for future superhero films. Avengers is perfect at 5/5
"Mar 13, 2014",positive,Whedon's handling of each hero as their own unique character makes the incredibly well-filmed action sequences all the more entertaining.
"Mar 11, 2014",positive,"Not a huge fan of superhero movies... but I must say, The Avengers isn't to shabby... but its no Watchmen."
"Mar 10, 2014",positive,Absolutely love this movie! Watched it 8 times while it was in theaters. And I also own the movie and I've watched it 3 more times
"Mar 10, 2014",positive,The Avengers is one of the best superhero ever! The action was great and evenly spaced out so there's a good amount of dialogue. The characters are great. There are so many moments in this movie that are just awesome and so unforgettable! This is what all superhero movies are supposed to be like! Joss Whedon did a great job directing so kudos for him.
"Mar 10, 2014",positive,don't get much better than this
"Mar 10, 2014",positive,"Overrated in my opinion. Cheesy Loki nearly ruined it for me but, hey! The Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor all in one movie.
That makes it so much better."
"Mar 10, 2014",positive,"Pure entertainment done right! A film that should please fans of the source material as well as those of previous marvel films, while also being a blast for new comers. Joss Whedon again proves his value by taking a concept that could be utterly disastrous, and turns it into a home run for audiences and the money men."
"Mar 9, 2014",negative,God I was falling asleep
"Mar 9, 2014",positive,"Ensemble films are usually a mess, trying to give everyone screen time and failing to pull all the plot threads together.  Not Avengers.  This movie is tightly written and perfectly executed, giving everyone a chance to shine (even Hawkeye). I was never a fan of any of these Marvel characters before their movie incarnations, and now I'm a fan of them all (even Hawkeye)."
"Mar 9, 2014",positive,Doubtably one of the best superhero movies of all time well put together and great acting with a smooth pace it's what everyone wanted and was hoping for.
"Mar 7, 2014",positive,My most favorite marvel movie of all time! Joss Wheddon definitely delivers the goods! Im super excited for next year's Avengers: Age of Ultron!
"Mar 6, 2014",positive,definitely THE BEST superhero movie ever created all the actors were awesome plus joss whedon gave his best a must seen movie destened to be a classic....
"Mar 6, 2014",positive,Enjoyable.  Luv Iron Man & glad to see the Hulk as a good guy.
"Mar 5, 2014",positive,"For the most part, the Avengers was solid, and it kept me entertained; which is the sole purpose, right? The star-studded cast was all there, ready to make a great action movie. Some parts even made me laugh, more than I expected. I like Colbie Smulders, who played Agent Maria Hill, since she plays Robin on How I Met Your Mother. But, I think we all have to admit, she didn't only get the part for her amazing acting talents. We all know she 's pretty."
"Mar 3, 2014",positive,Quite possibly the best superhero film ever made. THE movie of 2012.
"Mar 2, 2014",positive,The movie that changes the world.
"Mar 2, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon. Do i need to say more? And the cast is full of stars. Well, easy going plot which kinda basicly revolves around Loki and his feelings. One of my favorite MARVEL movies."
"Mar 2, 2014",positive,"Must be my favorite superhero movies next to Captain America. Love the action, love the story."
"Feb 28, 2014",positive,"Just watch it. It has a good plot, cool action sequences and the humor fits in at just the right moments. Oh and the Hulk is awesome. We need more of the Hulk in Avengers Age of Ultron, Please."
"Feb 28, 2014",positive,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this. An all-star cast and an excellent script with stunning visuals. Nice job, Joss!"
"Feb 28, 2014",positive,I just can't stop watching this over and over
"Feb 28, 2014",positive,BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!!!
"Feb 26, 2014",positive,Huge entertainment value and vibrant characters who bounce off each other in truly inspired ways give this the strength to power through some of the more glaring story inconsistency.
"Feb 26, 2014",positive,"Produced and directed without the same kind of goals as previous Marvel films, The Avengers focused on taking its massive budget and making the coolest, most spectacular movie they could. They pulled that off with aplomb. Iron Man and co must unite and work together to defeat Loki, Thor's crafty, wisecracking bro.

Every Avenger cast member hits the bullseye in the acting department. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr probably are the best as the Hulk and Iron Man. Tom Hiddleston will endear himself to the world with his portrayal as Loki.

The action is plentiful, but thankfully director Joss Whedon doesn't saturate the film with it too badly; we still get some merciful respites as the directing crew really nail the pacing factor. Don't try to seriously compare the Avengers with Marvel's other movies. Its less serious and more obligatory, and it give fans a heck of a ride."
"Feb 26, 2014",positive,"a wonderful movie with great special effects and excellent, so I think The Avengers is one of the best movies I've seen in my life."
"Feb 26, 2014",positive,"I kicked myself in the a** for not seeing this movie in theaters. When I finally saw it on DVD, it blew me away."
"Feb 24, 2014",positive,First half was boring and the battle in New York was anti-climactic and disappointing.  Okay movie but overall just meh.
"Feb 23, 2014",positive,who in their right mind wouldnt love the avengers.
"Feb 23, 2014",positive,Ce film est tout simplement mon rêve d'enfant devenu réalité... un de mes meilleurs film à vie
"Feb 23, 2014",positive,An epic finale to Phase One and a great modern portrayal of all of the heroes.
"Feb 23, 2014",positive,Best comic book movie
"Feb 22, 2014",positive,everything you could ask for in a superhero movie
"Feb 22, 2014",positive,This is what all blockbuster superhero team up movies must strive to match!!!  Hardcore and casual fans are equally blown away!!!  Nice job!
"Feb 20, 2014",positive,I love all of the marvel universe stuff
"Feb 20, 2014",negative,What garbage. The only redeeming factor was Robert Downey Jr.
"Feb 19, 2014",positive,A great ending (and beginning) to the past superhero movies. It is a perfect bridge to add any superhero that Marvel wants to bring to theatres.
"Feb 18, 2014",positive,loved this movie. loki is my favorite.  not sorry for loving the villain
"Feb 18, 2014",positive,The best of the franchise by some margin. A fitting end but unfortunately there will be more!
"Feb 18, 2014",positive,Robert Downey Junior + Samuel L. Jackson + Josh Whedon = gimme another pants to wear...
"Feb 17, 2014",positive,One of my favorite movies of all time! Creative and action-packed. Everyone's favorite heroes all in one in a touching and fun story.
"Feb 17, 2014",positive,when the next one coming out
"Feb 16, 2014",positive,"That, my friends, is a whole new level of greatness. I thought the Marvel movies were incredible but The Avengers is somthing else entirely. Enjoyed every bit."
"Feb 16, 2014",negative,I guess these movies are not for everyone. Felt it was long and predictable and often found myself checking my watch to see how much longer until I could leave.
"Feb 15, 2014",positive,"75%
Avengers is a popcorn flick, and it succeeds as such."
"Feb 13, 2014",positive,unexpected action sequnces
"Feb 12, 2014",positive,A good movie for comic book fans. Great effects throughout!
"Feb 11, 2014",positive,CANNOT....EXPLAIN......TOO AWESOME!!!!!!!!
"Feb 11, 2014",positive,so anticipated and did not disappoint!
"Feb 10, 2014",negative,"I know everyone else seems to love this movie, but after about 30 minutes I was bored with it's predictability, squabbling children, er I mean heroes and the lat of any real depth."
"Feb 10, 2014",neutral,I'm a big Buffy fan and I did not like this.
"Feb 9, 2014",negative,"Decepcionante, le falta épica al film"

"Feb 6, 2014",positive,Absolutely perfect movie
"Feb 6, 2014",positive,"Marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and after the success of this film, it seems to be getting much bigger and more ambitious. Before making The Avengers, the studio decided to have a couple of films dedicated to each main character, and in a way filled the world that would then be the setting of The Avengers. Honestly, I don't think this film would be as successful if it wasn't for those films. So as years and films gone by, the hype for The Avengers kept growing larger and larger as we have never seen a film so ambitious in its cast and its concept. In 2008, when Iron Man came out, we never thought that this would be possible, now here it is. Does Joss Whedon's take on The Avengers, do it justice. My answer is yes, but not to a point of high praise.

The Avengers was written by Joss Whedon, who is commonly known as the show-runner of some of the best TV series of this generation. He is an experienced writer, but when it came to films, he has very little to brag about. Whedon's work has always been known to be ambitious and in a way quirky, especially in dialogue. What Whedon has created for this film is actually quite simple in its plot. It touches on themes that have been explored on many films before, and is a common aspect in comic books. These themes include teamwork, ego, good vs evil, responsibility, and war. I didn't mind Whedon in applying these themes to this film because they are universally relatable and it allows the film's plot to be simplistic. My biggest concern in his writing is the characters. I think Whedon was happy to have the opportunity to work on multiple different characters, and he knows that he could express each one with their own individual personality, allowing the characters to feel unique and at the start, be un-cohesive with each other. But Whedon has forgotten to give any character a sense of depth beyond their dialogue, as he just wanted things go quickly as they could to the parts that have us jumping in excitement. I understand that the individual Marvel films are the one that showcases this multi-layered character study that I was looking for, but that doesn't mean that The Avengers should lack it almost completely. I don't care if the film spends more time on these characters and letting the film run at 3 hours because it would have allowed me to appreciate more than just the surface of these characters. Whedon sometimes make their personalities and intentions too obvious, which takes me aback as it doesn't feel at all natural. It is almost as if he was too afraid that we might not entirely get it. Though there was potential in characters like Maria Hill, Phil Coulson and Natasha Romanoff, but very brief. Whedon's dialogue on the other hand was fun to listen to, as the back and forth between members of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film. Through dialogue, Whedon has shown us just how different these characters are and how each one thinks they are above one another.

Joss Whedon is also the director for this film, he also doesn't have a lot of directed films in his name as he seems to be more pre-occupied with his work on TV. The success of The Avengers did open doors for him and allowed him to create films with more creative control, like with his next film Much Ado about Nothing. I could see a bit of artistic license in The Avengers, but at the same time, I felt it was a bit too tame. I am not sure whether this was a result of the studio or it was the intention of the director in order for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience. It would have been nice if we actually see some civilians die during the fight in New York, so at the end we can really feel that the event was a huge travesty to our kind and that we have hope it won't happen again. Whedon has created something very ambitious, containing a number of characters and yet still give enough screen time for each one. The area where Whedon has impressed me is the last hour and a half of the film. This is where the action comes in, supported with big sequences that are memorable and exciting. Whedon has given the last fight a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be better than what anybody else could have thought of, which I personally agree. The film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't come off as fake or lacking in texture because the budget and time that was given to him allowed the film to be polished, ergo having the audience be immersed in the experience. My main issue was the first hour of the film, as it felt very rushed. It contained fast editing cuts that made things feel off. I think Whedon trimmed a hefty amount in order to move the plot along, and I think that was a bad decision as more time with these characters at the start would have allowed the audience to identify with them easier. Overall, I think Whedon did a good job in creating a film that contained so many beloved characters and still make a decent movie out of it. It's a tough job, and maybe it could have been a different experience if someone else helmed the project, but nevertheless it was good enough.

The film's director of photography is Seamus McGarvey. What McGarvey and Whedon have done with the film's cinematography is disappointing as the film contained many shots that felt unnecessary. There were many moments earlier in the film where I ask myself, ""Why did they use that angle?"" or ""what was the point of it?"" I felt that some shots were too concerned in what would be filled in it rather than what it could do for the actor's performance or its connection/relevance to the film's plot or themes. It is during the moments that contained action sequences is where the film's photography shines, as the irritating approach they applied for the slow and earlier parts of the film would actually work in this situation. I assume a lot of the film is shot with a green screen but it never proves to be as obvious or distracting, like in Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. The film also uses a more handheld approach for most of the scenes, assumingly using a Steadicam. I was really hoping for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to its cinematography, but sadly that wasn't the case.

The film's score was handled by Alan Silvestri, who is mostly known as a collaborator with Robert Zemeckis. Silvestri's work here is astounding. The film's score is so grand and memorable that it becomes the first thing I think about when I recall back to this film. Yes it does follow the many trademarks and styles in mainstream action films, but this is an example of one that is excellently crafted. The film's theme track is the highlight of the score as it just hits the right notes and when it comes it feels so epic that you can't help but get goose bumps when it comes on.

The Avengers contains a wide cast and overall I felt that they did quite well with their roles. It is already established from their previous films that they have already given these legendary characters justice. The stand out performances mainly came from Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders. The rest were good but their roles, I felt were underdeveloped therefore the actors were limited with what they can do with it.

In the end, I thought this film was a bit of a letdown but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a disaster. It's something that I would definitely watch again just for its amazing action sequences and to hear the chilling score, but that's really about it."
"Feb 3, 2014",positive,"awesome teamwork in this seemingly awkward and impossible collection of members including Captain America who came from the past, Biologist turning Hulk, physicist tycoon Iron Man, and a demigod Thor."
"Feb 1, 2014",positive,Every comic book fan will love this film. Marvel's greatest super heroes come together in this spectacular production taking the genre to a new level. It does not get any less entertaining even on the 10th time of viewing. Brilliant.
"Jan 31, 2014",positive,"With an awesome comic book series that combines all of your favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe characters into one team, an amazing story, a genius script full of incredible dialogue with the story written by Zak Penn and Joss Whedon and the screenplay written by Joss Whedon, a talented cast headed by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, wonderful directing by Joss Whedon, exciting scenes and sequences, quotable lines, brilliant character development and interactions, fantastic visual effects and a fast but dynamic pace and flow, Marvel's The Avengers is a film that any Marvel, comic book, superhero and sci-fi fan will enjoy again and again."
"Jan 30, 2014",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers had hype rivaled only by The Dark Knight Rises, being built up from 5 separate movies. Does it live up to it? Yes, it does. The cast and crew have successfully created a perfect mix of humor, action, story and character, and is truly one of the best superhero movies of all time."
"Jan 29, 2014",neutral,Take away the quippy one liners. Now you're left with a not so good story. This movie was highly overrated. You want a good superhero movie? Watch The Dark Knight Trilogy.
"Jan 28, 2014",positive,Best marvel movie EVER!!!!!
"Jan 27, 2014",positive,why are hawkeye and black widow even there? do they get everyone else coffee?
"Jan 27, 2014",positive,One of the best comic-book films ever.
"Jan 26, 2014",positive,An amazing movie that brings all of Marvels Greatest heroes that is so true to the comics and is my personal favorite of the comic movie genre
"Jan 26, 2014",positive,the greatest superhero film to date
"Jan 26, 2014",positive,Nothing to say against this film. Just watch it if you like the Marvel characters.
"Jan 25, 2014",positive,Too much on dialogue instead of the awesome visual effects the movie has to offer.
"Jan 25, 2014",positive,"Awesome movie with some great actors, excellent directing and action scenes, a must watch."
"Jan 25, 2014",positive,"Nice one, but would bi better with only one hera"
"Jan 24, 2014",positive,bringing all of the greats together and pretty well done!
"Jan 24, 2014",positive,Hats off to you Marvel. You pulled off the impossible.
"Jan 23, 2014",positive,It's doesn't try to be like a Nolan Batman movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously.
"Jan 22, 2014",positive,"It's a good movie, but considering the multiple years and movies they used to build it up, I couldn't help feeling noticeably underwhelmed."
"Jan 22, 2014",positive,"Best marvel film probably ever. So much fun! So many characters yet never seems convoluted. This really is THE comic book movie. I still prefer the dark knight over this but the avengers is a game changer. 200M opening week! This movie was an event & the 4 year build up was well worth it, can't wait for the sequel!"
"Jan 22, 2014",positive,"Cool, funny, beautiful and interesting. Director Joss Whedon managed to completely different characters to combine them into one command so that each would not take over the movie.

The Avengers 2012 blockbuster best and best movie Marvel comics. Stark Tony / Iron Man excellent jokes. Loki turned out very cool villain. The other characters are also good. In the film, excellent special effects, cool action, a great cast and funny jokes"
"Jan 22, 2014",positive,A great mix of special effects action and comedy this works very very well
"Jan 18, 2014",positive,One of the greatest superhero movies ever made.
"Jan 18, 2014",neutral,"This genre must be called ""Action-Comedy-Cliché""..."
"Jan 18, 2014",positive,"The most hipped up movie of all time doesn't offer a complex or a thought provoking story but it doesn't try to. It knows that all we want to see are our favorite heroes kicking ass. It's full of action having the heroes fighting both each other and the enemy and saying one-liners left, right and center."
"Jan 18, 2014",positive,Amazing movie! Totally metâ??if not exceededâ??expectations! Every actor and actress put on a spectacular performance. Loved every minute of it!
"Jan 18, 2014",positive,THIS is a superhero movie!
"Jan 18, 2014",positive,The action and comedic elements more than make up for its weak villains and uninspired story.
"Jan 17, 2014",positive,"Wow three years on and this film is still great. The avengers is a fantastic film and one of the best Marvel movies, easily in the top 5. Now I'm not going to lie the Avengers is not as perfect as when I first saw it in the cinema, after seeing quite a few more times the problems in this movie are starting to become more obvious however that doesn't ruin this great movie. One of the best things about the movie is the cast. I mean look at this cast Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg. Everyone is great in the movie and there isn't a bad peformance is thee whole film. All the characters are handled very well except for two, unfortunately Hawkeye is very underutilized and Captain America is really badly handled, even his costume is terrible in the movie it's just a big shame as movies like Captain America the Winter Soldier prove what a badass he can be but in this movie he's really badly handled. Luckily though Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and especially Hulk are all handled brilliantly. The Shield regulars, Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Agent Coulson are all fantastic. Loki is a great villain, he's not the most threatening but he's absolutely brilliant, Tom Hiddleston makes him a charming villain and he has some good jokes. Speaking of which the humour in this movie is great and while it might not be as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy it's still hilarious. The action in the film is also brilliant, especially the final action sequence which is just fantastic and a visual treat, I also love seeing the Avengers all work together and it's just tones of fun. Joss Whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and it's a shame he won't be directing any more Avengers movies after Age of Ultron. While this film is absolutely brilliant it unfortunately does have some rather big problems that stop this being a perfect movie. Probably the biggest and most common problem with the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad. It goes on to long and to be honest it's very underwhelming. Another big problem is that even though I do love the end action scene the Chitari are actually a terrible army, they are very unthreatening and and we never actually see them kill anybody so it makes them seem really terrible, they also did extremely easy. One personal problem I have with this movie is actually more to do with the Marvel series as a whole. Spoiler Alert the motivation for the Avengers to all team together and fight the Chitari is because Loki kills Agent Coulson, this scene is actually very well done and it's very sad to see such a likeable character die. However Agents of Shield came out and now Coulson is alive, why would they do that. You had a very sad death that proved Loki could be evil and that the series is fine with killing off main characters however now he's alive, why couldn't they have just based the show off of Maria Hill. But problems aside this is a fantastic movie with great acting, great action, great humour and great music. I would say see it but who hasn't. A"
"Jan 17, 2014",positive,"Marvel heroes from previous movie combined into one movie..not so surprising especially the villain since he already appear in Thor, is it that hard to show another villain from the huge Marvel Universe? I hope to see more surprises on Avengers 2. But hey, on the positive side it does have a great action and a bit of funny dialogues"
"Jan 16, 2014",positive,The greatest movie of 2012
"Jan 16, 2014",positive,I didn't know films could be this perfect.
"Jan 14, 2014",negative,"Keys to enjoying this movie:
-put a nail in your head
-become both blind and deaf
-listen to music instead of sad excuse for dialogue
If you follow one or may of these tasks you might enjoy avengers."
"Jan 14, 2014",positive,Easily the 3rd best film of 2012
"Jan 14, 2014",positive,"I finally got around to watching this movie and I have no idea what took me so long. Beyond incredible cast (of course), amazing effects, and I absolutely loved the comedy in it. Definitely entertaining- no complaints here. Had watched it 3 more times within a couple of days afterwards."
"Jan 13, 2014",negative,First saw it on opening weekend/ midnight showing
"Jan 13, 2014",positive,"The best Marvel movie I have ever seen. I remember going to see this two years ago not knowing what to expect and I left in the most excited stage I've ever felt. Joss Whedon was the perfect choice to direct this movie and I'm so happy that he didn't screw it up. He wrote each character perfectly and the script was fantastic, it was smart, clever, funny, everything I had hoped it would be. The performances were EXCELLENT by everyone. Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, Renner, Hiddleston, Gregg, Smulders, Skarsgard, Jackson, Paltrow, Bettany, Denisof, they could not have picked a more outstanding cast for this movie. The action was over the top but it also didn't seem to dull, and the hole movie flowed so perfectly the whole time. It was probably the most entertaining and fun movie of 2012. I think what stood out the most in this movie would have to been Hiddlestone's performance as Loki. As a big fan of the comics, that was what I was most worried about. Hollywood has a tendency to not show marvel villains in the correct way, but after seeing this I think I liked movie version of Loki better than comic version. I'm looking forward to the second on in 2015 and really hope in can live up to this one's expectations and doesn't let me down."
"Jan 13, 2014",positive,Entertaining collection of superheroes do battle against thin weedy man with stick. Hulk smash!
"Jan 11, 2014",positive,genius and just the right amount of action.
"Jan 11, 2014",positive,"One of the biggest surprises I've had in the theater. So AWESOME! Definitely up there with TDK Trilogy, Spider-Man 2 and Iron Man 1, and it delivers on every level."
"Jan 11, 2014",positive,This one of the best movies of all time.
"Jan 9, 2014",positive,What it lacks in plot it makes up for in action.
"Jan 9, 2014",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers completely lives up to its hype.  This movie features action never before seen on the big screen, complimented by humor and characters who all are given their moment to shine.  The Avengers completely delivers and has just set the bar for every super hero film to come."
"Jan 9, 2014",positive,"epic superhero movie.   Taking hulk iron man captain america and others together, displaying a great blend of storytelling, action, and humor, you have a blockbuster that matches its enormous expectations. It keeps you fully engaged throughout."
"Jan 9, 2014",positive,"Nothing remarkable for an epic superhero movie. All blame on talentless Joss Whedon who is not good in making epic movies... First, the scenes in the movie were not epic, all involved small actions - sucked. Second, the enemies - Loki's forces are suck-ass, too weak as challenge to the avengers... When I watched how the avengers won the battle easily without any challenge, i felt sleepy. Come on, they are the AVENGERS!!! Make the enemies STRONGER! Joss Whedon - Sucked"
"Jan 8, 2014",positive,"If you like the avengers, little will disappoint you in this long, exciting movie"
"Jan 7, 2014",positive,Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie in general. It's very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story.
"Jan 7, 2014",positive,"You get what you'd expect from this comic book blockbuster. Hulk Smashes, Thor talks funny, and Stark rips on everyone. There are some laughs, the team takes a bit of a detour to settle some pissing contests, and the good guys wail on the forces of evil. I'm just left with the lingering thought of, ""If only the IP owners of Spider Man or the X-Men would have played ball! Damn!"""
"Jan 7, 2014",positive,Great sound effects. Loved it.
"Jan 7, 2014",positive,"Given that they only made this in six months tops, the movie was pretty epic. The bonding of the cast on and off cam is commendable too."
"Jan 7, 2014",positive,I think it's just okay. could've done better with what they had.
"Jan 6, 2014",positive,The only Marvel film I could watch! Absolutely loved it! 2 thumbs up!!
"Jan 6, 2014",positive,Joss Whedon is a genius at ensemble cast interactions...  The repartee is wonderful!
"Jan 6, 2014",positive,great movie. one of the best Marvel movies yet
"Jan 5, 2014",positive,"Super hero goodness, with lots of witty quips. My favorite character was black widow."
"Jan 5, 2014",positive,"Joss Whedon brings us an epic for all movie & comic book fans. Alongside the Dark Knight, this film is the best Comic Book Movie of all time. The differences between characters MAKE you love them, along with knee-slapping comedy, stunning visual effects, and a hopeful score. Each character gets to shine in their own way with a fair amount of screen time."
"Jan 4, 2014",positive,Although it starts slow the ending is just amazing and it's about time to see a movie like this.
"Jan 4, 2014",positive,Loved it the avengers finally got a movie loved the cartoon they did it justice thank god now just hope they don't mess it up
"Jan 3, 2014",positive,"Great movie, lots of energy all the way through!"
"Jan 3, 2014",positive,"It's fun. Cheesy well acted and shot nerdy fun, and not really much else... But then again it doesn't really need to be"
"Jan 3, 2014",positive,"The action scenes are spectacularly exciting, with excellent use of visuals and CGI. I loved seeing the heroes argue and not getting along, and seeing them working together and just beating the crap out of everything."
"Jan 2, 2014",positive,Top 3 MCU movies and a must buy!!! It is a five star movie no doubt.
"Jan 2, 2014",positive,"Predictable, nothing-new plot but the action scenes are spectacular. Who doesn't love superheroes?"
"Jan 2, 2014",positive,Best movie ever has great character and a wonderful cast
"Jan 1, 2014",positive,What can I say other than Earths Mightiest Movie
"Jan 1, 2014",neutral,"Fairly predictable, but come on, it's a comic book movie.  If you're looking for convoluted storylines, try some actual literature.

This movie didn't need to be nearly as long as it was.  Most of the airborne happenings were extraneous and not very believable, frankly.  They didn't add anything to the plot or the character development, and frankly it feels as though some stuff hit the cutting room floor that might have better explained why we spent so much time there, though I doubt it would ultimately justify that time.  

Obviously trying to provide a modicum of backstory for each of the characters takes time, and future installments of the franchise won't have to do that as much.  But for this first movie, it takes up a lot of time without a great deal of payoff.  There isn't enough character development to really connect, yet it's time consuming still.  

Theologically, this movie was interesting for its portrayal of the gods, and particularly humanities abilities to outwit and outmanuever them. Thor and Loki as demi-gods clearly are not vastly superior to the abilities of the avengers.  They might be impressive enough and overpowering enough for ordinary humans, but for the cream of the crop, they're marginal at best.  Hulk summarizes it best with perhaps his only line of the movie - ""Puny god.""  

While Captain America provides at least a head-nod to the Judeo-Christian God of an America past, that God is otherwise non-existent in this film, and in particular in the lives of the various heroes.  Humanity is alone in dealing with this other-dimensional threat.  The demi-gods of ancient civilizations are not enough on their own to save us - we have to do this for ourselves.  It would have been interesting to see this played out a bit more explicitly, but this probably isn't the forum for it."
"Jan 1, 2014",positive,Absolutely loved it. It was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish with great chemistry between the cast. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark delivers great value as always
"Dec 31, 2013",positive,faithful to the source material....and mind blowing comic adaptation
"Dec 31, 2013",positive,"Action pack, nice plot and never gets boring."
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,The only word to describe this movie: awesome. JUST AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,The inner comic book nerd within me absolutely adored this movie. Thank you Joss Whedon!
"Dec 30, 2013",negative,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. How people liked it is beyond me. The script was absolutely terrible, and I had actually fallen asleep during the movie due to boredom, having to finish it later. I would rather blind myself than watch this movie again."
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,This is a great movie
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,Every nerd's dream with an amazing cast.
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,A movie we have been waiting 49 years for and it completely delivers everything we wanted and more.
"Dec 30, 2013",positive,LOVE THIS MOVIE BUT Thor 2 is best Marvel cannot wait till age of altron
"Dec 30, 2013",negative,Over hyped and overdone; The Avengers hero's stories don't mesh well and its skinny plot doesn't contain enough strength to hold them all together.
"Dec 29, 2013",positive,A great superhero film that equally distributes the spotlight on each of its characters
"Dec 29, 2013",positive,"I owe my fondness for superheroes almost entirely to this film. When it came out, I went to the Marvel Movie Marathon held by AMC and ended up watching the five previous films in the MCU, leading up to the premiere. It was kind of a lot to take in all at once, but I fell in love with the characters in each of the movies, and seeing them all brought together in a single movie was brilliant. It must have taken enormous effort to work in enough screen time for each of the main characters, without favoring one over the others, and I cannot get over just how well Whedon managed it. It was very well-balanced, well-paced, just excellent overall. Definitely one of my all-time favorites."
"Dec 29, 2013",negative,Overhyped and pretty slow to take off before all the action near the end. The Tony Stark and Captain America bitch fest seems so unnecessary. Not a fan of this movie.
"Dec 28, 2013",positive,Would be a five if it weren't for all the damn U.S. military advertising.
"Dec 27, 2013",positive,Avengers is a stellar film with tons of twists and turns. It starts with a thrilling high jack by Loki the Demigod in pursuit of the tesseract. The stress and struggles the Avengers experience are intriguing. Whedon's comical style added to the piece is in no way cheesy has a fantastic balance between action and comedy. It ends with an amazing battle against the chitari warriors. All of the efforts I have mentioned make this movie a five star classic.
"Dec 27, 2013",negative,"This lacking movie, is a great example on a superhero movie, that only serves up to the action, that so little is given to go deeper into our superheroes and answer the raising    questions throughout this movie. In general The avengers has the ability to prove action-wise, but never in a millenia goes to serve as a realistic or even an ejoyful movie."
"Dec 26, 2013",positive,One of greatest movies of all time!!!
"Dec 26, 2013",positive,One of the greatest Marvel movies ever!!! Nothing and no one can beat this movie ... except the second one
"Dec 26, 2013",positive,"I'm sure that Joss Whedon is a person of genius.
He succeeded in mixing all of Marvel's heroes and making one of the greatest team in the world."
"Dec 26, 2013",positive,"When it comes to me rating a movie I always think of how the plot unfolds, character development, the theme and the acting. This is different because honestly it was just so much fun. I enjoyed the tension, snark comments between the team-mates and for sure the action in this movie. I mean it generally performs favourably in every other aspect as the story unfolds towards a grande-finale at the end. If there was a weak spot for this movie, it would be the character Hawkeye in this movie, but honestly that's a minuscule complaint. I'm a comic book fan and Hawkeye's cool, it's just when you got the big guns in this movie you don't really care about him, he seems like just an add-on. I do feel, however, that the actual figure Hulk didn't get enough character put into him  (which is understandable, as it's hard to relate to a rage monster). I just wish I could have seen a greater conflict between Bruce Banner and Hulk. All in all, fantastic movie, recommend it!"
"Dec 25, 2013",positive,"The Avengers. This film boasts an impressive cast with downey jr., chris hemsworth, and Mark ruffalo. Make no mistake, with all of the talent on this cast. Downey jr. absolutely steals the shows. This film was entertaining from beginning to end, and contains some of the most impressive action sequences I've ever seen. The hulk smash was just as enjoyable as was thor throwing 'Mjlonir' at iron man. The movie does lack a solid storyline, but you are still left very satisfied. The Avengers is a very funny movie, and it's in large part due to Joss Whedon's ability to write wittingly. With all that said, this film is still way overhyped. And this does not mean it's a ""bad"" film because it's the exact opposite. The more I watch the film the film the more I enjoy it. At first, the hype around the film somewhat ruined my experience. I expected something other wordily, which is not what I got. None the less, the avengers offers great comedy and mind blowing action, but there not much more than that. At the end of the day it really didn't matter. This movie was easily one of my favorite movies of 2012, and definitely worth seeing.

4.2/5"
"Dec 24, 2013",positive,"Good but not great, most overrated movie of 2012 if you ask me.
Now for starters this is in no way a bad movie, it was smartly written, it fit together and it wasn't uneven, and it actually had charachter develpoment (something almost unheard of in an action movie). Despite those perks, it has flaws that seem to be always overlooked. For starters, the plot is much to simple, which is OK for most people, but I often enjoy complex stories, the plot is also predictable and cliched, so there aren't many suprieses. This was also a pain to watch in the theather, with so many toddlers and little kids talking and crying constatly. Overall it's not bad, but terribly ovverrated and not that great as well"
"Dec 23, 2013",positive,"A hell of a gathering for all the super heroes coming together in this action packed helarious movie, bringing all the hero movies together. 5 Stars from me."
"Dec 23, 2013",positive,"Top Movies   (12-14)  ON DEMAND, BLU LIBRARY"
"Dec 21, 2013",positive,"It never fails to amaze me that some people seem to think that movies such as this should, 1) make sense, 2) have the dialogue of Dickens masterpiece, 3) match the Cinematic greats of yesteryear. It has explosions, it has super heroes and super villans, all in all it delivers in spades. Minus sides some of the Super Heroes you might not miss if they died ( Man with Bow makes me yawn) and the invading force seem to be cannon fodder for our super heroes. However the overall affect is good and you will leave the cinema wanting to see the next installment."
"Dec 20, 2013",positive,"Simply brilliant. I liked it... a lot. The Gods were a bit average, the man in an iron suit his good old self, a sexy Scarlett (say no more!), and, wow, Hulk is so handsome. And why is it called the Avengers? Well, the explaining could be cut a bit, but I don't think it's a waste of time plotting the lead-up to all the actions. Each hero rocked up in his/her own brilliant way. The superhero movie of the year for sure!"
"Dec 19, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is an fantastic movie with great amount action and a wonderful story, and I'm especially amazed by the music and the special effects! 

Another thing that's great about The Avengers is the opening scene, which truly is exiting and thrilling. I found this movie highly entertaining, because it's so damn good and unique, and it's packed with great actors and the movie overall is cool and touching. The negative thing about The Avengers is that the tempo is a little to slow at some places, but also that there are some scenes that's not so original, because some scenes looks like they might have taken from other movies (like Transformers). But except for that is The Avengers truly fascinating!

An amazing film from Marvel, but with to much slow scenes (and boring conversations).

The Avengers gets a 8.7/10"
"Dec 18, 2013",positive,Very long but great movie
"Dec 18, 2013",positive,Need more Hulk smash less banner.
"Dec 18, 2013",positive,needed a longer fight between thor an hulk but besides that dam near perfect
"Dec 17, 2013",positive,The best crossover ever!!!
"Dec 16, 2013",positive,Incredible movie along with breathtaking special effects. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Perfect blend of action and humour.
"Dec 16, 2013",positive,Over the top. Makes me chuckle.
"Dec 16, 2013",positive,"It was alright, but i don't understand why people are saying things like it was better than star wars and it was the best movie ever. It was just another super hero movie, nothing more."
"Dec 15, 2013",negative,"I like a good super hero flick, but this was a dumb waste of 2.5 hours. Blah. Boring."
"Dec 15, 2013",positive,Great movie. Must say on point with the action and the suspense.
"Dec 15, 2013",positive,"Very good, top ten from the past half a decade"
"Dec 14, 2013",positive,"I am still utterly confused as of why this movie is as popular as it is.  Yes it was good and yes the characters are cool.  But why was this the big success?  I really don't get it.  Thinking back I cannot remember any real iconic scenes or any moments of gripping dialogue.  The enemy? That guy from Thor.  What was at stake? The Earth. How emotionally attached was I to any of the characters? almost not at all.  I love IronMan, as does everyone, but that's about it really.  Captain America was good too.  But again, what was amazing about this? I really do not understand.  Maybe in time, years later, more people will really see this movie for what it is: mediocre."
"Dec 13, 2013",positive,"The Avengers was the movie where all the Marvel pressure lied.If this movie failed,all the previous Marvel movies would have been a a failure,if not a complete loss.I must say that if you are not one one of those movie-goers who feels that the plot should be really good,and just feel that you should have a good time and that's it,look no further.The Avengers is an all out superhero fan fest and the epitome for all Marvel and superhero fans.
 The plot is simple.Everything unfolds just the way you expect.But what elevates the movie above your previous Marvel ones is the chemistry between all these heroes.All these characters know each other,and are all of a sudden thrown together to save the world from Loki(Tom Hiddleston,the best Marvel villain after Magneto).Here,they must overcome personal differences and work a team,and how they get about to become is the team is what the movie is-and not how there is endless action to save the world.There is a lot of action,no doubt.And it's good action too.But at any given time,the dialogue and the interplay between the characters is what makes this movie.And that was probably what Whedon was aiming at.
 Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is always a treat to watch.He is as badass as he can get here,but also shows his importance.The way he jabs at Captain America(Chris Evans)is really funny-calling him old fashioned and of no use.Chris Hemsworth as Thor is as reliable as ever,and he too has some really funny scenes.But the superhero who steals the show here is Hulk,played by Ruffalo.Its a treat to see Bruce Banner AND Hulk,which was not so in the previous independent Hulk movies.That does prove Whedon is a great director.Renner,Scarlet Johhansson and Sam Jackson are,in my honest opinion,not given much to do.In fact,there is importance is so minutely felt,that I can't even judge if their characters were of any use in the movie at all.That and the fact that the plot was a little too weak are the two major issues with this movie.Otherwise,The Avengers fits as a perfect popcorn entertainer,possibly the best superhero one,and one of the better superhero movies in general."
"Dec 12, 2013",positive,While not perfect what could be asked more from this ambitious movie that surpassed many people expectation s
"Dec 12, 2013",positive,"There are two schools of superhero film that are currently enjoying success. The first is composed of gritty, complex, semi-realistic reinterpretations of classic comic characters, the most successful example being Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The second is more light entertainment fare, with colorful heroes duking it out with sinister villains in over the top action sequences interspersed with humorous material. That's what this is, and this is one of the best examples of the breed. Every actor that makes up the titular team has enough charisma to lead his or her own feature, which makes bringing them together a bit of a risk, but Joss Whedon manages it brilliantly, so no one feels wasted here. There may not be a lot of substance to it at the end of the day, but it never feels as if its lacking needed weight. It just feels like a fun ride."
"Dec 10, 2013",neutral,"Well made in that the effects and banter between characters are pleasing enough (except Loki, whose dialogue and character development as opposed to the original Thor movie are atrocious), but other than that it seems people have a hard time accepting this movie just has a far too weak plot with too many plot conveniences to count.... while the characters are charming the storyline is just hokey and campy."
"Dec 10, 2013",positive,So much action. Great SFX. Loved it from start to finish.
"Dec 9, 2013",positive,Best of the Marvel films so far a that's a big deal
"Dec 8, 2013",positive,"While it could have been better with the budget it had, it pleased me very much and can even get non-comic book fans excited."
"Dec 7, 2013",positive,This movie stayed pretty close to the comics I thought.  It is week worth your time watching it. Enjoy. I loved it when Hulk called Loki a puny god.
"Dec 7, 2013",positive,"A high action blend of the greatest super heroes known to the marvel universe. Avengers proved itself and then some. I was expecting a clamored mesh of terrible 
acting and a pathetic story to go with it, but what I saw was just amazing"
"Dec 7, 2013",positive,Beat Comlc-Book Movie Ever
"Dec 7, 2013",positive,"Witty, action-packed and a rock solid installment in the Marvel franchise, The Avengers is an unprecedented masterpiece that is wondrous to behold."
"Dec 6, 2013",positive,"I mean, yeah, it was good."
"Dec 6, 2013",positive,"Slightly overrated, but still entertaining AF"
"Dec 5, 2013",positive,Needs no review cause it's to great for words
"Dec 4, 2013",positive,This just makes me happy.  I loved the Avengers and Justice League. This is a great take on it.  I like this Hulk much better. You'll have to see to appreciate.  :)
"Dec 4, 2013",positive,Big budget superhero blast.
"Dec 2, 2013",positive,"For SE, 5 stars
For cast of characters, 4 stars
For cast of actors, 4 stars
For story, 3 stars

I watched a Redbox DVD in the library, killing some time.  I laughed aloud at some of the sarcastic humor."
"Dec 2, 2013",positive,I liked the film.  It was another great comic story on the big screen.
"Dec 2, 2013",positive,Coolest superhero movie ever Best of all times Can't wait for Avengers Age of Ultron
"Nov 30, 2013",positive,One of the best superhero films ever.
"Nov 30, 2013",positive,One of Marvel's best films.
"Nov 30, 2013",positive,"A great big action movie that is absolutely worth watching even if you're not a comic book fan. A nice portion of the film was filmed in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio and it's a blast watching it and saying I know where that is and that and so on. Can't wait for #2!"
"Nov 29, 2013",positive,"It's certainly superior to Man of Steel, which I class as the most disappointing superhero film of recent years, and which has a second half featuring incessant, irritating noise and constant boring sequences of stuff getting smashed into stuff, but this genre of films on the whole is starting to follow a very similar and increasingly tired formula. To be fair Avengers Assemble works better than most, inevitably helped by the added options offered up by teaming all the heroes together, one significant addition being all the banter and wise-cracking between the Avengers. I didn't mind the film, when I went into it actually expecting to dislike it, so in that sense it's a success, but as director Joss Whedon himself has admitted, it could have been better."
"Nov 28, 2013",positive,a definite win for marvel
"Nov 28, 2013",negative,"Really? I guess it looks cool, but really? Maybe i want a little more than just mindless action in m movies. 5 minutes of good solid character developing dialogue would have been nice. I have no emotion toward any of the characters, it would have made no difference had any of them been killed, not that it treats major character deaths in an emotional manner anyway."
"Nov 28, 2013",positive,Loved it (just like everybody else).
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,Possibly the best Marvel movie to date. The Avengers is one of the the most fun movies ever and it still manages to have some brains and drama.
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,Fucking Amazing!!!!!
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,The best part of watching this movie in the theater isn't just that its amazing but everyone's reactions in the audience made watching it so much more comfortable. This will universally give people something to talk about and have in common.
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,"This movie was excellent. Its a collision of worlds for all these different people. This had a very good story, excellent villian, and a good plot structure. I can't wait for the Age of Ultron"
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,"It was aight, if your 15 years old."
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,"With an amazing cast, and a script that cares about every of its heroes, it totally delivers a blockbuster extravaganza of film, the characters are the main thing that made the film great, the special effects, action sequences, score, story and script are spectacular, it is one of the best films from Marvel"
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,Great movie never stopped laughing
"Nov 27, 2013",positive,Best Marvel and superhero movie I've ever seen!
"Nov 26, 2013",positive,"Some of the BEST superheros team up to stop Loki! I personally LOVED it. (MUST SEE)
I can't wait for the squeal!"
"Nov 26, 2013",positive,"Throughly entertaining and spectacular to look at, but ""The Avengers"" stumbles a bit with a script that could've been polished and story that could've been more compelling."
"Nov 25, 2013",positive,"You had me at ""Shakespeare in the Park!"""
"Nov 25, 2013",positive,great action movie that i enjoyed!
"Nov 24, 2013",positive,I've never had so much fun watching a movie. The comic book truly became alive with the direction of Joss Whedon!
"Nov 24, 2013",positive,An amazing superhero team up movie. Can't wait to see the 2nd one when Ultron brings them to their breaking points
"Nov 23, 2013",positive,Damn good and funny too
"Nov 23, 2013",positive,"This has got to be one of the best movies in 2012, with superb acting, thrilling action, believable special effects and great story and script, this movie is the best marvel film yet.

Overall: This is a must see movie for all actions fans and simple movie lovers

Number Grade: 92%"
"Nov 23, 2013",positive,"As a crossover and an action film, the avengers nails both. While it has its flaws, they are far outweighed by the good. It's not the greatest superhero film of all time... but it's one of the best."
"Nov 22, 2013",positive,"No solo demuestra ser un grandioso logro por parte del MCU, si no que también logran un buen progreso. Un equilibrio entre protagonistas bien balanceado, una historia que aunque sencilla, su desarrollo esta más que bien manejado y fluido. Pese a ser más que una peli genérica de héroes, la cinta es un orgasmo garantizado!"
"Nov 22, 2013",positive,1 scene that made my day captain america:.......and hulk ...SMASH!
"Nov 22, 2013",positive,The Avengers es una excelentes  con un guion muy bueno y con un toque e comedia y con actuaciones espectaculares como la de Robert  Downey Jr. y con excelentes efectos especiales
"Nov 22, 2013",positive,Loved it so much action
"Nov 21, 2013",positive,I'm sure there will be another sequel for this franchise movie
"Nov 21, 2013",positive,"As egos, powers, personalities and conflicts let rip; a punchy script, cohesive story and deft dialogue flow; outstanding action, zealous stunts and exceptional 3D effects amaze reviewers can finally put cynicism aside and allow The Avengers to stake its claim as an excellent Marvel film and one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made.

True comic aficionado and writer/director Joss Whedon's (Creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly and Dollhouse and highly-regarded comic author) influence is apparent in every facet. From the culturally appropriate tone, plausibly integrated characters, subtle interpersonal turmoil too blatant sarcastic witty, every element comes together in harmony to create something to be savored.

When the villainous Norse demi-god of mischief Loki (the masterfully pithy foe from Thor, Tom HIddleston) infiltrates the international peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D's secret bunker to steal the fundamental source of unlimited sustainable energy known as the Tesseract and the only man who can tap into its power and turn it into a weapon scientist Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), the world comes under imminent threat of war and ultimate enslavement. 

Attempting to save the world and prevent complete human annihilation, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (the stylishly authoritative Samuel. L. Jackson) brings together a motley collection of superhero recruits.  The uniquely talented master-manipulator Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson who  deftly hints at her characters tumultuous undercurrents), recently defrosted WW2 super-solider Steve Rogers /Captain America (Chris Evans with his old-fashioned all-American wholesomeness), self-proclaimed genius playboy billionaire philanthropist Nick Stark / Iron Man (quick quipped scene stealing Robert Downey Jr), brilliant scientist come green rage monster Bruce Banner / The Hulk (film standout and deeper Ed Norton replacement Mark Ruffalo), unsurpassed archer and expert assassin Clint Barton / Hawkeye (the as yet underutilized Jeremy Renner ) and Loki's own step-brother, the god of thunder, Thor (the physically and mentally imposing Chris Hemsworth).

Internal quarrels erupt as the myriad of alpha-males bicker and vie for top position clouding their vision to Loki's evil schemes. But when he opens a portal to another world to allow passage for an invading alien race of superfast mini-fighters and ominous giant slithering sloth come lobster ships, the Avenger team must put aside their childish squabbling for the greater good.

From the onset there is a palpable feeling of camaraderie between the actors manifesting in some genuinely unforced laugh-out loud moments; and after all it is meant to be a comic. Having so many leads could have resulted in a cinematic battle of supremacy, but by previously having their backstories explained in individual films and Whedon's deft understanding of internal dynamics, no-one's story arc has been  shortchanged. Each heavy-hitter gets at least one moment in which to shine and for some an even better than when they were the focus. 

Each actor brings something different to its massive table. Even though it is only Ruffalo's first turn as the Hulk the depth he brings is dramatically profound, contrasting wonderfully with Downey Jr's levity inducing natural smart-arse swagger.  Evans' injects some self-deprecating humor into his outdated character and Hemsworth sidesteps the inherent cheesiness of a strong silent type. Meanwhile the only real human characters of Johansson, Renner and Jackson ground the story in a slither of reality. 

Not to bring about a spoiler alert, there are a few scenes that warrant special mention. Romanoff's two interrogations are a work of seductive art, the confrontation between Hulk and Loki is hysterically appropriate, the final battle sequence takes care in showing viewers specific detail rather than relying on disorientating rapid editing, and pretty much every time Stark speaks you wish it was a DVD you could replay. 

The Verdict: Not to be confused with 'Shakespeare in the park', The Avengers has a certain gift. Light and Dark, deep and shallow; its grand but damaged figures from parallel fictional universes meet somewhere in the middle between antiquated comic and contemporary cinema to transcended the makeup of its elements.

"Nov 21, 2013",positive,"Fantastic film, would watch over and over. One of my favourite marvel movies"
"Nov 20, 2013",positive,"From Iron Man to The Incredible Hulk. Then Iron Man 2 to Thor, and from there Captain America: The First Avenger. All the bases are filled and have been seen from the public. Started in 2008 to come it's conclusion in 2012. Bring them all home Marvel.
The Avengers. The film that tied all the franchises together and made one hell of a movie and a thrilling and exciting ride. No super hero movie has ever brought franchises together like this, so Marvel knew it HAD to be a success in order to truly complete what they had intended to do four years ago. They brought in Fire Fly creator Joss Whedon to help write and direct the film as he is familiar with bringing everyone together and interact with one another. 
The story revolves around Loki and his quest to rule and be king and the tesseract from Captain America. Crises happens and the crew is brought together, but not before even more things happen and the team isn't really a team. Officially when the finally happens which by the way is unbelievingly awesome and just great. 
The cast is fine, and with a huge cast like this why wouldn't it be? It's great! Great summer movie, great action movie, great fun with everything in between. Love this movie and anyone who loves heros will love this one. Only recommendation is that you watch the films that lead up to this one. 
Already saw Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, waiting on Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy for the sequel; The Avengers: Age of Ultron in 2015."
"Nov 20, 2013",positive,"Loud, action-packed, and fun; the right ingredients for a comic blockbuster film."
"Nov 20, 2013",positive,Best movie I have ever seen
"Nov 19, 2013",positive,An entertaining romp through the Marvel universe. Close to pure super-hero spectacle gold.
"Nov 19, 2013",positive,"The story: the six super heroes unite to fight against a global threat
This action film is PHENOMENON and EPIC !It's the best film of Marvel. When I watched this movie... I'm stagger. All the spectators in the cinema applaud. There are a lot of actions scene (nearly two hours); we haven't the time for relax, it's fascinating. The special effects are awesome, it's clearly amazing. The graphics are perfect;it's top, notably for the characters (Hulk) and the scenery (city).It's for that Avenger thrill fan of Marvel and of action film. But I understand the Avengers haters, maybe there are too action and a lot of scene are not decent, not really possible.

There is a good casting for example: Robert Downing Jr. (he is the best actor ever and he ist the moste popular and the most compelling actor in Hollywood), Scarlett Johansson (she is the most beautiful actress on Earth), Chris Evans (he played in many Marvel films). The other actors are not verry popular and they haven't much talent that Robert Downing and Chris Evans. Apart Avenger, the movie maker, Joss Whedon don't produce a good films, it's absolutely mediocre."
"Nov 19, 2013",positive,"As not a big Marvel fan, The Avengers was still pretty good even though I didn't like it QUITE as much as most."
"Nov 19, 2013",negative,Boring and it's trying too hard to be funny.
"Nov 18, 2013",positive,overated..its the avengers. where's all the action..
"Nov 18, 2013",negative,"I hated...HATED this movie. 

I attempted to watch it twice...I just couldnt make it the whole way through so I had to watch it in halfs. Marvel movies are either realy awesome or a huge let down...this one was frustrating for me or any real marvel fan. At least its better than the superman movies."
"Nov 17, 2013",positive,"Whether a Marvel geek or not, Marvel's the Avengers did everything right and oh boy, it was a helluva fun time. Director Joss Whedon did an incredible job putting these characters from previous Marvel films together and his and Feige's take on putting the Avengers together on screen was brilliant as well as the effects and the story itself. Grinning from cheek to cheek, the film was great until the last twenty minutes. The last twenty minutes were purely phenomenal (Hulk and Captain America are awesome). All the characters in the film matter and had a dynamic contribution to the storyline. Personally, Captain America is my favorite (personal bias because he was the first superhero action figure and comic I had and I was six years old at that time) and the way he was portrayed was awesome. The film made me more excited for the Winter Soldier. His banter with Iron Man was fun and you have to give credit to Joss Whedon for the conversations and character dynamics. For a film that relies on strong character development and relationships, Joss Whedon did an amazing job with that. My only gripes about the film was that there was no Ant-Man and Wasp in the Avengers roster. I understand the film has to be more grounded so it would make a lot more sense to add Hawkeye and Black Widow and that they were apart of the earlier phase 1 films. But, Ant-Man and Wasp were apart of the founding members of the Avengers. Hawkeye is an amazing character and one of my favorite superheroes of all time but they misused him and made him more serious than he should have been. The other gripe is a tiny one but it needs to be addresses. How can the Avengers communicate without any communicators... just saying.To offset it was an amazing job of Joss Whedon of creating this dynamic storyline in which all of the characters have a relevant role that doesn't drag and entertains all the way. For comic fans, some would expect some serious weight to the film like in the Dark Knight, especially when a certain character dies and the city endures massive casualties but it wasn't necessary. These Marvel Studios movies under the direction of Kevin Feige knocked it out of the park and the Avengers film sits up there as their crown jewel of achievement. I gave the film five stars and even to extent: The GREATEST SUPERHERO FILM OF ALL TIME because it is everything a superhero film should be and surpasses the expectation. The magic of having all of the franchises from phase one come together in an amazing story arc is undeniably awesome and it sets off on what appears to be a bright and limitless future for Marvel."
"Nov 17, 2013",positive,"All it has going for it is the action, because the story was terrible, but they focused too much on it rather than the action. But for the moments where the visuals could really show off, wow. Lots of eye candy."
"Nov 17, 2013",negative,"I was bored.  Kept looking at the clock and taking breaks to look at my Facebook newsfeed.  I wanted to like it because it's a Joss Wheedon movie and I love Buffy,  Firefly and Dollhouse. Sorry Joss!  But I couldn't get into this.  Maybe because the story is preexisting and the characters aren't new.  There just want anything to hook me in and make me care much about the outcome.  There were some cool (and sometimes beautiful)  action sequences and the flying turtle/eel things were pretty cool,  but other than that not much interested me.   Some of the costumes were nice.  But mostly I just want the last 2 hours b and 20 minutes back. I mostly watched because I wanted to try watching S.H.E.I.L.D. Agents of Storm and needed the backstory. Hopefully Joss does something more exciting with that."
"Nov 17, 2013",positive,"This is a fun superhero film, nothing else."
"Nov 16, 2013",positive,big fan of marvels work thought it was great
"Nov 16, 2013",positive,"Open your eyes people! The special effects are spectacular and the acting is solid, but the main bulk of the movie is just trying to tame Hulk! Only the last 30 min of the movie is actually defeating the REAL enemy"
"Nov 15, 2013",positive,"I was never a huge fan of marvel movies, except for the X-Men series, and I still am not. The Avengers' story was extremely weak, and the combat and 3D was the only thing left behind to enjoy, when they weren't pacing around, concentrating on a story they didn't even have all figured out."
"Nov 15, 2013",positive,"The Avengers lives up to the massive hype, as many movies a rarely can do. I have never before had so much fun watching a superhero movie in my life. With so many characters to handle from the multiple superhero franchises, it could have easily failed. But Joss Whedon gives each hero time to shine, balancing all these characters with such care. The script is packed with humor all around, and adds to the enjoyment. It's well paced, exciting, and an absolute blast. The final battle in New York is one of the most amusing battles and most satisfying movie climaxes I have ever viewed. Even the villain is awesome, proving a formidable foe for the team. Seeing the struggles for the Avengers to assemble is very funny, all the personalities in the Marvel universe facing off. All the set up for this movie pays off, and you will not be disappointed. If you looked up entertainment in the dictionary, I'd be surprised if this movie didn't pop up. The Avengers gets 5/5 stars (A+)."
"Nov 15, 2013",positive,"Thanks to strong performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo, The Avengers, while formulaic in structure, has intricate action sequences along with clever dialogue that makes it too fun to deny."
"Nov 15, 2013",positive,This movie was amazing.  I consider it to be a pinnacle of superhero filmography.
"Nov 14, 2013",positive,An amazingly done film with great CGI and story. What's not to love about Tony Stark's hilarious comments and witty comebacks?
"Nov 14, 2013",positive,great movie best movie in my life
"Nov 14, 2013",positive,Good fun. Hulk rocks!
"Nov 14, 2013",positive,"Enjoyed every minute of it. Simply stunning. Despite a huge cast, Robert Downey Jr steals the show with his charisma yet again. Awesome superhero(s) film."
"Nov 13, 2013",positive,"The way they integrated each character was great, they didn't miss a beat. So excited for the next avengers adventure."
"Nov 13, 2013",neutral,Re-Rate: 5/10. Mediocre & Overrated. It Can't even compare to other movies in the comic book genre like The Dark Knight or Days of Future Past.
"Nov 13, 2013",positive,one word.....Loki :)
"Nov 12, 2013",positive,"Fact: ""Marvel's The Avengers"" made more money then any other movie. To me, it's one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. Hulk is the best."
"Nov 12, 2013",positive,Fantastic! Thor and Loki were fantastic!!!! Iron man of course stole the show-
"Nov 12, 2013",positive,"For a film that, for a time, had zero chance of existing, The Avengers brings together the best super hero league of them all in a fittingly glorifying fashion. In Joss We Trust."
"Nov 12, 2013",positive,"Avengers is a fairly decent flick even for comic book novices like myself. Watching guys fly around punching and zapping things is always great but beware take the story with a pinch of salt, there's a few occasions particularly with captain America which are toe curling. 
Downey Jr as expected steals the show Iron man just kicks arse and Ruffalo as the Hulk is great. 
It's a pity the main villain was so weak though Loki reminds me of Orlando bloom in troy, a pussy. If they had had someone like Patrick steward play the bad guy Avengers would have been a 4 star movie."
"Nov 11, 2013",positive,"Do you know what?s hard to do? Apparently for me its writing a review on The Avengers. I think it?s because it is one of those films that everyone has so much to say about that getting in the conversation and actively adding to it is really difficult. We have all seen the great spectacle, and for the most part great movies, that has defined the MCU. Marvel?s ambition has yielded great results and in recent memory I can?t think of a movie that?s had such a great pay off since the Dark Knight, like the Avengers has had.

The Good: Character intros, Dysfunctional team, Comedy, Escapism done very well, Tom Hiddelston, Investment in the loss of Coulson, Logical final fight, Quick pace, In knowledge isn?t necessary.

The Bad: Slow and weak opening, Very bland final enemy and Cap's uniform.  

The Good.

Introducing characters in a franchise film like the Avengers is really difficult. There are going to be some who have seen Iron Man but not Captain America, or Thor but not The Incredible Hulk. Joss Whedon had the good sense to say to hell with it, concise intros that perfectly reflect who the characters are and they?re intentions. This is fantastic we have exposition that doesn?t irritate the initiated into the series while accurately describing to new comers who these heroes are.  Whedon did the same on Serenity and shows why he is one of the best sci-fi directors working today. 

Cinema has it's fair share of dysfunctional teams, but not quite like The Avengers does. The premise almost sounds like a bad joke, a billionaire genius, a patriotic war hero, a god and a man with anger issues have to work together.  Whedon does a really great job of showing off different ways the team is dysfunctional. The obvious Thor and Hulk fight to Captain America and Iron Man?s huge culture and class clash. While characters like Coulson and us as the viewers look on in dismay. All we want you to do is work together! It?s great frustration and good story telling.

Escapism done right is impressive and has a high, high replay value. I saw the Avengers six times in the cinemas. The film never takes itself too seriously but also never forgets what is happening. Will this film change your life? No. Will you watch it again and again? Yes. This is great movie that is an easy watch. 

Great escapist movies have great villains, Die Hard had Hanz Gruber, Harry Potter had Voldemort and The Avengers has Tom Hiddelston?s Loki. Loki is a devilish, trickster who?s swagger is disarmingly charming. His motivations are sound and although I never really came to hate Loki, I did love his brand of villainy that if it were not for Tom Hiddelston, would have been an unconvincing performance from any one else. 

The end of the world is a been there, done that sort of fair. It?s sad but really it is, Whedon had a better object at stake. Funny and average, yet extraordinary Phil Coulson. Phil was almost like the audience, in the moment more of an observer and yet he separated himself from us by his abilities. When Coulson died in the film that was worth avenging. It was a novel move, a dark surprise and not only solidified the team but also the ultimate motivation for the final battle.

Speaking of the final fight scene it was really welcome to see some logic behind a final fight instead of a messy, oh god its everywhere final fight. The team actively says, logically we should contain this. That tiny bit of foresight does wonders for not only the scale of the fight but the reliance on the team.

The film has a very brisk pace, it has to be for the amount of star power  that is very well divided among the team.  Many events in the film come and go, all done justly and quickly with the team growing until it comes to a quick assemblage in New York. Considering the run time of the film it never feels like a long film.

For The Avengers ultimately being a sequel to several films it never feels like it. The same foresight that kept the intros concise but elaborate is at work the entire movie. You never need ot have seen another film in the MCU to understand just what?s going on in The Avengers. It?s nice to have it especially in terms of scale but it never stalls or leaves you wondering about anything. 

The Bad.

The opening scene is the only moment in the film that sort of drags on. It?s a lot of exposition about the tesseract and were it not for Tom Hiddelston?s intro I would have thought the Avengers opened with more of a splat than a bang. That?s not to say the film has a completely weak opening it?s just bloated and even a collapsing building barely warrants a ?meh?. 

The chitauri are a very, very bland enemy. There is nothing distinctive about them and their ships look almost like transformers. Loki is leading an army of faceless followers and it is distracting. Their numbers are impressive yes, but I never feared them, and honestly to describe them is almost ot say grey, velociraptor predatorish things. Weak support to a very strong antagonist.

Captain America's uniform in the first Avenger is utilitarian, plausible and works really well for the period piece. Had I been the one to make the call for Captain America?s uniform it would have been to stay in line with that, maybe a bit more modern but let?s not completely go full on spangly on the outfit. Cap?s outfit in the Avengers is almost distracting. It is uninspired and it does wonders to take the mask off, the colors swirl together and create an unimpressive scheme in comparison especially to the other costume. Minor note but it still does damage since Cap is such one of the leaders of the team.

The Avengers is a film that I honestly did not expect to succeed on the level that it did, Whedon is a great director and as his work in Serenity showed he can work around a team. Marvel has raised the bar for escapist super heroes at the movies that will be difficult to match, however it does suffer from an almost non starter beginning and issues in the visuals. 8.5/10"
"Nov 11, 2013",positive,"outstanding movie, a pack of superhero"
"Nov 11, 2013",positive,This film will always have a special place in everyone's heart including mine. Josh Whedon's plan to bring the epic Marvel Universe together since 6 years has finally been fruitful. Hope that this never changes. Way to go Marvel...
"Nov 11, 2013",negative,Incredibly overrated TV fare.
"Nov 10, 2013",positive,"The Avengers brought together some of Marvels greatest heroes as well as one of their greatest villains. I thought that every one of the heroes got equal praise, even characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow. Loki was easily one of the best villains and could be compared to Heath Ledger's Joker. There was lots of unexpected humor and brought each character's strengths from all their individual films."
"Nov 10, 2013",positive,boring it lost my atention by 3/4 of the movies
"Nov 10, 2013",positive,MOST AWESOME MOVIE EVER!!!
"Nov 9, 2013",positive,"Is ""The Avengers"" the greatest superhero movie ever made? I think so. It's has amazing effects, a terrific action/adventure script full of humor and great performances from a dedicated cast of young professionals who have made this group of American icons their own. With repeated viewings, I've just liked it more and more. Great stuff!"
"Nov 9, 2013",positive,"It is, in many ways, the anti-Dark Knight: a large, loud, extremely silly blast-em-up superhero epic that doesn't search for deeper meaning and doesn't care. But sometimes, a story about guys hitting aliens is just what the doctor ordered. It may be completely pointless, but it taps into a primal need of humans: the need to have pure, uncomplicated fun every now and then. It is my pleasure to report that the Avengers delivers."
"Nov 9, 2013",positive,The best superhero movie.
"Nov 9, 2013",positive,"One of the best, worth watching multiple times."
"Nov 8, 2013",positive,"Well-done for the action genre. Kept attention entire movie. Nice variety of heroes with some character development and history, causing the viewer to care about the what happens to the characters. Not a deep-thinking movie, but fun. Form: +3; morals: +3."
"Nov 7, 2013",positive,Definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time!
"Nov 7, 2013",positive,Having all the comic book characters in one big blockbuster movie spell epic.
"Nov 7, 2013",positive,"Plot/Summary,Marvel Studios presents Marvel's The Avengers-the Super Hero team up of a lifetime, featuring iconic Marvel Super Heroes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. When an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins.
My Review
This is one of the greatest films of all time, and it's the best comic book movie of all time! Ever since the ending credits of Iron Man where you see Nick Fury talking about The Avengers,ever since you saw Tony Stark walk to General Ross saying that they were putting a team,ever since Iron Man 2 you saw Black Widow,Nick Fury,Agent Colsun,and seeing Thor's Hammer,ever since Thor you see Hawkeye,and Loki taking unlimited power,ever since Captain America,you see a small quick tease of The Avengers,we have been waiting for Earth's Mightest Heroes to assemble on the big screen and know that day has come. The Avengers were born. The Avengers revolves around a group of heroes Iron Man, Captain America,Hulk,Thor,Black Widow,Hawkeye who are all formed to stop Loki and his army. This one hell of a film a great one and all i can say is if you love the hulk see this movie Now! This truly is the best Hulk i've ever seen on film. Mark Ruffalo as Dr.Banner is amazing,Robert Downey Junior is as great as Iron Man as always,Chris Evans owns Captain America and i cannot stress this enough it's The Best Comic Book Movie of All Time!"
"Nov 6, 2013",positive,"I saw this without seeing any of the Iron Man movies (I had only seen Thor and Captain America) so I was a little lost on some of the character relationships and call backs to other movies.  Also, I found several parts to be boring.  At least there were some very funny, laugh out loud moments.  

Maybe I'll try it again at some point."
"Nov 6, 2013",positive,"It is an incredible film about a group of super-heroes with the fight against Asgard's God Loki, the with the Tesseract wants to open a portal to a different world and enjoy his army on the world of men. The super-heroes of the film are, Iron Man, the incredible hulk, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye. There are leader is Director fury, the super-hero's together.

I think the film super, there is so much going on to keep on the hard drive. The computer animation is excellent, you should not think that they did this in a highly developed computer. The fight scenes are exceptional.
The film also has some disadvantages. You can easily guess what would happen and that the Avengers want to win against Loki, it is very predictable. The film was also very expensive, it cost more than 255 million US-dollars."
"Nov 5, 2013",positive,"This is more like it - 'The Avengers' manages to lose the slow build up, the horrible love stories, and focus on what it does best - being ridiculous. It does help that they manage to throw in some capable villains (Tom Hiddleston was excellent.)"
"Nov 5, 2013",negative,Suspension of believe buffer overflow.
"Nov 5, 2013",positive,"Witty, philosophical, self-aware, funny and dynamic."
"Nov 3, 2013",positive,Mark makes for the best hulk!
"Nov 3, 2013",positive,"If the money it made nor these rating numbers don't convince you how fun this movie is then nothing I can write here will. If you refuse to watch it because it has 'superheros' and 'monsters', I would say your you need to open your horizons a bit more."
"Nov 3, 2013",positive,Really was almost perfect can't wait for the next one!!!!
"Nov 3, 2013",positive,off the chain enjoyed
"Nov 2, 2013",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers ends Phase 1 with a bang. It is Marvel's best film to date with perfectly written characters, great cinematography, a great score, and great performances from all of the actors, but this all couldn't have been the same without director/writer Joss Whedon who absolutely nailed the entire film giving fans as non-fans alike a lot of excitement to take, as well as some great action-set pieces and very great character moments."
"Nov 2, 2013",positive,Really good I can't wait for the second and third one
"Nov 2, 2013",positive,This was an awesome superhero movie. You have a whole lot of superheroes kicking Loki's scrawny little ass over and over again. That's all I have to say
"Nov 2, 2013",positive,"For 4 years, Marvel had been leading up to this movie, and it definitely doesn't disappoint. The action is amazing, the main characters have great chemistry, and where many other directors would fail, Joss Whedon makes it so each character has important things to do in the movie. My only complaint is that Hawkeye does not get alot of screentime, but that is only a minor complaint considering how big this film universe is, and hopefully soon we'll be able to see more of him on screen"
"Nov 2, 2013",positive,"A truly mind blowing experience. Speaking as a true fan of the genre and somebody whose been following these character both on the screen and in the comics, this film was everything I could have asked for. Not only is Marvel's The Avengers a dream come true for any true Marvel Comics fan, but even both casual fans and regular movie goers won't be able to resist the exhilaration and grandness that is Marvel's The Avengers."
"Nov 1, 2013",positive,"Muito infantil, muito besta, vai virar clássico da sessão da tarde."
"Oct 31, 2013",positive,"As much as I loved Avengers, it pains me to see that Whedon opted for a popcorn flick over what could've been a revolutionary film in the superhero genre. The cast has perfect chemistry with each other, and while I understand that Whedon couldn't have known this, I still feel like there was too much comedy in this film."
"Oct 31, 2013",positive,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!, it is loaded with really incredible action, and there is also several funny moments as well, most of which came from iron man, RDJ is so cool lol"
"Oct 31, 2013",positive,great movie...more hulk!
"Oct 31, 2013",positive,"Great movie , loved every character , they did a really good job on the acting part"
"Oct 30, 2013",positive,"If this isn't an epic superhero movie, then I don't know what is! The groundbreaking special effects, fantastic and yet slightly unexpected story-line, and of course, the superb acting from everyone involved made this film the ground-breaker that it was! Robert Downey Jr brings his loved portrayal of Tony Stark, the ''genius, billionaire, play-boy, philanthropist'' into the mix which creates some beautiful chemistry. Downey Jr takes the beloved Iron Man down emotional paths we have never seen before which creates an interesting scenario to view. Chris Evans returns as the first Avenger with his shield at the ready with some wonderful dialogue and leadership which seeps through Evan's performance. Chris Hemsworth makes a comeback as the mighty Thor who we see strutting his stuff in his usual fashion. We also see some wonderful chemistry between him and other members of the cast such as Robert Downey, Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg. Mark Rufallo's first outing as Dr Bruce Banner AKA the Hulk is an absolute gem, Rufallo takes the character to levels we have never seen before, surpassing that of Eric Bana and Edward Norton by a long shot. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal as the devious and loveable Loki makes for the type of villain we love to see in a movie: He loves doing what he does! The chilling enjoyment and enthusiasm for his work makes Loki a tricky and intriguing villain, he has certainly evolved since we saw him in Thor (2011). Other charming and dominating performances include: Samuel L Jackson as the Nick Fury (Leader of S.H.I.E.L.D), whose past is a thought provoking mystery. Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson who we learn is the ultimate good-guy who isn't afraid to fire very large laser powered weapons! Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff. Johansson's performance as the talented and stategic Black Widow is certainly a highlight. Jeremy Renner also stands out as Hawkeye ( The Legolas of the Avenger's), we see him at the height of his abilities giving everything he has to save New York. Renner portrays Barton well and I only see potential for a more elaborated Hawkeye with more past to play with, especially seeing as his relationship with Natasha Romanoff is such an intriguing one. The film depicts some epic, next-to-real visual effects. A huge highlight of which is the Hulk, in The Avenger's we see him looking better (and more realistic) than ever. The look of the Chitauri army should also be commended as from a design point of view, these alien creatures look spectacular!

Overall, a hugely enjoyable movie that should be seen by anyone who enjoys movies! This thrill ride of superb acting, perfect visual effects and a design that can hardly be matched will stay with people for a long time. All I can say is, bring on the sequel: Avengers: Age of Ultron!"

Overrated, shallow, boring, pew pew pew, kabloom.  These are words that describe Joss Whedon's (God of the Nerds) Avengers.  What really impressed me was how this film rips off Transformers 3 and gets a 94%!  Now, I'm not saying TF3 deserves a 94%, but it is pretty much a double standard.  I would say that Man of Steel is the same thing, but that film was pretentious.  Anyways, this film holds no significance to anything.  It's really a waste of time.  

There are many unanswered questions, such as ""How was Hulk able to control his power?"" and ""Why did all the aliens just die suddenly when their ship exploded?""  Listen, you may say that you enjoyed it as dumb fun, but if you say this ""WAS THE BEST FILM EVAR!!!! LOLOLOLOL""  I seriously think you are retarded.  Even the ""answered"" questions, such as ""How Thor got to Earth?"". were glossed over really quickly.  No, seriously, they only mention that in one line.  There are many gaping plot holes, such as ""What did Loki accomplish by getting captured?"".  The film is just here to show some 'splosions and a little pew, pew!  The script has to have been written in 10 minutes cause this was embarrassing.  

Well, after the events of Cpt. America, all the heroes unite to fight Loki and his incredibly ""fool-proof"" plan to enslave mankind.  The film is PG-13, but it could've slipped away with a PG, seeing how only one person dies (besides the aliens), but he comes back on Marvel's show.  Seriously, at least Transformers 3 and Man of Steel, weren't afraid of deaths, but no, no one can die.  That may be a nitpick, but it really pisses me off.  Also, the actions scenes were all just ""BOOM!!! BOOM!!! KABLOOM!!! BOW!!! PEW!!!! PEW!!!"" and there was too many jump-cuts, I couldn't even tell what was going on.  

The acting was okay, I guess.  Robert Downey Jr. still plays Robert Downey Jr., so if you liked him in the previous Iron Man films, you'll like him here.  Scarlett Johanson is terribly miscast as Black Widow, again.  She has no charm or charisma, and at the end of the day, she just has some nice tits.  Chris Hemsworth as Thor is alright.  All he really does is speak in Shakespearean language and flexes his muscles.  Chris Evans, who I despise as an actor, is terrible as the Cap.  He is wooden and very cheesy and campy.  Samuel L. Jackson is probably the best part of this film, as he is often hilarious (think Django Unchained).  Jeremy Renner, who I believe is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood (The Hurt Locker sucked though), is practically given nothing, and he just stands around shooting arrows.  Mark Ruffalo, another underrated actor, is an okay Hulk, but he isn't given any good substance.

 But after 2 1/2 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions, ""witty"" banter, and generic story-telling. I was happy the movie ended, all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw. My plan was just to go home and put on a real movie. With plot twists and character development, both things I missed in the avengers. You could say it's fast paced but if the story doesn't grab you by the balls, it's all irrelevant. The only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious, to bad it were the scenes that didn't mean to be.  I knew after five minutes that the movie wasn't going to live up to the hype. And it was only downhill from there to be honest. The last sequence was the worst in my book. The alien invasion was so stupid, we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole. And what came to wipe out all of humanity? A few hundred alien beings, wow... is that an invasion? Six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them. That was a huge anti-climax!

And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.

John Tyler, you can go fuck yourself for thinking this film is much better than Spider-Man 2, which had a story and character development, rather than BOOM! PEW PEW!"
"Oct 22, 2013",positive,This is the movie that made the super hero team happen. Outstanding job!
"Oct 22, 2013",negative,Absolutely terrible. Only redeeming factors were Loki and Scarlett Johansson. The plot was way beyond predictable.
"Oct 21, 2013",positive,One of the best super hero movies ever.  Fulfills the dream watching Super heroes matched up against eachother until they unite and become a super force.
"Oct 20, 2013",positive,Must see again movie
"Oct 19, 2013",negative,Maybe it was the hot shower and glass of sangria ....zzzzzzzzz.
"Oct 19, 2013",positive,"One of the best superhero films of all time that manages to meet our expectations and make it worth the wait. This is the film that we had been waiting for years and provides exhilarating action, impressive performances, a wonderful story and dazzling visuals. With the overwhelming success of this film, expect a Justice League film to be finally made anytime soon."
"Oct 18, 2013",negative,"I appreciate I'm in the minority, but I found this underwhelming to say the least.  The 'heroes' spent the first hour trading playground insults while absolutely nothing happens.  Things brighten up in the second half when they finally get round to bashing the bad guys, but there is zero plot, zero suspense and zero brain cells required.  OK if you like watching things exploding, and an extra star for a few comic moments."

"Oct 12, 2013",positive,Was a very heart warming film for all those superhero fans out there
"Oct 12, 2013",positive,"As a Marvel fan for years, it was truly exciting to watch a movie totally dedicated to Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The film itself was a hit from beginning to end. Though the pacing dragged a bit in some scenes, the overall duration of the movie was satisfying for a true comic-book fan. The witty dialogue is a contributing factor to the film's success. Though Hawkeye wasn't portrayed with true character, the rest of the cast delivered an intense film."
"Oct 12, 2013",positive,"Funny, and very entertaining."
"Oct 11, 2013",positive,A Perfect Comic book come to life.
"Oct 11, 2013",positive,Great action scenes. The storyline is awesome. Cant wait to see part 2.
"Oct 10, 2013",positive,"Every single thing about this movie is either epic or the work of a genius! I saw this three times in theatres and NEVER grew tired of it! It had me cheering, laughing and on my toes the whole time! I'm not a ginormous fan of Marvel, but I can already tell, this is their BEST FILM YET!"
"Oct 9, 2013",positive,Awesome movie amazing cast and just all I can say is wow
"Oct 8, 2013",negative,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but have to say that it disappointed me. I felt that I had seen it all before, and overall was uninspired. The highest grossing film of 2012. D"
"Oct 8, 2013",negative,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but have to say that it disappointed me. I felt that I had seen it all before, and overall I was uninspired."
"Oct 8, 2013",positive,"Marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and after the success of this film, it seems to be getting much bigger and more ambitious. Before making The Avengers, the studio decided to have a couple of films dedicated to each main character, and in a way filled the world that would then be the setting of The Avengers. Honestly, I don't think this film would be as successful if it wasn't for those films. So as years and films gone by, the hype for The Avengers kept growing larger and larger as we have never seen a film so ambitious in its cast and its concept. In 2008, when Iron Man came out, we never thought that this would be possible, now here it is. Does Joss Whedon's take on The Avengers, do it justice. My answer is yes, but not to a point of high praise.

The Avengers was written by Joss Whedon, who is commonly known as the show-runner of some of the best TV series of this generation. He is an experienced writer, but when it came to films, he has very little to brag about. Whedon's work has always been known to be ambitious and in a way quirky, especially in dialogue. What Whedon has created for this film is actually quite simple in its plot. It touches on themes that have been explored on many films before, and is a common aspect in comic books. These themes include teamwork, ego, good vs evil, responsibility, and war. I didn't mind Whedon in applying these themes to this film because they are universally relatable and it allows the film's plot to be simplistic. My biggest concern in his writing is the characters. I think Whedon was happy to have the opportunity to work on multiple different characters, and he knows that he could express each one with their own individual personality, allowing the characters to feel unique and at the start, be un-cohesive with each other. But Whedon has forgotten to give any character a sense of depth beyond their dialogue, as he just wanted things go quickly as they could to the parts that have us jumping in excitement. I understand that the individual Marvel films are the one that showcases this multi-layered character study that I was looking for, but that doesn't mean that The Avengers should lack it almost completely. I don't care if the film spends more time on these characters and letting the film run at 3 hours because it would have allowed me to appreciate more than just the surface of these characters. Whedon sometimes make their personalities and intentions too obvious, which takes me aback as it doesn't feel at all natural. It is almost as if he was too afraid that we might not entirely get it. Though there was potential in characters like Maria Hill, Phil Coulson and Natasha Romanoff, but very brief. Whedon's dialogue on the other hand was fun to listen to, as the back and forth between members of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film. Through dialogue, Whedon has shown us just how different these characters are and how each one thinks they are above one another.

Joss Whedon is also the director for this film, he also doesn't have a lot of directed films in his name as he seems to be more pre-occupied with his work on TV. The success of The Avengers did open doors for him and allowed him to create films with more creative control, like with his next film Much Ado about Nothing. I could see a bit of artistic license in The Avengers, but at the same time, I felt it was a bit too tame. I am not sure whether this was a result of the studio or it was the intention of the director in order for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience. It would have been nice if we actually see some civilians die during the fight in New York, so at the end we can really feel that the event was a huge travesty to our kind and that we have hope it won't happen again. Whedon has created something very ambitious, containing a number of characters and yet still give enough screen time for each one. The area where Whedon has impressed me is the last hour and a half of the film. This is where the action comes in, supported with big sequences that are memorable and exciting. Whedon has given the last fight a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be better than what anybody else could have thought of, which I personally agree. The film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesn't come off as fake or lacking in texture because the budget and time that was given to him allowed the film to be polished, ergo having the audience be immersed in the experience. My main issue was the first hour of the film, as it felt very rushed. It contained fast editing cuts that made things feel off. I think Whedon trimmed a hefty amount in order to move the plot along, and I think that was a bad decision as more time with these characters at the start would have allowed the audience to identify with them easier. Overall, I think Whedon did a good job in creating a film that contained so many beloved characters and still make a decent movie out of it. It's a tough job, and maybe it could have been a different experience if someone else helmed the project, but nevertheless it was good enough.

The film's director of photography is Seamus McGarvey. What McGarvey and Whedon have done with the film's cinematography is disappointing as the film contained many shots that felt unnecessary. There were many moments earlier in the film where I ask myself, âWhy did they use that angle?â? or âwhat was the point of it?â? I felt that some shots were too concerned in what would be filled in it rather than what it could do for the actor's performance or its connection/relevance to the film's plot or themes. It is during the moments that contained action sequences is where the film's photography shines, as the irritating approach they applied for the slow and earlier parts of the film would actually work in this situation. I assume a lot of the film is shot with a green screen but it never proves to be as obvious or distracting, like in Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. The film also uses a more handheld approach for most of the scenes, assumingly using a Steadicam. I was really hoping for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to its cinematography, but sadly that wasn't the case.

The film's score was handled by Alan Silvestri, who is mostly known as a collaborator with Robert Zemeckis. Silvestri's work here is astounding. The film's score is so grand and memorable that it becomes the first thing I think about when I recall back to this film. Yes it does follow the many trademarks and styles in mainstream action films, but this is an example of one that is excellently crafted. The film's theme track is the highlight of the score as it just hits the right notes and when it comes it feels so epic that you can't help but get goose bumps when it comes on.

The Avengers contains a wide cast and overall I felt that they did quite well with their roles. It is already established from their previous films that they have already given these legendary characters justice. The stand out performances mainly came from Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg and Cobie Smulders. The rest were good but their roles, I felt were underdeveloped therefore the actors were limited with what they can do with it.

In the end, I thought this film was a bit of a letdown but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a disaster. It's something that I would definitely watch again just for its amazing action sequences and to hear the chilling score, but that's really about it."
"Oct 6, 2013",positive,"Don't get me wrong, I loved this film. I've seen this film about 7 times.
But I felt like all the characters were quickly thrown into their own films so that they could make Avnegers."
"Oct 6, 2013",positive,"One of my favorite superhero movies of all time. It has awesome actions, great characters and acting, stunning cinematography and effects, and an awesome story"
"Oct 6, 2013",positive,Candy for your inner man-child. I still can't believe they pulled it off.
"Oct 5, 2013",positive,Director Joss Whedon finds a way to reunite an all star cast and make a comic book adaptation classic. Awesome action and acting to make it a top movie of the year.
"Oct 5, 2013",positive,Heck Everybody likes it even me
"Oct 5, 2013",positive,"Finally the Avengers are assembled and does it pay off? To put it lightly yes,yes it does.  It has tons of mind blowing action that never leaves out any of the heroes."
"Oct 4, 2013",positive,It was a f****** awesome movie but what happened with the Hulk you can't change the character like that but otherwise it was pretty cool. Fighting scenes are pretty awesome. I like the final battle.
"Oct 1, 2013",positive,"Cool movie, it got so much hype before it came out I kinda expected more. But still enjoyed watching it. Thought Dark Knight Rises was better by far."
"Sep 30, 2013",positive,"The quirky, wild fun of the Marvel comic books adapted purely and prominently into film. It's a well-structured and eye-catching affair that's hard not to enjoy."

"Sep 28, 2013",positive,"Good mindless entertainment, A year after seeing it I can't remember a single thing about it."
"Sep 28, 2013",positive,"A lot better than I would have imagined.  Not being familiar with any of the films from which the characters are drawn (and barely familiar with the comic series'), I had only the story presented in this film to go on. The direction appeared to be spot-on as many of the camera-angles were great. The cgi was good, but the action was a little to drawn out of for me despite some awesome fight scenes. Worth a watch even for those non-blockbuster film fans such as myself."
"Sep 27, 2013",positive,"Great action scenes and soundtrack, but for me, there was too much dialogue ( probably just my preference). The action scenes were well made, but lacked a certain quality to it, I wanted a more intense fighting sequence - the film in general is excellently produced, but my preferences get in the way of this. If this wasn't actiony enough for me, and although the atmosphere of the film is perfect , it made the film a little boring. Excellent cast and performance."

"Sep 25, 2013",positive,the best marvel movie
"Sep 25, 2013",positive,"Generally good.  Liked that there were so many superheros in this movie, but all fighting just one bad guy?  Turns out Loki has an army.  Iron Man had some great memorable lines.  Loki had a great scene in the beginning and then later with Thor and Iron Man.  Hawkeye and Black Widow's conversation after he came to his senses was really good.  The last battle scene was too much mindless action for me that went on too long.  The dialogue between the characters was much better.  Thor and Loki's relationship was very interesting as well."

"Sep 23, 2013",positive,"While the first 35 minutes are boring, and the Tesseract is never fully explained properly, this movie is a ton of fun and is definitely one to see. I don't think they did the villain justice, and there wasn't enough character development, the CGI is fantastic and it's really enjoyable to watch. I would recommend it."

"Sep 19, 2013",positive,"for some reason I did not like this film, I can see why people liked it. however I think It still was predictable. For example when the avengers fought between each other I always thought they would end up as friends, also Loki was an awfull villain, I mean he is enterteining, tom does a good job, however the moment he is smashed by hulk he just becomes a comical relief, and no longer a threatening villain Unlike obidia or the joker. the action was fun but it didnt feel intense, also the climatic final battle felt too much like independence day SPOILERS in both movies the aliens are defeated by an atom bomb and a few other similarities. hawkeye and black widow in the final battle, are you kidding me, I just never beliebed that, I mean Iron man has a suit, Thor is a God, Captain america and Hulk have powers, but hawkeye and the widowm come on that was way too stupid, I never bought that, also when Loki gets captured i instantly thpught he got himself captured on porpouse. However the movie had a really awsome moment, that is when Coulson died, i never expected that, and also when Nick fury makes the avengers unite was awsome, however the final battle was comical and fun instead of dramatic as those previous scenes where, making it have a dull pace. I cann see why people like it, it has drama, action, good characters and actors, not so many cliches, but for one reson i always saw miself one step ahead of the movie, the movie never caught me, I saw it as it was. a predictable not so fun action blockbuster. with not that much tension."

"Sep 17, 2013",negative,"Horrible movie.  Really, really horrible.  Bad story line, bad acting, bad casting.  Totally unrealistic.  Its like all they wanted to do was spend the entire movie smashing things up. I was shocked at how bad this movie was.  And I loved Iron Man and Captain America.  The only positive about the movie was Loki.  He makes a really good bad guy."

"Sep 14, 2013",positive,"This is it...the end all be all of superhero movies, or so I've been told.  Usually throwing a bunch of superstars together in the same movie is a recipe for disaster but this one actually holds its own.  Character and actor continuity is key with all sequels and it's fun seeing all of the characters/actors together after being showcased in their own individual stories.  The script is fun and light and doesn't get bogged down in mythology.  Pretty solid overall."

It's too bad that they're still making more of them."
"Sep 6, 2013",positive,"A thrilling roller coaster of a film that never lets down on action and has some great CGI, but is lacking in plot. Better than I expected, much due to the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson, but still a bit too much whizz bang for my taste."
"Sep 6, 2013",positive,"One line summary: Lots of action in the Marvel universe.

-------------------------

    Loki travels to Earth with the help of aliens who intend to invade.  Loki steals the Tesseract in order to open a portal from the invaders' location to Earth.  While doing this, he instills a large amount of tension among certain SHIELD operatives.

    The SHIELD project 'Avengers' gets started to counter Loki's activity.  By the time the Avengers (Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America) get done dealing with each others' egos, Loki has opened the portal.

    When the invaders flow through to Earth, the Avengers and the SHIELD flagship are already bruised and battered.  Will the Avengers save Earth?

"Sep 4, 2013",positive,"This movie fully exploits the moviegoers anticipation to see characters that have appeared in their own solo movies in the same Universe join forces for possibly the best action movie in recent memory.This movie kinda is very slow and kinda boring in its first 30 minutes and the alien robots are quite generic but most fanboys and fangirls really won't mind because their just getting wet  from seeing their favorite superhero's kick ass. Marvel's the Avenger's is THE greatest superhero movie when comes too action and it lives up to the hype that was made from all the ""easter eggs"" that have happened since the first Iron Man."
"Sep 3, 2013",negative,"Continuing the latest generic Marvel movie trend. 'The Avengers' shows no signs of deviating from the 'Daredevil' of all action fodder. It doesn't take any risks instead plays the family friendly budding superheroes card. Laced with insufferable cliché's it begs the question, ""Have I seen this before?"" even if you haven't, it feels like you have. A testament to what Marvel has always been; mediocre."

"Sep 2, 2013",negative,the movie has received many glowing reviews but I fail to see the overall entertainment value. there is almost no plot and there are many inconsistencies such as Bruce magically appearing to save the wimps of marvel from a small scale invasion. the new hulk looks stupid compared to the incredible hulk film. there is only 1 fight scene that isn't amongst the team members and it is conveniently ended with a nuke in a wormhole. there is a little comedy but it wouldn't make it anymore watchable is ur had more.
"Sep 2, 2013",positive,"Despite the recasting of Bruce Banner, which normally really bugs me, I actually LOVED this movie. I love Marvel movies, and was pleasantly surprised how well Whedon weaved the many storylines so seamlessly together. There's no shortage of action, or handsome men in this one. It's a must see."
"Sep 2, 2013",positive,The Avengers is no doubt one of the greatest if not the best superhero movie ever
"Sep 2, 2013",positive,Pretty much the same as Iron Man 1 & 2. Quality entertainment with a great cast.
"Sep 1, 2013",positive,"This superhero film is a little pop style, but is totally entertaining, smart and is well done."
"Sep 1, 2013",positive,This movie was just epic I really liked so did my two brothers
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,Live action avengers was what we wanted and we weren't disappointed. Great story and awesome special effects. Deserving of your undivided attention.
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,"Several very decent individual Avenger movies culminate beautifully in Joss Whedon's The Avengers. It comes together so perfectly. Nicely paced, fun characters, dramatic yet fun. My only complaint about this film, and it's a very small complaint, is the Acura product placement. It's one thing to issue Shield agents company Acuras - that acceptable. But when Capt USA, Black Widow and Hawkeye run out of a freshly crashed plane into a war zone - right past an undamaged Acura SUV that takes up half the shot, that's taking it a bit far. http://talkiegazette.com/the-avengers-2012-superhero-perfection/"
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,"Can you say ""best superhero movie ever made""? Action, emotion, and some seriously funny moments make this one, as many critics have put it, not just an awesome superhero film - it's an awesome film, period."
"Aug 31, 2013",neutral,"Am I the only one who felt this movie was empty? Hawkeye and Widow were underused and the mindless, effortless destruction of countless aliens was just dull. I mean if you've seen all the films, then you've seen lots of explosions and flying and after four individual franchises it becomes monotonous. There wasn't even any strategy to defeating Loki, they just wandered into the city and killed lots of monsters. Then Loki gets beaten up and Iron Man almost dies."
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,"Witty and high action, with flawless comedy!"
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,Whedon makes the film work so well and makes the movie unbelievably fun.
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,it was just a delight to the eyes
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,"Second best super hero movie ever made, behind only Batman Rises in my opinion."
"Aug 31, 2013",positive,a movie well waiting for!  it was great to see what marvel had in the makings for so many years.
"Aug 30, 2013",positive,"The Avengers surprisingly transitions one of Marvel's most famous comic series into one of the best blockbuster superhero films of all time, boasting an ensemble cast of Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson, excellent use of CGI, adrenaline rushing action sequences, and appeal to old and newer viewers by balancing source material with cinematic pleasure."
"Aug 30, 2013",positive,I revolves around and relies solely on the action sequences and it never fails to deliver everything we wanted and more.
"Aug 30, 2013",positive,"After Loki steals the infinitely powerful Tesseract from Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. puts together the group that he's had in the works for years Gathering Iron Man, The Hulk,
Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye
and Black Widow, the team of
""Lost Creatures"" takes on Loki and
his army to save the world.

Plot of ""The Avengers"" contains lots of action and lots of use of special effects/CGI to make it hugely entertaining. Director Joss Whedon made this thrill ride without any major flaws. Story written by Zak Penn is good, perfect story for this kind of film. The pace of the film is accelerated by many thrilling scenes.  Cinematography is absolutely brilliant. Dialogues are good especially funny one liners delivered by Robert Downey jr. Editing is sharp, every scene is perfect.  Also, Film is very good in character development department. 

The performances in ""The avengers"" are excellent. Robert downey Jr as Iron man is charming. Chris Evans plays the role of Captain America sensibly. Mark Ruffalo as hulf does very good, his character in final battle is absolutely brilliant. After watching this film, I added Tom Hiddleston in my favorite villains list. He is awesome as menacing Loki. Also , Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth are brilliant in their roles. 

Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an absolutely brilliant film packed with mindblowing action. A perfect summer blockbuster."
"Aug 29, 2013",positive,Though Im A DC Fan More I Was Excited To See It And This Is The Avengers Film That All Could Imagine Joss Whedon Has Created It Wonderfully Im Hoping That The Sequel Will Be Just As Good If Not Better
"Aug 29, 2013",positive,"It's a very action-packed, & fun movie.  Story? Not really.  It was REALLY predictable.  But you know what?  That's ok.  I enjoyed seeing these characters on screen.  I enjoyed watching the Avengers come to life.  If I had any complaints, it would be about the under-usage of Hawkeye, Thor trying to kill Captain America for no reason, and Banner's contrivance of control over the Hulk.  Even with that, Joss Whedon was the perfect guy to bring this to fruition.  I cannot wait to see if, they do this better the second time around."
"Aug 29, 2013",positive,"The most surprising aspect of this film for me was the writing.  Yes, the script itself.  The humor and the dialogue.  It made it seem like before they could have a chance to do anything as a team, they would first have to bicker as all humans (superhumans, gods, mutants) do.  Larger than life and yet, at times so relatable.  I would like to see more of Bruce Banner and Tony Stark sharing scenes in the future just because of their individual genius and shared interests.   I think that was really rewarding to see, and hear."
"Aug 29, 2013",positive,Very good wrap up for Marvel's Phase One.
"Aug 28, 2013",positive,"Best one ever from marvel I really  enjoyed,I can see it as many times & never get tired of it can't wait to see the second one,+ hulk he is the man."
"Aug 28, 2013",positive,As much as I love this film it just had something missing don't get me wrong I'd watch avengers every night if I felt like it anyway the characters are spot on how they are in the comics Captain America is the leader iron man is comic relief etc everything was great but it felt just satisfying not spectacular sorry
"Aug 28, 2013",positive,I can never resist a superhero movie so I loved this
"Aug 27, 2013",positive,It's fun. 4 stars bc I was expecting a mess. Unprepared for ensemble film that was so good at balancing the cast.
"Aug 27, 2013",positive,"Really good movie, but the Hulk was the icing in the cake."
"Aug 26, 2013",positive,This movie was awesome cant wait for the sequel
"Aug 25, 2013",positive,"Very few summer blockbuster movies ever live up to the hype that's built ridiculously high for them.  However, Marvel's The Avengers is one MAJOR exception.  Packed with heroes, action, heart and wit, this supercharged epic ranks with films such as The Dark Knight, Spiderman 2 and Iron Man, films that have raised the standard for heroes in capes and masks on the big screen."
"Aug 25, 2013",positive,Best Marvel movie to date absolutely magnificent
"Aug 25, 2013",positive,Amazing action and had loads of superheroes I'm it so obviously it was good
"Aug 24, 2013",positive,"Had it all. Violence, funny and comics. No complaints here"
"Aug 24, 2013",positive,ONE OF THE HERO GREATEST MOVIE EVER SINCE IRONMAN. MUST WATCH AND OWN IT.
"Aug 24, 2013",positive,"A geeky, nerdy, orgasmic dream! So much fun! Great performances from Downey Jr., Ruffalo, Hiddleston, and Hemsworth with great writing and direction from Whedon. The only thing that brings it down a bit is Evan's Captain America, who looks absolutely ridiculous, and Renner's Hawkeye, who adds very little. Also, the characters with no powers here are able to do the unbelievable with no explanation at all. It's a distraction for me. But I absolutely love this movie and watch it regularly. Fan-fucking-tastic!"
"Aug 23, 2013",positive,"This was such an inspiring Super Hero film. At this point films like this are played out, and as of late they are being dragged out for hours and hours. But this was one very good. It was brilliant how they came together and saved the city of New York (which always needs saving). Worth seeing though."
"Aug 23, 2013",positive,"Phenomenal movie! Humor, great acting, stunning visuals, and lots of great action. What's not to love?"
"Aug 23, 2013",positive,"This was some good stuff, Joss Whedon.
I was hooked from beginning to end.
I can't wait for more."
"Aug 22, 2013",positive,Love this movie. So funny & action packed.
"Aug 22, 2013",positive,Perfect action movie! Nuff said.
"Aug 21, 2013",positive,"Excellent, best movie of the year"
"Aug 21, 2013",positive,Great film. So entertaining. I look forward to Joss Whedon doing more marvel.
"Aug 20, 2013",neutral,"Lots of explosions which I grow weary of, but it was also plenty of fun. Lots of movies packed into one, sort of like expendables."
"Aug 20, 2013",positive,"Cool movie! It was a long time coming, and it payed off! Super overrated in my opinion though."
"Aug 19, 2013",negative,"Given the other relatively good movies leading up to Avengers, I found this 'flick' to overly strong on outlandish action and extremely weak on plot. If I wish to be overwhelmed by giant flying aircraft carriers again, I'll just watch Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, as it had a much more interesting plot and good, three-dimensional, characters. If Whedon's goal was to turn a two dimensional comic book into a two dimensional movie, then he succeeded. If your looking for any depth though, your definitely going to need your 3D glasses."
"Aug 19, 2013",positive,Good movie I enjoyed and purchased
"Aug 19, 2013",positive,"The pinnacle of the comic book movie, 'The Avengers' holds a special place in my heart for being hands down the best experience I've had at the cinema. When you are in a crowded screen full of people with tremendously high expectations, and each and every one of them is crying with laughter, cheering with excitement, totally engaged, thrilled and engrossed in the spectacle as their expectations receive a Hulk Smash, you know you have a winner. Its characters are many and each perfect with their chemistry, portrayal and heroics. The direction is impeccable. The story (while totally simple) works tremendously well to bolster its characters and make it a film made souly for the fans. Marvel's 5 year experiment paid off: The Avengers is, in a word, marvelous."
"Aug 19, 2013",positive,Best movie of all time
"Aug 19, 2013",positive,"I absolutely loved this. 
Iron Man: What are we dealing with? Shakespeare in the Park?

Hulk (holding Loki in hand): Puny God."
"Aug 18, 2013",positive,All my favourite marvel characters in one place. Yes yes yes anyone who think this film sucks needs to go to hell.
"Aug 18, 2013",positive,"The Avengers was a pretty good film. I definitely enjoy the superhero stuff (but, that's literally what the film is, so Marvel would obviously excel at that) and the banter and human aspects between each character make this feel real."
"Aug 18, 2013",positive,Not much depth to it but very enjoyable. A must see!
"Aug 18, 2013",positive,Marvels the Avenger's just the best superhero movie of all time a movie I've been waiting my whole life to watch there's absolutely nothing bad I can say about it it gots action and great super hero moments.
"Aug 17, 2013",positive,I loved this movie..... This is a must see!!! The hulk was of the chain!
"Aug 17, 2013",positive,Absolutely an AWESOME movie!!! ð???ð???ð???
"Aug 17, 2013",positive,Doesn't get better as far as superhero movies go
"Aug 17, 2013",positive,"I really like this movie! I thought the cast was awesome and the acting was great! Ive always loved all the Avengers personalities. The premise was great and Loki was just as awesome as he was in Thor. The effects were out of the park. Also, the scenes were excuted nicely and the violence ran at the right time. They had great humor and everything was awesome and just unbelievable, It may not be a movie you want to watch 4-5 times but it definitely deserves five stars!"
"Aug 17, 2013",positive,"Visually spectacular and altogether entertaining, but poorly scripted and entirely too predictable."
"Aug 16, 2013",positive,Can't wait for the next!
"Aug 15, 2013",positive,"I love Marvel, and I love superheroes, but some superheroes, just aren't great in the lime light. To me, this was a needed movie for the superhero world, its a great comic, and a respected group. But to me, it wasn't the best film. It was critically glorified, yet I don't see all the fuss. If you are going to keep all the characters from their individual superhero movies the same, why did you bring in Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk when you either choose Eric Bana, or Edward Norton the original two. It was a fun movie and a good plot but little things like the hulk cast change, and the villain of Loki were just ridiculous to me. That said it was fun and a summer blockbuster. I gave it a 3.5/5 because it was a better superhero movie than some recent ones"
"Aug 15, 2013",neutral,"A well-made and entertaining film, but I left the theater feeling empty and unaffected. Definitely doesn't live up to the hype."
"Aug 13, 2013",positive,Best super hero movie yet
"Aug 13, 2013",positive,I will just always love feel-good team banter combined with epic explodey action.
"Aug 13, 2013",negative,"This movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula. Superheros need super problems to solve, so that they can shine. Each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to his/her individual super powers. They only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team. But suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread, as you can guess, and only towards the end begin to rely on one and other. For me I am disapointed in Studios need to over load special effects and place a storyline on the back burner. There's more animation then actors doing stunts. And seriously an Australian as Thor? FYI Thor is Norwegian. Just saying..."
"Aug 13, 2013",positive,The Best Super Hero Film Ever Made
"Aug 12, 2013",positive,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is the most fun I have ever had or probably will have in a movie theater.
"Aug 12, 2013",positive,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!
"Aug 12, 2013",positive,If your super hero fan you will love this movie.
"Aug 11, 2013",negative,"Eye-candy, and nothing more. The problem with marvel characters, is that they have no substance. This is another example where they tell the audience ""forget character development and story, focus on the effects"". This was overladen with special effects to the point where I was getting dizzy from watching.I mean seriously, a FLYING AIRCRAFT CARRIER??? 

Marvel seems to be launching an assault via movies these days as they have launched ""phase two"". How more manufactured can you get?"
"Aug 11, 2013",positive,It was long but it was awesome
"Aug 11, 2013",positive,robert downey jnr owned these movie my eye was on him the whole time i think it is a brillant movie showing what i think is a showing that iron man is best avenger
"Aug 11, 2013",positive,"Coming from a die hard Marvel fan its a pretty bad movie considering how much hype it got, it was just boring hawkeye was evil most the movie and the fact the hulk has no control, until the final battle is just plain stupid, I hope the second will be way better also why fear the alien invaders? All they did was blow up some cars and buildings. They are going to rule the world by wiping out humanity but when they have an opportunity to kill at least 50 they take hostages...WHAT THE FFFUU..and still the Dark Knight powers on as the best superhero movie and once again this is from a Marvel fan"
"Aug 10, 2013",positive,"The avengers is an amazing movie.
Funny, action packed, filled with an amazing cast. Robert Downey jr steals the show. Can't wait for the next movie!!"
"Aug 10, 2013",positive,I don't even really like superhero movies but The Avengers is pretty awesome. The actors all seem to genuinely enjoy working on the project and it shows in their acting. There are great comedy lines and the action is great and not overwhelming.
"Aug 10, 2013",positive,"The Best Superhero Movie, so far!  It has done something no other Superhero movie has done before!  It explained the orgins of each hero (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger) before releasing the movie about the Ultimate Superhero team-up!  That is what's so great and terrific about this film! 
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!!!"
"Aug 10, 2013",positive,Action packed star to finish
"Aug 10, 2013",positive,we need more HULK!!!
"Aug 9, 2013",positive,"Whedon has taken something that (at first) sounded laughable, and made something extraordinary out of it."
"Aug 9, 2013",positive,"great movie
lives up to its expectations. can't wait for the sequel"
"Aug 9, 2013",positive,"What I got to say about ""The Avengers"" is that it's a marvelous superhero movie that I have ever seen before. ""It's absolutely a action pack, thrilling, and moments in this movie that as great humor as well."" The performances by the hole cast is magnificent. ""Everyone is skillful to very high degree."" The directing by Joss Whedon and screenplay by Zak Penn is so spectacular. The cinematography is well done. The score in this movie I personally ""love this score so much!"" It give the movie more powerful energy that give the movie a perfect sound and even when the effects are going on ""It get even better."" ""I'm raving that ""The Avengers"" is the best action movie of all time. It's that good. This is a must see movie!"""
"Aug 9, 2013",positive,"A great movie with stunning visuals, sound and storyline making it a movie that any body will love."
"Aug 8, 2013",positive,"Although I admire most of the stars in this movie, especially Tom Hiddleston for his charming acting talents, but I must honestly say the story is the same old same old type.

"Aug 8, 2013",positive,"Although the sweeping arc of the Marvel line of superhero movies may be reaching it's inevitable nexus sooner rather than later (with the general public at least), Joss Whedon perfectly captures the most bad-ass aspects of the Marvel movies thus far and mashes them into a perfect PB&J sammich of dynamic battles (that utilize the same handi-cam techniques of Micheal Bay but don't overload the screen with useless clutter so you can actually SEE what's happening during the bevy of battles) and interpersonal conflicts between the team and main villain Loki (played to a gleefully perfect tee by new fan-favorite Tom Hiddleston). Of course, RDJ gets more than his fair share of awesome moments, but Sam Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evans shine nonetheless in roles that most actors would consider too corny to be cool (unfortunately Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johannson can't match the energy of the bigger powerhouses). However, this movie wouldn't be as insanely fun to watch if it wasn't for Whedon's biggest trump card - The Hulk. Ruffalo expertly renders Bruce Banner as a sympathetic d*&^-wad and the FX/CGI team ace the look of his green counterpart, finally bringing the Green Giant into the main continuity of the rest of the Marvel film canon as a HUGE BAD-ASS. 5/5 Nuff said."
"Aug 8, 2013",positive,"The greatest superhero film ever. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show, and Ruffalo, Hemsworth and Evans are all brilliant. The script is great and the final battle is awesome. The charcter of Nick Fury needed to be developed further and also all we ever knew about the alien army was that it was an alien army."
"Aug 8, 2013",positive,"great movie, hopefully 2nd movie can be better"
"Aug 7, 2013",positive,A decent flick that was totally over hyped. It has a predictable story and I was just sitting waiting for action other than the secret of the Hulk and the relationship of hawkeye and black widow.
"Aug 7, 2013",positive,"This movie will never get old, even after watching it over 300 times, which I probably have..."
"Aug 7, 2013",positive,"Dark, epic, full of non stop action that blows your mind..... You never get bored with this movie !!!!!"
"Aug 7, 2013",positive,"Thor, Cap,Iron man,and The hulk in one movie Epic and who better to put these superheroes together than a fan of the genre"
"Aug 6, 2013",positive,best super hero movie ever
"Aug 5, 2013",positive,"Balances the characters with precision and gives us the Hulk we've all wanted. Fun, bombastic and almost perfect"
"Aug 5, 2013",positive,awesome movie keep up the good work for marvel. loved it :)
"Aug 4, 2013",positive,One of my favorite movies of all time! Funny and action packed its a must see!
"Aug 4, 2013",positive,"Good movie, doesn't fall victim to the cliches that can make so many other action / superhero Marvel flicks wither and die. Definitely worth watching - really well done, high production value, great special effects, and - most importantly of all - LOKI!!!"
"Aug 4, 2013",positive,"The best marvel film out there, I saw no dull moment in the film"
"Aug 3, 2013",positive,The Avengers is just a fun movie experience.
"Aug 3, 2013",positive,love this movie can't wait for part two
"Aug 3, 2013",neutral,"The avengers  its a high budget superheroe movie with nothing but a regular story, hollywood non-funny jokes, pure modern special effects. The characters were very well planned but The Avengers its a prove of the crap people call nowdays as a ""great movie"". 2.5/5"
"Aug 2, 2013",positive,"What is really moving in the movie is, that in the end of the tale, Tony Stark is more formal and warm, than when he is in a similar situation with Pepper Potts, as he offers Bruce Banner a seat next to the drivers, just before they take a spin in Tony's best car. Mark Ruffalo is the best Banner, there has been. I actually just felt that Scarlett Johansson was the child star of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I mean, the karate child sensation, who doesn't inherit the factory, because she stands out."
"Aug 2, 2013",positive,"Wow, just simply amazing. Can't wait for the sequel."
"Aug 1, 2013",positive,"One of the best super hero flicks that sets a high bar for others to follow. It’s amazing that each character gets their moment to shine and the team has great chemistry in pairs and as a whole. Also, it’s pretty funny."
"Aug 1, 2013",positive,"It's just a silly comicbook movie, in many ways that silliness works but in some ways it doesn't."
"Jul 31, 2013",positive,By far the best superhero group put together. lots of action from start to finish. all the actors came together and put an awesome movie together.
"Jul 31, 2013",negative,The hands down worst movie of all time. Awful acting cheesy plot. If you enjoy giant flying catepillars attacking NYC then you will like this but if you are like most people you would not enjoy that
"Jul 31, 2013",positive,"Great fun film, it was much better than I expected and tied all the different marvel characters together very well. It was very enjoyable, especially so if you are a fan of all the other marvel films."
"Jul 31, 2013",positive,Great Superhero film!
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"The best superhero film since Superman, there is never a dull moment, and no character is singled out or especially focused on."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"I really enjoyed this movie, it did a very good job at staying balanced between action and story. I plan on buying this movie, which is something I usually never do."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"While it doesn't disappoint in special effects and likable characters (almost TOO likable), and the script is fun and witty, The Avengers has trouble distinguishing itself from other superhero action romps. Only this time there are more. That doesn't mean it's better."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America in one movie! PERFECT!!!!"
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,Good watch for all Marvel fans.
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"With all the heroes, explosions and fights you could ask for The Avengers is arguably the best summer blockbuster in years, but like any summer blockbuster it has plot holes. For example how Bruce Banner is suddenly able to control his powers without explanation or why the aliens decided to attack only one city instead of simultaneously attack the whole world at once, but the movie is fun and exciting so you'll forget about any inconsistencies in the movie."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"Totally, outstanding. Mark Ruffalo made up for Ed Norton's Hulk and more!! The whole cast was excellent at playing their parts. Excellent fights and a really good storyline. Can't wait for Age Of Ultron."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,Great movie with lots of great moments.
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,"Though I think it's a little overrated, The Avengers Assemble is still a very good Superhero movie with great action and as usual, a movie stealing performance by Robert Downey Jr."
"Jul 30, 2013",positive,An orgy of comic book goodness!
"Jul 29, 2013",positive,This is an awesome movie the avengers best part was the the humour good movie that well remember for years
"Jul 29, 2013",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever made. I love this movie and so will any other fan of the marvel series. FULL of action and also full of great comedy. 9/10
"Jul 29, 2013",negative,probably the most overrated movie of all time.
"Jul 29, 2013",positive,Great movie! Funny and action packed.
"Jul 28, 2013",positive,A fun superhero crossover.
"Jul 28, 2013",positive,"One of the best action movie i seeing, Hulk , Ironman and Thor are awesome, but the two side kick have no reason to be there. Make the test yourself, you have to choose 2 super hero to fill up the avenger movie, here a list of every caracter who been in the avenger team in the marvel history ( AntMan, Wasp, QuickSilver, Hercules, Black Panther, Vision, Black Knigth, Mantis, Beast, MoonDragon, SwordsMan, Captain Marvel, HellCat, TwoGun kids, WonderMAn, wizzer, Miss Marvel, Falcon, the Cape, Teh sword, Jocaste, Tigra, Miss Hulk, Starfox, MockingBird, War Machine,The thing, FireBird, Moon Knight, U.S Agent, Human torch, Living Ligthning, SpiderWoman 2, MAchine Man, Darkhawk then Dark widow and hawkEye .... )"
"Jul 28, 2013",positive,GREAT ACTION MOVIE I LOVED THIS MOVIE
"Jul 27, 2013",negative,"Too over the top for me.  Dialouge written by a corny 7-year-old.  Effects not spectacular, just a lot of crap flipping and blowing up.  The only thing that saved it for me was Iron Man.  Could not get into it."
"Jul 27, 2013",positive,Succeeds visually as a masterfully crafted adventure and keeps the heroes alive with great chemistry and innovative action.
"Jul 27, 2013",positive,Robert Downey Jr. made this movie!
"Jul 27, 2013",negative,entertaining but with many flaws
"Jul 27, 2013",positive,"This is in my opinion not just THE best marvel film but the third best superhero film ever (Behind the dark knight and the dark knight rises), Everything was brilliant. Some scenes gave me shivers and this was the redemption of Captain america:TFA and Iron Man 2. 3D was great and the cast had real chemistry. The only negative I can actually give is in relation to Mark Ruffalo as the hulk, he's a great actor but I prefered Edward Norton. The change in actors ultimately changed the Hulks appearance which I didn't like but that's not Mark's fault, that's Marvels fault. They should have had Edward Norton sign a paper or something (If the avengers had been planned at the time of the incredible hulk) but I recommend getting this on Blu Ray 3D. Completely worth it."
"Jul 27, 2013",positive,"Great action scenes, great jokes, great plot, great acting, brilliant film."
"Jul 27, 2013",positive,it waz freaken awesome liked the whole movie watched it like million times and i never dislike it :)
"Jul 26, 2013",positive,"Joss Whedon brings the most popular Marvel franchises together for the greatest movie in the company's history that is full of laughs, explosions, and great character chemistry.

- Details Breakdown -

The Good: Let me first address the elephant in the room. Many critics complain of the ending chaos that ensues, saying it is too Michael Bay. This cannot be further from the truth. The final epic battle is full of clever one liners, elaborate multi-hero fighting, and buildings being exploded - but in much more fun ways than Michael Bay could ever even dream. The mass destruction was inevitable when one lets The Hulk loose on New York city to SMASH, but it does not get out of control. That aside, the final fight scene is not even the best part of the movie. There is an unbelievable amount of heart here for a movie that has an ensemble cast of heroes whose main purpose is to blow things up. The death of a beloved character, the chemistry between heroes (even the new ones), and the cleverness of the villain make this an exciting movie that will a blockbuster for the ages. The story line is a bit illogical at times, as to be expected with a superhero movie, but overall it does not venture into the realm of plot holes and breaking their own rules as many such movies have the tenancy to do. There is great acting all around from our favorites like Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth and even from the two new heroes introduced in this film played by Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson. The show-stealer by far though is Mark Ruffalo. The Hulk movies have never done too well and are not most people's favorites, but using a whole new actor for the character was a bold move and it paid off big. Ruffalo is the greatest Bruce Banner to have ever lived and actually made me hope for a new Hulk movie. That in and of itself is impressive.

The Bad: Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye does not get a whole lot of face-time as a hero and the movie left me wishing that he was able to do a lot more than he was given. The film was not as deep as it could have been and there was a lot more squabbling than there was building relationships (although the squabbling was quite entertaining). The very end of the movie was a bit cheesy compared to the rest. There was a tad too much Hulk SMASHing going on in the final sequence, but not so much as to make it not enjoyable, it just took up valuable time that could have been better spent on deepening the characters."
"Jul 26, 2013",positive,Amazingly badass. 3rd favorite superhero/comic book movie.
"Jul 26, 2013",positive,What is there not to love about this film?
"Jul 25, 2013",positive,great action packed movie!
"Jul 25, 2013",positive,What else do you want?
"Jul 25, 2013",positive,It's an almost perfect movie in its genre.
"Jul 25, 2013",negative,"There must be wolverine in the movie somewhere h
He is the one most famous character of marvel comics"
"Jul 24, 2013",positive,Brilliant. Somehow they managed to cram all the heroes into this film with great success
"Jul 24, 2013",positive,"Never have I enjoyed a movie this much in the theatre than The Avengers! The chemistry between the superheroes is a blast to look at, the action is suburb... Every superhero gets the same amount of attention. What a blast this movie is."
"Jul 24, 2013",positive,"That was my first movie in 3D so it's special. The story was nice but we all know the special effects are the selling point in such movies. 

4 *s"
"Jul 24, 2013",positive,"Saw it in the theater and want to see it again. I'm not usually into special effects, but I do love superhero movies, and the dialogue suits each character perfectly."
"Jul 23, 2013",positive,best comic book movie of all time
"Jul 23, 2013",positive,This is my favorite film of all time just loved it
"Jul 23, 2013",positive,"j'ai 12ans et j'ai surkiffé ce film :D pas besoin d'argumenter les CGI sont au top, le castings de personnages aussi et les dialogues sont au dessus de la moyenne pour un blockbuster."
"Jul 22, 2013",positive,Entirely enjoyable comic book romp. But doesn't quite hit every mark. A wonderful achievement nonetheless.
"Jul 21, 2013",positive,"This movie  was one of the best
 movies i have seen in a long
time"
"Jul 21, 2013",positive,Starts slow but gains steam and ends great.
"Jul 21, 2013",positive,An incredible film.  The best of the year.
"Jul 21, 2013",positive,"Hollywood take note-this is how you do a superhero movie.  None of that Hulk, Batman or daredevil nonsense."
"Jul 20, 2013",positive,Amazing superhero fight scenes and a pretty good storyline that keeps on giving makes it one of the best Marvel Movies.....oh and don't forget Scarlett.
"Jul 20, 2013",positive,"Not my regular genre of movie, but rented the DVD for my son. Surprisingly entertaining!  Just wish it would have had Wonder Woman, although she was DC and these guys are Marvel. She deserves her own movie anyway!"
"Jul 20, 2013",positive,"Ótimo filme, incrível!"
"Jul 20, 2013",negative,One star for the 30 mins of action at the end. ZZZZZZZZZZZ
"Jul 20, 2013",neutral,"This one was all action, so if thats your bag then its all you. Not the most original plot, basically another alien invasion vs super hero movie. I must be getting old if these movies don't do it for me anymore, but check it out, its entertaining. Also want to mention the whole Thor-Loki thing is totally a rip off legend from the Sumerian Enki vs Enlil and Anu, but my guess is even the Sumerian was a rip off from prior to that."
"Jul 19, 2013",positive,"Kind of a slow start. 20 mins into it starts getting interesting though. And it gets very good, it could possibly be one of my favorite action films. All characters in it make a great film and they're all awesome at their roles and everyone plays an important role. The action scenes are incredible and it really gets your heart pumping. I loved almost everything about The Avengers....funny when these movies first came out, I didn't think much of them. And then I saw Iron Man 1 & 2 along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and then I just had to see the others and now I'm a huge fan Marvel. I own all of the original Avenger movies. Highly recommended"
"Jul 19, 2013",positive,Lots of action a little humor and great FX!
"Jul 19, 2013",positive,"To have some of the eras greatest actors renew such incredibly prominent roles all in the same film is something most would expect too difficult to make work. That is not the case in this instance. Every aspect of The Avengers, especially the screenplay, theme music and compelling performances, is so perfectly crafted that the only negative thing to be said is: ""All film makers are now arduously pressured to live up to the hype""."
"Jul 19, 2013",positive,A fan-boy dream of super-hero team ups! Arguably the best comic book movie ever made.
"Jul 18, 2013",positive,"Rewatching in 2021.  Combining Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain American from the previous Marvel films into one finale-type film is really a fanboys wet dream.  Although each film previously stated had its own style and flair, Marvels The Avengers doesn't exactly ""WOW"" the audience with auteur filmmaking or even a groundbreaking storyline... but I would be lying if I said didn't enjoy every second of it.  Hampered down by the top notch cast, beautiful special effects, memorable and lovable characters, and the execution of joining all the characters into one film without it feeling overbearing, this film is quite the experience"
"Jul 18, 2013",positive,love it. if you're in to action and jokes watch.
"Jul 17, 2013",positive,Beautiful beautiful beautiful! My favorite movie!
"Jul 17, 2013",positive,"perfect blockbuster entertainment, fun from beginning to end."
"Jul 17, 2013",neutral,"While there is an appropriate playfulness to the movie, if the dialogue were any cheesier I'd stuff it into a burrito."
"Jul 17, 2013",negative,i majorly HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 17, 2013",positive,An obvious classic. Marvel's the avengers  has action and drama. A great line up cast and a brilliant script
"Jul 17, 2013",positive,"Amazing job with the montage and with the visual effects. A lot of  great and interesting scenes, but a few of unnecessary scenes too. Pretty good job with this movie, it makes people feel excited."
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,"Extremely entertaining, easy-to-follow plot, harmless and very satisfying, The Avengers is very cool and worth-watching."
"Jul 16, 2013",negative,Probably most boring movie of 2012 wait for 2 hours of talk and and predictable dialogue just to get to a transformers rip off action scene don't waste your money and time.Instead watch man of steel or something dc related at least it's realistic but this is just trash
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,"You know it, most loved it.  It is exactly what you would think it would be and what it is supposed to be.  No more no less.  Break out the popcorn and enjoy!"
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,"After watching on Netflix for the first time, I'd say it's a decent crossover of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,A good accessible blockbuster that everyone can like.
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,Greatest Marvel movie yet
"Jul 16, 2013",positive,The best. No wonder I came back to America where else is there such impact.
"Jul 15, 2013",negative,the avengers did not hold my interest but is very interesting for anyone who is interested in super heroes
"Jul 15, 2013",positive,An awesome movie the movie event of 2012
"Jul 15, 2013",positive,"3 stars! 


I did enjoy this! However it was kinda long and did drag for a bit! But I'd definitely be up for seeing the second one!"
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,"The Avengers: 
****1/2 (out of 5) 

After four years, five films, and one change in casting, The Avengers finally made it to the big screen and it was awesome. The best choice Marvel ever made was hiring Joss Whedon who was one of the most underrated TV Creators of all time. Firefly may be dead, but at least we got this fun film. 

The story is pretty simple, Loki (Tom Hiddelston) wants to take over the world, and it's up to the Avengers to band together and stop him. It's the execution of this simple story that works and the interactions between Iron Man (with Downey owning every minute) Thor and Captain America are fun and interesting. I had worries about Mark Ruffelo replacing Edward Nortin but my fears were put to rest. The effects and portray of Hulk are not only fun, but Ruffelo plays the role of Banner much better than Nortin, making him feel more like a scientist and a man looking for inner peace. 

The last forty minutes of the film make any problems I had disappear. It is the kind of action you wish Michael Bay would imitate. Hands down the most entertaining comic book movie I've seen."
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,a near perfect movie.  riddled with apocalyptic action and zany dialogue.  this is one to own.
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,"Quite possibly the most popular superhero film besides The Dark Knight, The Avengers is everything a Marvel fan could want. What really sells the film is the team up between all these characters, seeing them play off one another and then fighting alongside each other utilising their own unique abilities. Joss Whedon's character focused direction and writing really makes this film and provides some great humour as well as some effective personal drama. Each of the cast is great but Mark Ruffalo is the biggest surprise here being a much better Bruce Banner than Edward Norton. When it gets to the action, it rarely halts and keeps you on the edge of your seat with amazing visuals and each individual action set-piece feeling unique because of the different characters involved. Whilst I wouldn't say this is my favourite Marvel film as I'm sure it is for many others, I still think it's awesome."
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,"My second favorite movie!! Avengers is a masterpeice. The heroes interact brilliantly, the fight scenes are breathtaking and the movie is a joy to watch, from start to finish. I would give this 100%!!!"
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,Perfect movie good to see marvel teaming up together. Can't wait for the next one!
"Jul 14, 2013",positive,Josh Whedon and RDJr. hit it out of the park.  The combo of Whedon's snappy dialog writing combined with RDJr.'s sharp delivery is magic.  Very well done.  That last scene (post credits) in the Shawerma restaurant is pure gold.  Great flick all around.  Wish they could have done this with the X-Men franchise.
"Jul 13, 2013",positive,"This movie is very cool. Great special effects, good acting, some funny scenes in their and its just really cool to see all these heroes on one screen. But they spend to long on getting these heroes together. The Avengers also don't really talk to each other unless they are fighting or planning, which is really disappointing. Overall it is really fun but could have been better. 70%"
"Jul 13, 2013",positive,Easily one of the best comic book movies of all time!
"Jul 13, 2013",positive,The greatest superhero crossover movie of all time. Nuff said.
"Jul 12, 2013",positive,"Não curti muito as piadas, mas de resto é bem legal."
"Jul 12, 2013",positive,actiony fun with a good plot.
"Jul 12, 2013",positive,"This was a great movie, I really enjoyed this one."
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"An awesome super hero movie were all heroes are equally important, a Marvel masterpiece"
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"Didn't had all the avengers, but it was pretty good."
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,Loved it ... can't wait for Avengers 2!
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"PEFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!! MARVEL'S BEST FILM EVER MADE. DAZZLING SPECIAL EFFECTS, GREAT ACTING, AND FANTASTIC ACTION SEQUENCES MAKE IT ONE OF THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIES EVER MADE!!"
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"the only thing you need to know,  ""puny god!"""
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"There are so many wonderful adjectives to describe this movie.  AMAZING ... AWESOME .. ACTION PACKED ... EXCITING ... the list goes on and on and on.  It is one of the best Marvel movies ever made, and I loved the consistency that this franchise has kept between all the ""individual"" movies like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc and this conglomeration of characters in Avengers.  I am EAGERLY awaiting when we get another one.  Joss Whedon did a fabulous job with writing and directing.  I hope he does the next one too."
"Jul 11, 2013",positive,"Best superhero movie, directed by one of the best directors, good job Joss Whedon and team!"
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,"BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not joking, this movie is SOOO well done and I LOVE it soooo much! If u get the chance SEE IT"
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,Can't say it was perfect but I just think we all expected so much. But it did very well for such high expectations
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,An excellent and hilarious super hero movie. One of the most fun experiences I have ever had at the theater.
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,The high point of all comic book movies to date. Slow to start as the story gets going. Once the story gets up to speed it doesn't stop.
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,Can't get any better unless you throw in Spiderman All I can say is now they just gotta do the Super Friends
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,Easily the most entertaining movie of 2012.
"Jul 10, 2013",negative,I hate superhero movies.
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,great movie watched it 4 times in 3 days. love Jeremy he was fantastic as hawkeye. All the characters showed the different emotions about the heros loved it. its candy for Marvel Geeks lol like me. Had hilarious humor in it I was constantly laughing or on the edge of my seat best movie I've seen in awhile!
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,Both Iron Man & Thor were surprisingly entertaining and witty movies - when the two meet it's not disappointing. Some great escapist fun and not just in the 3D IMAX action.
"Jul 10, 2013",positive,Very entertaining!!! However as a comic book movie it definitively falls short story wise of the brilliance of the dark night.
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,"An epic masterpiece. We have never seen a movie of this magnitude; Thor, Iron Man, Captain, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Hulk. Just a sensational movie that rivals The Dark Knight for best comic book movie ever."
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,"Wow! What a ride! From beginning to the end the movie stay true to the many other movies before it, and still works well. Downey has found himself a home in the arrogant role of Tony Stark and he owns it...not a fan of his other snooze feet movies this one is exciting from beginning to end!"
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,"Yea it's that good.  Even if you've never followed the comics, you owe to yourself to watch it if you're a fan of action movies.  It is one of the better ones of the last decade."
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,It was a fantastic 3D movie!
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,"These simple 5 words can describe the avengers the best superhero movie ever, also one more word, masterpiece"
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,"Alittle slow at some parts, but it was great overall.Just love superhero movies!"
"Jul 9, 2013",positive,Its a great film with a great cast. just wished they had a better villain. Loki? Come on so many more bad guys out there to chose from. in my opinion the bad guy shouldn't be able to be beaten by just one of the hero's. the villain should be able to go toe to toe with all of them at once.
"Jul 8, 2013",positive,"I loved the teamwork aspect of it. Just a tad too unrealistic with a few things... the flying aircraft carrier and a few Scarlet Johanson(also flying) scenes to name a few. Otherwise, very cool."
"Jul 8, 2013",positive,This was a solid movie. They got all the superheros together and somehow they got equal screen time (maybe Iron Man a little more than others). The story is straight forward with a good amount of action throughout.
"Jul 8, 2013",neutral,"Overhyped and overrated film. A film where all the characters compete to see who can give out the best ""one liner"". It had great sequences, a strong cast and amazing special fx, however, I believe all the hype this film garnered was unjustified because I didn't think it was as great as it was made out to be. I also don't understand why some people even suggest this as, ""the greatest film ever made"". It is completely a falsity on so many levels. The film is merely ok, I wouldn't even call it good. But having said that, I don't think it's a bad film either. It's just a film which was over produced, over commercialised and over hyped.  

Typical A list celebrities trying to garner a huge pay check. A recorded budget of 225 million dollars went into the making of this film, however, you leave the theatre with not one intelligent thought in your mind because the film doesn't provide you with anything meaningful or intellectual. All it gives you is almost 3 hours of big budget Hollywood formula."
"Jul 8, 2013",positive,"A great movie, its every GEEK's dream to see Iron man, Hulk, Captain America and Thor in a whole movie.
The act was amazing, as always, Robert downey jr was the main show, he is perfect to be iron man in every case.
Samuel l jackson was also a very good act, he bring a little ""old school"" acting to the movie.
Well that's my favorite part , as many like me, i thought that Edward norton was the perfect hulk, and his replacement will stink, i was diffidently wrong, Mark ruffalo was the best hulk i'v seen!
Well, we cannot forget Chris evans, Chris hemsworth, Scarlett johansson and Jeremy renner who did a great job too.
I am expecting Avengers 2."
"Jul 8, 2013",positive,Mediocre remix of many superheroes.
"Jul 8, 2013",positive,FREEEEEKIN AWESOME!!
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,"A solid superhero movie, where the characters stand out more than the action and explosions."
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,An overall fun and entertaining superhero flick with good character chemistry and excellent action.
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,DC better catch up...
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,Entertaining superhero movie
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,"This movie was a visually dynamic and action-packed film with cutting edge digital wizardry and characters as true as possible to the comics in behavior and abilities. It was excellently cast and realistic rifts and minor grudges against one another. Loki was an awesome villain, with smooth talk and true evil tendencies. By far my favorite action film"
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 7, 2013",positive,"Though there are some potholes and lazy ways to close it up. Avengers is a thrilling and entertaining joyride. The reason why it was so good is that the already existing superheroes, and the actors who played them, are interacting with each other. This is the first time in movie history when standalone movies turn into a big extravangaza known as a superhero epic."
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,I liked the story line and the movie made me fall in love with super heroes again.  A must see for the man who wants to be a kid again.
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,Second best superhero movie of all time. LOVE THIS FILM.
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,The best comic book movie I've seen
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,RDJ.....sigh.....finally saw it....better late than never....was great!
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,"Grandiose and bloated, although extremely entertaining;  It's jammed with impressive action sequences, and the characters are all well-developed, although that may be due in part to all of the preceding films. The script is generally well-written, and there's a good amount of humor and witty dialogue as well."
"Jul 6, 2013",positive,"Between the directing, acting, chemistry, and effects;The Avengers is the perfect summer superhero flick. I still don't know how they managed to bring all these heroes together into one film without a mess like I expected, instead I was rewarded with what is now one of my favorite films."
"Jul 5, 2013",positive,I give this movie a 9.9/10 for pure goddamn awesomeness.
"Jul 5, 2013",positive,"Not bad...
Stark (Downey Jr.) was quite overbearing, but other than that, a very good film"
"Jul 5, 2013",positive,"Wanted to rate it higher, but it's a bit too Transformers for me. Acting doesn't impress."
"Jul 5, 2013",positive,"Unsurprisingly, I did not marvel at Marvels Avengers Assemble.

Jam packed with action (too much and all a bit samey, if you ask me, with few memorable set pieces), heavy on the buff (no complaints there), laced with witty one liners.

It's not really my cup of tea, but there's lots about it to like - particularly the buff!"
"Jul 5, 2013",positive,learned to appreciate what it is. still not my favorite
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,Amazing! Joss does it again!
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,One of my favorite movies of all time!
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,"I didn't have much understanding what the fuck was going on, but I've never seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, or The Hulk so you'll have that. Even so, lots of shit blows up so that's cool."
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,This is easily one of my favorite movies
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,Seriously. I didn't get the hype. It was entertaining. But these super heroes were more well-done on the solo tip.
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,"Entertaining, funny, exciting but sometimes silly."
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,"Great entertainment ,as you would expect from a set of super hero's.."
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,"This definitely broke a lot of box office records. And the millions of people who went to see it should have thought it was worth it. Robert Downey Jr. was funny as always, and the visual effects were amazing. The only downside is that the big action is at the end of the movie, and you might not understand some of it if you haven't watched Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, or the Iron Man movies. But the movie was definitely good in many ways. HULK SMASH!!!!!! 4.5/5"
"Jul 4, 2013",positive,"Exhilarating action scenes, an engaging story, meaningful characters, and an exciting finale make The Avengers live up to its hype as a spectacular example of pure blockbuster entertainment."
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,One hero is not enough for any 2 hour movie any more!!!
"Jul 3, 2013",neutral,"Its entertaining, but its also nothing special. A superhero mashup that does everything its expected to do."
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,No doubt one of the best action films I have seen so far. The movie grabs you from the get go and keeps you in place the entire time. Even adding in a little comedy and a slight love interest. I can watch this over and over.
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,"the movie was great I can't wait to see the next one ill watch this one about a thousand times before the second one comes out
jared jones"
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,This movie is funny and has lots of action at the same time
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,Odlican...Zabava zagarantovana :)
"Jul 3, 2013",positive,Very well done comic book movie. Each character feels like the star of their own movie and I really appreciate that because not only does Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man steal the show but the other characters do as well.
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,"Best comic book movie, EVER! Hands down. :)"
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,"It's well-shot and exciting, but The Avengers isn't nearly as funny or charming as it thinks it is."
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,"The best movie of 2012. Avengers Assemble, asshole!!
When a dream becomes truth... An Avengers movie is Rising."
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,Probably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,an amazing marvel story that kept me on the edge of my seat!!!! I love it!!!!!!!
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,The Avengers top ranks all marvel movies ever made
"Jul 2, 2013",positive,"Arguably the best superhero film of all time, The Avengers provides all of the action-packed spectacle and visual sparkle while also continuing the story arcs of its extraordinary leads, creating a fantastic thrill ride for young and old."
"Jul 1, 2013",positive,one of the best movies of the year!
"Jul 1, 2013",positive,"Joss Whedon played this movie really safe. About as safe as you can make a movie, but in this case it actually works for the most part. The writing is great, the cast blends well, and their are alot of comedic moments that fit in the film well. A problem I see is the villans. I thought they could have choosen better villans. Also, parts of the movie seems bland but again the movie still has a lot of good and even great scenes. 
I give the movie a grade: B but the acting gets a grade: A+"
"Jul 1, 2013",positive,"Best movie ever, yet"
"Jul 1, 2013",positive,"One of the best superhero movies in the last decade, everything you need in a superhero film is right here."

"Jun 26, 2013",positive,"After four years and five movies of build-up, The Avengers is out and...it's a great film. The Avengers is a certain turning point for both the nerd culture and filmmaking in general. Filmmakers are going to be copying this elaborate world building for decades, and for good reason. If you havent seen The Avengers, rush out and see it, it's an absolute marvel (no pun)."
"Jun 26, 2013",positive,Best super hero movie to date. Very funny action packed great acting and directing! Was amazed by the special affects cant wait till the sequel. Hulk Smash!
"Jun 26, 2013",positive,"I f you don't like it, you're dead inside!"
"Jun 26, 2013",positive,"Like catching lighting in a bottle, the greatest comic book movie of all time understands just how ridiculous it would be if the source material suddenly became modern, real life. This popcorn masterpiece walks the fine line of never taking itself too seriously with the pin point perfection of a 6 year old's beautiful imagination."
"Jun 25, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is one of the best comic book adaptations out there.  It has great action, special effects, and the screenplay, which usually kills comic book movies, is pretty decent.  

One thing I noticed while watching this a second time is that they did a good job of balancing all of the heroes' parts in the film.  That must have been difficult trying to allot time to so many main characters.  Well done.  

I do have one complaint. . . Captain America's uniform was much cooler in his stand alone film.  His uniform in the avengers was a little costumey.  Why the change, I wonder.  Everything else was great."
"Jun 25, 2013",positive,"funny, full of action, charismatic and memorable characters, the story simple and fairly cliche, but is still very disfrtubale, if you do not like, probably do not have soul."
"Jun 25, 2013",positive,Definitely not the best superhero movie ever. But The Avengers is a fun and exciting movie.
"Jun 25, 2013",positive,Superheroes? In New York? Give me a break!
"Jun 24, 2013",positive,Marvels best seller!!!
"Jun 24, 2013",positive,"Spectacular movie with enough comedy, action, and sex appeal, that can keep you near the edge of your seat."
"Jun 24, 2013",positive,it was great but I thought it was funny that the hulk can control his powers only because the plot calls for it lol
"Jun 24, 2013",positive,WONDERFUL just wonderful ;-)
"Jun 23, 2013",negative,"I understand that it was popular, but I am baffled that this film was well received by critics.  There was nothing in particular that was memorable about this film.  It's bloated with superficial characters participating in a low-stakes, hum-drum plot filled with wall-to wall Transformer-style action.  The few witticisms and humorous moments that appear throughout the movie are not enough to save it from its oppressive mediocrity.  In fact, there were several times where I almost laughed at the ridiculousness of the whole big bugeted affair.  However, I cannot say that it was particularly terrible.  It was just average.  Slightly below average."
"Jun 23, 2013",neutral,"The Avengers is a for the control of earth between aliens and the team of Marvel heros.  The plot is somewhat predictable with only a few twists, but there is a lot of action.  I suppose people will watch it with so many A-list actors in it."
"Jun 23, 2013",positive,"Perfect. Well paced, character development is absolute and the best third act any action film can offer, I can honestly say this was torn from a comic book and splattered onto the big screen."
"Jun 23, 2013",positive,A quality superhero movie.
"Jun 23, 2013",positive,"Great superhero movie, possibly one of the best I have seen"
"Jun 23, 2013",negative,There is completely NOTHING but FX. HUGE overrating and waste of time for cinema loving people
"Jun 22, 2013",negative,Hated every frame of this.
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,this movie is great love it
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,I love this movie. I will own it soon.
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,Very amazing movie ! Every character had enough screen time !
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,Marvel pulled off the team up almost flawlessly.  One of the most enjoyable movies of the summer.
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,I wish I could rate it 100 stars
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,The lowdown on Marvel's The Avengers... The best thing about it was that it showed people how much fun it has been to grow-up reading comics and to play within the Marvel universe.
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,Loved it - the best of the best in comic book movies.
"Jun 22, 2013",negative,"The Dark Knight Rises, Watchmen and Man of Steel make this flick look like a kids movie. It's just so over rated."
"Jun 22, 2013",positive,one of the best films in history
"Jun 21, 2013",positive,"Extremely entertaining. Extremely fun. This is a nerd's dream come true.  Marvel fans will be proud of this. However, my only complaints are that the plot was, in someway, generic, there were a few slow and boring moments, and the aliens I found weren't that threatening. Overall, this is easily one of the most delightful comic book movies to date."
"Jun 21, 2013",neutral,Great visuals but I really can't understand all the hype for the avengers i found it entertaining no more no less it's so overrated and predictable
"Jun 21, 2013",positive,How could you put a bad rating with this one? Loved it!
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,"Sort of slow, but picks up speed and is good"
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,Great movie. A lot of action. Could have had less cursing.
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,Alright. 6.2/10. B-. Good if you don't watch it seriously.
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,The best Superhero movie ever! Make Avengers 2!!!!
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,"Fun characters, great writing, and fantastic action sequences. What's not to like"
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,Take a bunch of good movies and put them all in one and you get one of the best movies I've ever seen
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,"The Avengers was the cinematic experience of the 2012 summer and showed that we could enjoy fun superheroes as well as our dark and brooding ones. The Avengers had a big rival in The dark knight rises but it overpassed it with success. The Avengers showed hollywood and fans that Joss Whedon could again handle big blockbusters after most people criticised his script for the Alien Resurrection being the reason that it floped. 

The storyline was not to complex but was fun and provided the right amount for each character to shine except for hawkeye. Joss managed to bring in his sense of humour like he has had in all of his work this managed to make the long run time fly by. The that he handled all their individual powers and strengths is again what he does best and has managed to convert from his shows like Buffy and Angel.

The visuals in the Avengers was very good and shows off what can be done with character hulk because even though he is fully CGI he managed to communicate better than in the previous hulk instalments. It also gave a chance for Joss to destroy New York. Many of the CGI set pieces like the shield hover craft were very well done and did not stick out as being that way.

The way that the actors managed to work together so that they all got the same scene time shows off the way that they were all committed to this movie. Some actors did outshine others with their performances though. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was amazing and was the perfect villain for the first avenger film. RDJ like usual also stands out for his crowd pleasing turn as Tony Stark. However there was an unexpected highlight from Mark Ruffalo and the hulk. Mark played Bruce brilliantly as mild mannered and calm and then the Hulk was unstoppable but funny and totally different from the way that he was portrayed in Ang Lee's Hulk and the incredible Hulk.

For me personally the Avengers shows the humourless Man of Steel that it is okay to have a laugh but don't go all quest for peace with us."
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,"COME ON! ENTERTAINMENT JUST DOESN'T GET BETTER! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUTRAGEOUS AND OVER THE TOP, PERFECTLY SCRIPTED AND SHOT MOVIE."
"Jun 20, 2013",positive,Possibly the best super-hero movie ever made.  I don't think I have anything the complain about here!
"Jun 19, 2013",positive,INCREDIBLE I loved the hell out this movie all of marvels heroes teaming up what else can u ask for
"Jun 19, 2013",positive,Don't know how this could have been done better.
"Jun 19, 2013",positive,"everything you could possibly want from a comic book movie, when things are done right it just works."
"Jun 18, 2013",positive,"More of a screenwriting stunt than a great action movie. There seemed to be a giant checklist guiding the plot: ""Scarlett Johansson vs. Jeremy Renner, check."" The action scenes were over-planned, style-free CGI. By far, the best parts of the movie were in between the big set pieces."
"Jun 17, 2013",positive,An action movie that's actually not ridiculously over the top.  It's kept grounded by an amazing cast along with wit and fast pacing.  This is a near perfect example of an action film
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,A wonderful execution of everything we wanted as kids. Avengers assembled flawlessly to the dismay of many
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,"Thogh starting out as a normal 'bad guy trying to take over the world, good guys stop him' story, the film takes a turn for the awesome in the third act, and we finally get great Hulk moments with Mark Ruffalo's performence getting special marks, and a better Hulk then both of the privous Hulk's combined!"
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,"Buena acción, buenas actuaciones, buena comedia y excelentes efectos. Es un película muy buena y bastante entretenida pero no pasa de una película de superheroes más. La historia es cliché, aunque su desarrollo puede hacer que no parezca así. La música pese a ser buena e ir acorde a las escenas no es para nada memorable y la olvidarás una vez terminada la película. Un pequeño aspecto que me molestó fue que casi todo el protagonismo de la película se lo lleva Iron Man, Capitán América y Thor pierden mucho protagonismo. Bueno, tendrá sus errores argumentales por ahí pero en general es una buena película, pero no es la mejor de su género y tampoco la mejor de Marvel."
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,Marvel's Avengers delivers a well packed script and full of coherent action scenes that serve as a meeting point for the first phase of Marvel's Cinematic Universe.
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,Brilliant film can't wait for number 2
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,Perfectly brings the characters together and has enough action to keep you enticed without losing a few IQ points.
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,This movie gets better on multiple viewings.  Just a stunning realization of Marvel's shared universe plans.
"Jun 16, 2013",positive,INCREDIFUCKINGBLE!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",neutral,I couldn't get into it.
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,"With an already set up potential by means of its stand-alones, The Avengers advances the climax of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with utmost action packed brilliance and by being amongst the few movies that relish the essence of their source material."
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,This is an awesome movie.
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,"I made the mistake of seeing this movie before the individual Marvel films comprising it. After seeing those, the quality of the movie increased substantially as I was able to pick up on more subtle character traits and easter eggs throughout the film."
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,best movie of the year. i loved the way the actors blended
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,"After four years and five previous films that were effectively used to build a cinematic universe, we finally get The Avengers."
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,"How could I forget to rate this movie when I finally got to see it? I must have been too hype afterwards! It was great to see the Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, and Captain story lines all come together. I'm not even a big comic book fan but the movie was awesome."
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,"The Avengers executes the wonder and spectacle of the comics on the big screen while  injecting a much needed style of Joss Whedon. The cast works great together with giving all enough screen time time for character development. A great blend of humor and action, an all time high for all geeks, fan-boys and newcomers to the Marvel universe. Phenomenal entertainment 5/5"
"Jun 15, 2013",positive,You will love Iron Man and Captain!
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,"I was bored and disappointed. After much hype preceding the showing of the film, the movie turned out to be so-so."
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,"Entertaining, but mostly overhyped and only considered by critics because it had a notable director."
"Jun 14, 2013",neutral,"Overrated. A few clever one liners but the narrative was stupid and predictable.  Just word noise to get you to the next action sequence.  Visually, I can see why The Avengers would be entertaining but other than that it had nothing to offer.  I do respect Whedon's work so maybe I'll give this another chance one day."
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,"Featuring one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, 'Marvel's The Avengers' shows off Marvel Comics' superhero best; combining action, comedy, and emotion to create a fully functional and resonating cinematic story."
"Jun 14, 2013",neutral,"It's like the whole movie build up amounts to just mindless action. Yes, I said it. Uninspiring script with too many cliche dialogues, and it was too much on the surface. Good vs bad, wants the same thing, fight. Meh.
In saying this, yes, i did watch ALL of the preceding movies."
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,Good action but hag-tag storyline
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,Too much fun to handle.
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,"Meh.  I feel like a real curmudgeon when I say I didn't really like this movie.  But, I didn't really like it.  I thought it was a shame that a cast like this couldn't be brought together for a better script.  The story was good, but told in a ham handed way so I didn't care at all about any of the characters.  And, since I'm not a fan boy, I could have used a bit of introduction to the characters.  The Avengers focuses more on cool special effects than story and since this is no longer 1985 and I'm not impressed by great SFX, I'd prefer more story less flash.  As reviewer Al Alexander says ""Joss Whedon empties everything at his reported $225 million disposal to assault the eyes, ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film.""  I don't know about the stupidest tale ever put to film, but throwing everything including the kitchen sink into a movie continues to ruin the experience for me."
"Jun 14, 2013",positive,"It's something like Bay's ""Armageddon"". Bunch of funny guys avenging manipulated dead agent, saving of the world it's just a sceondary objective."
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,"Awsome, the hulk is bad ass in this one"
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,"The only thing that makes this movie good is because it's eye candy. That being said, all of the people thinking that The Avengers is an ""innovative"" movie need to watch ""The Dark Knight"" again. ""The Avengers"" is a highly predictable movie that is an obvious cash cow."
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,Great film by all means
"Jun 13, 2013",neutral,It was okay. But the movie doesn't deliver like I thought it would. Take out the comedy and you have really no plot.
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,"64%
The Avengers is even more for kids than the Hobbit."
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,"Brilliantly written, great action, phenomenal acting.  Overall great movie"
"Jun 13, 2013",positive,"i simply love the script, the visuals, and the acting."
"Jun 12, 2013",positive,great action with the usual funny parts
"Jun 12, 2013",positive,best super hero movie ever
"Jun 12, 2013",neutral,"Yeah, yeah, yeah... whatever."
"Jun 12, 2013",positive,Al thought I did enjoyed the movie. Sometimes I felt like I have to wait the whole movie till the end which was the best part.
"Jun 12, 2013",positive,"The Avengers doesn't seem to have the ""Top Notch"" kick."
"Jun 12, 2013",negative,Superhero movie for kids.
"Jun 11, 2013",positive,Simply Awesomeness!! Has to B a part 2.
"Jun 11, 2013",positive,"This movie is one of the best superhero movies ever.The Avengers was fantastic.It had everything I wanted.It had a great villain,a great plot,great action,and great acting. Everyone nailed their role out of the park in this movie. It great laughs also at great timing. Overall I loved this movie so I'm giving this movie a 5/5 stars and an A+."
"Jun 10, 2013",positive,"The first 15 minutes were hard for me to sit through, but over all I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Might even be worth a second viewing."
"Jun 10, 2013",positive,"Probably one of the best comic book movies out there.
However, it's too long and incredibly formulaic (to the point of being predictable)."
"Jun 10, 2013",positive,Never underestimate the entertainment value of hulk breaking stuff.
"Jun 10, 2013",positive,Cannot wait til sequel
"Jun 10, 2013",positive,The best superhero film you will ever see. Joss Whedon strikes again with a fantastic film. A absolute must watch.
"Jun 9, 2013",positive,Good but cap america is an asshole
"Jun 9, 2013",positive,It's good fun for the most part but ultimately further proof that I want more than some okay characters & lost of special effects to be satisfied with a film overall. There are touches of where Whedon wants this to go on display here and I'll be interested to see where he can take it.
"Jun 8, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is the big film we all were expecting, probably better than expected actually. The plot is the classic evil vs good but puts several elements to make it work: characters that interact with each other, great action scenes and everything a comic book fan is looking for. A highly enjoayble experience and unforgetteable."
"Jun 8, 2013",positive,The 3D version is amazing
"Jun 8, 2013",positive,"It's my third time watching this wonderful piece of work! Very entertaining and funny. I can't ask for more, everybody's favorite superheroes are here in the movie. I love to watch it over and over again. Hulk make me laugh and Thor's power is amazing!"
"Jun 7, 2013",positive,Best action hero movie hands down.
"Jun 7, 2013",positive,"Waiting for the 2nd one! 
    Had me flies to the big screen the whole time!! ;)"
"Jun 6, 2013",positive,"Unlike ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Superman: The Movie"", you're not going to expect this movie being a comic book film that will be incredible, but it is what it's meant to be- A summertime midnight movie spectacle that you can just check your brain at the door and have a great time!!!!"
"Jun 5, 2013",positive,I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!! IT WAS SO AWESOME I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT IN AWESOMENESS WORDS!!!!!!!
"Jun 5, 2013",positive,"OVERRATED AS ALL HELL. For a two and a half hour movie about super heroes, there really isn't a whole lot of action going on... Just a whole lot of talking... Too much talking... The battle scenes aren't even that enjoyable so there is no reward for sitting through all the insufferable dialogue. The loss of Edward Norton as The Hulk is disappointing since Mark Ruffalo can't act to save his f*****g life. Robert Downey Jr. is the only entertaining aspect of the entire film."
"Jun 4, 2013",positive,"It's so much fun to see all the superheros we watched in their own separate movies, finally come together!"
"Jun 4, 2013",positive,"Great movie, amazing work on the costumes and effects. But with Loki being the main villain after not really loving the movie Thor, I was a little disappointed with that. I also felt that there was far too much time spent on the airship. It was still a great movie overall, but some parts also felt a little too rushed.. as if each character had to introduce themselves into the movie in a 30second or less scene, or else be cut. I just wanted to care a little more about some of the heroes and other characters. Awesome acting too though :) Hopefully the 2nd movie is makes up for those little things, and the villain is a little more badarse."
"Jun 3, 2013",positive,Loved it. Nothing else to say
"Jun 3, 2013",positive,"Clearly, Marvel/Disney will have a bright and lucrative future releasing the various Avenger-related films (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, ect.), but the fact that they've set the bar so high with the lead-up to The Avengers makes me worry about the quality and continuity of the future films.  We've already seen Bruce Banner's character replaced twice (personally, I think Eric Bana should have reprised his role for this film) and the War Machine character once (which was for the best, I think).  Needless to say, my greatest concern is what's going to happen when one of those BOX OFFICE SUPERSTARS gets sick of paying the character they've now played multiple times...sometimes more than once a year.  For comic geeks like me, the Marvel Universe on film is complete and utter paradise...but, at least it's expected to last for several more years.

 

I'm going to assume you've seen the other Marvel films that have led us all to this blockbuster (because if you haven't, you're just cheating yourself to the epic buildup), which centers on the formation of one massive super team, called The Avengers.  The Avengers picks up right where the Captain America film leaves off.  In many ways, the film feels mostly like a Captain America sequel, since it involves a newly awakened Steve Rogers and the back-n-forth possession of the cosmic cube (the Tesseract), which was the Red Skull's obsession in the last film.  This time around, Loki (played by the absolutely marvelous Tom Hiddleston) is hell-bent on harnessing the cube's power for his own personal gain.  He may be the main villain for the film, but he's not the one pulling the strings (***hint***watch the scenes after the credits for an appearance by a villain that only die hard comic nerds can identify).

I didn't just decide this now, but anytime you can get Robert Downey Jr. in one of your films, it's worth every single penny.  This film is no different since he brings the typical Tony Stark charm to a room filled with serious characters.  Without the humor, this film would not have been as enjoyable as it turned out to be.  The scene between Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts character simply wets everyone's appetite for next summer's Iron Man 3.  Personally, I find the Iron Man films to be the most enjoyable (and the backbone) films of this franchise.  Basically, without Downey Jr. and Paltrow pulling the weight at the beginning, there would be nothing to enjoy right now.

 

One of the two gripes that I have about this film is that there aren't any real major comic book references off in the background for the diehard comic book fans to explain to their friends sitting next to them (who really don't care), especially since there were several references in previous films.  We don't even get an ""Avengers Assemble.""  I suppose the full-time additions of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) make up for the need to have any of those tiny little details in the background.  There are so many characters in this film that it's surprising that I didn't feel like I got screwed over because one character wasn't in the film enough.  Some of them have more lines than others, but the film feels like a perfect character balance.

 

What's the biggest gripe I have about the film???  Comic books have a way of killing off characters in order to further the plot or enlarge a villain, so when one of the characters (and one of my favorites) bites the dust in the film, it left me pretty bitter.  The good news about comic book deaths is that characters usually don't stay dead for long.  With that being said, I'm hoping that's the case here, because if it's not, the film writes off an incredibly brilliant character.  Did the plot of the film need the death?  Maybe, but probably not.   Did the scenes afterwards improve because of the death?  Absolutely.  I just really, really hope it's not permanent.

 

Overall, the action sequences throughout the film make a two hour-plus movie feel like half an hour.  (If you have to go to the bathroom at any point during this film, HOLD IT!!!)  Who would win in a fight between Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man???  This film might not supply you with a definitive answer to that question, but it does supply you with a round of sensational superhero vs. superhero vs. superhero action.  Then, of course they unite and team up to fight Loki's random alien army that is destroying everything in sight.  Bottom line:  LOTS OF ACTION!!!

 

Enjoy this comic book masterpiece.  If you're not entertained by this film, you are beyond help!"
"Jun 3, 2013",positive,"Oh yeah, I watched this a few weeks ago. I liked it, but it wasn't transcendent. It was something like the perfect application of a familiar formula, in that it was perhaps the most entertaining ""summer movie"" in recent memory, but it didn't add to the superhero genre in novelty (the first Spider-Man), depth (The Dark Knight), or setting (X-Men First Class) like the best superhero films. That said, I completely understand why/how it was the cash cow it was and, unlike a lot of movies, I don't root against it merely because it appealed to everyone.

My only substantive gripe is the short shrift given to Bruce Banner suddenly figuring out how to control the Hulk. The singular plot point of prior Hulk movies (and a significant plot point underlying this movie) is resolved without mention when, only a few scenes removed from a prior uncontrollable rampage, Banner confidently hulks out without losing control."
"Jun 3, 2013",positive,"""Is The Avengers the movie everyone was hoping for? Yes, and it's even more. This is how a sommer blockbuster has to look like!"""

"Jun 2, 2013",positive,"Seeing the Avengers assemble itself is enough to make any comic (or superhero film) fan get shivers down their spine, thankfully the film happens to be great too. Let me put it this way, it's done so well that even the Hulk is entertaining..."
"Jun 2, 2013",positive,It was great having most of the super Herod in this movie
"Jun 2, 2013",positive,Every character complemented each other perfect!

"Jun 2, 2013",positive,With Fantastic performances from all the actors from playing their characters..and with fantastic special effects and a great climax..Marvel's The Avengers is definitely is a great      welcome to the Marvel Universe.
"Jun 1, 2013",positive,"Awesome!  100% badass throughout the entire film!  You go Joss Whedon!  The film has awesome costume designs, awesome cast and crew, perfect performances from all of them, and Mark Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner and Hulk ever, way better than Eric Bana and Edward Norton separately and combined.  Has lots of heart and humor, very funny, good pacing, and awesome character development throughout.  Awesome special effects, a terrific story, the connection and bond between the characters, and nonstop action make this the best superhero movie ever.  Best superhero movie ever!"

"May 31, 2013",positive,Nothing beats up a collection of super heroes in one magnificent film.
"May 31, 2013",positive,They brought it together.  The story delivered and I think marvel is just cashing in while they're still hot. the problem with putting the team together is that now marvel has to take them apart to make more movies.  Purely by accident though...they did make the best SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER.
"May 31, 2013",positive,hope the cast and studio working out the money. issues. would love to see every one come back. highly anticipating. a sequel
"May 31, 2013",positive,"Every comic nerds wet dream. Fan of the or not, everybody should check this out."
"May 31, 2013",positive,"I'm usually not one for comic books, never grew up with them as a kid, but my god... this movie was awesome. Each character gets their fair share of screen time and each has their own personal character arcs to deal with, a big movie with a great ensemble cast!"
"May 31, 2013",positive,"Not just a hugely entertaining piece of popcorn cinema, but also a very energetic movie with great characterization, suitably fast paced and focused direction and a script that is sure to satisfy comic-book fans and casual movie-goers alike. Perhaps THE quintessential superhero movie due to the way it deftly blends action and drama to craft the perfect blockbuster experience."
"May 31, 2013",positive,"Best superhero movie of all time. The Avengers is absolutely perfect in every way. The heroes are great, the villain is great, the acting is great. I saw this movie in theaters twice because it was so good. It made me fall in love with Marvel. Fantastic film."

"May 28, 2013",positive,"Love it absolutely amazing, i even bought it for my kids"
"May 28, 2013",neutral,"Finally I saw it, and... BORING!!! What is this?! I didn't like it at all! Because I didn't like all super heroes and I didn't wanna see them together in just 1 movie! But I liked The Hulk and his parts (only little...) were great. Mark Ruffalo was the best performer and he was very quiet and naive, so it was really shocking when he became Hulk. Story was boring, too many unfunny jokes, noisy, overacted actors, bad guy looked like a girl and too complicated! I think Joss Whedon's good director, but I think his movie Serenity was better. Pretty good special effects, dynamic action fight sequences and I liked battle scenes at Grand Central Station in NYC! But I really disappointed... Best part: Fast food restaurant scene after the end credits! If you stopped watch it during the end credits, you missed it!"
"May 28, 2013",positive,"Joss Whedon is an astoundingly good filmmaker. He successfully crafted a film that is not only record AND ground breaking, but feels like a dream come true to Marvel fanatics like myself. Do yourself a favor and experience this incredible achievement in film."
"May 28, 2013",positive,:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-D:-(:-(:-(:-(:-( yeah
"May 28, 2013",positive,Thor is still my favorite and Iron Man my least. but this movie was pretty awesome. yes I know I'm slow.
"May 28, 2013",positive,A very good film to bring together the heroes. Fun action but has too many one liners.
"May 28, 2013",negative,"Out of all the hype, this movie was incredibly boring."

"May 27, 2013",positive,I love the way the superheroes play off each other. The fighting scenes get long... I live for the funny Robert Downey Junior moments.
"May 27, 2013",positive,lets get them boys. great movie full of action
"May 27, 2013",positive,It Is Overrated And Takes Too Long To Start Up But When It Does It Is A Lot Of Fun
"May 27, 2013",positive,Joss Whedon gets it right. I hope Michael Bay is paying attention. It is possible to have a massive special effects display and still tell a good story.
"May 27, 2013",positive,comic books make great movies.
"May 27, 2013",positive,"The plot was so so, it took too long for the Avengers to come together and the villian wasn't particularly impressive (if Thor on his own can beat Loki, then why do The Avengers struggle so much?). That being said, the humour and the chemistry between the characters was pretty good and The Hulk Smash scene is worth 2 stars on it's own. The dude with the crossbow is incredibly lame though."
"May 26, 2013",positive,Fantastic movie can't wait for the second one!!!
"May 26, 2013",positive,Other than Captain America Winter Soldier the best Marvel movie

"May 25, 2013",positive,It was everything! The movie was perfect.
"May 25, 2013",positive,the best super hero movie so far
"May 24, 2013",negative,"Very overrated. RDJ and Phil Coulson are great, as usual, but the rest is garbage. Full of cheesy, predictable one liners. I don't know how people love it so much. I wanted to see an action film, I saw a disneyfied bullcrap attempt at ""family fun"". You know exactly how this movie is gonna play out 10 minutes in. Movies like the Dark Knight make this movie look pathetic. Basically, it's a bunch of superheroes doing their own thing, battling for screen time. Thor, Loki, Captain America, and Black Widow were horrible characters. Iron Man, Hulk, Fury, and Coulson were good. However, this movie was horribly directed and very, very predictable. No suspense or originality. This movie isn't as bad as Thor, but its not much better because Thor is still in it. 2/5 stars."
"May 24, 2013",positive,One of my favorite superhero movies of all time!
"May 24, 2013",positive,"This Movie was only possible with CGI. However, The movie blends the best of these action hero's and has a story line that flows with the franchise. We have the best actors coming together with one of the best sci-fi director's ""Joss Whedon "" of the Firefly series and Motion Picture ""Serenity""."
"May 23, 2013",positive,"If it weren't for Captain America's suit, it would be perfect."
"May 23, 2013",positive,"Excellent movie with broad appeal from the most rabid comic fan to the average movie goer. Bravo to everyone involved!

Also, as a long time comic book collector, it proved that the stuff I've been reading for years can be brought to life on the big screen and be excellent."
"May 23, 2013",positive,Josh wheedon is force to be reckoned witg when it comes to epic action/super hero movies
"May 23, 2013",negative,"It's like any old 'Avengers' comic books with the addition of explosive special effects. The interactions between characters were dull and highly artificial, and there was so much explosive carnage throughout the film that by the time the climax came there was little to be impressed by. Fairly run of the mill modern day super hero film I don't understand why it's so popular."
"May 22, 2013",negative,"This movie had the ability to be amazing, but it would seem that the writing staff either didn't exist, were ineffably rushed, lazy, or simply lacking any amount of flesh within the cavity that is suppose to house the organ most critical to their craft. Besides filmography, and the thrill of seeing such a large conflict, this movie has nearly no drive. It lags in the worst of places and lacks a significant amount of drive, and expects the audience to immediately accept it as amazing without actually earning the right."
"May 22, 2013",positive,"The Avengers

	The Avengers is one of the best Hollywood superheroes movies. The first time the news mentioned that The Avengers movie was in the making, I really thought that it was impossible for any directors to make it, or it would become a disorganized movie because each character has different stories and it impossible to connect them in one story.  However, the movie showed the opposite. It is really linking among different heroes who have different stories in one amazing story. 
	The Avengers movie shows some famous heroes who come together to get rid of the enemies. The heroes are an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and the enemy, who is Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston).
	In this movie, when the international peacekeeping agency felt that the earth was in danger, they started to ask the earth's heroes for help. When the unexpected enemy who threatens global safety and security came to the earth, the heroes succeeded to kill him, and save the earth. So the Avengers movie want us to believe that these action figures have worked nice as a team, which is good news for humanity, but it is bad news for the enemies.
Some people do not like action movies or superheroes movies. However, this movie is different than the other movies. What I would like to say is that everyone who loves action movies or even who does not should watch ""The Avengers"". It is really a worth watching because it has seriousness and humor, so you will cry in some sections and laugh in the other sections."
"May 22, 2013",positive,A good experience that left me wanting more.
"May 21, 2013",positive,I liked all of the super hero movies by themselves ut having them all in the same movie was AWESOME!

+ strong supporting"
"May 21, 2013",positive,"Since Iron Man 3 is out... I'd better review this movie. This movie is so incredible, you never get this kind of movie nowadays. Yeah Cap, Thor, Iron Man, Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye get together and they work as a pretty good solid team. The supporting cast did a great job. I loved this movie and I highly recommend watching over and over again. Avengers Assemble!"
"May 20, 2013",positive,Awesome shit! And some damn fine men right there!!
"May 20, 2013",positive,"I knew from the moment Joss Whedon was announced as writer/director of Marvel's supergroup franchise, The Avengers, that the right decision had been made. While it seemed like a gamble to industry observers -- Whedon had previously only made one feature film, a sequel to his short-lived television series, FIrefly -- genre fans were immediately frenzied with excitement. Whedon's track record at crafting stories with large ensemble casts (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly) made him a great fit for The Avengers, his respectful and insightful handling of the characters made a potent film out of a premise that could have been an overstuffed mess in the hands of a lesser craftsman. The Avengers is essentially a sequel to five other movies, all made with this one in mind; nothing like this has ever been done before. And while it is true that there are not a lot of complex character arcs in this film -- those were largely taken care of in the solo movies before this one -- Whedon never lets the characters feel superfluous, even the ones who admittedly should (i.e., Black Widow and Hawkeye). His handling of the team dynamic is near perfect, hitting the right character beats that don't slow down the relentless action and actually bring some stakes to the film: if the team can't learn to work together then they cannot save the world. And it is the focus on the character dynamics and grandiose action set pieces that overshadow the film's rather rote and conventional plot. It is as if Whedon understands that the nature of the conflict is not as important as its meaning, what it does to the team, and accordingly treats Loki and his world-conquering quest as something of a MacGuffin, not for the heroes to obtain but for them to unite against. The Avengers manages the impossible, to not only deliver on all the set up of the previous five films, but to match or surpass them in pathos and fun. Whedon's gift for dialogue feels perfect coming at a fast pace out of Robert Downey Jr., who gets some great one-liners as Tony Stark. And The Avengers finally gives us not just a decent film version, but the definitive film version of Bruce Banner/The Hulk, played with just the right balance of nervously unhinged by Mark Ruffalo (replacing Edward Norton).

Marvel's unprecedented gamble in trying to create its own interconnected cinematic superhero universe, conceived before its first seeds were planted in Iron Man (2008), has reached the apex of Phase I with a film that does everything right, and exemplifies how Marvel has treated this ambitious project not just as a money-making tool but as a viable storytelling medium."
"May 19, 2013",positive,This movie just screams win.
"May 19, 2013",positive,Great combination of all the marvel movies.
"May 19, 2013",positive,"""There's only one God ma'am, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like ""that.""""

Marvel Studios has created perhaps the most unique franchise in the history of film, combining superheroes and putting them in their own universe. Before The Avengers came out, Marvel's definitive masterpiece was Iron Man, and others were memorable as well, including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. When it was announced that Disney had purchased Marvel Studios, I panicked. Knowing the recent track record of Disney's live-action action blockbusters, I believed that Disney was going to dumb down the story and turn the story into a disaster. But, the advertisements looked awesome, and combining an all-star cast and the teaming of Marvel heroes had never been done before, so I ended up watching it opening weekend. Looking back, I realized that Disney didn't dumb down the story; along with director Joss Whedon, Disney has created a cinematic epic masterpiece, and is without a doubt the GREATEST SUPERHERO FILK EVER MADE, yes, even better that Christopher Nolan's masterpiece The Dark Knight.

Asgardian exile Loki (Tom Hiddelston) ends up on Earth, threating the safety of the world by using The Tesseract, a cube source of unlimited power, to unleash an alien race, called the Chitauri to destroy Earth as we know it. SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to unleash The Avengers program, bringing together a group of unique people to stop Loki from his evil scheme. Involved in this project includes billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Asgardian, and brother of Loki, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), patriot Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Agent Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). But Loki's manipulation causes The Avengers to turn against each other and allow a tragedy to strike. With one agent dead, The Avengers must put aside their differences in order to defeat Loki once and for all.

The Avengers also features Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Agent Hill, Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Eric Selvig, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Stan Lee cameos in a news footage scene.

Besides the fact that Disney purchased Marvel, the other thing that made me skeptical about The Avengers was the premise. I knew that a team of superheroes was a cool and awesome idea, but as we've witnessed in Michael Bay's Transformers, too much action is loud, noisy, and can be overdone, causing a film mess and a massive headache. But thankfully, Joss Whedon knows his action, and The Avengers features tons of exciting action without being Michael Bay overdone, causing The Avengers to knock the Transformers out of the park. Seriously, a 30-40 minute finale action sequence in New York featuring The Avengers in action is much, much more thrilling than multiple Autobots fighting evil Autobots, causing a confusing mess. One critic went as far as calling The Avengers ""Transformers with a brain"", and whoever that critic is, he's absolutely right. Besides the awesome finale, there's an exciting mission on SHIELD'S helicarrier, a flying naval ship, a massive showdown between Thor and Hulk, and an even more awesome fight scene between Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man.

Making The Avengers reach it's full potential is Joss Whedon's excellent script, filled with excellent humor and unforgettable dialogue. Also, the visual effects are Marvel's all-time best, finally making Hulk the beast he really is (by use of motion-capture), and the explosions in the New York battle jaw-dropping. I first saw The Avengers in 3D, which I rarely watch cause I'm not a huge fan of the format, is extremely jaw-dropping, and is currently the best non-IMAX 3D presentation I've witnessed (this is coming from someone who missed out on 3D viewings of Avatar, Hugo, Life of Pi, and Pacific Rim). Making the film worthwhile is Alan Silvestri's score. Silvestri mastered epic sounds with his Captain America score, and here, he outdoes himself even more. The Avengers theme is simply amazing and awesome and the score in general is one of the most thrilling, epic scores in recent memory.

But it's the all-star cast that is the greatest thing of all in The Avengers. My absolute favorite in the group is Robert Downey's performance of Iron Man. Downey continues to be extremely funny while being an awesome superhero genius. I was skeptical of Mark Ruffalo's take on The Hulk/Banner, cause while Edward Norton was excellent as Banner in the previous Hulk movie, he failed as Hulk cause Hulk was just a CG creation. Well, it turns out, not only does Ruffalo outdo Norton as Banner, but with the incredible motion-capture technology created on this beast, Ruffalo is awesome as Hulk as well, and makes a realistic creature that Norton's Hulk lacked. Norton probably regretted turning down the role now due to the huge money this film made. Chris Hemsworth continues to be awesome as Thor, while Tom Hiddleston is even more menacing as Loki and is the scene stealer in every scene. Captain America was likely the weakest super thus far, but here, Chris Evans reaches Cap to his true potential, making more excited to see his sequel now.  Scarlett Johansson continues to be an awesome chick as Black Widow, Clark Gregg is awesome and even moving as Coulson, and Samuel L. Jackson shows his cool and occasionally violent side as Nick Fury. While I wanted to witness his backstory than hear it from his own mouth, Jeremy Renner's take on Hawkeye is a good performance, and the lack of backstory does not hurt my score in any way. I just hope that in the future, Marvel will make a Hawkeye movie that will make me love the character even more.

Even with the new purchase of Disney, Marvel's The Avengers is the greatest superhero film ever made, featuring a truly excellent all-star cast, Joss Whedon's excellent direction and script, awesome action sequences that have common sense and not overdone like Bay's Transformers junk, Alan Silvestri's awesome, epic score, and features every single character in development and getting their chance to shine, plus the fact that the visual effects are Marvel at their very best. Phase 1 ends on a very high note, and Marvel has really raised the bar in their superhero films. Phase 2 started with Iron Man 3, and I am hoping their future releases will continue to impress and thrill. Now that Disney has purchased Lucasfilm, I have full confidence that Disney's new Star Wars film will be equally incredible."
"May 19, 2013",positive,"A great blend of action/comedy/drama/character study/geek out/Special Effects. It's the movie Michael Bay wishes he knew how to make. I didn't know how they'd manage to contain the 4 main characters (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk) without having one outshine the others, but they do, while still including a good amount of time for Nick Fury, Hawkeye, Black Widow and SHIELD. Impressive. The movie manages to set up the rivalries that underpin the Avengers (probably for later storylines) but still shows that when it's time to get together, then they do. Oh and Schwarmas. Tasty, tasty Schwarmas..."
"May 19, 2013",positive,THE MOST EPIC SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 19, 2013",positive,"Great film. Joss Whedon does an amazing job brining huge names together and not letting one overshadow another. Each character has their time at the forefront. The action is great and believable, even for a superhero movie.

"May 19, 2013",positive,"It was funny, dramatic, action filled, and a great family movie"
"May 19, 2013",positive,"The greatest superhero movie of all time, even better than dark Knight. An amazing cast, clever script, simple story, and great director this movie is great for anyone, from little kids to grandparents. The avengers was fantastic and action packed, great humour too. Loki wasnt trying to be a batman like villain, he just wanted to be respected. He is a great and likeable villain. Robert was great as usual as tony, as were Chris Evans and He worth. Mark ruffolo replaced Edward Norton, which was didn't annoy me that much honestly. He's a great Bruce banner. Overall, this is an outstanding superhero movie( and Disney didn't screw it up!)"
"May 19, 2013",positive,"Not only is this an excellent movie, but it serves as the link between the many franchises that Marvel has created, which in turn opens up a whole world of possibility."

"May 18, 2013",positive,Very good direction.

"May 17, 2013",neutral,"How this movie rated higher than Star Trek 2 is proof some people are just dumb. This was an overly long, boring movie that had no right to be.  Lots of super hero's standing around each fighting over screen time, a lame plot and an even lamer bad guy. Ohh, and Sam Jackson, the guy who'll do anything actually refrains from using the word ""niggar"" in this one, although sometimes he acts like Sam Jackson not a character."

"May 16, 2013",positive,"Good addition to the franchise, although certainly not as good as Thor or Captain America from a story perspective. Robert Downey, Jr. was not as good in this as he is in Iron Man works.  Scarlett Johannson a nice surprise as an action hero.  Nothing really bad about this, just not a great story."
"May 16, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is every kid's dream to see their favorite superheroes all together, for me it was a truly reborn of my love for movies, it made me felt some kind of excitement that I hadn't felt in years."
"May 16, 2013",positive,"What The Dark Knight did for seriousness and realism, The Avengers does for a fun, comedic, and joyful romp with a great ensemble of characters. As different as it was effective, this finally made it worth it to sit through all those Thor and Captain America movies and post credit scenes."
"May 16, 2013",positive,Great action movie. With favorite super hero's.
"May 16, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is everything you want in a summer blockbuster while making every fanboy wet themselves. 

Joss Whedon weaves a simple but strong story to bring these ""lost creatures"" together. He makes Captain America less of douchebag while unleashing RDJ in full blown Tony Stark mood. You'll feel like a kid in a candy shop just listening to the conversation between Banner and Stark. It's grand and larger than any movie before, but why shouldn't it be? Marvel has done something never done before in movies and it delivers on all levels. 

It wasn't going to be an easy journey for the characters to get along, not with such large egos, whether they flaunt it or not. 

Each character gets a good three actions scenes culminating in the final scene which was like stimulation overload. It's hard to not get chills when they finally all come together in epic fashion; with Banner revealing his ""secret"" and punching a freaking giant worm in the face. 

Tom Hiddleston takes a whiny character of Loki and makes him truly evil. Unsympathetic villain without any regard for human life. He sees humans as mere pawns and ants to be ruled under an iron fist. 

You'll walk away believing in superheroes."
"May 16, 2013",positive,Great movie overall. Wonderful action
"May 16, 2013",positive,"Great action, effects, characters, chemistry, acting, and that feeling ""this is epic""."

"May 15, 2013",positive,"Just plain awesome movie!!

I could tell you what is so awesome about this movie but there is just to much and I don';t want to type forever.
I personally expected it to be a good movie (Because the other Marvel movies are pretty good), But I didn't expect it to be this good... Period!
Loaded with action & comedy in moments. Anyone who gives this below 4 stars is just a hater plain and simple. Can't wait for the next one and the new Iron Man movie coming next summer."
"May 15, 2013",positive,"I fell the beginning of this wave of comic book movies began with the first Ironman, I saw that film in the theaters 5 times and it still blows me away. I gave the Avengers 5 stars because such a tremendous undertaking with so much talent in the cast and such a difficult setting to direct Joss Whedon did an excellent job. The only draw back to this film is that with so much going on it is hard to contain it to one movie I could feel at times the sense of urgency in the story telling, almost as if the writers knew they were running out of time to tell all of the story. This lead to the movie feeling rushed and implied at times, fans that are not familiar with the comic books or the characters may have found themselves lost at times. Other than that, this is a crowd pleasing thrill ride, for lack of a better word. I still enjoy watching this over and over today."
"May 14, 2013",positive,What more could you ask for in a movie?
"May 14, 2013",positive,"I really liked the Avengers. The story was very interesting, and the acting was very good as well. With that said, I thought the villain was more annoying than scary, and I really enjoyed watching them repeatedly kick his ass. But, the villain seemed more like a spoiled brat, who had found himself a new toy, then a believable villain. If it was not for each superhero, and their stories, I probably would not have lived it.

My favorite scene is probably the one where the villain is trying to enslave Iron man by touching his heart with his magic staff, only to find out that Iron Man doesn't have a human heart, and the hulk flies in through the window and kicks the villains ass! I was laughing so hard, thought I was going to cry.

It's a decent film, with all kinds of great effects, an a lot of unpredictable stuff, that make for a really great movie. One of the best super hero movies I have seen."

trevsreviews.wordpress.com

I know Marvel's The Avengers has been out for quite some time now, 96 days to be exact, but after my recent second viewing I was inspired to write this review.

The Avengers is a smoragasbord of superheroes including: Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. They're brought together by Nick Fury, played by the super-cool Samuel L. Jackson, to do, you guessed it, save the world from an evil invasion. Writer-Director Joss Whedon does a brilliant, and I mean brilliant, job here. I still don't know how he did it, but I'll get to that later.

Thor's adopted brother, Loki, the evil mastermind in the film, leads an army of giant flying slugs to destroy planet Earth. I'm actually glad they brought back Tom Hiddleston's character. His sly charisma and devilish charm was the only thing I liked in the pseudo-prequel Thor. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans both do their jobs as Thor and Captain America, respectively. Jeremy Renner does what he can with what he's given as Hawkeye. I thought Scarlett Johansson actually had some nice, human moments as Black Widow (as oppose to just looking pretty in spandex). Most people felt Mark Ruffalo stole the show as the Hulk, which I admit he did a fantastic job with the amount of pressure there was on him to deliver. However, no one else comes close to the level that Robert Downey Jr. is on. He simply shines in this film as Tony Stark/Iron Man. The way he excels with Tony Stark's humorous sass and human emotion when he loses a dear friend makes him look like a man among boys. I'll admit I'm a Robert Downey Jr. fan, so I am bias. Nonetheless, in my opinion, no one else could have played this role better (but yes he certainly had help from Joss Whedon, who gave him some of the best lines including a jab at the villain's ""shaft"").

Now let me state that I'm not a Joss Whedon fanboy. I've never seen a single episode of the critically acclaimed Firefly. The only other work I've seen of his is the hilarious Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. However, now, I'm slowly becoming one. The only reason why The Avengers succeeds so well is because of Joss Whedon. His writing is smart, hilarious, and masterfully arranged. Every scene feels like a little puzzle piece that Whedon perfectly assembled (no pun intended) together to create a complete picture that combines story, action, and character development beautifully. Even though this is a summer superhero blockbuster, this is a great film to study for any aspiring writers such as myself.

Now in the realm of superhero movies, I personally prefer the darker, realism that Christopher Nolan brings to the Dark Knight films. I would say Marvel's The Avengers is the best superhero movie, excluding the Dark Knight trilogy. Having that been said, I'm not entirely sure The Avengers gets all of the credit for that title. A part of me asks, ""Is The Avengers really that good, or does it just appear to be because it's surrounded by the mere mediocrity of its Marvel superhero movie counterparts?"" (Captain America, Iron Man 1 & 2, and Thor - which was a 1/5 for me). In the end, I think it's a little bit of both.

However, putting the genre population aside, The Avengers is pure fun. It is cheesy in every sense of the word. It's a superhero movie mash-up bonanza! I practically heard a comic book fanboy orgasm a few rows behind me. But what makes The Avengers special is that it knows it and is not afraid to make fun of itself. It knows it's not an Oscar contender. It knows why it was made - to haul in the masses for huge (HUGE) profit. However, this film doesn't feel like it was made for the money. You can tell the cast and crew really put their heart and soul into the film (and had a lot of fun doing it). I wish more blockbusters were made with more genuine care and dedication like this one, as oppose to just splattering CGI on the screen a la Battleship. A good movie doesn't have to be a powerful, heavy drama. It can be a silly blockbuster. Thanks to Joss Whedon and company, seeing The Avengers was the most fun I've had at the movies in a very long time."

Even after being home for an hour my mind was still reeling from this one!! Un cufking believable!! Start to finish action, the story line i thought might be sketchy but everything came together in a timely fashion. Marvel really took their time with this one and really hit it out of the park. They get super kudos for this one. Mind blowing!! And people if you haven't learned yet don't leave before the very end of the film. I will not spoil it for all you true believers who have not seen the movie yet, but don't leave, they are setting up the premise for Avengers 2, and the bad guy for the next film is going to blow your mind!!!!! Nuf said!!! This one gets a full 5 stars from this house, wished I owned 1/10 of 1% of this film, i'd never have to work again! This is going to be the years best grossing film, no questions asked. So it's a must see film for any Marvel fan, most definitely worth the price of admission! After seeing it I would say it's worth it at twice the price! So to all uou true believers I say ""Excelsior"" !!!!!!!"

"May 12, 2013",positive,Best movie I've ever seen
"May 11, 2013",positive,"It achieves its place as one of the best superhero movies ever. The dialogue works, the action sequences are cool and the comedy is really the icing on the cake. Joss Whedon successfully brings together genres the same way he successfully brings together superheroes."
"May 11, 2013",positive,"One of the coolest movies I've ever seen. Epic, extraordinary, and a bit hilarious, Marvel's The Avengers is a one-of-a-kind blockbuster. Love it!"

"May 10, 2013",positive,"Although it does suffer from a rather dull first thirty minutes, Avengers does provide the team up fans have been waiting for, giving each member equal time to shine, and of course, gives plenty of time for some great set pieces.

3.5/5 stars"
"May 10, 2013",positive,"Marvel gets serious and finally conquers the world with this enormous blockbuster.
Six dispair personalities, including an egoccentric, genious millionare, a patriotic soldier with a  dad-caring sense of responsibility, a Northern, brute God, a guy with problems to control its greeny and chaotic anger and a pair of meticulous assassins meet to face what is presumably the greatest superhero final battle in film history. Watch half of the end credits to get an astonishing final surprise for the sequel. Pure entertainment, pure epicness. An instant classic."
"May 10, 2013",positive,Should have been called Iron Man 3!
"May 10, 2013",positive,The biggest crowd pleaser in geek history!
"May 10, 2013",neutral,Entertaining fast paced action superhero movie. Same story all the time.
"May 10, 2013",positive,"pretty awesome to bring all the stars  together, wish there was more to the writing though.."
"May 9, 2013",negative,"It was a very childish film and once again chris hemsworth's acting sucked. I really didnt enjoy this compared to the dark knight trilogy, dc all the way."
"May 9, 2013",positive,"The Avengers. Simply saying the name makes audiences tremble in awe. It is widely known to be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, for bringing together some of Marvel's greatest heroes and having them all kick ass against aliens, while also forcing them to learn to cope with each other. This was the film of the year that every single living critic on the planet gave a 10/10, 5/5, 4/4, A+, 100%. Do I think the film deserves a 100%? No. In fact, I may consider the film to be just a little bit overrated. But did the film kick ass? You bet it did.

I'll make my praise of the film short, because everything I say has probably been said before. Well, where do I begin. For starters, the action kicked ass, even by superhero standards. The Manhattan alien battle was stunningly rendered, reminding me of some of the finest moments from Transformers. The special effects are equally stunning, and the cinematography is gorgeous. Simply put, the film is visually stunning. The actors have remarkable chemistry with each other, all giving excellent performances as usual. The only actor that I really didn't like was Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought he was flat, unemotive, and just flat-out bland. He looked the part, he just didn't act the part. But everyone else was excellent. Alan Silversti score is simply magnificent, almost rivaling Hans Zimmer for the best superhero musical score. The film's dialogue is smartly written and well delivered, doing a good job of keeping the humor balanced and not going too over-the-top.

Basically, those are the positives. I can't really go into much detail about them, because they're just so obvious. One really big thing I disliked about the movie is its lack of explanation for several plot devices, like: how the fuck did Loki survive falling into the crevasse? Wasn't that supposed to be him committing suicide, or whatever? I'm sorry, did I miss something, some detail? I don't know. And wasn't breaking the Azgard bridge in Thor supposed to break all connectivity with the human world? And what was the deal with Hulk saying ""I'm always angry""? What does that mean? None of it really made sense. But I understand that the film has a lot of ground to cover, so I can't blame it too much. Also, I thought the film took a little too long to develop in the first half. There wasn't even that much interaction between the heroes until much later. I think the pacing could have used a slight touchup.

Really, those are my only big criticisms. I do think the film is a bit overrated. I mean, it's not particularly thought-provoking or unbelievably intelligent, it's just good popcorn fun. It's certainly no Dark Knight Rises, but it's one of the better films of 2012. I know this review is rather simplified, but that's pretty much the way this film can be summed up. There's not much to talk about, not much detail that can be given about its pros and cons. The film is fun and enjoyable, and it's worth a watch on Blu-ray."
"May 9, 2013",positive,"Being from India, I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing Avengers last night. The movie is long, which is to be expected since every character was given his own Movie just to bring them all together....but every minute of the movie was about something....there was never a idle moment in the whole show. It was fast, it was beautiful to watch and it was funny.The casting was near perfect, although i think Hawkeye deserved a more meatier role than a simple mind controlled enemy reverted to friend. Everyone else did their roles superbly....especially The Hulk....Mark Ruffalo pulled off being timid and imposing at the same time [Although sometimes he felt really dumb]. The villan is my favorite character in any movie/comic book and I must say, i was disappointed at Loki. Loki is the god of Night, and above all...the god of mischief...i think the directors have taken it in a childish sense....since Loki is nothing more than a angry brat. He is as Tony stark says ""A Diva"" however....he seemed pretty weak and easily led to me.On the whole....the movie is superb, theres action, theres comedy [Especially with the Hulk], theres drama and intensity....and theres Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow....need one say more??"
"May 9, 2013",positive,"Easily one of the greatest action movies ever created. The chemistry of the characters is fantastic. I could try to name a weak spot in this movie, but I seriously don't think there is one. A movie that will be talked about and re-watched for decades to come."
"May 9, 2013",positive,"after many years of waiting the avengers is finally here. lets put the clock to a few years ago. when i first heard joss whedon was directing i didnt know what to think. i didnt think it was a bad choice i just didnt know. sure iv seen a few episodes of buffy buts thats all. now lets skip forward to the fist interview i saw with him about the movie. i knew from then on marvel had made the right choice. he sounded so passionate about making movie for fans and how he wanted us see these charcters. and wasnt wrong, the avengers is fantstic movie and im opinion the best marvel movie so far.  the avengers strong point is its dialougue. joss whedon now im my opnion has the best dialogue than any other screenwriter. its clever its wity and makes you care about the charcters. now dont get me wrong the action scenes are top notch espcially the last one and the one with hulk( side note. this hulk is far the best. mark ruffaloo kills edward norton and eric bana in the role) but the dialouge is the films strong point.    this movie is the defintion of a comic book movie. it literally is like a comic book coming to screen. the visuals and dialogue joss whedon uses makes it so. the cast are superb . its amazing that  joss can not let one character overshadow the other. fantastic!!!  now to the negative points and i know this is just nitpicking. the reason i give it 4 and a half stars out of five is just because even though the dialouge and humour are fantastic they do they do both seem a bit to try hardand in your face sometimes. and also some of the action sequences at the end even though they are fantastic  look abit fake especially when cars are being blown you can clearly see they are just adding a bit of cgi if thats sense. but other than these two thing the movie is superb. so to finish up , see this movie and bring on avengers 2!!( nowone but joss whedon must be aloud to write and direct)"
"May 9, 2013",positive,An amazing movie! Wow just wow!
"May 9, 2013",positive,An excellent addition to the Marvel franchise. The only thing wrong with the film is the tedious fight scene between two disliked characters: Hawkeye & Black Widow.
"May 9, 2013",positive,Absolutely Fantastic.
"May 8, 2013",positive,All hands down to one of the best of best superhero action movie ever!
"May 8, 2013",neutral,It was an alright movie
"May 8, 2013",positive,This was probably the biggest nerd-gasm I've ever experienced.
"May 7, 2013",positive,Easily the best superhero movie.  Like a sci-fi Return of the King.  A solid 9.4 is my rating.  Great acting and a very action-packed thriller
"May 7, 2013",positive,"I believe that The Avengers was the most riskiest project ever. Marvel took 4 years to bring The Avengers to the Big Screen. It is not an easy job to make a movie with such iconic characters. Joss Whedon did a perfect job with these characters. Loki is my second favorite super villain of all time, next to Joker Of Course. After The Avengers I'm looking forward to all the Marvel Phase 2 movies. They are doing a great job not to mention Iron Man 3, It was a disaster. It is so much fun to watch these characters interact and Hulk steals this show like taking a candy from a baby. The Avengers is Awesometacular!"
"May 7, 2013",positive,BRILLIANT AND LEGENDTASTIC!!!! I HAVE SEEN THE AWESOMENESS SINCE THE TIME WHEN THE WORLD HAS ENDED!!!! IT HAS THE ULTIMATE ALIEN INVASION OF 2012!!!!!! THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
"May 7, 2013",positive,"This movie was great, my only concern was that some of the characters whim were underdeveloped had significant roles such as: Black Widow, and Hawkeye."
"May 6, 2013",neutral,"2.5: Hmm, I don't think I am terribly impressed.  It certainly doesn't deserve to be the biggest box office hit of the year.  It seemed reasonably entertaining, but nothing more.  The cast is star-studded, but I couldn't quite get into it.  I kept wishing I were watching a full version of practically any of the one characters.  By combining so many characters and stars into one cast, basically everyone gets shortchanged.  Directors like Altman and PT Anderson can obviously make an ensemble film like this, but Whedon is no Altman.  The MacGuffin seemed tired, as did virtually the entire plot.  I felt virtually no urgency, exhilaration, or excitement.  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood.  I'm sure I'll find it entertaining in a mindless sort of way the next time around as well, hopefully more so."
"May 6, 2013",positive,5 stars...great mix of so many super heroes in 1 picture.  They all worked and created a comic book super movie for the ages.  Watched this movie 2 time at theater...that is rare with the higher prices of theater tickets these days.  Then ordered it online in Bluray.  Hoping the follow-up movie will be as good if not better.  Captain America did great job as combat leader during the main battle.
"May 5, 2013",positive,The main thing that i loved about this movie is that it had more than one protaginist and that all of them were played by brilliant actors. it has a brilliant plot and lots of awesome fighting and action scenes.
"May 5, 2013",positive,"An entertaining rollercoaster ride where even conversational scenes make it more then what it already delivered. It's at best a popcorn film, probably of all time."
"May 5, 2013",positive,Best Movie Ever!! Joss Whedon is awesome and is even more awesome that he managed to bring the greatest supper heroes of all time together.
"May 5, 2013",positive,Going into this film I was very skeptical and was sure it would be bad. I assumed that Disney/Marvel would make it Iron Man featuring the Avengers. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that each hero got ample amount of screen time and the story was a good blend for the characters to interact in. Joss Wheadon has given us another wonderful piece of film history.
"May 5, 2013",positive,What I thought would be a disaster was a great action packed movie.
"May 5, 2013",positive,love comic book movie this one really rocked
"May 5, 2013",positive,It is really hard to bring all those hero into a team. It just feel great when people put down their difference and work together!
"May 5, 2013",positive,"I love to watch this, really very very good and excellent, especially what Hulk done to Thor, I love to watch this.  WOW very fantasy!!!"
"May 4, 2013",positive,This movie was the epic movie of Earth's mightiest hero's: Iron-Man Hulk Captain America and Thor. It had humor and some other movie characters like Jane's Dad from Thor Nick. F and more plus awesome action the only reason this movie doesn't get full stars is because Captain America sucks and Hulk can control his anger which is not explained and the stupid scene at the end of the credits! Plus it didn't live up to it's hype at all but overall not the best Marvel movie but not the worst.
"May 4, 2013",positive,Needs a little better story line... But overall great movie
"May 4, 2013",positive,"Growing up with comics, I can happily say we are in the golden age of comic source movies. This one is the best because of the interactions between superheroes. Hulk and Thor made me laugh! Got to see it again in 3D on a Disney cruise ship. Disney has done a great job shepherding all these projects to this point."
"May 4, 2013",positive,Coolest Movie Ever!  Loved seeing everyone together!
"May 4, 2013",positive,I love super heros and this movie.Best movie i have ever watched
"May 4, 2013",positive,"On paper, this may look like a convoluted mess. Fortunately, they hired the perfect director for the ocassion, Joss Whedon, and what resulted was a movie where not only do all the characters shine and are relevant, but its story is as engrossing as it is just epic. Combine that with dazzling action sequences and out-of-this-world special effects, and you have what is, as of now, the best Marvel comic-book adaptation ever, one of the best superhero movies ever, one of the best action movies ever made, and one of the best movies of the year."
"May 4, 2013",positive,"Really, really, really great film. Solid script, great characters, intense action. Avengers provides the audience with what they paid for. I cannot stress how great this film was enough. Anticipating the second film very much!"
"May 4, 2013",positive,it was spectacular movie foul
"May 4, 2013",positive,Whedon treads a delicate balance with the finesse and grace of a tightrope walker. Johansson's wooden acting is a speed bump in the midst of great characterization and a stellar script. Ruffalo in particular stands out as the first Hulk that leaves nothing to be desired.
"May 4, 2013",positive,the avengers was action packed filled from captain america to thor to iron man to hulk to hawk eye to the widow it was so much fun
"May 4, 2013",positive,Well written and entertaining.

"May 3, 2013",positive,One of the best Super-Hero Movies ever.
"May 3, 2013",negative,"The beginning of the film relied extremely heavily on the audience's previous understanding of the comics, along with a series of boring action sequences, bad dialogue and flat performances. Don't get me wrong; I'm a comic fan but as its own entity the film jumped all over the place.

The flat acting never improved, with characters coming across as cardboard cut-outs with nothing more to do than throw out unfunny one-liners and argue with each other. Almost every piece of dialogue contained plot exposition in the most overt way possible, i.e. ""You know that X is happening? This is because Y. You already knew that, but the audience didn't"". Film is a visual medium, not a radio play.

While I do agree that the film was a fun representation of the comics it was based on to some extent, at no point were any of the characters relatable and nor were their decisions. For example: a character we neither know or care much about dies (much less each of The Avengers themselves) and yet this motivates the main characters into action. I spent most of the film trying to justify in my own mind the decisions characters made along with their sudden 180-degree turns from one idea to another. Which brings me to the lack of consistency in the characters; having just met, the dialogue comes across as though they've worked together for years in this organisation, only seconds later to reveal their personalities suddenly don't mesh at all. Overall, self-indulgent in-jokes and one-liners take the place of truthful character interactions.

I would forgive this in the name of mindless enjoyment if not for the very backwards-looking visual effects, in which nothing much looked convincing. Likewise the cinematography ranged from fake-looking light sources (which screamed studio set) to shots which looked like home movies; perhaps this was an attempt to capture some realism following Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, but if so the filmmakers missed the point. Indeed the compositional choices in general did little to complement each scene and the events taking place. All these elements did was to break the viewer's suspension of disbelief and make the other flaws more glaringly obvious due to disengagement with the story.

I have to say, during the large fight scene about 3/4 of the way into the film, I started to forget (finally) about some of these problems. This was perhaps because this was the first time in which the pacing was constructed to add excitement and draw in the audience at last. Even within these sections though there were jarring moments of disbelief (how many damn arrows fit into Hawkeye's quiver?!) and jokes which missed the mark completely. Worst of all were the frequent similarities with a large number of sci-fi/action flicks from Independence Day through to the abomination that is the Transformers trilogy.

I could go on about the problems with The Avengers for quite some time, but this is just an overview of the most prominent issues which affected my enjoyment of the film. In actuality I don't think there was a single scene that wasn't packed with unbelievable character actions, fake-looking visuals and/or logical errors.

In its favour, the film did a very good job of providing a framework onto which fans of the genre could place their preconceived notions of the characters and the Marvel Universe, in order to overlook the oddities which arose continuously throughout the film. It was nice to see these characters united at last in live action, just disappointing how bad its execution was."
"May 3, 2013",positive,Best Hero Movie ever.!
"May 3, 2013",positive,"Really good movie, can't wait for sequel!"
"May 3, 2013",positive,One of the Best Marvel Film so far.
"May 3, 2013",positive,A wonderful blockbuster!  Both amusing and exciting!
"May 2, 2013",positive,"Perfect summer action film.  Doesn't take itself too serious, has some fun along the way, and delivers visually."
"May 1, 2013",positive,"The opening scenes were very different from what I expected, however the movie, in no way, let me down!"
"May 1, 2013",positive,Almost everything you want and would expect from a superhero filled film like this
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,"Una gran película de superhéroes, la mejor del año, pero con falta de seriedad."
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,it was ok wasn't as great as i thought it would have been
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,best superhero movie off all time
"Apr 30, 2013",negative,I am glad they kept the same actors. Good story line lots of action
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,The best action movie ever made
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,One of the best superhero movies I have ever seen!
"Apr 30, 2013",negative,Absolutely loved it and can't wait until part two. I wish Edward Norton  played the hulk but still a great movie.
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,A monumental film that has never been done before. A Marvel fan's dream come true.
"Apr 30, 2013",positive,I don't want to talk about it. I get emotional about how fucking awesome this was. Phil <3
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,Super movie!! I have watched at least 18 times! Mark Ruffalo is PERFECT as Bruce Banner! Please don't change him!! I love this movie and can't wait until the next one!!
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,"On the action scale, The Avengers gets an A+.  On the thought side, it receives a solid B.  Nothing special, but certainly good enough to elevate it far above the Transformers series.  Amazing action with an average plot, good acting, and above average dialogue."
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,It's Whedon. What's not to love?
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,"Kinda love this even though I shouldn't. Story wise and character wise, there is nothing going on. Absolutely nothing! Here's where it gets good, this movie feels so big..!! The fact that this movie combines characters from four different franchises, and just feels so epic! It's never ever boring, it's hilarious, colorful, this movie has it all. The fact that this even came to be is commendable, and the whole movie I just had that giddy laughter you get only from pure joy. This probably couldn't have been executed in a better way, it's just so much fun"
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,"Loved it, favourite Marvel movie to date, really brought the characters together. Few little bits that were missing... still don't know what was going on with the Hulk, and Hawkeye got a bit short changed in it, but still a fantastic movie."
"Apr 29, 2013",positive,"Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America come together with Hawkeye & Black Widow to take down Loki. I saw this at the cinema (not in 3D) and I really enjoyed it. The way I put the trailer clips together into a story in went completely a different way which I was glad of. I enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other. There are a few twists in this that I really wasn't expecting. The dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny, more jokes and hilarious quips than I expected which were really good. I'm glad it wasn't really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and it's just The Avengers. Even people who haven't seen the rest of the MCU I think will enjoy it as there isn't much depth and a lot is explained like why the Hulk is why he is and how they found Cap alive; so with very slight back stories and awesome plot I will get this DVD and everyone else needs to too! YES, right now! Go!"
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,One of the best superhero movies i have ever seen. The action are AMAZING. The characters are well developed. The screenplay was entertaining. Joss Whedon is a very good screenwriter and film director. The plot isn't mindblowing though. It's a superhero movie....were you expecting a spectacular plot?
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,Perfect and Iron Man is sexy
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,Lots of fun but doesn't match the quality of The Dark Knight Rises. Easy movie to watch.
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,Awesome movie in all. Kept mymy interest from beginning to end. I would have preferred storyline be small bit less complex but that could be nitpicking. All actors/ actresses played their role to the tee. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson role as Nick Fury. The ending set up for what I expect a awesome phase 2 of the marvel universe.
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,"A good movie, without a doubt, a nice tie-in from the movies so far, but it did not leave a lasting impression on me. Stunning visual effects, great performances. Just not my favorite comic book movie. C+/B"
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,Best hero movie clash ever
"Apr 28, 2013",positive,I've been waiting for this years.
"Apr 27, 2013",positive,"Definitely one of the best super hero movies ever made, pretty excited seeing all these characters in the same movie, hoping Marvel keeps going with these great movies"

"Apr 26, 2013",positive,Best super hero movie ever!!!
"Apr 26, 2013",positive,"***
I found it enjoyable and lot of fun, but the Avengers is really lacking in any form of plot, and the enemies of the movie aren't developed at all and even look cliched."
"Apr 26, 2013",positive,AWESOME! My favorite movie of all time!
"Apr 26, 2013",positive,"One of the best movies of 2012, The Avengers lived up to the years of hype and provided a spectacular and unforgettable superhero blockbuster. Joss Whedon perfectly brings each character to the screen and provides the best action sequence of the year and is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight."
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,"Action Packed, Awesome, Great, Amazing, Incredible, Spectacular Movie"
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,"I may not be familiar with the whole history of the Avengers, but I really did enjoy this film.  I saw the midnight release and it was a true action-packed thriller.  I'm sure some comic book fans found some or many things wrong with this film, but I loved it."
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,Action-packed with stunning special effects. 'The Avengers' is one of the best super-hero films of the past 10 years!

"Apr 25, 2013",positive,Add a Review (Optional)
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,"""The Avengers"" is as good as comic book superhero movies ever get, and that proves to be extremely good, indeed. There is a reason that Joss Whedon has become a brand name in the world of sci-fi and fantasy. His deft touch is on full display here, expertly mixing engaging characterization, snappy dialog and plenty of brilliant action. Everything about this movie is great."
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,The humor and effects are great. And I LOVE that they changed Hawk-eye's costume (the purple suit felt gay.) The acting is really good and I recommend it.
"Apr 25, 2013",positive,"love this movie, must watch if your a superhero fan, it's funny and the relationship between characters is great along with good story and great special effects"
"Apr 24, 2013",positive,Breathtaking special effects and enough star power to light up the universe!
"Apr 24, 2013",positive,"With the unprecedented Avengers, Whedon has accomplished what many believed to be impossible: an on-screen superhero team up.  Intense action perfectly balances with thoughtful character development.  Moments of genuine emotion and earnestness compliment a spirit of fun and adventure.  Honestly, what can I say that hasn't already been said?"
"Apr 24, 2013",positive,"A lighter ""Dark Knight."" The conflict of the members of the Avengers works well, yet can be annoying after a while. Despite that, the extremely well executed action makes up for it."
"Apr 24, 2013",positive,Awesome. Perhaps my favourite super hero movie yet. Stark steals the show again.
"Apr 23, 2013",positive,a fun action film. funny dialog and great action. I recommend it to anyone who likes comic books.
"Apr 23, 2013",positive,thiz movie was the bomb
"Apr 23, 2013",positive,"Full of action,star filled cast,awsome"
"Apr 23, 2013",positive,"The best superhero movie ever! Great writing to bring these heroes together, and giving us all what we were expecting!"
"Apr 22, 2013",positive,"It was a very good movie!!! Lot of action!! There just needs to be more comedy and romance. The 3 things I look for in a movie are action, comedy, and romance. It does have a lot of action, very little romance, and a barely any comedy. But overall it was a great movie!!!So my final decision is to give it 3 and a half stars."
"Apr 22, 2013",positive,"Good watch, slightly long winded getting everyone together, roll on number 2!!!"
"Apr 21, 2013",positive,"Por fin la vi, esperé tenerla en bluray para aprovecharla totalmente, ademas del hecho de que es una buena historia, los efectos especiales son de primera y robert es mi amor platónico jaja recomendable!"

"Apr 20, 2013",positive,awesome movie. tons of action nothing short of a masterpiece
"Apr 20, 2013",neutral,"A solid super hero flick, great effects. However, nothing particularly groundbreaking and a bit over-long"
"Apr 20, 2013",positive,All the marvel heroes come together to make a fantastic team. I love iron man and can't wait until the third one.
"Apr 20, 2013",positive,"Well it is entertaining, but still a simple comics-action movie without any contant."
"Apr 20, 2013",positive,action packed really enjoyed it
"Apr 19, 2013",positive,"Very entertaining. Just the right balance of action, superheroes and mushy storyline. Can't wait for the second one."
"Apr 19, 2013",positive,"Movie was good but it was pretty over hyped I'll say. To much talking at a certain point , not bad but not that great . Good"
"Apr 19, 2013",positive,immersed in the marvel world you find yourself looking at the time hoping for avengers to continue one of the best movies ive seen. the story was just right. they didnt just band together alk cohesively. the had to bond and fight through there differences. awesome movie that left you wanting more. we are all looking forward to the sequel.
"Apr 19, 2013",positive,This movie and the movies that built up to it redefined what a superhero movie could be or should be. It has a perfect balance of giving each of the characters time to shine and comedy laugh-lines with plenty of action. There are multiple times that each character shows relatable emotion on-screen that just ties you to them and makes them feel like real people you could know and like. In my opinion it is the best movie of the superhero genre to ever be made
"Apr 18, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is one of marvels best, and it's not a dumb mindless summer film like many others."
"Apr 18, 2013",negative,This really didn't live up to a lot of my expectations. Joss Whedon has been known to do better and I was disappointed that he didn't. He did well for what it was but there were a lot of good things that just weren't done.
"Apr 17, 2013",positive,what can be said about this movie. it was amazing. I wish hawkeye had a bigger part.  but this movie.. just wow
"Apr 17, 2013",positive,"I began to watch The Avengers the other night and was reminded why it was such a cool movie. The cast of the movie included Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman), Chris Evans (Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury). All of the actors/actresses that I just listed are incredible actors/actresses. 
	The reason this movie was a box office hit was because of the cast, the action, and the humor. There were many action scenes, as well as, funny scenes and scenes where you felt as if you were actually in the room. The movie had a great story line, which came with its rivalry between some characters, as well as, chemistry with others. The ratio of action to comedy was just about perfect in this movie, the reason being is because of the key ingredient of comedy... timing. Another piece that made the movie funny was Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Loki (Tom Hiddleton).  Tony Stark being the corky/crazy guy he is makes the character great. Loki (Tom Hiddleton), is sarcastic at times and very witty. He cracks jokes whenever an opportunity comes up.  In this movie Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a Norse God, comes to Earth in search of something of great importance and power. In the process he causes chaos and brings on war. Nick fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is not fond of this idea and gathers a group that we all call the Avengers. 
	As Loki was preparing to begin a war, he was caught, but when his accomplices did what he commanded, they eventually freed him. This stirred up quite a large amount of chaos. The Avengers were dispersed and eventually all gathered up to fight the Chitauri army that was attacking New York.
	Tony and Captain are not the best of friends throughout the movie but when the time came for them to work together, they stepped up their game.  The Avenger's fought against the Chitauri in New York City. Although they did cause a lot of damage to New York, the battle was a great one.
	All in all, this movie was great. It is a movie that the family can sit down and watch together and it's even a movie for all ages. Whether you are a comic geek or business person doesn't matter, because this movie kicks ass. I am neither a comic geek nor business person and I loved it. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch. This is a movie that you don't necessarily need to know all of the characters to understand what is going on (although it is probably better if you know the characters). And to tell everyone the truth, I couldn't find anything bad about the movie, they really knocked it out of the ball park with this one."
"Apr 17, 2013",positive,"I love this movie really the effects is so amazing, the adaptation is very good,  this movie contains all the action, fun, abeyance and excitement,  is a fantastic movie"
"Apr 16, 2013",negative,I was not a fan. Thankfully it is over and I have a year to wait until the next one.
"Apr 16, 2013",neutral,"As I settled in for Marvel's The Avengers (to cite its full title) my mind began to drift back a few years, all the way back to another Marvel action team, The X-Men. I complained then that the problem of multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control. How do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers? The X-Men series never straightened out this problem, but with Marvel's The Avengers, this is not an issue.

It was a smart plan for Marvel Studios to build the characters one at a time, giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here. As a lead-in we got Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), and last summer's Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger - next up is Nick Fury. With that, by the time we get to Marvel's The Avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us. That frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action, although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one.

The Avengers are more interesting to me than The X-Men because they come from different places. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is Norse God from another galaxy; Captain America (Chris Evans) is a genetically-altered Army strongman from the 1940's; Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is a green muscle mass hiding out in India under the passive alter ego of Bruce Banner; and Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the Chrysler Building in New York. Plus there's an archer called Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and a token female, Russian-born woman named Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who, I think, is good with martial arts. For whatever reason, these last two didn't get a movie of their own, but stay tuned.

The Avengers, like The X-Men, are also led by a secretive bald-headed authority figure with a handicap. He is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who runs a shadow organization called S.H.I.E.L.D., whose function is to stop super villains from . . . well, doing super-villainy I suppose. The task here is to get back an object called the Tesseract, an object that - if I understood it correctly - acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy. That's bad news for our planet because it means that the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adopted half-brother, can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful super-army. It also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain S.H.I.E.L.D personnel. Loki's first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world: Germany. Maybe he hasn't heard, but that's probably not a wise place to start.

The Avenger's personalities are known to us, but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another. In this movie, many are meeting each other for the first time and no one knows who can be trusted. That's especially true with a tense relationship between Iron Man and Thor. Since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil Loki, can he be trusted? Another issue of tension comes with the addition of Bruce Banner. Everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyone's apprehension that Hulk's destructive nature could be a potential problem.

The most engaging character in the film, for me, is Bruce Banner, played this time by Mark Ruffalo, who manages to pull off the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role. Ruffalo plays Banner as a mild-mannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check. He does something interesting; he quiets his voice to a calm, mellow, deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls ""The Other Guy."" I liked his rendition of Bruce Banner although I think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show Bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check (maybe with the mantra ""Keep calm and carry on.""). That might have been perfect.

I liked the character touches in Marvel's The Avengers. I liked the dialogue, which is written at a smart, snappy level by writer-director Joss Whedon. He has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive. He is the man behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", Toy Story and a brilliant horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods, still in theaters.

I just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act. He's a smart writer but the movie goes into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that we've seen a million times. It would have been see the same inventive brilliance as the last act of The Cabin in the Woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special. His Avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue. When you stand back and look at the plot as a whole, you see that it really doesn't add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world. His movie, as it stands, exists somewhere between the ho-hum of The X-Men and the brilliant extravaganza of The Dark Knight. It isn't a perfect film, but I enjoyed it probably more than I expected."
"Apr 16, 2013",positive,This may be the worst movie of all time. NEXT
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,Best movie I ever seen
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,"The true example of a great summer blockbuster.  The Avengers is a great superhero film that's a spectacle to watch.  Whedon, Feige, and Penn do a fabulous job at integrating six very different characters from entirely different films into one masterpiece.  The whole cast is nearly perfect and puts on huge show.  Ripped straight out of the comics, The Avengers is a major success for Marvel for a five year ambitious project, and is on the right track in this cinematic universe it has created."
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,The most fun I've had at the movies in a long time! The critics need to relax and enjoy the fun. Exactly how I wanted to kick off summer movie season.
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,"One of film's greatest achievements! Bringing characters from all franchises together! Only Marvel can pull this off! Excellent visuals. Great cast. Epic story. Avengers, Assemble!"
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,"Went into watching this thinking, after watching 'Captain America', can it get any worse? But, i was stunningly surprised and impressed! Characters who i thought were portrayed to weak in previous films, took a lead in which i felt their characters were more projected and the acting was amazing! Too good! LOVED it! And the new additions to the cast are brilliant and had be hooked!"
"Apr 15, 2013",positive,Best superhero movie ever
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,I Love it! Great make up artist & special effects. I love the hulk!
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,I had to record all of the other movies to I got caught up. Loved it! Can't wait for Ironman 3!
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,"great blend of action and thriller, its been a long time since they've came out with one."
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,"Was that it? Seriously? 1 hour of inane dialogue and one hour of just overblown action? I get it, I really do, you have all the character development in the first half to make the ending more powerful, I understand. But when the hour before it was just completely hollow dialogue that really had nothing to say it just came off as pointless and boring. One line of how Bruce Banner tried to kill himself is not good character development, it is just something that was just started and then never added to. Hawkeye and Black Widow are boring super heroes who no one cares about with Hawkeye being completely useless after he runs out of arrows. I don't particularly care for Hulk and Thor that much. I like Captain America and Iron Man though. I liked their rivalry and the banter they shared with Robert Downey Jr. doing what he does best; have a good time. His dialogue made me laugh quite frequently and it was just fun to watch him. Even if I personally did not like the first half the script was great at making the characters feel the same from the movie that they were in and I liked the fact that they were not all friends from the get-go, I like how they had to grow as a team and the scene before the final fight begins where they are all standing together was quite awesome. It is a Joss Whedon film so of course the visuals looked spectacular and the action was very nice but I'd have preferred a mix of talking and action but I cannot really see that working well here. Even so, after all was said and done I did have a smile on my face just because of the enjoyment of the ending, so the movie must be doing something right. I am not one to listen to hype because I am usually let down because of over-hype but I do feel that people need to calm down with this. The movie is merely average, it is just the spectacle of seeing all these heroes together at once. Although, if you love it, more power to you, have fun."
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,"The Avengers superhero film, written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film was produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The movie is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. Starring ensemble cast of Robert Downy Jr. Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and more. 

The Avengers grossed $1.51 billion worldwide, topping it to the list of highest-grossing films of all time at #3. 

Loki (main antagonist villain from Thor and an adoptive brother of Thor) is stealing the Tesseract (a sparkling cube of infinite power from the movie Captain America: The First Avenger) from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick. Loki is planning to go on the human race to tie them with his own rule. Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Hawk and Thor all have to assemble together to face this prevailing threat to planet earth. 

I missed this movie in theater on purpose (thank God to save myself from sitting through more than 2hrs). While the movie does prove joyful for the viewers and fans, but simply it stretches too far, it seemed like the avengers themselves were being part at destroying much of the city. 

I love the Hulk character, loved the Ang Lee summarizing the character's definitive approach to unlocking mystery of what simply gripped and feared him the most. Ang Lee version was the assumptive analysis of the Hulk that so little movies really dare to tackle and present to viewers (of course the fans obsessed with Hulk in action missed much part of that). I loved Edward Norton in sequel, and I got to learn about Mark Ruffalo (one of my top-favorite actors) playing the character, I was too excited to see the film. I could not understand (though) why Dr. Bruce Banner would go and live in Kolkatta (India), if he had to hide? There are several other nations, where he could quite easily hide from those looking for him; such as Cuba, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, or Pakistan (but as it has always been the case the producers needed to attract the 2nd largest population of a country in the world for ticket-sales) 

Excellent witty touch of humor from Robert Downy Jr. made it quite enjoyable - a pure annihilation-filled film of 2012."
"Apr 14, 2013",positive,Sheer entertainement.

"Apr 13, 2013",positive,"Great characters, great actors and great dialogue but the plot was lacking- Loki needed to be more evil and powerful- it was like he was over powered and over whelmed- Heroes are as good as their villains- witness Darth Vader vs luke. Enough said."

"Apr 11, 2013",positive,"Rating: A+
Without a doubt one of the greatest superhero movies- one of the greatest movies, for that matter- I have ever seen. Spectacular special effects, clever humor, and great directing, The Avengers is an AWESOME film. Almost every character in this movie really could not have been cast any more perfectly. Seriously, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Two thumbs up for that one, Marvel. All of the build-up movies were pretty good, and I did not see any that I did not enjoy. Since I have seen pretty much every superhero movie ever, I have great expectations for almost all of them. This one goes beyond the imagination more than any other film. Almost any superhero movie after this was great. Man of Steel, The Wolverine, Iron Man 3, Dark Knight Rises, all pretty great. But still, I'm sorry, you cannot beat the Avengers. To wrap up, to anyone that did not enjoy this movie, as an old man in an abandoned building would say, you have a condition, because the Avengers is the most masterful and spectacular superhero movie that there ever was, and might ever be."
"Apr 11, 2013",positive,"Inevitably over-hyped, this film delivers on action, but sacrifices character development in the process.  Fun-filled, but, again inevitably, not all the characters get their deserved time in the spotlight, and the film feels like ""Iron Man 2.5, now with super-powered sidekicks"""
"Apr 11, 2013",positive,A great action/superhero film.
"Apr 10, 2013",positive,Hard to follow if you haven't watched the other movies in the series (particularly Thor and Captain America) but still a good flick.
"Apr 10, 2013",positive,An outstanding cast of heroes put together to make an unbelievable film. One of the best of 2012.
"Apr 10, 2013",positive,Extremely bad ass! The Avengers is arguably the most action packed movie ever created to date. It mixes four iconic superheroes and none of them take a back seat in the action or story. Excellent entertainment!
"Apr 10, 2013",positive,Thoroughly entertained. The ego bouts between the heroes were great and made the ensemble cast actually work. Funnier than I had anticipated.
"Apr 10, 2013",positive,The best movies of superheroes

"Apr 9, 2013",positive,It's really good but it's also a little overrated
"Apr 9, 2013",positive,"A well chosen cast, and a action packed blockbuster that was well crafted from beginning to end"
"Apr 9, 2013",positive,"In the era of films today, film disappointments are scarily common. Usually in a much anticipated film like this you usually expect it to either be pretty good or a complete mess. Fortunately, it is neither of those, and it didn't just meet my expectations, but surpassed them. Not just a good film, but an amazing one. The plot works, there are fantastic action sequences, stellar performances and brilliant special effects! Loki is one of the best comic book villains ever put on screen and all the heroes are just plain badass! A modern classic."
"Apr 9, 2013",positive,"Marvel's ""the Avengers"" is a great action movie in which writer/director Josh Whedon assembles all the great marvel-superheroes.
 Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Natascha Romanov (Scarlett Johanson) are enlisted by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) into an organisation called S.H.I.E.L.D to fight Thors` evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). 
It`s really fascinating to see the way the ""Avengers"", with all those individuals, become a team in the course of the movie, especially Captain America and Tony Stark, who at the beginning cannot even be in one room together without arguing. 
S.H.I.E.L.D has to retrieve the Tesseract, an energy cube Loki, Thor's brother, stole with which he can open a portal from space to earth for his alien army, the Chitaury, to come and destroy earth.
Hiddleston did a great performance as Loki because he showed the selfishness and arrogance self-confidence of Loki in an unserious and ridiculous way, which makes him look like the ""wannabe bad guy"" but given his immense, mysterious space power, he remains a huge threat to the Avengers.
The special effects are breath-taking. That's what makes this movie so expensive. With a budget of $220 million it was one of the most expensive movies of 2012. The main action scene in which the Avengers defend New York from Loki's alien army are thirty action-packed minutes full of marvelous effects that leave the audience open-mouthed.
It's absolutely worth watching this movie, because all these great characters come together in one fabulous movie."

"Apr 9, 2013",positive,Easily one if my favorite comic book movies. Had sky-high expectations (along with everyone else) and it was as good as advertised!
"Apr 8, 2013",positive,Best freaking super hero movie ever
"Apr 8, 2013",positive,One of the movies that made me scream with pleasure. Its minor plot holes aren't enough to make me not to love it. One of the most enjoyable movies of the past years. Finaly Marvel made a really great film.
"Apr 8, 2013",positive,"Coming into the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  As a kid, I spent most of my time outdoors.  I can count on one hand how many times I've touched a comic book, and most of those times were to roll them up, and use them as an imaginary sword.  I'd never seen any of the accompanying movies either.  So, naturally, I figured I'd be completely lost throughout the entire movie.  The first time I watched it, I was.  I had no idea who was who, or what they were trying to accomplish.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy it.  If it weren't a part of a school project, I probably wouldn't have given it a second chance.  So, I watched it again.  After watching it a second time, I picked up things that were initially missed, and ended up enjoying a movie that I never thought I would.
	The movie starts with Thor's brother, Loki, finding his way to Earth with the objective of stealing a renewable energy source called ""Tesseract"".  The Avengers are called to save the day in classic comic book fashion.  Hawkeye was initially assigned to guard the Tesseract.  A portal opened, and out came Loki.  Loki manipulates Hawkeye, along with Dr. Selvig using his magical staff/spear-looking thingy, makes off with the Tesseract, and the Avengers are assigned with the task of retrieving the Tesseract, and bringing Loki to justice.  That proves to be quite a difficult task.
	 There are points during the movie that each of the heroes butt heads with each other, making it difficult to accomplish their task.  Evidently playing well with others isn't part of a super hero's genetic code.  It takes the ""death"" of one of their own to bring them together as a team.  As a team, they prove to be unstoppable.  The Hulk smashes stuff.  Ironman is the billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist that doesn't work well with others.  Hawkeye eventually gets out of his funk (with the help of a face smashing by Romanoff).  Captain America reminded me of a younger, stronger, and better looking version of my grandpa.  He looks at the world with the eyes of an 80 year old, but has the abilities of a 20 year old.  Thor was also interesting, to me.  You could tell at the beginning of the movie that he was a little conflicted with the assignment he'd been given.  You could tell that he wasn't thrilled about having to bring his own brother to justice, but, did it anyway because he knew that it was the right thing to do.
	All things considered, I enjoyed it.  It caught my attention enough to watch the other movies associated with it. That may lead to me appreciating The Avengers more than I already do."

One of my all time favorite superhero movies."
"Apr 1, 2013",positive,"I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Each character had their own thing going on, their own weaknesses, strengths, yet also had amazing group dynamic and chemistry.  Actually the chemistry of the group was very palpable and desirable, almost making me want to be apart of their friendships.  I, hate to say it, even enjoyed the villain, though I don't like siding with evil guys.  Tom, who played Loki, is cute, so maybe that's why.  Oh well, moving on.  Robert Downey Jr was good at being himself, as always, lol, and just everyone meshed so beautifully.  I loved Captain America also.  Even Scarlett held her own incredibly well, because i dont know her to be a action hero type actress, and despite being outnumbered by a bunch of action-type men, she was not overshadowed, bringing umph, yet some estrogen to the mix.  She was awesome and made me notice her, despite not giving her much thought before this movie.  I loved all the characters to be exact.  No one seemed left out concerning the character development part of the movie, it seemed complete in that area.  I liked some of the moral aspects of it, good overcoming evil, SPOILER ALERT---Ironman changing from being selfish to sacrificing himself for others, reconciliation in the group.  Just it was a feel good movie, plus the action sequences weren't too shabby either.  It was a complete package!"
"Apr 1, 2013",negative,Not as good as I expected it to be.
"Apr 1, 2013",positive,"Dramatic, cinematic, and full of entertaining heroics. Takes a while to get into at first, but a must see for any Marvel or superhero fans. Witty and fun, it could definitely have been shortened, but the wonderful character dynamics and complementary soundtrack liven up the movie considerably."
"Apr 1, 2013",positive,I really like how they combined all the action heroes
"Apr 1, 2013",positive,great action movie. it will keep you on the edge of your seat
"Apr 1, 2013",positive,"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! Hulk's word of silence: ""Puny god."" Really gets me going! If u hav not seen it, well, you're gonna hav to see it! I rate it THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!"
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,Simply a must see for comic fans!
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,Best comic book movie I've seen so far.
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,Lots of action!!! Really good!
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,"While not the masterpiece many make it out too be, few films have done action like The Avengers."
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,"The movie event we've been waiting for is great!

Marvel's The Avengers is one of the best superhero movies of all time! With great direction from Joss Whedon and the performances from the cast. Mark Ruffalo us a perfect Bruce Banner. The action was great, just like a Michael Bay film except this movie had a plot line. And then one of the best movie moments of all time when the Hulk beat up Loki, I was almost crying from laughter.

A great superhero movie, I give it a 8 out of 10"
"Mar 31, 2013",positive,Awesome f**king movie!!!!
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,This movie was an incredible adventure from start to finish. Seeing this at  midnight was great. A cinematic universe on film paid off.
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,"2ND BEST, ONLY  TO IRON MAN."
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,Awesome on every level. Best super hero movie in years....ok ever.
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,This was a great movie!
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,One of the best movies of all time! Of course I am super biased because of my comic book roots and absolute love for everything Marvel!
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,Best part is the Hulk!!
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,"I expected more from Joss Whedon. While Avengers was a reasonable romp, it lacked Whedon's more typically irreverent snarkiness. There were only 3 cases when Whedon let his inner browncoat/slayer out: when Thor advises the team that Loki was adopted, when Hulk pwns Loki, and when Hulk takes one last jab at Thor. That's not enough for a 2+ hour movie. 
I also didn't like how the Avengers spent so much time bickering like schoolchildren. 
And why oh why must battles always result in so much destruction? It seemed that the good guys demolished as much of New York as the bad guys did - and seemingly with as much relish. 
Still, I'm grateful that Whedon has received the recognition he deserves finally, although I wish it had been for Firefly or Buffy rather than Avengers."
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,"Do you like action and state of the art special effects? If so then this is the film for you. Do not expect a serious realistic film here, this is simply a fun and sometimes funny thrill ride through the Marvel universe."
"Mar 30, 2013",positive,great movie to watch. :)
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,Exceptional gathering of Marvel comic Superhero's. Great script.
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,This movie is just great. A must see.
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,"The story was little too mainstream for me, but the action and visuals are great."
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,Brilliant mix of humour and action!
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,This is where puny gods get smashed...smashed hard
"Mar 29, 2013",positive,"It's all well-executed Hollywood fun, but as with most superhero movies, I never doubted the outcome."
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,"Saw it!!! It was great. Mr Wheaton at his best. But after all that is what he does. The action and acting was great. I have to see more!!!!!  I was glued to the screen I forgot to eat my popcorn. I have read the comics ""Avengers"", and was impressed by the true to life it was. Did I say I loved it!!  No more words could I say. Great!!!!!"
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,Best movie. Amazing writing.
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,"This is the perfect superhero movie. Characters pop with such gleeful humor that the film could be considered a comedy, and yet, the drama has much weight and its presence is always felt. Of course, the action is wonderful, and you won't want to wait until you can see Thor smacking Hulk with his hammer again. Ultimately, I can say little that has not already been said. Avengers is the movie to beat this summer."
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,Fuck yeah!!!..one of the most exhilarating films ive ever seen
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,"Popcorn entertainment at its finest.  Fun, not too deep, not too thoughtful, but very engaging and exciting."
"Mar 28, 2013",positive,love this movie.  its full of action and surprise.  I'm nit a comic book fan but this movie is awesome.
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,Did I just see Hulk beat the hell out of two gods? This film is not just action-packed; it is also full of comical performances. One of the best superhero films ever made.
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,"It isn't often that a superhero movie of this calibre is made, with a million laughs per second and amazing action scenes, this one is worth every penny"
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,"This movie really blows my mind. I never thought 6 heroes could be so powerful. This movie is action packed, comedy filled, & in my top three favorite movies. The Avengers work hard and eat some well deserved schwarma in the end."
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,"Awesomeness.  

Not just for the geeks.  This one serves it up real nicely"
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,how can you not love this movie?!
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,"There's not much sophistication to it, but it's still wildly entertaining."
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,A nerd's dream! This film had a lot of hype to live up to what with all the films Marvel made leading up to this and it payed off in every way possible and made a hugely enjoyable and entertaining film with a good simple plot.
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,Nobody gives a shit about Tom Hiddleson. He is the best
"Mar 27, 2013",positive,"If you are a true Marvel fan, then you will love this film.  The plot and characters were already developed in previous movies (highly recommend you see the individual titles). Acting is suberb for this genre, the A-list names work well together.  One of the best superhero flicks to date."
"Mar 26, 2013",neutral,like teenage mutant ninja turtles 2 with a bigger budget and worse dialogue.
"Mar 26, 2013",positive,You'll never get the feeling you got from watching this movie the first time again. The magic of bringing different characters into one movie holds an awesome magic.
"Mar 26, 2013",negative,"Dreadful!!! What happened to super hero movies from Marvel???? This movie was hailed to be some sort of modern masterpiece for the genre but upon viewing it on the big screen I wanted to scream and run to get my money back! This painful piece of CGI trash has about as much entertainment value as a steaming pile of dog excrement. 

Don't get me wrong the cast did their best and are fine, but the script and reliance of CG was a slap in the face to viewers. The villains were not explained, the story made me check my watch every other minute and the over the top sequences of green screen violence were a major insult to everyones intelligence in the theater. I understand some people really seemed to enjoy it and I say more power to you. But for me this was a complete joke. The realism that was interlaced in films like the original Spider-man, X-Men, Daredevil and Punisher proved that Marvel had a dark side. It really worked for those films. Ever since Disney got their sparkly little fingers in Marvel's pie, it is easy to see how things have gone down hill.

A complete and utter bore that will undoubtedly have an equally lame sequel that mindless hordes of people will flock to see. These films thrive because of the excellent trailers. Sitting through 2+ hours of this is just mind numbing. Your kids will love it, but in a few years it will be evident that these Marvel Avengers are cheesy and two dimensional. A huge money maker....but ultimately a sorry excuse for a film."
"Mar 26, 2013",positive,AWESOME!!!!!! Enough said A+
"Mar 26, 2013",positive,All those ripped abs is enough. The action is a bonus. Loved it!
"Mar 26, 2013",positive,Best superhero movie ever.  Arguably yes.
"Mar 26, 2013",positive,The entertainment value alone should be enough to make you enjoy this film. I personaly found myself constantly amazed at how the script was able to jugle so many great names and charcters in such an effective way. I didn't think that a movie with 4 main characters can work. I was wrong. 9/10
"Mar 25, 2013",negative,"Can't really feel for super heros who are have such a ultra ego,also it feels as though none of them can die except for one moment,and its too predictable,it never felt as though the bad guys could win,its gone down to me as a horrible film,and im surpised anyone could actually give a positive review for this 2 stars from me"
"Mar 25, 2013",positive,"A bunch of superheroes come together to save the world from alien invasion - this is a pretty good effort as far as superhero movies go.  The group dynamics are interesting enough and the special effects are impressive.  The movie is a little long since while original in a way, the goodies vs baddies save the world deal has been done many times before.  Nice effort."
"Mar 25, 2013",positive,"Beside all the obvious perfectness of this movie, Cobie Smulders was the best addition to the cast. Even though her screentime was minimum, Maria Hill gave me something to hold onto on this ride of a movie."
"Mar 25, 2013",positive,"Movie had good action but the whole funny parts during the movie killed the moment and would have been a more interesting movie if it wasn't for that, Transformers 3 didnt have Optimus doin funny scenes"
"Mar 25, 2013",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing in all the characters we came to love, and the finale definitely showed the spectacle Marvel had promise us and even more."
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,best movie I have seen in years and definitely best movie of this year.
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,If you are a fan of the genre you MUST see this.
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,best super hero movie to date
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,Would watch over and over!
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,This is what a superhero movie should feel like!
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,Good wholesome fun.  My only complaint is that the final battle sequence started to sag under the weight of all the CGI creatures stuffed in.
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,Probably one of the best summer movies to come out in a long time.
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,This is an awesome movie that wraps up Phase One wonderfully. There is lots of action and awesome Iron Man epicness.
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,IT'S GOOD BUT FOR SOME FANS IT WILL PROVIDE DISAPPOINTMENT OVER ITS STORY AND DEVELOPMENT
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,This film is exactly what I wanted it to be!!!!! Nuff said!!!!
"Mar 24, 2013",positive,Final fight scene was badly written but dope overall
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"With each movie adaption of Marvels various superheros gaining mixed reviews, I had a feeling this would have some ground to recover. With the hulk changing actors, Hawkeye having no background before this and Captain stuck in WWII, it seemed Marvel would have to pull a miracle to make this work... they did. An amazing line up of actors and actresses all building certain relationships with each other and with the head of SHIELD himself, Nick Fury. Loki returns from the Thor movie so those who haven't seen that may be a bit behind when the movie kicks into high gear. However all other roles not previously established are done well and don't seem to occupy as much screen time as one may think would be needed. This movie is one of the best of 2012 and deserves a shot at a sequel!"
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"Could watch this movie over and over, love it."
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"This excellent cast makes an excellent, entertaining movie."
"Mar 23, 2013",negative,"Erik Weber's statement ""Without Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty quips in patented rat-a-tat-tat fashion, The Avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a Michael Bay production,"" holds very true. Joss Whedon and Zak Penn played this game too close to the chest and failed to surprise me in anyway whatsoever. The only good thing about this film is the fact it made up for 'Thor' and 'Iron Man 2.'"
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,Trailer looks awesome
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"While it may not be the best movie ever made, it has a charm that is unforgettable. It will bring laughs to everyone while creating a visually stunning masterpiece. The cast is 100% top notch and all critically acclaimed. This film is not just for nerds or gentlemen, it is for women and even the little ones too. This film helps me enjoy going to the movies again."
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"I had no expectations of it, even though it did have a lot of hype, there were one or two scenes in it that i felt didn't need to be so long, but a film needs that I think especially when it's a character based movie more than an action film.  Everyone in the cast did awesome and everyone from a behind the scenes creative aspect did their jobs really well.  One of the best movie going experiences I've had in a long while."
"Mar 23, 2013",positive,"The avengers is funny, sometimes. it's very good, not at the level of the Dark Knight but better than the Dark Knight Rises. It's very good, it deserved more than only one nomination to the Academy Awards. But the ones that decided not to give The Avengers more nominations are the same that gave the Academy Award of Best Animation Movie to Brave instead of Wreck-it Ralph."
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,"Entertaining, even though I don't know my comics like I should to watch this film.  I know I'm going to get hate on this, but I love the casting of Johansson.  And whoever decided Ruffalo should be Hulk was brilliant...I never would have pegged that one, but he's believable and so unexpected."
"Mar 22, 2013",negative,"A hype without any substance. Little to no character depth or development to be found. The film runs its course from substance-less action scene to fan-serving action scene. The actors have great chemistry, but they are given nothing to do with it.  A ""world is going to end"" film with literally no stakes attached. We are supposed to be moved by a character's death (which already is undone) because he is written to be us (the fanboy)--to bad he had little to no screen time to make us really care. Not only does this film have plot-holes galore, it completely 2-dimensionalizes its villain to the point of absurdity. Beginning (in Thor) as a god struggling to meet his father's approval and find a purpose, he somehow ends up trying to rule a planet he never even cared about before, with the help of (because a God needs help?) aliens...aliens who trust and make a deal with him because...we don't really know.  These aliens decide to bring mindless hive aliens to attack only New York City...because that always works...the film is a straight up 2-dimensional brawl with characters only given depth by their associations with their previous (better) films. Don't even get me started on how little Thor mattered or made sense in this film. Basically the same treatment Winston got in Ghostbusters 2."
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,Joss Whedon can do no wrong.
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is one of the few great examples of putting a large cast together and making the chemistry work. I would recommend this movie even to those who aren't fans of superhero movies (and trust me, I should know)."
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,"such a good film, and very well done, the actors were brilliant for their roles. this film holds the balance of action and sensability."
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,"Like a red carpet for superheroes, ""The Avengers"" showcases all of Marvel's A-listers (except the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Spider-man) in a funny and spectacular way. 

One of the best, if not THE BEST, superhero movies ever."
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,One of the best action adventure movies but I've seen the past decade. the comedy is also placed perfectly.
"Mar 22, 2013",positive,Not bad But grossly overrated.
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"El gran gancho de ésta película resulta ser su impecable dirección, además de una pirotecnia asombrosa (en el mejor sentido de la palabra). Así se reinvindica el género produciendo un filme cuya calidad sobrepasó a la que muchos esperaban en un principio."
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,Probably the best Super Hero movie yet.
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"Though it hit box-office gold, it's still underrated on a critical level. It's script and character development are somehow able to keep up with it's fantastic action sequences, making it that rare package that's shockingly complete."
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"One of the most satisfying films in recent memory. It's very rare to see a film with this much hype actually live up to its promise and Joss Whedon pulled off what many thought was impossible. Devindra Hardawar from the /Filmcast described this as a ""miracle movie"", which is perhaps the most accurate description for this. You know that a film like this has done its job well when you actually care about the characters and are enjoying the journey, even when a bunch of stuff isn't blowing up."
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"Whedon Assembles a Mighty AVENGERS

In the 1960s, Marvel Comics pioneered mature storylines for its super heroes, of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films (Spiderman).  The Avengers were a group with individual icons like Iron Man who had already established identities contrary to The Fantastic Four and X Men.  Marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters, and several years later, it has culminated in The Avengers, a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and 'marvel' its intended audience.  As orchestrated by versatile writer/director and comic book fan Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics; it's nirvana, a comic lover's dream come true.

The Tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish Loki, Thor's half brother.  Kept for study by SHIELD, the elite security agency, (and once possessed by The Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger), the cube can open a doorway to another dimension.  When Loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth, the SHIELD agents are no match for his supernatural powers.  What to do?  Who ya gonna call? 

Well, there's nothing like 'puttin' the band together' for the first time.  Assembled by SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and aided by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the Avengers Initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response.  These Avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals: an otherworldly warrior, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), a meek scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and his anger induced, gamma radiated monster, The Hulk; inventor Tony Stark, in super armor as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and two SHIELD agents, master archer Hawkeye, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and top assassin Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson).  
When Loki's legion of soldiers descend on Manhattan, it's 'Avengers Assemble' time.  Drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by Captain America, it's teamwork at its finest as The Avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth.   

After initially bickering and fighting each other, it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness.  This film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films, but it certainly does not hurt to have seen Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.  Whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each hero's personal life.  

We learn some interesting background on Romanoff and Barton, who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues, but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax.  Rogers, the honorable, idyllic soldier, has to adjust to a world like a modern day Rip Van Winkle.  Dr. Banner keeps his anger at bay, but what will that mean for the Avengers if it can't be controlled?  Whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters e.g. Stark's assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), from other the films.

All the stars perform ably including Tom Hiddleston who is appropriately devious as Loki.  Downey, who clearly improvised much of his dialogue, has a rousing, good time. Jackson embodies Fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity.  

This is the third movie version of The Hulk, and while Ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted Banner, his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot.  To say more would spoil some hilarious moments.  The filmmakers got this Hulk right.  

A couple things don't quite add up like how does The Hulk decide to be a do-gooder at a critical moment?  Who is the mysterious Council (resembling the Syndicate from The X Files) that SHIELD answers to, and what are their intentions?  There are, however, nice touches like the Stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the Avengers.  When the grand showdown is imminent, there is a marvelous circular shot of the Avengers that is iconic.    

When the evil army attacks, one is reminded of Ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of Superman II and any Transformers film.  Whedon, though, never forgets to include intimate moments and details.  Although each Avenger gets a heroic moment to shine, the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle.  The film is also about self sacrifice, and people do perish in this film including a major character.  

Despite a 143 minute running time, the film is full of subplots and well-paced action, and every bit of the enormous, effects laden budget is on the big screen. The Avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made, The Dark Knight being the apex, but it is the most complete, entertaining, multi-hero film to date.  The question now is what do you do for an encore, and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement?  It would require the abilities of a James Cameron or Peter Jackson, or maybe studio executives can plead for Whedon's return.  Let's hope so. (Do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat.)"
"Mar 21, 2013",neutral,The first time I watched this movie I really liked it. the second time I didn't like it. in the end its just okay. Marvel is so childish it's kind of upsetting. Not a big fan of the goofy jokes and corny characters although I really wanted to be.
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"Simplemente bombástica, espectacular, conmovedora y épica. Su elenco es realmente paralizador, una historia fantástica que se apega y no se aleja del guión que se acopla a una de las mejores películas que se ha hecho en la historia de películas de superheróes de todos los tiempos."
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,It was fun but it didn't really do anything that original or spectacular. It had the same old Joss Whedon humor and charm to it. It did not have any new action scenes or special effects I hadn't seen before and it seemed to be flawed in it's plot. It still accomplished its job and satisfied my expectations completely. It leaves me wanting more and I'm excited for more Marvel movies.
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,always love a superhero film
"Mar 21, 2013",positive,"With five separate films, years of hype, and billions of dollars all leading up to this, how in the world can director Joss Whedon satisfy expectations surrounding his new film, The Avengers? Easy: Up the stakes as high as they'll go and pack in as many glory moments as humanly (or, in Thor's case, godly) possible into two and a half hours. Digging deep into what The Avengers has to offer isn't recommended, but the film as a whole is recommended unreservedly. It's full of pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo and some characters are rather disappointingly tossed aside, but it's impossible to at all dismiss a film as fun and full of energy as this.

After the events of Thor, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was exiled from his home on Asgard, and an all-powerful source of sustainable energy known as the Tesseract was in the possession of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. Minutes into The Avengers, Loki breaks into S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters to steal the cube of energy, and in the process, he brainwashes and escapes with Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).

The destruction left by Loki-and the threat of worse things to come-leads Fury and company to give the ""Avengers Initiative"" another shot. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) tracks down Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) at the newly renovated Stark Towers, while the Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) heads to India to find Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), meanwhile, lives under guard of S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of Captain America. And Thor descends from Asgard not long after learning about the trouble his brother has caused. Loki is soon captured, but the Avengers' challenges are only just beginning. Their egos are constantly getting in the way of their mission, which remains a little mysterious, and it's unclear whether Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Cap will stop fighting with one another in time to start fighting their common enemies.

It's funny how much set-up is needed for a film that already required hours and hours of set-up, and the deeper The Avengers goes into the Tesseract and gamma radiation and thermo-hydro-nuclear-micro fusionism particles and all other sorts of nonsense, the more likely you are to jump off the wagon. My philosophy: If you can't explain a concept with a five-word-or-less analogy, it doesn't belong in a film. The Avengers breaks this principle a lot. I feared Whedon had lost me several times, but each and every time the film felt in dire need of a jolt, it breathlessly delivered. The sets are massive, and the enemy is surprisingly strong. What's most exciting, however, is the fact that no one character seems more powerful than the others. When Thor and Captain America and Iron Man all fight, you don't know who'll come out on top.

Nothing, however, comes close to the incredible final act, which throws everything at you plus the kitchen sink (and a few giant armored space caterpillars for good measure). All the film's flaws go out the window as we learn exactly why these superheroes are so super. There's something special and exciting about seeing characters like these become vulnerable, but perhaps just as exciting is heroism in its truest form, which is what we have here. The six individuals featured in The Avengers are flawed, but that's not what this movie is about. It's about them rising to the ultimate challenge and performing at the peak of their powers, and about five minutes into this magnificent final sequence, it's clear heroes in movies have never quite been this super.

There was a ton of concern leading up to The Avengers (at least from me) that characters wouldn't get their due, particularly that the film would essentially turn into an unofficial Iron Man 3. It happens to a certain degree. Tony Stark is the star of the show (and Downey is probably the best he's ever been in the role), but plenty of others get their due. My own personal favorite character was Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Throughout the film, his powers are only talked about (in a very fearful way). But Ruffalo imbues Bruce Banner with his trademark style of low-key humor, and when he finally goes green, he smashes like Eric Bana and Edward Norton never did.

Almost as good, and just as pleasantly surprising, is Scarlet Johannson, whose Black Widow isn't nearly as superfluous here as she was in Iron Man 2. The actress isn't quite revelatory, but it's definitely one of her better performances over the last few years, and she's a welcome addition to this gang, rather than an unnecessary distraction.

So three great performances and characters so far is good. Unfortunately, the remaining trio of heroes doesn't quite measure up. Thor and Captain America are merely adequate. The former shows up late in the game, while the latter is hurt by some of his physical limitations (he's strong, but not as capable of amazing feats as his fellow Avengers). Neither is nearly as bad as Hawkeye, who's completely wasted. Jeremy Renner is merely OK, but I blame Whedon more for what happens to him. It's a shame.

The film obviously cost a ton to make, but it's all there on screen. The score is terrific, and the camerawork is sensational. Overall, it's an extremely well-made motion picture that works in spite of its many flaws because it's just so damn entertaining. So here's your bar, summer of 2012. Let's see if you can clear it.

"Mar 20, 2013",positive,I loved it and it was so easy to watch no boring parts!!!
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,"This is a real slow burner but when it finally kicks into life packs a big punch! The closing battle scene is right up there with the best of any comic book yarn and is well worth the admission price alone. The comedy between characters entertains throughout with Downey Jnr as always at the forefront... however, the surprising star of the show is one large, often angry, green monster. Puny God!"
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,Can't wait to see Avengers 2
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,best superhero film ever
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,"Considering the huge budget, this is a Loki film."
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,Great super hero movie. Kant wait for the 2nd one to come out.
"Mar 20, 2013",positive,"AWESOME!!!!!
\(X.X)/"
"Mar 19, 2013",positive,A childhood dream come true. Well done.
"Mar 19, 2013",positive,"Visually bright, well acted and presented. Director successfully brings all these superheros in a single movie, keeping every single ones own importance."
"Mar 19, 2013",positive,What can I say? It's awesome.
"Mar 19, 2013",negative,This was one of the most boring super hero films I've ever seen.  Each hero is just a caricature of themselves from previous films to the effect of boring recycled dialog.  How this film scores above a 90 on RT is beyond me....
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,"Even better than I thought it'd be. The introduction of Loki in the beginning was fast-paced and exciting. Then it slowed down quite a bit into a well-acted drama. More good action and then slow drama again. Finally, the last quarter was action-packed! The movie gives all heros involved good time to shine and neglects none of them. I was totally sold at Loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie Thor."
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,"I'm not a comic guy, but this was a pretty good movie. I loved the character interaction. The action was forgettable and cliched and the story was silly, but I guess this was a comic book movie adaptation or whatever. Stupid big dumb ending."
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,"This film was expected since 2008 with the movie Hulk (movie more or less), since Marvel has promised the film ""THE AVENGERS"", the famous group of super heroes (basically, the Justice League Marvel). Then came the movies Iron Man (2008-Great), Iron Man 2 (2009-Good) Thor (2010-Good) Captain America (2011-Very Good), and finally in 2012 came the expected and exceeded all expectations!
A film that brought together four powerful super heroes (and 2 that appeared in the movie Iron Man 2 and Thor), with all the elements of a superhero film. And who directs it all? Joss Weedon, nerd-director, best direction for a superhero film there it's not (except for Nolan, ""THE DARK KNIGHT""). He took the heroes and their BDs, took Manhattan (the stage of all superhero movies), and with a little touch of realism and pum ... ""THE AVENGERS"" born.
Managed to put together a fantastic action, die laughing humor, and even a bit of emotion, and the most impressive are the heroes. All were perfect in their roles, and each had their moment in the film, it didn't had a main character, all leading heroes in the film are- For example, when Iron Man appears it is all about him, when Hulk appears everything it is about him, and that's with all the characters.
But to understand the story better, it's kind of mandatory watch the other films that I mentioned earlier. But you can see the same movie and love it completely.
After THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, THE AVENGERS is the best superhero film ever made."
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,great movie must see
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,"A fantastic movie. great acting, mind-blowing action scenarios & a great story. this movie is a comic books fan's dream come to life. a must see for all comic book fans."
"Mar 18, 2013",positive,"My rating is more based on preference than anything else, because this really isn't my kind of movie. It was too...actiony, and I wasn't even close to tears at any part of the film. I think Loki should have gotten more screentime and more focus on his personal struggle."
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,"The Avengers was extremely built up, but fell a little flat, only giving some action and a decent story."
"Mar 17, 2013",negative,To be honest I think this is the most overrated superhero movie of all time. Didn't like it and I personally love Superheroes
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,It didn't live up to its hype for me but having said that it was entertaining enough.
"Mar 17, 2013",negative,"Over hyped,long and boring,very disappointed!M"
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,The Avengers is one of the rare superhero team movies that truly work amazingly.
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,"Fun for the kids. Nice special effects. Not my cup of joe, but my girl loved it."
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,A very good movie that kept my eyes fixed on the TV.
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,"Flying invisible aircraft carriers? Fuck, yeah!"
"Mar 17, 2013",positive,This movie kicked arse! I loved it!
"Mar 16, 2013",positive,this movie is a movie
"Mar 16, 2013",positive,"a good action flick, but the comedy ruined it."
"Mar 16, 2013",positive,"Even now, I can hardly believe this movie exists. The first 45 minutes is slow, and the plot itself is silly fluff, but few genre-storytellers can craft compelling relationships like Joss Whedon and that's really what makes the film work. Scarlet Johannson is the stand out, and more Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is never a bad thing. This is also the best screen version of the Hulk since the Bill Bixby days. The script bubbles with delightful dialogue and hilarious moments of inverted expectations. They seriously pulled it off. A joy."
"Mar 16, 2013",negative,"The goofiest heroes (with exception of Hulk and Iron Man) ever, united at last.
Little to no interaction between characters, an alien invasion that doesn't makes any sense, typical Joss Whedon direction."
"Mar 16, 2013",positive,awesome movie. if you like marval comics you going to love this one.
"Mar 16, 2013",positive,"Behind The Dark Knight, this is the best superhero movie I have seen."
"Mar 15, 2013",positive,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE.......PERIOD!!!
"Mar 15, 2013",positive,"A film that has no delusions of grandeur, The Avengers is a film in which charismatic leads take part in large-scale and well-designed battles while making self-aware quips. In many ways, Chick Flick of the Year."
"Mar 15, 2013",neutral,"A lot of money put into this movie for a predictable story with big name actors, big name comic characters, etc.  It was just okay.  The one highlight was the Hulk (not Ruffalo, I think Norton did a way better job).  Just an okay movie really."
"Mar 15, 2013",positive,"this is truely one of the best films of the year bar none action special effects and the acting was,nt bad either so this true hits the mark .... 10/10 .... but then theres The Expenderbles 2 to come yet"
"Mar 14, 2013",positive,A hit WAY out of the ball park.
"Mar 14, 2013",positive,The Hulk was the man in this movie.
"Mar 14, 2013",positive,I LOVE this movie!! It was so much fun to watch!
"Mar 14, 2013",positive,"This movie just worked. The writers obviously knew the comic books well and the actors took their roles seriously, but not TOO seriously. The special effects were awesome. The tags at the end cracked me up, the first one because I recognized the villain and the second because it was such a departure from the usual ""Nick Fury invites the hero to join the Avengers."""
"Mar 13, 2013",positive,Absolutely awesome!!! I can't wait for the re-Assembly in Avengers 2!!!
"Mar 13, 2013",negative,"A special effects orgy that drags on for two hours and change, with little internal plot or character consistency. I rate it as high as I do purely on the strength of the CGI. Adults who read comic books will probably like this splashy, colorful, violent movie. Personally, I think adults who read comic books are retards ... and so am I for ordering this one in the first place."
"Mar 13, 2013",positive,Some of the most entertaining action and fight scenes you'll ever see in a superhero movie. Great film!
"Mar 12, 2013",positive,The best superhero movie I've ever seen
"Mar 12, 2013",positive,Everything was just perfect.
"Mar 12, 2013",positive,"Deftly balancing a large roster of iconic characters without skimping on story or action, Whedon proves to be the perfect choice to close out the first phase of the Marvel cinematic universe and usher in the second."
"Mar 12, 2013",positive,The perfect superhero movie. I can;t think of any other words to describe it.
"Mar 12, 2013",positive,Amazing best movie this year
"Mar 12, 2013",negative,"Highly overrated and far too long for what is a paper-thin story, The Avengers tries far too hard to be the best action/superhero film of all time, but just seems to be a ride where they show off outdated special effects. If you've already seen any comic book movie, you're getting nothing here besides Hulk's return to the big screen which is HIGHLY satisfying to say the least. Mark Ruffalo is amazing as Bruce Banner and I look forward to him in far better films than this disappointing action flick."
"Mar 11, 2013",positive,"Most rewatchable film ever.
Love it."
"Mar 11, 2013",positive,"The Avengers is visually stunning, to add so many superheroes from their previous movie outings from the Marvel franchise is very challenging, it was either doomed for failure or guarenteed success and thankfully it was explosive, entertaining and arguably one of the best superhero outings in recent years. Downey Jnr and Ruffalo deliever stand out performances as The Iron man and Hulk respectively but the others in the all star cast also impress to the highest standard. it looks too much and it has too many superheroes recruited and its hard to see who was given more screen time, there were a few spots i thought everyone was too over crowded but they overcome that by keeping the audience entertained, giving their audience's favourite hero a special moment for each one with a huge spectacle. Special effects were dazzling and well put together. The Avengers was challenging but extremely good."
"Mar 11, 2013",positive,"probably warrants a higher rating, but fuck it i ain't no comic bitchnigganerd"
"Mar 10, 2013",positive,A kick-ass super hero movie.
"Mar 10, 2013",positive,"I really don't get the hype over this. It was okay I guess, I just don't get it."
"Mar 9, 2013",positive,Totally awesome. Sure we've all seen NY attacked in an epic battle countless times it feels like. But whatever. Incredible bunch of characters. A laugh a minute. For me this is a very much unforgettable movie and is one of my top 10 favorites ever. GO MARVEL
"Mar 8, 2013",positive,"In a film where EVERY Superhero's emotions and feelings are portrayed, not one character being ignored when it matters the most, and a satisfying rush of some ""kick-ass"" superhero action, The Avengers definitely proves that it was WELL worth the hype."
"Mar 8, 2013",positive,Had a good amount of action and exceeded my expectations. Thumbs up! :D
"Mar 8, 2013",neutral,"I don't understand the hype with this. I thought it was cliched, predictable, and formulaic. There wasn't a satisfying resolution."
"Mar 7, 2013",positive,"Avengers assembled flawlessly! WOW! Smart, action-packed witty and immensely entertaining as one of the best Marvel films ever made and this is the third highest-grossing box office hit of all time for good reason.
Director Joss Whedon takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers. 
At a running-time of 2 and half hours, The Avengers is well paced and time flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the script drives the movie elevating its strengths. I see the new Hulk is awesome in CG motion capture better than The Incredible Hulk and Hulk. 
My all-the-time favourite scene is The Avengers fight Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his Chitauri (aliens from space) armies in defense of New York City for half hour."
"Mar 7, 2013",positive,"A zenith of superhero movies, propelling Marvel's juggernauts. The climax of the previous five films. Looking forward to Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Captain America 2, Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers 2."
"Mar 7, 2013",positive,"I'm not even a comic book movie fan, and I enjoyed the hell out of Avengers.  :)"
"Mar 7, 2013",positive,LOVE THIS MOVIE. WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW.
"Mar 6, 2013",positive,This movie is awesome!!
"Mar 6, 2013",positive,"I don't care how silly it is, it is amazing!!!"
"Mar 6, 2013",positive,"favorite part, by far was when the hulk whipped Loki around like a ragdoll."
"Mar 5, 2013",positive,The perfect superhero movie a lot of action nice performance from all the actors and excellent special effects well done great 3d
"Mar 4, 2013",positive,The greatest superhero movie of all time and my favorite superhero movie!!!!
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"The best of the best in popcorn action flicks, but a lot more enjoyable if you're a longtime fan of the superheros that appear on the screen.  I had little previous knowledge or investment in them, so seeing them all interact and fight side by side didn't excite me as much as it could have."
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,loved it. best superhero movie ever.
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"This movie was awe-inspiring to me. The conflicting personalities of all of the characters could have been too tough to handle for this film, but Joss Whedon proved to me that he could handle nearly everything thrown at him. The action was engrossing, the final battle positively epic, and it only left me feeling completely satisfied and elated. It was absolute magic in the theater, and didn't lose its luster when viewed at home. A truly remarkable film."
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"I have mixed feelings about this film, or rather, about the genre it belongs to. Don't get me wrong - I had a great deal of fun watching this - Whedon is very good at ensemble set pieces, including how to weave good turning points and, of course, witty dialogue, as well as little charming moments that just light up the film like few directors can. Thing is - it's also the Avengers complete with MacGuffin and Epic-Battle-to-save-the-world-against-inter-galatic-super-beings, which I never liked in the comic books to begin with - I prefered Spider Man, a local hero, with very relateable issues. Which is super epic spectacle and escapism but, to me, a not very interesting story. I lay none of that at Whedon's feet mind you - he  does the best anyone possibly can with this material. Even so, I'd prefer movies like The Dark Knight or X-Men: First Class."
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"That's probably the best marvel movie and one of the best superheroes movie ever, a movie that will keep you watching it and wanting more of it. Good stuff."
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"One of the best superhero movies ever, simply pulled of by great characters. All of the plot comes from character based motivations, and that's why the story is so good. And after a long while, we get rewarded with a juicy battle scene and enough humour."
"Mar 3, 2013",positive,"Pure action!  I love seeing the comic book heroes that I loved as a kid, come to life on the big screen.  I've been waiting for this for a very long time.  Now, DC Comics should follow.  They should start with Wonder Woman & see how that works."
"Mar 2, 2013",positive,The best comic book movie EVER and probably one of THE best movies ever! So why are you reading this review and not watching this movie?
"Mar 2, 2013",positive,absolutely loved it!! plenty of action and loved the hulk! he took no prisoners so to speak!
"Mar 2, 2013",positive,Great superhero movie.
"Mar 2, 2013",negative,"I couldn't even force myself to like this movie. I hated almost every second that I had to watch it. I still cannot believe that so many people thought that this movie was great. The script was unbearably boring, and the acting was nearly as bad. Also, having an action sequence for a half an hour, and then having no important things happen in it, is a massive waste of on-screen time. This movie should not be thought of as a good movie by anyone's standards."
"Mar 1, 2013",positive,All of them are cool
"Mar 1, 2013",positive,the best superhero move
"Mar 1, 2013",neutral,"Finally got around to seeing this, and I am stunned by all the love. It's a pretty standard comic book flick, with some trademark Josh Whedon, ""Firefly""-like humor. Final battle scenes felt endless. Good performances from Downey Jr. and Johannson don't make the pretty weak storyline any more compelling.  No where near as good as ""Ironman."""
"Mar 1, 2013",positive,A masterpiece and one of the greatest Superhero movies and one of the greatest movies of all time!!  Period!!  It would be a CRIME to rate this movie lower than FIVE STARS!!
"Mar 1, 2013",positive,This movie was heller good...
"Feb 28, 2013",negative,"la vi en Austin, Texas <3 pero no me gustó tanto jajaja"
"Feb 27, 2013",negative,Horrible and unmemorable. Amazingly stupid plot with weak battle scenes and a pathetic resolution. I was expecting so much more from this debut film. Disappointed!
"Feb 27, 2013",positive,The best action movie by far
"Feb 26, 2013",positive,Ehh... I don't see what all the hype is about to be honest.
"Feb 26, 2013",positive,i love this movie so much
"Feb 26, 2013",positive,AWESOME MOVIE BEST IN A VERY LONG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 25, 2013",positive,The best superhero movie I have ever seen by far!!
"Feb 25, 2013",positive,Maybe one of the best movies I ever saw.
"Feb 25, 2013",positive,The perfect superhero flick. Joss Whedon did an awesome job directing on a bigger scale than ever before.
"Feb 25, 2013",negative,"The only thing that Marvel's The Avengers uses to work is it's great visual effects and it's several one-liners. However, this isn't enough to build an interesting story nor a relationship between the characters and the viewers. It simply doesn't stand on it's own."
"Feb 25, 2013",positive,great fast pace movie
"Feb 25, 2013",positive,"A film that we've been dying to see ever since comic book fanatics first read The Justice League back in 1960...only Marvel were able to put together their superhero team-up film before DC - and to devastating effect. 
The build up to the film, via the preceding Iron Man/ Thor/ Hulk etc. film was done particularly well. 
The film itself was everything comic book fans have wanted for so long, and Marvel duly delivered."
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,"Hulk inexplicably was able to control his rage, and talk."
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,"I am a comic geek...but I love movies more. This movie combines both into one very entertaining movie. Based on the comic book of 'The Ultimates', a re-telling of the Avengers, updated, and how many individual heroes combine to make a super-team to save the world. It combines excellent story telling (Just as accurate as 'Iron Man', 'Captain America', 'Thor' and 'Hulk'), Some comic relief (just enough for a few laughs, without looking too funny), and action that will please any movie go-er.  You do not have to be a fan to see this movie, but you may be a fan of comic book movies after this..."
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,Pretty awesome. Better than expected. But the individual stories have a better setting. Hoping for a justice league movie! :D
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,"Tough to rise up to the hype, but the sum is not greater than the parts. Still better than most comic book flicks."
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,One of my favorite superhero movies ever!
"Feb 24, 2013",positive,"Decent enough, graphically awesome - plot basic but entertaining enough. Would have like more Hulk but that's just because he's a personal fav! As expected Downey Jr (Iron Man) makes the cast gel in a good performance again. Number 2 should be good!"
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,Best superhero movie ever
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,The best part of this movie was the interaction of the different personalities which makes these characters believable.  Add the humor and action makes this a must-see movie
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,"One badass superhero extravaganza!  The special effects in this movie were amazing, fight scenes spot on! A must watch!! Even if your not into comics, its a fun movie to watch"
"Feb 23, 2013",negative,"WARNING: CONTROVERSIAL REVIEW-DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED

Ah, Marvel's The Avengers. A universally loved film that contains the world's favorite super-heroes fighting as a unit again an alien onslaught. On paper this sounds like a blast, but the final product(and I mean a product) is incredibly flawed and surprisingly tedious. 

The film opens sloppily with a poorly shot action sequence after Loki(the most overrated movie villain ever) steals the Teseract(don't know if that's spelled right, but I don't really care) and escapes S.H.I.E.L.D's headquarters after it blows up due to the Teseract's power. The Teseract instantly reminded of the Allspark from Transformers, which this film borrows heavily from. Yet Transformers gets shit on and this steaming turd gets all kinds of praise from both critics and audiences.  The first Transformers is solid dumb fun, and is way more entertaining than this. 

The rest of the action in this film is unexciting and dull, because we know nothing will ever happen to any of these characters. Hell, the one characters that does die came back for Marvel's shitty TV show! Avengers is a live action cartoon and the characters are in no danger because Marvel wouldn't dare kill off any of their heroes because  they are all about fan service, and trying to please the mass comic book reading populace. Joss Whedon takes zero risks with this film, and it might as well been sold as a family film. It's so sanitized, clean, and safe that it's fucking boring. And the poor, unfunny writing doesn't help things. Captain America's dialogue was pitiful(""son, just don't.""). I was also annoyed by the blatant product placement. It reminded me I was watching a product used to sell more comics and toys, and also Southwest Airlines flights...

Since I gave it a 4/10, I'll give you some pros. The acting was fine, the visual effects were great, and the action sequence on the aircraft has moments of mild awesomeness. I also found the Hulk smashing Loki amusing. But that's really all. The rest of the film lacks real tension and the film isn't very involving. Like I said, I never felt fear that any of these characters would die. And if they did, they'd just return in a sequel. Or a TV show.

Final Score: 4/10"
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,Very entertaining! I love seeing the comics brought to life.
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,DAMMIT JOSS WHEDON YOU GO GIRL!
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,Entertaining. Needs a sequel.
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,"Very well made entertainment, but hollow at its core. Plus the villain was such a pussy and generic. Great action and direction, but got sick of the one liners spouting from every direction. Joss Whedon is a great writer, but I felt the script was ""battle of the one liners""."
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,second only to the dark knight
"Feb 23, 2013",positive,"Very cool. Really liked the characters, esp Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Hulk."
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,"Not being into the whole superhero genre, still found this pretty good. Although I think I'd rather have Bill Bixby with me in a tight spot ahead of Bow & Arrow Man!"
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,"The highlights here include the snappy, witty script, the interplay between the characters and Hiddlestone as Loki, who should have been given a much larger part in the proceedings. The assemblage largely seems to happen because this film was going to be a massive hit and that's what takes the shine off. The final fight scene may have looked nice but the realism in three mortal characters (the Captain, BW and Hawkeye) surviving could only happen in a comic book. I'm not particularly frightened of alien invaders whose ships are destroyed by lightning. Good fun all the same."
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,"A brilliant film with stunning visuals and a nice blend of all good super hero movies, my only criticism would be that it is slightly underwhelming despite all the hype, still a good film with a good cast though."
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,"A real fun time, but, like most of the Marvel movies, pretty shallow."
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,"Well performed and well acted movie, cant wait for the A-2.
perfect timing for one liners."
"Feb 22, 2013",positive,I think this is THE best film i've ever seen.
"Feb 21, 2013",positive,It was a good film good action good dialogue and comedy but what made me give a low rating is they argued. More then work together and the ending sucked for the film that's why I hope the second is better
"Feb 21, 2013",positive,Went a little over the silly line at points but bloody good film. must watch
"Feb 21, 2013",positive,"What a movie! I am not a comic-books fan at all. I don't know Captain America, Thor or even Hulk (I thought he's that wrestler named Hulk Hogan or so). Anyways, this one was watchable. Dialogues and most of the scenes were as dumb as the plot itself, so those couple of witty moments and quips are appreciated. I might regret not watching this one of a large screen, because with HD quality movie, the effects might have been astonishing. The ship was monstrous, as cool as the arch in 2012 movie and those flying armoured fish with incredible movements, awesome! :) I guess 3,5 out of five."
"Feb 21, 2013",positive,Awesome!!! Enough said
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,The ultimate superhero movie.  The chemistry of all the stars make it even better than most movies that mix stars!
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,"Shiny, speedy, and as slick and deep as glossy paper."
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,Suffers a little from the Transformers syndrome of destroy the city but very funny and enjoyable.
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,"Wow, another masterwork, mastercraft. So much fun. The ending was absolutely flooring, with wit, humor, effects, action, and aliens. I loved how they focused on 9 or so characters and they all had 10 minutes to shine. I could never make a movie like this as it was full of cgi (mostly the Hulk) which was very fun to watch. Just a brilliant, real, superman movie for adults."
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,"for a while I though this movie wasn't going to work. but after watching this movie, it was entertaining from start to finish. I would rank this in top five best marvel superhero movie's"
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,"Saw it in theaters, great movie. The DVD released and I've seen this movie so many times that I hate it but I do recommend it"
"Feb 20, 2013",positive,"The first Comic Book movie that actually made me fee like I was watching a Comic Book, if that makes sense"
"Feb 19, 2013",positive,Great story and action.  all actors wored well together.
"Feb 19, 2013",positive,For a marvel and hollywood action typical lovers
"Feb 19, 2013",positive,"Finally! The superhero movie everyone waited for! Marvel's The Avengers is fantastic, amazing, beautiful, and packed with everything a superhero movie needs! There were 5 Marvel Movies of these four fantastic superheroes: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. Joss Whedon brings all of them together to make this fantastic movie! When Thor's brother Loki, threatens to destroy the world and all of humanity. Nick Fury, Head of S.H.I.E.L.D., brings Earth's Mightiest Heroes together to save the world. Let the biggest superhero battle begin! The Avengers is a great movie that deserved more Oscar nominees than just one!"
"Feb 18, 2013",positive,Pretty much delivers on all summer-blockbuster fronts.  A good touch of character and story with some sweet action sequences.  Nothing more you could want as a fan of superhero movies.
"Feb 18, 2013",positive,I loved this film.... I didnt manage to watch it in cinema but really enjoyed it on my 60 inch flatscreen Led at home characters were amazing and story was simple but effective no complex rubbish
"Feb 18, 2013",negative,"Probably one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. This superhero movie is horribly written, from the script to the characters. Too many heroes that they don't go in depth about their story."
"Feb 18, 2013",positive,this is what cinema and tv is made for. pure entertainment from beginning to end. spoiler. hulk steals the show.
"Feb 18, 2013",negative,"What a load of pants! Poor plot, acting and boring. I know it is a comic strip film but compared to the Nolan Batman trilogy this film was slapstick, unrealistic and not very entertaining."
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,awesome movie for kids and adult.
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,"Love you wanting more, very action pack, but the storyline needed more indepth interaction and less action; so, I give it four stars because the action is very good, but not great enough!"
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,"At 16 this was officially my favourite movie!! Will always remember this film as it delivers thrills, classic performances, hilarious gags and jaw dropping action! Dream come true seeing the superheroes share the screen together for the first time!! The last 45 mins is awesome! Brilliantly written & directed by Joss Whedon too!"
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,"Plot line is a little weak, but the characters and actors are incredible, and Joss Whedon's directing is superb as always. Whedon has a talent for taking disparate characters and weaving them together to make a strong cast."
"Feb 17, 2013",neutral,"I spaced out about 50 times throughout the movie. I'd be lying if I said that it captivated me. Some likable characters, still, I didn't do it for me. Boring!"
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,"This movie was really fun to see with its incredible special features, but it packed good story development. Either way it was fun to see though. I would still recommend the movie despite it's one flaw."
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,Joss Whedon's witty script and enjoyable set pieces enable the film to stand out from other superhero movies that are clearly the products of soulless production companies.
"Feb 17, 2013",positive,This was one of the greatest movies experiences I have ever had.This is what the art of film is all about.
"Feb 16, 2013",positive,Not a big fan of comic book movies but I really enjoyed this one. Would love to see all the other movies now with their individual stories. The action was awesome and the story was pretty good.
"Feb 16, 2013",positive,Awesome!  The best of the action/super-hero genre!
"Feb 16, 2013",positive,hulk and thor.... nuff said :-)
"Feb 16, 2013",positive,An entertaining action flick with great oneliners and great fun for all.
"Feb 16, 2013",positive,"If you're gonna make people wait then you better make it damned good & this is good. Around five years in the making, starting with Iron Man in 2008 & concluding with Captain America in 2011, we eventually get to where it was all heading - the creation of The Avengers. The film does have its flaws, Tony Stark being one of them. Although Stark is an egotistical, narcissistic billionaire he did have that air of vulnerability about him after his near death experience, coupled with a wicked sense of humour which made him a loveable character. Sadly it seems his new arc technology has cranked up his annoyance levels to astronomical terms & quite frankly his role in this movie seemed to be self motivated & it had to be about him. In fairness the testosterone levels are oozing out of the screen as each hero tries to exert his manliness in what can be best described as a dick shaking contest! The humour throughout the movie is great with possibly the best saved for The Hulk involving Loki. Another flaw is its a bit of a slow burner before the main dish is served up in the last third of the movie. There are some snippets of action but as I've mentioned before  it was more about who was stronger than each other as each hero argued amongst themselves. A good thing about the movie was it felt like a montage of each heroes movies as each hero was given a fair share of screen time before finally putting differences aside to save the world from an alien invasion.
 Loki has gathered an army to take over the Earth & finally realises his dream of ruling after his failed attempt of ruling Asgard fell to the wayside. After finally getting his hands on the Tesseract he can open up a worm hole to let his army through & take over the planet. Sadly for Loki a group of heroes, brought together by the secret organisation SHIELD, stand in his way to world domination. Sadly for the world this group called The Avengers Initiative was disbanded due to the dangers each member could bring upon the planet. But Nick Fury has other plans & tries to bring our superheroes together again in a bid to save the planet. After a few teething problems each hero finally gets together to save the day & we get a battle reminiscent of the Transformers movies as the city in question becomes a battle ground."
"Feb 15, 2013",positive,Awesome movie can't wait for a second avengers movie !!!
"Feb 15, 2013",positive,"kick-ass movie, bought it on blue-ray."
"Feb 15, 2013",positive,Enjoyed...but almost too many heroes to follow and each trying to get screen time it seemed....but still liked the story and action!!!!
"Feb 15, 2013",neutral,"It will take many years to find out if Superheroes are genuinely today's Greek Gods, or if they are cheap imitations that will be laughed at a few generations later. 'Watchmen' (the novel) and the Batman Animated Series make impressive cases that perhaps Superheroes actually deserve to be placed among high art that will be remembered for centuries. 'The Avengers' does not. 

Yes, it is by no means terrible. Whedon (who joins Christopher Nolan as one of the most overrated directors working in Hollywood) still keeps an eye on his characters throughout the over-budgeted spectacle. It is also pleasantly surprising that in an age where Blockbusters are taking the Michael Bay tactic of beginning with half an hour of exposition, and the rest of the film being an over-long climax - 'The Avengers' has a consistent three-act structure. Its a shame this is the only thing Whedon remembers from his Scriptwriting lessons. 

The plot is the most underwhelming one can get. It still shocks me that in 2012 there are major films that still, without a shred of irony, centre their plots entirely around a MaGuffin. We hardly see a glance of the villains until the finale, so we are not threatened by them in any way. In 'Star Wars', there was always the shadow of the Empire looming over everything out heroes did. Also, despite 'Star Wars' having a simple plot, it had enough twists and turns to make our heroes go through character arcs. 'The Avengers' attempts this, with a 'will they work together or not' dilemma - which is immediately spoiled by film's poster. 

""Buts its fun!"" Everyone says. ""Just turn your brain off and enjoy it!"" 

No. To 'turn off' your brain is to stop caring. If you don't think about what you see then you become a mindless drone who doesn't observe anything. See Ed Norton slumped half-asleep in front of the TV at the start of 'Fight Club'? That is you if you turn your brain off. 

In such films as 'X-Men: First Class' and 'The Amazing Spiderman' I actually began to sweat. I cared about the heroes and I felt the threat the fictional universe was feeling. I did not feel this in 'The Avengers'. The explosions are all very impressive, but I suddenly realised that I did not care at all. I had no idea who the villains were, Loki is defeated within the first act (thus he is absolutely no threat to anyone), and the superheroes are all ridiculously overpowered. Thor shrugs off a stab in the abdomen, but since he's basically a god he is indestructible. The Hulk is showered with bullets but treats it literally like water on a ducks beak, and the other characters seem to hardly break a sweat. The only person to actually sustain an injury is Iron Man - and this is after the battle. 

In 'The Amazing Spiderman' - Peter actually gets injured and is forced to carry on with the third act barely concious. Things look as though they will fail, yet Spiderman triumphs against the odds. At absolutely no point in 'The Avengers' does it seem as though our heroes may actually fail - which is something even the most basic films have. A child writing Harry Potter fan-fiction would include a moment when it seems like Harry's day might go wrong. 

This is a thoroughly overrated affair that fails its only promise: To deliver satisfying action. I simply did not care about anything occurring - which is a shame since I like these superheroes. They are cool, they're powers are cool. I want to be these people. So its the mark of a particularly bad filmmaker when you make me bored by these God-like entities."
"Feb 15, 2013",positive,"it has a well-written script. combining most of marvel superheroes in one film is an amazing idea, which led the movie to be amazing. the best of the move is its visual effects, they are totally awesome and dazzling. With the release of almost 7 marvel movies excluding this, and the planned release ( guardians of the galaxy, avengers 2, captain america 2, thor 2 and ant-man), I don't think that any will top this. If The Godfather is the king of classic movies, I can say that this is the king of superhero movies ( along with TDK ). A must-watch.\"
"Feb 14, 2013",negative,"This movie is terrible, a complete mess with a sub-par foe.  It takes iron man 45 minutes to fix a turbine, which was his toughest opponent in the film.... Ridiculous.  Too much going on, too cheesy, mark ruffalo doesn't work as the hulk, blah, blah, blah.  I could go on for as long as it took iron man to fix that damn turbine blade here with examples of terrible movie making, but to avoid sounding like the teacher from peanuts I'll end my rant here."
"Feb 14, 2013",positive,"Ok for all those superhero fans- here's the cast plan and simple
Iron-Man, Hulk, Thor. You want action? <-Here they are
Because I can barely understand Thor and he is powered down in this film, he doesn't leave as much impact as the other two
Ironman is such a smartass, and I love it!
Banner, even when human is a great character. ah fuck it- I want to see Hulk Smash.
and honestly, who gives a crap about the others
Why the hell does Captain America exist!? His very character is SO bland and SO useless in combat. Spoiler- a single gunman almost kills him. YOU DO NOT GET OVERWELMED BY A SINGLE MOOK. Captain America was made to be US propoganda, and he fails misrabley at that- his appearance in the movie makes 'MERICA look weak!
If Black Widow was replaced by Catwoman, it wouldn't really change anything, except Catwoman at least is a fun character!
Hawkeye? Green Arrow rip-off, and nothing more.
Demoman? No one cares.
Finally, Loki is an interesting villain though I wish I knew exactly what his powers are, because he almost kills Thor in one scene and is pwned by the Hulk in the next.
More hammier than The Dark Knight series, more of an action flick than a serious film."
"Feb 14, 2013",positive,After 5 years the ultimate idea for a superhero movie payed off with the third best superhero movie ever
"Feb 14, 2013",positive,"Easily one of my all time favourite films. Fantastic cast, great story! The action will in no way disappoint anyone. All the characters get their well deserved face time revealing their strong personalities which in turn make for hilarious situations between characters. I can't wait for the sequel to come out!"
"Feb 13, 2013",positive,Amazing movie with great comedy.
"Feb 13, 2013",positive,"Tony Stark: You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? 

So I finally got around to seeing one of the more hyped films in recent memory. I purposely didn't go see The Avengers when it was first released because the hype was so huge. I honestly didn't think it would live up to all of it. I'm glad to say I was wrong. I've never been the biggest Marvel film fan. The Hulks were nothing special. I thought Thor sucked. Captain America was pretty good. Iron Man was the best of them and a great movie, but the second one was a big step down. Put all those guys together, give it a huge budget, an all-star cast, and amazing effects and you have something though. 

This movie was huge. Huge. Massive. Epic. Awe-inspiring. The movie looked great, sounded great, and most important of all was great. It started a little slow for me, but with each scene the movie just picked up momentum and kept getting better and better. 

I'm not going to say this is the best Superhero movie ever because in my opinion it just isn't. I'd take the original Superman, the Nolan trilogy, and Iron Man over this in those regards, but that isn't saying I don't completely respect this movie for what it is. This movie had so much going on. It didn't just have a focus on one superhero versus a villain or two. It had to put emphasis on a large amount of characters and it did so rather impressively. From Bruce Banner(The Hulk), who I thought was the best character in this film to Scarlett Johansson's sexy spy. All the characters were given just treatment and the character interplay is what made this film as good as it is.

So if you're one of the very few people who have not seen this yet, do so. It's definitely another move in the right direction for the superhero films. I'm extremely excited about the sequel and if they don't go to far away from what made this one so good, I could see that one even being potentially better. Only time will tell though. And hopefully this will give DC the push it needs to put out a Justice League movie, although I don't see them touching this quality with that."
"Feb 12, 2013",positive,",+lots of superhero fun.  some say it is a little long, but I disagree completely... all the worlds greatest heroes had ample screen time.  only real negative is the Bad armies aim."
"Feb 12, 2013",positive,"Just as good as i was expected. It's a mixture of comedy and action, what could be more fun than that! Each character stands out and no one is left behind. But, there is always the top character in the movie, Iron Man, ladies and gentlemen. I love to see small jokes that the characters make even when in a serious situation. I have to tell you this, I love Captain America, he's a true soldier and no one can deny his wise orders. Unfortunately, the cut scenes are only available on DVD (you can find it on youtube), some of the scenes are connected with what's going on in the big screen. Must watch movie!"
"Feb 11, 2013",positive,so good want to be a second one
"Feb 11, 2013",positive,"The Avengers (Avengers Assemble in UK and Ireland) pits together the protagonists of Marvel's properties  Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Captain America (Evans), Thor (Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Ruffalo) in an optimistic, never-before-seen (or attempted) ensemble. The reasoning behind this get together? The god of mischief (Hiddleston) has set his sights on Earth with an extraterrestrial army at his disposal and Earth's peacekeeping organisation S.H.I.E.L.D simply can't contain the situation without major help. Why did it take 50 years for this film to be made?

The film starts with the threat, Loki gathering his army from an unknown benefactor and readying himself to once and for all take his brother down, oh and to conquer our little blue planet. Nick Fury (Jackson) doesn't like this, not one bit. *Important side note* The interesting thing about The Avengers, and part of the reason it's so successful, is that it's part of a much bigger story, this is correctly referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has five (yes five!) prequels that lead up to The Avengers. This has made us love the characters before we've even seen the in a group dynamic. *Back on track* Being the director of the world's most secretive and powerful organisation, he has contacts. Each of these being super-powered (well not all of them) heroes that come in all shapes and sizes. Being a huge comic book fan, just seeing these guys in the same room gave me goose bumps. S.H.I.E.L.D's top agents Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Renner)come along to join the fight to (only for one of them to be turned into a bad guy, kill loads of his colleagues and give the bad guy the object he was earlier hiding from the forces of evil). 

Delaying the 'assembley' Stark's selfishness and arrogance annoys and pushes apart everyone, maybe even more than Loki does? Cap's goody goody old-fashioned-ness doesn't impress anyone except Coulson (Gregg). Thor's sleeveless, point-break appearance is nowhere near as impressive as it is in his own film. Black Widow and Hawkeye's vague yet uninteresting relationship bores the hell out of you. And The Hulk? The Hulk is the best thing about this film. When I heard that Mark Ruffalo was cast as Bruce Banner I was a little skeptical to say the least. The Incredible Hulk was okay and I do quite like Edward Norton however I seemed to like Norton a lot more when I heard Ruffalo got the hand-me-down part. Let's just say I was prepared for the worst, another re-casting. However, his performace was absolutely perfect as the nervous (as for a good reason) brilliant scientist, Bruce Banner. You can see that the Hulk has turned him into a ever so slightly bitter man, especially when you have Tony Stark poking you with sharp objects, trying to get you to hulk-out! As Banner you can't help but feel for him but as the Hulk you can't help but laugh at his humour. Other actors whose performace deserves a mention: Tom Hiddleston, a cold, calculating and interesting villain, Clark Gregg, fan favourite Coulson, Robert Downey Jr. oh, he does play well with others! Who knew? 

The chemistry of these fine actors is bliss to watch when they finally come together. The story is great. The vision of geek-favourite director Joss Whedon is a pleasure to witness. This is what I say to those who said this film is too overcrowded..it's not crowded enough. 

With 6 future films announced and well under-way, this optimistic yet fascinating story is no where near ending and being a comic book fan, I'm hugely proud to be a part of it. The Avengers is a brilliant flick for everyone. Now, I'm off to watch it again. 

Pros
The Tony/Bruce bromance
The natural feel of the group dynamic
The little easter eggs for those who were really watching
'Hulk...smash'

Cons
Not once did anyone say 'Avengers Assemble!'!!!!!!
Thor's helmet looked awesome in his solo movie, where is it?!
Same for Cap's uniform. The First Avenger's combat-influenced outfit is miles better 
The way all the Chitauri died Phantom Menace style 
Banner's sudden control over his anger (although it was a sweet scene)

Recommendations for further enjoyment
Watch all of the MCU films in order, research all of their easter eggs if you can't find the all. And then finally, watch Avengers again, I guarentee you'll enjoy it even more the second time."
"Feb 11, 2013",negative,To much going on mark ruffalo is the only thing that's amazing
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,Best comic book movie ever!
"Feb 10, 2013",negative,"Very disappointing. Nothing special here, and kept reminding me of other similar movies."
"Feb 10, 2013",negative,i hate this film. it's so overrated
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,"I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made! This is one of those movies I could watch 100 times and never get tired of it. It's one of my favorite movies ever! It's the superhero movie ever, one of the best movies ever and the best movie of 2012."
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is a crowd please with great performances by the leads you expect (Robert Downey Jr) and good performances by the rest.  Anticipation for a  film of this magnitude growing up as a young boy, one would expect utter failure back in the early 90s when comic book films were all but rationed to DC's ""Batman"" franchise.  However, in the day and age of ""working my way back to you babe"" type film making, ala starting with solo films Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, etc, the build up in the film was preordered via a few years of solid films in their own rights.  However, I can't help but feel a certain ""Manufactured"" quality amongst this film, knowing the characters ahead of time and knowing the ""pull your punch make it somewhat kid-friendly"" for the audience it somewhat has.  Great action, good performances, and of course a set-up for future installments, Avenger's fits the bill.  Nonetheless, in further films, I want a ""break the mold"" type of film-making with these enduring characters to satiate my sense of progression that is now to be expected in the world of what is comic book films in the modern ear of films."
"Feb 10, 2013",negative,"One of the most overrated films ever, the script was as stupid as boring, there was nothing new in this movie, also they spoiled the Hulk, it is just a big boy that smashes like a WWE wrestler. Loki, do I have to say it?, I will have to... he was so mediocre, his plan was very foolsih...!!!!!! (with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,Brings hero action films to a new level.
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,"Fun, witty, and action packed.  The Avengers is a must see for comic book fans.  The less-is-more approach used with The Incredible Hulk and expanded use of Black Widow are definitive highlights of Marvel's best film to date."
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,A get together of some of the less popular superheroes that haven't been given trilogies or even particularly successful films. The result is extremely entertaining. The science side of it went a bit over my head but for just pure superhero fun this was really great.
"Feb 10, 2013",positive,No higher because of the lack of fighting and I wanted more 'Smash!'.
"Feb 9, 2013",positive,IT WAS FANTASTIC!!! NOW GET OUT OF HERE!!!
"Feb 9, 2013",positive,"It doesn't have the darkness and human drama of Batman films (Batman being my favorite superhero), but The Avengers was an excellent film of solid storytelling and sheer FUN with its exceptional effects and cool characters."
"Feb 9, 2013",positive,One of the best movies I have ever seen
"Feb 9, 2013",positive,This film has definitely avenged the genre after a parade of sub-par super hero films.
"Feb 9, 2013",positive,"action filled,excellent and filled with excellent charisma from the cast this is the ultamate blockbuster blast see it"
"Feb 8, 2013",positive,Awesome movie with great action.
"Feb 8, 2013",positive,Everything I had hoped for from the moment I heard this movie was in the works.
"Feb 8, 2013",positive,"Amazing movie. What Marvel films achieved with this movie is nothing short of astounding. Combining 5 movies with different plot lines into one mesh of a film is recipe for utter disaster but they pulled it off. Not only did they pull it off, they spiked the ball and did a TD dance that makes all TD dances pale in comparison. Only Joss Whedon could've pulled it off as well. Perfect choice in casting. The man has been building ensemble pieces all his career with great success. Glad he is getting the main stream recognition he has earned and deserves. Avengers was brilliant on every level and cannot wait for Marvel Phase 2."
"Feb 8, 2013",positive,A remarkable comic book movie.
"Feb 8, 2013",positive,this movie is the shit
"Feb 7, 2013",positive,"Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and The Hulk - there's a good chance that at one time or another every boy fought an epic (make believe) battle pretending to be one of these comic book heroes. I dare say that a movie that brings these four to life on the big screen is about as good as it gets for a fan of the comic books and action movies. The Avengers (2012) does just that, and it does it spectacularly.

The Avengers are a team of super humans brought together to prevent the human race from being enslaved by a banished Asgardian, known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), with a score to settle. Loki is the step-brother of Thor and was banished from Asgardia after waging war on earth. He returns in this movie to enslave the people of earth as retribution against his earth-loving brother.


Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) are each the stars of their own blockbuster movies that preclude this movie. It's in those prequels that we get to know the characters and their motives. The challenge with a movie that brings together four huge characters into one plotline is screen time. I was concerned that 143 minutes would not be enough time to do the characters justice. It's this balance that really makes The Avengers special. Director Joss Whedon does a marvelous job of keeping the dialogue and interplay between the characters seamless. That, and the writers also did a great job pacing the action and giving just enough time to each character. It never feels like one character is dominating the screen which means whether you're a fan of Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, or The Hulk, you'll feel like you saw what you paid to see.

Something that often gets overlooked in movies of this action genre is the subtle nods to other films or pop culture events that make it special. This movie is loaded with them which is especially entertaining to the die-hard comic book fans. For example, the scene involving the interrogation of the character Black Widow is a parody of many of the James Bond interrogation scenes. While the casual James Bond fan may not notice, the avid fans will recognize it as a classic ""James Bond"" escape from being bound to a chair during an interrogation.

The Avengers could be called a classic Hollywood action movie: the good guys must fight off the bad guys to save the world. However, the awe-inspiring presence of four of the biggest action/comic book heroes, combined with a script that allows each of them to shine makes this movie a cut above anything else I've seen."
"Feb 7, 2013",positive,"really good, better than I thought it was going to be"
"Feb 7, 2013",negative,"Long, drawn out, and non sensical plot"
"Feb 7, 2013",negative,"No matter how amusing it is to watch the Hulk smashing everything and Iron Man 's flights with their exquisite special effects, nothing can save this film from being an utter dissapointment to an audience with at least some basic intelligence. The plot is obviously a silly excuse for bringing all the heroes together and making them fight each other, much in the juvenile tradition of Marvel's plots back in the 60s and 70s, minus the kitch, naive charm of the latter. The biggest problem arises from the ideological core of the film, which -much like the Dark Knight- promotes a totally unrealistic view of human values, choices and consequences. One has only to look at the scene in which Loki makes the common people to kneel before him while he makes his arch-villainous speech about how humans are made to obey; one person, a 'common', 'average' old American citizen stands up and 'proudly' defies Loki with his stance. Now there is nothing wrong with someone standing up to his convictions, but where are the consequences of doing so? Well, there aren't any in this film; Loki shoots at the old man but of course, at the crucial moment Captain America comes in front of him out of nowhere and deflects the beam with his American shield (so obvious and moronic is the symbolism). Not to mention that the film shyes away from showing a single death of one of those 'average', American citizens because if they did this would go against the fantasy that the American super-heros succeed in protecting the common people. Instead we get a lot of shots with people running in the midst of destruction, but no on screen killings. The only death in the film, the death of that 'child-like', 'good-hearted' SHIELD agent (he collects Captain America vintage cards) whom Loki kills becomes a whole parade of melodrama that moulds the heroes in the end into a team. In other words, the film promotes the fiction of 'heroic' death, which is a 'meaningful' death. However, in real wars, meaning is nowhere to be found; one can get a bullet while walking the street without even realizing what happened. Anyway, at leat Mark Ruffalo is good as Bruce Banner and the special effects are well done. Other than that, it is funny, or rather alarming, how these films get so much praise from audience and critics alike without any critical thinking done. One of the critics here even called it one of the best films of the year. Critics should take their roles a bit more seriously, I think."
"Feb 7, 2013",positive,one of my favorite movies
"Feb 6, 2013",positive,"this is the ultimate example of a blockbuster action-filled superhero movie. It is solid popcorn entertainment all around and should be expected this much. Don't expect an incredibly deep-thinking or thought provoking movie, but expect a predictable but fun explosive ride that never lets up till the end."
"Feb 6, 2013",positive,"I came to see this film expecting very poor results. I had gotten aacustomed to Thors, Incredible Hulks, Iron Man 2's, and Captain Americas... Just like when I went to see Iron Man in 2008, after 4 years, I already had very little faith in Marvel pictures... (...) WOW!! Best Marvel Film EVER. Almost a (Marvel) Masterpiece... THIS is what Iron Man had promised in 2008, and I was wrongly expecting from Iron Man 2... It is The Avengers. Classic! I was like crazy, I had a Marvelgasm. I watched it again 2 times, so I've seen it 3 times in theatre. That's why this movie is history's 3rd biggest box-office blockbuster."
"Feb 6, 2013",positive,"The avengers was the full package.Interesting story,great characters,great action, and great character chemistry, Joss Whedon the God among nerds pulls together a amazing cast of people to accomplish one of the greatest super hero movies of all time. My only complaint is the first 30 minutes was a snore but the last 30 minutes made up for that."
"Feb 5, 2013",positive,"Completely Over-rated movie, is it a good action movie. Yes, that it is. I still think people are being ridiculous when it comes to this film."

"Feb 3, 2013",positive,Another slam dunk for Josh Whedon!!
"Feb 3, 2013",positive,Currently my favorite movie! A terrific Super Hero romp featuring some of Marvels best.

I hope there are plans for a follow up film!
"Feb 3, 2013",positive,"Wow! Great movie! The best Marvel's movie ever! Great performances, funny, well scripted and incredible special effects! I just adored it!! A must definetely!!"
"Feb 3, 2013",positive,Great show! I love the Hulk smash in this movie.
"Feb 2, 2013",positive,A witty script with plenty of those classically cheesy super hero one liners and some top notch special effects make for an enjoyable viewing experience. However there is nothing serious about this film.
"Feb 2, 2013",positive,"Still the best action hero movie, the Hulk has one of the best one-liners in the film. Easy to watch over & over ! Great music!"
"Feb 2, 2013",positive,A Fun Movie. It delivered what was expected from it.
"Feb 2, 2013",positive,"the best superhero movie of all time, action from beginning to end, after this DC has got some work to do with JL"
"Feb 2, 2013",positive,"Having read Marvel comics way back when, I felt an emotional link with this movie. The Avengers was a link to my childhood and could easily have disappointed, but it excelled. This is fun, respectful, fast paced and well composed. Josh is the man. Excelsior."
"Feb 1, 2013",positive,"''The Avengers'' is directed by Joss Whedon, who did a fantastic job in this movie. Avengers is one of the best superhero films I ever seen and actually this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. People may say that I'm being a fanboy, but Avengers is not only an incredible comic based film, it also stands out as amazing action/sci-fi/fantasy film, it is just so good!

The beginning is powerful and quick, but of course it was supposed to be quick. Half of the Avengers story is in other films like Iron Man (1 & 2), The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America. Anyways, the beginning is fast and immediately sucks you into the movie. Impressive.

The story is fresh and is not only about some superheroes that make a superteam and start fighting against the bad guys, is deeper than that. You will see constant discussions and fights among the characters that make the story more interesting because you don't if the Avengers team is going to end right. Loki is this film is like the Joker in ''The Dark Knight''. He is a smart evil man, that plans everything very well. After I knew the kind of villain that Loki was in this film I got excited, I knew that I was watching a smart film filled with action scenes and drama.

Whedon knows how to put his actors into work, he is one good director.
Robert Downey Jr. owns the Iron Man role. That guy was born to play Tony Stark, he is like Johnny Depp with Jack Sparrow. Downey Jr. is Iron Man, for sure. 
Chris Hemsworth does an incredible job playing Thor, it was so amazing, the best thing about Hemsworth is that makes Thor cool, so thank you. 
Evans is very good with Captain America, in my opinion one of the funniest characters in this film, is really funny to watch this man discover a new world filled with new kinds of technology. 
Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was just amazing, the best Hulk to the date, Norton was good back in 2008, but Ruffalo owns it, hands down. 
Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the Black Widow, she really put some hard work into this character. 
I didn't see Jeremy Renner a lot of time in screen, but he did a great Hawkeye and Samuel L. Jackson... how can't you be entertained? Samuel L. Jackson is awesome.

The script has it plot holes but whatever, is a wonderful script, if you are watching a movie just to question all the things that happen in that movie the you are not watching the movie. I'm really sorry, but you are just acting like an idiot. Avengers is so good that you don't care about the plot holes. Great job, Joss Whedon.

CGI is great! It was very impressive, it deserves an Oscar (actually has an Oscar nomination for best special effects), they were so neat, powerful. They were better that Transformers, I know they are pretty much the same effects but I'm gonna tell you why the CGI was better in Avengers that in the Transformers... Whedon knows how to use them. He is moderate while using CGI. He is not exploding things everywhere and giving you headaches. He is really carefull while using special effects.

What else can I say? It was a great film. Charged with action. Perfectly balanced and well acted. Thank you so much, Joss Whedon.

"Feb 1, 2013",positive,awesome marvel movie
"Feb 1, 2013",positive,"There you go Micheal Bay, thats how you direct an epic battle sequence! First rate action!"
"Feb 1, 2013",positive,"Its another superhero movie with all the hero's you love to see squashed by the bad guys, then save the day. The story is something we have seen before, the heroes are ones we have all seen before but this time they are all in the same movie. The start of this film was long and questionable, but when the film got going, it picked up the pace....and ended. I'm only hoping that this film is paving the way for the next one which will be much better."
"Feb 1, 2013",positive,"The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.

Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.

Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.

There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen."
"Jan 31, 2013",positive,"Though pretty boring in the beginning, The Avengers picks up in the middle with very well-crafted action sequences, impressive visuals, and a good story mixing all of the Avengers."
"Jan 31, 2013",positive,"Best way to spend two and a half hours on a friday night, everything wanted from an action movie it here, impressive sets, great action, deep characters etc each of the characters have their moments here in this masterfully handled movie"
"Jan 31, 2013",positive,"Una de las veces en las que más me divertí en el cine fue viendo Avengers. La segunda vez que la ves, pasada la sorpresa de ciertas escenas no te reís tanto, pero sigue pareciéndome uno de los mejores pochoclos ever."
"Jan 31, 2013",positive,"Although i really disliked the movie, it looked amazing and had to be seen at the movies to fully appreciate how epic it looks."
"Jan 28, 2013",positive,it was my favorite in 2012
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,"To be honest, I don't really care for this movie all that much. At first I liked it, even calling it solid after leaving the theater. However, when I watched it a second time, the movie felt much more long, tedious, and dull than before (maybe it was just because of all the hype), and I walked out during the big fight scene in the city (I wasn't even paying attention much of the time before then either). So yeah, I think it's kind of average in my humble opinion."
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,Just wish they started with the originals but still badass
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,A perfect superhero movie.
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,What. A. Film.  Waited a long time to watch it but it didn't disappoint. Tony Stark obviously stole the show followed the Hulk. If you don't like it then you're just not normal!
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,Beyond entertaining.
"Jan 27, 2013",negative,Quite typical brains off super hero movie. Nothing new to this genre.
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,Possibly the best superhero movie ever.
"Jan 27, 2013",positive,"An overrated, but formidable entry in 2012's catalog of high quality films. More coherent, fun, and true to the spirit of comics than Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy could ever hope to be."
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,The best super hero movie on the planet
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,this movie is awesome
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,The best movie from 2012 :D
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,"This film was a good laugh as well as action packed, it's unusual assemble of heroes that not only rub each other the wrong way but can pull it off when it's time, will happily watch again!!"
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,"Of course I entered this movie having been told that it was incredible and one the best movie of the year.  Sorry, its not.  Its too corny.  There are too many one liners and overproduced action.  With that being said, if you want to watch a comic book action movie, this one is still enjoyable.  The first time."
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,"Need I say more? If you hate this, you're a total douche."
"Jan 26, 2013",positive,good is just epic heroes unite all these together and fighting together but the essentials of a movie is the story and here there was none at all. but I could not see the story that the action scenes were too much fun and I could see that the story was missing until I left the movie theater. but yeah the movie was the movie that all the geeks want to watch.
"Jan 25, 2013",positive,A very nice payoff with an excellent assemble of characters all of which are relevant and entertaining.
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,They couldn't have made an Avengers movie any better.
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,"A very funny movie wich, although it doesn't have a great plot, make's you have a nice time when you're watching it. Recommended to watch all the other ""marvel superhero""'s movies first, specially the iron man saga, captain america and thor."
"Jan 24, 2013",negative,"Highly uninspired and very disappointing. Little by way of character involvement. I have heard it defended 'there's too many characters to get that involved'. X-Men First Class destroys that theory immediately. It's was flashy, the graphics were epic, but left me entirely empty"
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,"ONE of the best..nothing more to say. The plot is clear and holes-free, which is good."
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,Basically... Just Brillant!
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,Great popcorn fun. What big movies are made for.
"Jan 24, 2013",positive,Absolutely a must see!! I â?¤â?¤â?¤ this movie & it is one of the only movies I would watch more than once.
"Jan 23, 2013",positive,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!! No more words are needed to be said.
"Jan 23, 2013",negative,I couldn't find anything attractive in this movie.
"Jan 23, 2013",positive,Yep. Zesty and knowing. A blast.
"Jan 23, 2013",positive,"This is Marvel's best movie to date with great humour a dynamite script and some fantastic action sequences that perfectly blend CGI with practical effects. There is nothing more riveting than watching Samuel L Jackson assemble the likes of Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and eventually Thor and Loki is by far the Marvel cinematic universe's best villain. I would even go as far to compare him to the Dark Knight's Joker. The long takes in the fighting scenes linking all the avengers together are masterfully excuited and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying! This is how to make a superhero crossover movie!"
"Jan 23, 2013",positive,Too good. 5 stars aren't enough.
"Jan 23, 2013",positive,Spot on and funny in places. Brilliant movie!!
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,"A fun movie.  Joss Whedon wrote some trully funny lines but the story as a whole is really bland. The villain for me was just dumb, i didnt like him. Never felt like he was evil or mad or heck even cold hearted. That is what drags down what could have been one of the summers best movies to just good. 3.1/5"
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,"A Movie that will be watched 10years maybe 100 heck maybe even  1000 years from now. if you have not watch  this movie yet i have to say i feel sorry for you b/c this is a movie that will blow your socks off and shoot them into space.
5/5"
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,"The most entertaining superhero movie ever. Whedon does a brilliant job with pacing, character development, story and humorous. This movie will be a day-one Blu-Ray purchase. Avengers Assemble."
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,My entire life came to the moment I saw this in the theater. My whole life was worth it.
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,"Highly overrated, a good, fun movie to see with friends, but unlike Iron Man or even other super hero series, it doesn't get deep or offer freshness. The acting is good don't get me wrong, with Robert Downey Jr and Jeremy Renner, but the plot is what gets me. Another man plans world domination, and yet again a hero risks his or her life for humanity, and lives. Good, but nothing special to the plot, or around the plot."
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,"After years and years through each foreshadowing end of each Marvel movie, they finally produce the Avengers. I had a lot of hype for this movie, and it lived up to every bit of it. Great flick, anticipating the second."
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,Avengers delivers on all fronts although the villain could have been better the story was still great
"Jan 22, 2013",positive,Seen it 4 times already in the theaters. Instant one of my favorite films of all time. Everything I love and then some.
"Jan 21, 2013",positive,it was simply fun to watch
"Jan 21, 2013",positive,"Very,Very,Very, good. It could use a little less
Swearing though"
"Jan 21, 2013",positive,"The movie was good but it was way over-hyped. I think that in an effort to fit all of the different characters in we lose a lot of the character development that makes Marvel movies fun in the first place. The movie is, in an essence, three drawn-out masterfully shot action sequences. The problem with this is that the characters suffer as a result."
"Jan 21, 2013",positive,Very good. I didn't expect to like it.
"Jan 21, 2013",negative,"It was fun despite the fact that I don't know about some heroes, but neither more nor less."
"Jan 21, 2013",positive,"Seen it all before; only excellent aspect was the special effects, nothing more."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,So much could have gone wrong here. Thank Odin it did not.
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"Super fun! Thoroughly entertaining. Thank you, Mr. Whedon."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"This is by far the BEST superhero movie. EVER. 
It's also more than that, it's actually a great action movie that's filled with thrills, humor, and pathos. Go see it now."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"Aside from The Dark Knight Rises, this was probably the most waited movie of the year, was it the movie of the year? No, but it was still fantastic. Up there, there's a not very certain rate of this movie, but here's a true review of this movie. The Avengers was not so good as I expected to be, that I can admit, but I still loved it, I admired that Joss Whedon did a great job with the characters screen time, it all had a balance, so no character seems distant, that was a very important element of the movie, and they succeeded at not blow it up, that was a great thing they did. The Avengers is the reunion of Marvel's greatest heroes (Yeah, unfortunately there's no Spider man, well, he's probably only amazing for them and they needed great), so this movie needed memorable action scenes. Well, along the movie, there's some great action scenes, but they can't be compared to what they saved for the end, it was almost 20 minutes of fantastic action scenes, featuring Iron Man (at his best), Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. The special effects were tremendous, as they shoul be and they brought a very significant and pleasunt quantity of humour in this movie, that was really helpful and enjoyable.

Downey once again suits up as Iron Man, and he was amazing once again, bringing to the screen he's amazing sense of humour and smartness. Chris Evans wasn't at Donwey's same calibre, but he was still solid. Mark Ruffalo was amazing as The Hulk, his performance was very solid. Chris Hemsworth fired some good jokes along the movie, nothing more than that, I don't appreciate Thor that much. Scarlett Johansson was amazing and hot here as the Black Widow, wich is a really strong character, by the way.  Jeremy Renner was too distant, Tom Hiddleston wasn't an amazing choise to play the villian, Clark Gregg was great, Cobie Smulders was a surprise, I was seeing Robin turning into a serious secret agent, oh and L. Jackson was also great with his Nick Fury.

Overall, The Avengers is a great blockbuster, that didn't fail, Whedon's direction made this happening so good. Of course the story isn't amazing, they didn't care about an amazing story, only the union of these heroes. But The Avengers is not a perfect fairy tale, it also has its flaws, like, the long second act that was mostly placed at a submarine and weird enemies that bored he viewer when shown, but aside from that, The Avengers is a fantastic movie, that succeeds at uniting all these heroes together amazingly, it was amazing to seem all work together, The Avengers is not easily forgotten. Highly recommended, oh, and by the way geeks, this is the new geek porn."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,Great film got it the day it came out!
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"fantastic chemistry, and great dialogue but above all just boldly brilliant fun."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"As a completist, I'm forced to type up something about ""The Avengers"". Here goes...It's big, it's fun, it's bright, it's exciting, it's funny. There. All done. Hmmm...that doesn't seem complete, really.
The most compelling characters are the Hulk and Iron Man. The Hulk is great here. But, and this is going to earn me zero comic book geek points, I find Ang Lee's Hulk monster more appealing. In that movie, you can knock him on his ass and shoot him up. He takes a second or two to shake it off and then he comes back for more. The ""Hulk smash"" scenes in that movie are intense and real. In ""The Avengers"", he's just another indestructible super-thing. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner character is much preferable, though. 
Robert Downey, Jr. is once again perfect as Tony Stark. He wisecracks and outsmarts plenty here and is the one who holds the whole thing together.
Captain America is a bit under powered, being that Thor is effectively a god and all. They try to add a superpower for Cap with the shield and all, but he's relegated to fighting with the other second-tier Avengers crew. Speaking of Thor, he misses out on a lot here. Like Superman, he's just too powerful. He can't really fit into a story like this.
For as many characters as there are, everyone has their moments. The story does feel a bit under told, but the movie is so viscerally exciting and bombastic that the lack of clever or emotionally impacting moments is forgiven. This is an ideal summer blockbuster."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,"A heroic film of epic proportions, teaming Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner) and Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) together to fight against Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The film is directed by the great Joss Whedon. The cast work well together and create an action packed fun filled film."
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,Really enjoyed this.
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,not to crazy about any of the avengers but good movie
"Jan 20, 2013",positive,More than just a superhero movie.
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,Sajian superhero berkelas dan mengasyikkan.
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,I went to see it last night with my mom and older brother. We all loved it. Loads of fun and laughs and great character interaction.
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,"I am a comic book collector. This movie combines the well loved comic books with the adapted movies for the major characters. So there were high expectations from both sets of fans. These expectations were fulfilled. It was a difficult task but the movie has some great acting from Downey Jr, and Ruffalo plus some great lines and a continuos Action romp that does not bog down. Probably not as good as Ironman, the first Ironman movie, but it brought in more people. I loved this movie but I'm a fan"
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,Esta es una gran muestra de cómo una película puede tener una historia sencilla y ser excelente.
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,"Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. 
1) Iron Man
2)Thor
3) Captain America"
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,great characters. can not wait for the next one.
"Jan 19, 2013",negative,"I honestlty don't get what all the fuzz is about. I slept almost through entire movie! Poor dialogue and boring.
I only gave it two stars because it's a good movie to fall asleep."
"Jan 19, 2013",neutral,So much hype for what I feel to be rather disappointing. Good action scenes and some funny moments but boring story with some long dragging moments. Also Scarlett Johansson is by far the worst actress they ever could of hired. Yes shes pretty but incredibly dull and not a good actress.
"Jan 19, 2013",positive,"What an amazing movie! Joss Whedon pulls it off again with this one! A great story, AMAZING ACTION and just the right ballance of drama and comedy carry you on an exciting rollercoaster of summer movie fun! Again, hats off to Joss Whedon for this one. Everything here is well paced and every hero has an equal part to play in the action. Grab your popcorn and get ready to have a blast! MAKE SURE TO STAY FOR AFTER THE CREDITS! THERE ARE TWO AFTER THE CREDITS STINGERS! So make SURE to stay till the END end!"" 5... out of 5!"
"Jan 19, 2013",neutral,"Things blow up, pop culture references are made and the characters are better used than is typical of the genre. It's a good enough movie but there's not much to it."
"Jan 18, 2013",positive,Fabulous!  Chris Helmsworth is just delicious!
"Jan 18, 2013",positive,to good. makes it worth another hulk film and make cap thor and ironman must sees
"Jan 18, 2013",positive,"Was a solid superhero movie, although I thought it didn't live up to the hype its worth watching."
"Jan 18, 2013",positive,"It's been awhile since I've seen CGI and action this good. A lot of the jokes miss, and the acting isn't great, but the action makes up for it all. Go see this movie!"
"Jan 17, 2013",positive,This how a comic book movie should be done!!
"Jan 17, 2013",positive,How can anyone resist a beautifully made movie which assembles all the great heroes?
"Jan 17, 2013",positive,Pure unadulterated awesome-sauce! What more need be said?
"Jan 16, 2013",positive,"This movie is amazing EXCEPT one thing. Joss Whedon is the only man that could make an action/super hero movie have so many intimate character development moments, which I LOVE. But Black Widow is awful. Black widow is breasts in a tight suit. She wasn't even an Avenger for long in the comics. Joss, I wish you would've done more with her. I appreciate the couple of scenes she is shown as such an intelligent person, but in the end, that largely is just meant to show ""I'm seductive"". For Avengers 2, replace her with Ant Man. Or Black Panther. Or one of the other comic book Avengers, one with a story and a personality. (I know this will never happen because sex sells nowadays, but hey, a guy can wish)"
"Jan 16, 2013",positive,"Holy. Crap. Great characters, amazing visuals and a perfect blend of action & story! AWESOME!!"
"Jan 16, 2013",positive,"A reasonably entertaining super hero film. Some nice character exploration highlighted by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark & Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. 

The final act was very entertaining but I almost shut the film off a couple times earlier on. It was just not very enjoyable.

Overall a reasonably good super hero film that gets better towards it's final climax."
"Jan 16, 2013",positive,Sickest super hero movie for awhile!
"Jan 16, 2013",positive,"Great action and special effects but in the end, just another high budget superhero film with very little development of it's ensemble cast."
"Jan 15, 2013",positive,"All things considered this was an amazing movie. Everything worked well. Story, special effects, acting akl blended together for excellent movie. A must see."
"Jan 15, 2013",positive,One of the best movies I've seen ever!!!!!
"Jan 15, 2013",positive,me and the boy loved it
"Jan 15, 2013",negative,"Though considered among film goers, I was out of it after 15 minutes. Though there is a lot action, the story and it's characters get lost in the confusion."
"Jan 15, 2013",positive,"For something that has had years of build up, hype, and various movie titles leading to it, ""The Avengers"" only barely manages to live up. Yes, the movie is good and is well made and produced, with actors doing their job and the CGI doing the rest, but it's just that. A flashy action film sure to be fun for the entire family, that has lots of flair but not as much substance. I would say that this film is indeed good and serves it's purpose, but is it a spectacular one? I liked it, but I didn't love it as so many of you do, and I certainly don't crown it with incredibly incredibly biased praise like most of the reviews I see below."
"Jan 15, 2013",positive,Another great hero movie well made.
"Jan 14, 2013",neutral,"I know I am going to get scathing responses from many fans here, but I have to be honest about this film.  ""The Avengers"" was good but definitely not the masterpiece that so many people say it is.  It hurts me to say this because everyone was clearly having fun, Joss Whedon was a perfect pick for director, and some of the humor was hilarious, but it becomes more and more manipulative every time I watch it.  ""Iron-Man"" was a clever science fiction film about an egotistical genius who turns his life around following a life-threatening incident.  The sequel did a relatively decent job of following suit despite practically coming to a stop to make room for a sneak peek of ""The Avengers"".  ""The Incredible Hulk"" was a very character-driven tale about a man trying to tame the monster within.  ""Thor"" felt very much like the classic myths depicting the interactions between Men and Gods.  ""Captain America"" was practically a living homage to the classic adventure films of the 40's.  Then ""The Avengers"" came along and seemed to discard all of those elements to combine all these characters together for a live-action version of a typical Saturday morning cartoon.  While the film does contain each distinct personality, the only characters who truly feel at home are Thor, Loki, and Bruce Banner to a certain extent.  I will admit that I had fun watching these characters interact with one another, but most of the fun was gone by the time the third act battle sequence kicked in.  It just feels very strange to me that after all the chances that the franchise took to stay true to the comics within the realms of live-action, that it would all come down to an explosion of nearly everything we have seen time and time again.  Maybe it is my decreasing interest in a lot of superhero and comic book fiction, or maybe it is my distaste for ""Team-Up"" films, but despite Whedon's obvious affection for the project, I just cannot enjoy this film quite like everyone else."
"Jan 14, 2013",positive,"Perhaps one of the quickest action movies to gain fame worldwide and make a killing at the box office, The Avengers has caught on like wildfire to the world of popular action movies and has officially kicked off the movie industry for summer business...as well as given upcoming releases (including the Dark Knight Rises and the Amazing Spider-man) much to live up to. Uniting characters from four different Marvel movies together for one blow out film and getting the original cast members (save for Hulk), few will find a reason not to check this one out.
The first big summer flick of 2012 finds Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (played by a comical Samuel L. Jackson) uniting superheroes from various recent films to form a team known as The Avengers to conquer the wicked Loki (a villain from Thor) and save the planet. Though all of them have their own agendas, they come together solidly yet have no idea what they are up against. Through various trials with many fallen warriors along the way, the supernatural powers each hero possesses bring them closer to creating world peace one step at a time. Though without the help of each of hero, they may never succeed and Loki's powers may rise to a level none of them are aware of.
A film many have anxiously awaited for prior to its April release, this flick will surely exceed expectations of skeptical viewers and is entertainment to the max. Not only did director Joss Weldon successfully get the original actors to come together for one mega film, but the script has something in it for all tastes, including many welcomed jokes (mostly from Tony Stark). A definite winner with an open ending for a sequel (anyone surprised?). Stay tuned through the end credits for two clips of additional footage."
"Jan 14, 2013",positive,"Joss Whedon made of Marvel's The Avengers what everyone was wanting this to be. A quality super-hero summer flick that leaves you flabbergasted. The movie is funny and has non-stop action. Furthermore, Whedon knows how to handle a great cast, and that is a very good quality for a filmmaker."
"Jan 14, 2013",positive,"This comic book fan's dreams come to life on the big screen! well almost, Stupid fox and sony holding back on a truely amazing movie universe"
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,Waiting for this movie since my first Avengers comic book in 1996.... And totally worth the wait!
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"What makes this movie so good is the fact that they waited. Didn't just come out and make, waited until all the characters were introduced and then did this. Perfect movie."
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,Its not a perfect film but it is a perfect summer blockbusterwith a sharp script great character interactions and big action the best comic book movie to date.
"Jan 13, 2013",negative,Ridiculously overrated and overhyped
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit too busy. I know it's hard to combine 5 movies into one. I guess this is the best outcome out of that scenario.
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"I do understand why most loved this film and praised it. I also do acknowledge that the film is good. But I must also underline that The Avengers is the most overrated movie of the year. 
The abundance of super heroes combining together certainly made it feel so, since everybody loves at least one of these characters. I personally always hated Captain America and loved it when he was always bullied by Stark and Thor.  Marvel has certainly prepared this film by releasing during the last five years an origin story for Captain America, Iron Man, The incredible Hulk, and Thor. The newcomers are basically Black Widow and HawkEye, brilliantly portrayed by Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner. 
However, it is definitely the combination of Downey Jr. (Iron Man) & Ruffalo (Hulk) that steals the show, but even themselves couldn't prevent the unpersuasive scripting of intertwining planets, even if we know about the 7 Kingdoms. It just felt absurd and totally unrealistic, which killed the whole purpose. Why presenting us and persuading us with origin stories for a decade to come up with an unpersuasive script ??? I'm seriously baffled here.
However, you will be entertained, you will see your action heroes, and you will certainly be eating a lot of pop-corn. In addition, you will leave the theater smiling, which is one of the reasons to go to see a movie."
"Jan 13, 2013",negative,"Generic.  I'm glad Robert Downey Jr. is cashing some massive checks these days, but I sure wish he'd go back to doing interesting movies."
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"""The Avengers"" is epic.  It successfully pulls six superheros into one film while giving each hero his own storyline and development until all six paths eventually intersect.  Some multi-hero films (cough cough ""Fantastic Four"") don't properly develop the characters and just become a jumble of annoying personalities.  But ""The Avengers"" has even more challenges than character development.  Unlike the X-Men films, where all of the characters exist in the same world and have the same goal of protecting the mutants, this film pulls characters from several comic worlds and has to make these worlds align.  I like how the writers didn't suddenly throw all of the characters together in a room and say ""Let's do this.""  The film has a believable quality because some of the characters show resistance to joining, other characters pair up and try to find a solution but can't do it on their own, and finally the necessity of the situation pulls them all together instead of their desire to be a team.  All of the acting is incredible, from Robert Downey Jr.'s coolness as Iron Man to Scarlett Johansson's never-ending kick-butt sexiness as Black Widow.  Outside of the superheros, Clark Gregg reprises his role as Agent Coulson and really grabs the spotlight this time.  Also, Samuel L. Jackson.  That is all.  The action sequences are amazing, the Hulk is so cool as he destroys stuff, the dialogue is great, and the acting is even better; however, this movie falls short in one way for me and that's the inclusion of mythological enemies.  The recent trend in superhero movies has placed these heroes into real world situations that makes it seem that they could be among us.  The costumes and characteristics of these heroes have been altered so that their abilities can be logically explained and the character's appearance wouldn't be laughable if we saw them on the street.  I understand that the plot of ""Thor"" requires this mythical garb and even though he looks goofy standing next to Hawkeye, I could have been okay with it.  But why did the conflict have to revolve around other-worldly beings instead of a realistic enemy like those in the ""Iron Man"" series.  I just feel as if this film lost some of its potential by breaking the realism that has placed superheros into the real world.  That being said, the story, special effects, acting, and script are awesome and make ""The Avengers"" one of the best superhero films out there.  I can't wait to see The Disney Corporation's continued enhancement of the Marvel Universe."
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"Having a huge cast of both top-notch actors and top-notch supers can prove to be difficult, but Joss Whedon and Kevin Fiege manage to bring the big 4 and more to the screen in collaboration that works wonders. It may be long, but it certainly doesn't feel that way and every moment is necessary to the story. While the first act brings together the supers in an extraordinary way, the second delivers a hard impact on the audience and the final act boasts some of the best action sequences ever scene in sci-fi and superhero movies alike. The Avengers rounds off Phase One with the biggest bang ever and sets the bar for Marvel and co."
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"Awesome film, good story and amazing effects, some funny one liners....Hulk and Iron Man steal the show for me."
"Jan 13, 2013",positive,"A bit too cluttered and convoluted and the villain is a dud, but it's fun which this sort of thing should be."
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"It was the perfect climax to all of the build up of the individual movies -- which ranged from pretty good to really good -- the individual movies provided the background and The Avengers was the climax. It works because you can take characters that might not have made the best movie (Thor, for example) and they all just come together and don't have to be the focal point, and they can just be part of the collective movie. That's why it works so well and that's why it's the best super hero movie that doesn't have the word 'bat' in it."
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,That. Was. Great. Very well-rounded and well-written script.
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,Best superhero movie ever made!
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"Loved the movie! Much fun, and worth while! Fun for kids and adults!"
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,Good action but completely lacks a story.
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,Very good! Amazing how they combined all of the movies into one big one
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"The juggernaut superhero movie of the year, âThe Avengers"", is possibly the most ambitious and entertaining superhero film I have ever seen. The concept started out as just a teaser after the credits of Ironman. Marvel Studious slowly crafted an intricately web of superhero films leading up to The Avengers.
The film picks up by revealing the fate of Thor's brother Loki. Loki has survived his climatic fate from his previous battle against Thor, and is now planning to invade and conquer earth. With the world facing itâ(TM)s most dangerous threat ever. Nick Furry the director of S.H.I.E.L.D decides to get the greatest Team of super heroes ever assembled to save the world. Usually what seems good on paper never turns out well in reality. The problem with having a self-sacrificing hero is that they never want to sacrifice being center stage. This issue is what works the best for the Avengers. From the heroes having to learn how to cope with their teammates, to showing off to one another is the glue the keeps the film entertaining. Is it the best superhero film ever made? I would leave that answer to self-interpretation. 
Standouts go to both Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Hiddleston. Robert Downey Jr. will forever be recognized as the face of Tony Stark, just like Harrison ford will always be known as Indiana Jones. He has that certain charm and arrogance that will always be a delight to watch. As entertaining Downey is as Tony Stark, the star of the film belongs to Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He carries the best dialog and shines whenever heâ(TM)s onscreen. You feel his torment and arrogance as the filmâ(TM)s main protagonist. He is a Shakespearian actor that never brings his character down to a campy style. This helps the audience believe in the threat of earthâ(TM)s destruction. The Avengers is a solid opening to 2012â(TM)s summer movie season."
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,I love this movie!! Robert Downey jr. Was great for the part of iron man
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"Worth every penny of the Â£30.40 price tag (for two tickets). 3D IMAX, strong cast, fantastic story and amazing special effects come together in a two and a half hour spectacle. If you've enjoyed the other Marvel films then this one will not disappoint."
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"I just finished watching the movies for the first time......and wow.  I was very skeptible when the hero movies started coming out.  I am in my late forties and I started being a comic hero fan in the late sixties.  I lost most interest in the late eighties due to poor art and lousy stories.  

All of the movies that have come out follow the same boring theme...someone in a costume, some action and a love story.  The Batman series had that, but also gave us a good story.  The Spiderman group gave us too much of a love story and so did the Fantastic Four.  The first Hulk was horrible as was the Green Lantern fiasco.  The second Hulk was outstanding, as was the Iron Man movies.  Captain America and Thor were ok...but I would rather have seen more of the hero than watch them stumble over a broken heart.....yawn.   

Now the Avengers.    What I didn't like is small.  I didn't care much for the new Bruce Banner....sorry but Ed Norton was better and it was a shame that he could not have been there.   As for Captain America, it's not that the actor was a bad Human Torch, it's more the scripts were bad.  I do like the more hard core Cap.   Thor looks more like a sixties beach bum, but that's passable.

What did I like.....everything else.   The action, the humor, the lack of another love story (I was worried were the Widow and Hawkeye thing was heading tho).  The Hulk made my day when he finally came out and his interaction with Thor and Loki was fantastic.  

I honestly thought it was going to be a corny movie...another wanna-be and I am very glad I was wrong.  The action was great, the interaction between the characters was true to the character and enjoyable.  The story was refreshing a fun to watch.  I was put off initially when I heard about the lineup including Hawkeye and the Black Widow, but it actually worked for the most part.  And speaking of Hawkeye, I think they did a really good job with him.

I hope the trend continues with the way the movie was created.  Keep good action and good stories with a good cast and we could see great movies for a long time.  I for one am getting bored with the ""poor me"" and ""love is above all"" scripts.  Those two with the constant recreation movies that some directors feel the need to waste time on, I hope is getting weeded out.  Keep the Avengers going strong with a good cast and good writing.

Now if only DC would get the message"
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"Okay, silly superhero movie... BUT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE.So glad we went so see it opening week, it's so much better when the theatre's full and everybody around you is as into it as you are."
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,That was fun :) Especially Robert Downey...Just love his attitude :)))))
"Jan 12, 2013",positive,"If you like Comic based action films this is definitely right up your street.  I love it.  Action packed, tongue in cheek genius"
"Jan 12, 2013",neutral,a movie with a more than cliche story but the superheroes feel like real superheroes but the actors don't do a lot. The only thing they do is try to anoy each other and tell bad jokes.
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,"Mehh. That's all I have to say. Through all the hype and stunning action one thing is overlooked. The story, or more-so the lack of story. The lack of romance and drama, the lack of everything except Iron Man and action. The hulk (Mark Ruffalo)  puts on one of the greatest performances  of any of the actors, and yet he has less screen-time than most. I'm not going to rant here but the non stop bombardment of action was really a turn off for me. 87/100"
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,Top marvel movie made (so far....)  hope this one has set the bar.
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,"Surpassed all my expectations, It was better than I thought it could ever be."
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,"a very long, very big budget blockbuster which didn't have a huge affect on me. It was entertaining to see all these characters together and it was a mostly entertaining film but it could have been a lot shorter."
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,A hugely fun experience...a childhood dream come to life.  Marvel gets it.
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,"An exciting thrill ride from start to finish, with an array of characters who just work brilliantly together."
"Jan 11, 2013",positive,Love it. Best superhero film since Spider-Man 2.
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,"I had a blast with this film! A true summer blockbuster! Now, was I as crazy about this film as other people were? Not at all. I thought it was a great summer film but as for people making it out as one of the greatest films of all time? That's a bit much."
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,"The best superhero movie I've seen in a long time. The film is filled with a great cast, and has amazing action sequences. Joss whedon gave the fans what they wanted. And now looking forward to avengers 2. A+"
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,"Totally worth a watch over and over again. As predictable as comics are - full of action, suspense and sci-fi thrills. Although some scenes and ideas seem familiar from others shows like Transformers, this is constant nail biting action and the thrill of the justice happens when Loki tries to assert himself face to face with the Hulk. You'll just have to see it to believe it. Looking forward to seeing it again and again!!!"
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,Better than X-Men! Only behind the Dark Kinght franchise for best superhero movie ever
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,"The whole MCU has been leading to this and it is Spectacular, it delivers on every level and has a great re-watch appeal, Marvel Studios, Joss Whedon, and the entire cast have crafted a Marvelous Masterpiece."
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,"Awesome flick!!! All the heroes are brought together brilliantly, and the story is amazing!"
"Jan 10, 2013",negative,Childish movie. Transformers 3 plot.
"Jan 10, 2013",positive,group of superheroes + lots of destruction still can't convince me to like the movie
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,Entretiene mucho y más cuando hay chiquitines en la casa...
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,Very entertaining and who could hate all these super heroes together in one movie? Epic!
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,"Excellent blockbuster
quoi dire de plus"
"Jan 9, 2013",neutral,"Fun seeing all of the heroes on the big screen, but this was a pretty by the books action movie. Sit back and turn your brain off."
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,Outstanding - dialogue was fantastic so many in jokes - loved it. Hulk vs Loki - hilarious.
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,"My main concern with The Avengers was, in encompassing all of the members, the film would be spread too thinly between the characters, resulting in a watered down attempt to integrate characters and personalities, a little like the X-men films. Thankfully this is not the case, although it's interesting that co-writer Zak Penn was involved in two of the X-men group films. Penn and Joss Whedon find enough screen-time for all the Avengers and by introducing them gradually through the film's opening third, sufficient emphasis is placed on each character. Similarly, I was disappointed when I discovered that the film's antagonist would be Loki, as I was not overly impressed with him in Thor. Again though, due to Hiddlestone's improved performance this time around and with Whedon's direction, I felt Loki was a much more interesting villain and one more fitting of the collective's film.

The team dynamic of between the superheroes is what really makes the film, alongside the blockbuster action sequences. Thor and Hulk clash, Captain America and Tony Stark routinely throw barbs at each other while Stark shows a surprisingly sincere side when offering support to Bruce Banner. Mark Ruffalo plays Banner with a sense of fear and regret of his destructive, uncontrollable power and I found him to be the most interesting character of the team. There's a slightly contrived back-story thrown in to give Hawkeye and Black Widow something of interest but its the funny moments between Stark and co. that gives the film its spark. Samuel. L. Jackson's brings his usual 'don't mess with me' cool factor and his larger role also benefits the movie. Being critical, I'm not sure the plot gave enough explanation as to why Banner returned to fight alongside the others after showing nothing but resistance to let 'the other guy' appear, or how he was able to control Hulk more effectively in contrast with the film's earlier events.

The so called Battle of New York finale is a really exciting well-directed battle, especially when you consider it's similarities to the frantic city battles Michael Bay treated us to in his Transformer films.

A genuine action blockbuster fit for it's cast."
"Jan 9, 2013",positive,"Awesome, worked with all the characters, lots of funny bits. Thor was incredibly sexy x"
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,complete entertainment
"Jan 8, 2013",negative,"When I see movies like this I become terribly worried about the future of film.

The Avenger's looks so digital that the people look fake, and the set design makes it look like a made for T.V Power Rangers movie from 1997. That's not all, the dialogue is pathetic and any attempt at humor is painful to watch and listen to. Nothing in this movie ever gels, there is no character developement , no sentiment so I really didn't care about any of the characters, and the action sequences are boring and repetitive. All I can really say is... Really? This plastic dreck is considered an achievement? This is the direction we're going in?"
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,Its good cudda use more fight scenes
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,The dialogues between Stark and Captain America are wonderful! :)
"Jan 8, 2013",negative,A complete waste of money. All corny wittiness and no real story. Literally made me nauseous.
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,One of the best hero shows of our time. Love the humor.
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,The best superhero movie ever!!! Id say one of the best movies ever period. Its awesome.
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,Great popcorn movie.
"Jan 8, 2013",positive,"When it comes to modern superhero movies, Nolan's Batman trilogy has raised the bar. Much as I love Joss Whedon, I don't think he quite hits the right note, perhaps a shade too bombastic and empty."
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,i love love love this movie!
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,not as good as the dark night rises
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,Downey Jr. carries the film with his super cool Tony Stark. Ruffalo's Hulk is great. The rest of the cast is good and has grown into their characters. Whedon plays it way too safe and makes this rather bland with a loud and numbing ending that belongs in a Michael Bay film. He is lucky to have such likeable characters.
"Jan 7, 2013",neutral,"As much as I respect this team for what they have managed to do with combining 4 existing franchises, I can't help but feel disappointed with the end result. Here we have the greatest assembly of Marvel superheroes ever to appear on the silver screen and yet I never once felt captivated eBay the action or plot. Loki as the main villain bears nowhere near enough of a threat. I understand that this is the first installment which is meant to introduce the team but I felt like that was the only thing really going here. Is it cool to see such a massive idea accumulate? Yes... But once the novelty of it wears off, we're left with a very mediocre film. The writing is serviceable if not above average. The ending does conjure excitement toward future films where the threat will be massive and hopefully well adapted (Thanos of course). Ruffalo's Bruce Banner is a welcome addition and this is likely the best version of Hulk on the big screen yet. As a huge comic fan, I look forward to where things are heading but I do hope that future installments have stronger intros and more of an impact."
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,An absolute MUST SEE!
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,"Joss Whedon manages the high caliber actors and established canon laid before him wondrously. This is not surprising, seeing his track record on screens , both big and small. Great performances in a film where they could have been lacking, and fantastic direction by Whedon."
"Jan 7, 2013",positive,"The story, in a nutshell, just seems so simple and not innovative at all. But Marvel's The Avengers, stands out in it's direction and a good solid cast."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,A movie on steroids.
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,"Josh Whedon knows how to make a movie. The Avengers is the definition of popcorn entertainment. There's little in the way of weighty themes or ideas to stick with a viewer after leaving the theater, but I'll be damned if this isn't the most entertaining superhero film I've ever seen. 2012 was a bit on the weaker side as far as superheroism was concerned (Chronicle notwithstanding), so its always nice to go into a big budget action movie, watch some glorious spectacle and hear some witty banter, and not feel as if my IQ is dropping as a result of viewing. Thank you, Joss Whedon, for understanding that having explosions does not excuse a writer from having to put in well drawn characters and great dialog."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,I enjoyed this one. I like Jos Whedons style. I also loved the coming together of all these characters from other films.
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,I just hope they kill off Hawkeye (blonde guy with bow and arrows) before the next one.
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,"The Avengers was absolutely incredible. Amazing special effects, all-star cast, and tons of humor throughout, this movie is definitely one of my favorites and it is easily the best superhero movie I have ever seen."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,As superhero movies go there isn't much better
"Jan 6, 2013",neutral,"I did rather enjoy this film, but then it got a little boring, and in the end I just gave up and didnt watch it anymore. Its highly over-rated, I was a little dissapointed."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,"It's a pretty good movie, I'll give it that but I don't get all the hype. See my full review at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,"Once again, Tom Hiddleston's perfect portrayal of Loki Laufeyson has made me burst into fangirly, angsty tears. Gorgeous."
"Jan 6, 2013",positive,I think no superhero film is much better than this! This was amazing! This was great! Unfantastic Four was the opposite but that does not matter. There scenes were BRILLIANT! But I gave it a 5 and a half stars because Loki is extremely annoying and the talking scenes were ridiculously long.
"Jan 5, 2013",positive,"Most people actually start getting angry when I say that I prefer The Avengers over The Dark Knight Rises. They say that The Avengers was nothing more than a dumb popcorn flick and that The Dark Knight Rises actually tells a story. The plot for The Avengers may be pretty basic, but Joss Whedon succeeds in making you actually pay attention and be enamored the whole time. Whedon has once again achieved the feat of taking 7 or 8 main characters and making giving them enough development to both make them relevant to the plot and making you care about them. Combine that with amazing performances, some of the best action ever shot, and a lot of laughs, and that makes The Avengers the new standard for not just comic book movies, but for action films in general."
"Jan 5, 2013",positive,"A good mix of all of the movie threads Marvel's been cultivating, probably too focused on Iron Man, but still solid."
"Jan 5, 2013",positive,My review is here: http://42lifeinbetween.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/avengers-the-review/
"Jan 5, 2013",positive,"Ever since we heard Sam Jackson's word at the end of 2008's Iron Man five years ago of what was merely an idea, we have grown with anticipation throughout every film.  What was truly great about the Avengers was not the great acting, effects, characters (although they do come close), it's the build up.  Thank you Joss Whedon."
"Jan 5, 2013",positive,Awesome movie! One of the best I have seen.
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,"Loved it! Fun from beginning to end, but I am a sucker for comic book hero movies."
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,The first movie that has the hulk that didn't completely suck.
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!!
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,Just Awesome Goodness
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,"By far the best superhero films out there. It never disappoints. It's emotional, but not too emotional, action packed, funny, and clever. It's as if we're reading a comic book with a much better visual."
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,This was so good I would have watched it again straight afterwards (if it hadn't already been past my bed time). Absolutely brilliant! Such a shame my 6 year old boy can't watch it yet.
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,Joss whedon was great before but after directing this movie I just don't have the words to show my gratitude to the man.
"Jan 4, 2013",positive,one of the best comic book movies ever...
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"At the end of the day, this is a really, REALLY good transformers film. I have a really bad feeling that this will inspire the next generation of Michael Bay adaptions which scares the hell out of me. 

Rating: A+ (for effort)"
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"Very stylish superhero action. During many of the fight scenes in the film, the action feels like true superhero teamwork, and the camera techniques used during fight scenes are superb. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat with the explosive action and interesting fight choreography."
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"This is a fantastic movie!  It has it all--great effects, good acting, gripping story--everything!  The moral of how we have to work together against evil is fittingly embodied by Captain America the ultimate Great Generation hero leading the postmodern heroes who lack the Captain's moral fiber and unselfish dedication.  It is rollicking good fun for kids of all ages!"
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,perfect popcorn film that you won't get bored of! :-)
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,perfect popcorn film that you won't get bored of! :-)
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"Pulls all the superheroes together, a great action flick, but still full of fun, good chemistry among the varied characters"
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"As I said with Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, giving this a full score is just cutting it a little short for me...! I had a hard time deciding what my favorite movie EVER was... and NOW I KNOW WHY: my TRUE all-time favorite took almost 20 years to come out...! For EVERY movie made after this, and the people who made them: THE BAR HAS BEEN RAISED...!!!!!"
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,A very entertaining and overall solid super hero movie.
"Jan 3, 2013",positive,"The first time I saw this film I was left speechless, deteriorates the second time."
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,Hilarious and awesome!
"Jan 2, 2013",negative,"After seeing Thor which I loved, I was just disappointed in this, constant over the top affects. Sensory overload."
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,"Stellar acting and scores give way to an even more impressive script that does allows the moviegoer to forget the seemingly basic ""superhero"" story and indulge themselves in a truly incredible comedy-thriller."
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,AWSOME marvel movie.complete heroes.awesome Loki.go nick fury.he made the avengers assemble.cool action.
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,"An amazing mash up of all the comic characters... If you like this then you should definitely consider reading the comics of each, or just the avengers comic in general! :)"
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,"Just WOW, what else can I say?"
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,Good movie worth an evening out.
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,"Fun movie, wish there was more on some of the characters, but I guess that's why you watch the individual movies.  Mark Ruffalo is amazing as the Hulk, so much better than the acting from the Hulk movies."
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,"No a big Marvel fan, but this was a fun, popcorn munching movie.

Action movies with Super Heroes > Action movies on their lonesome."
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,one of the best movies of the year.
"Jan 2, 2013",positive,Definitely a Marvel fan here and I loved it!
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,It's hugely entertaining and is no doubly the perfect film for all Marvel geeks and even for some people not fans of the universe. (A)
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,not bad......still ok
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,One of the best movies I've seen in awhile.
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,One of the few super hero movies to get it right. Focuses on the tried and true formula of heroes vs villains and doesn't get bogged down in backstory. Stays true to the characters which makes their interaction all the more enjoyable and believable.
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,"One of the best superhero movies made.  The unique personalities and motivations of each of the characters molds together to create a satisfyingly unique, comical, and action-filled production.  I have to agree with Wally Pfister that some of the cinematography was clearly for the sake of showing off a fancy set piece rather than driving the story or telling something about a character.  Not only was the cinematography at times needless, but much of the entire film is nothing but mindless entertainment with very little substance to support it.  Nonetheless, it is a very thrilling and exciting movie sure to entertain everyone."
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,"I think this is one of the best movies ever made. I wasn't a fan of every individual film but together these guys are Amazing! Joss did a wonderful job (as he always does) and the script was near perfect! It was funny, suspenseful, sad (yes I cried) and well executed!"
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,Not only what I was expecting from an Avengers movie... but also everything I expected from a Joss Whedon movie as well...  And the Hulk gives us one of the best moments on film.
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,"An incredibly awesome all out action movie!! In my mind, it is the greatest movie I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. The characters are all solid(other than Hawkeye but he can develop over time), the story has equal level comic book convolution and equal level awesomeness!! It is a very, very good conclusion to an epic series of films and the good thing is...there are more to come!!"
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,The biggest must-see of 2012.
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,one word to describe this movie EPIC
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,Absolutely great movie and one of the best DC Superhero movies I have ever seen!!!
"Jan 1, 2013",positive,"Great movie. Best in the series, except maybe for the first Iron Man."
"Dec 31, 2012",negative,"92%? WTF? For being far more interesting than the average super hero film, I'll grant it a 4/10. It's still quite a predictable bore."
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,Love this movie. Also like how the others tie into this one.
"Dec 31, 2012",neutral,It's entertaining with its Michael Bay extravagance.
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,Best comic book tie-in ever!
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,"Brilliant story, brilliant acting and the special effects are supreme. Top notch performances from the whole cast, even if Scarlett Johansson is only in it for eye candy."
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,Banner aka hulk steals the show but stark and cpt America are fun to watch hating each other
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,"This film was my first Marvel movie since Spiderman and I must say, this film is awesome and made me a Marvel fan again."
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,"It was a meh movie for me, but I'm not a comic book fan at all.  Robert Downy was pretty funny which lightened the mood of the movie. Still wouldn't watch the individual movies though but hey ho"
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,"Lived up to the hype for me.  Great effects, and nice development of the interactions between the members of the Avengers.  A couple of great tongue-in-cheek moments...two of my favorites involve the Hulk.  Definitely worth the price of admission."
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,fantastic movie but the death of the agent was unneed he has being in most pf the marvel movie and was sad to see him go
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,I had a total blast.  The superhero nerd in me was more than satisfied.
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,Amazing film! My faviroute out of any film I as seen. I couldn't of been any better
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,"Fantastic! That's the only word that can describe this movie. Excellent actors, plot, action, and much more."
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,Good. But that's all there is to it.
"Dec 31, 2012",positive,film of the year and the film Dark knight hoped it could be
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,"Not a bad action movie, can said it is an best movie of 2012 ^^"
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,"By Zanele Jiane

A bunch of superheroes are put together kicking and screaming in order to defend planet Earth from an alien invasion superintended by Thor's step brother Loki. Loki a Norse god, is cunning and has an ace up his sleeve all the time, but in Avengers he met more than his match.

Although there are many characters in the movie, each character shines brilliantly nevertheless. Thor is dignified and poised as always, Iron Man has his fun at the expense of others (Shakespeare in the park joke, Point Break jokes...all to Thor's humiliation), The Hulk revealing his secret, Hawkeye gets to play both sides of the fence and Black Widow handles the most challenging part of the gang, and Captain America taking charge and guiding the rest.

Avengers is full of energy and drama and has a clear cut premise that the audience will appreciate, the effects are delicious and the camera placement during the final battle puts the viewers inside the carnage.
The visual effects are amazing and leaves nothing to be desired, the score is lively, the editing is tight enough and renders the movie full circle.

Highly recommended"
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,Best Marvel movie yet!
"Dec 30, 2012",neutral,"It's not exactly the best superhero film of the year, but a passable one. After scrutinizing it, the film has too much of everything yet lacks so other things as well. Too much visuals, too much ridiculous and seemingly meaningless action feats, too much cliched punchlines. The film lacks plot and realism. It seems to be a mere cinematic visual tour de force with nothing much to tell (apart from the usual work-together and good-vs-evil) aimed to only entertain, in which it really did. It was entertaining, visually, but there's nothing special in it for me to actually remember it at all. Overall, it's bland film-making with visuals and loud sound effects being forced right into your face and ears, respectively. As a consolation, it did what it set out to do: entertain."
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,So good it hurts. I have been dreaming of a movie like this ever since in was a little boy and It was everything I ever dreamed it would be and more. Seriously go see it!
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,"High on comedy and action, lacking on plot and character development."
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,Dragged along for a fair bit at the start but livened up to be a great action flick with lots of funny bits.
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,flows nicely and they finally got the Hulk right
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,"Lots of action, little plot. I understand that sometimes it takes a movie to introduce all the characters and plot for sequels. In the end I hope the next one is better."
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,The Avengers lacks nothing in terms of stunning visuals and well orchestrated action. Somehow I wanted to see more of Bruce Banner.
"Dec 30, 2012",negative,"I went to the movie theatre to see this film in 3D and I was surprised, because I had expected something of a classic - based on the 93/96 % rating on rottentomatoes. Instead of a 4,5 star film, what I witnessed was a childish spinoff for Thor, featuring appearances by Robert Downey, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow.
 So why not such a blast? The film is full of action scenes, but it also has some tedious, pointless dialogue which doesn't really help in building up excitement or the storyline, for that matter. Abundance of action is an advantage, lack of sensible dialogue is a disadvantage. Tedious slowdowns amidst flying people, missiles, monsters and airoplanes, make it a mixture of fast action moments which are hollow of meaning, slowed down by equally empty and meaningless moments of sluggishness.
 The acting is not bad, but it is not anything to write about to the grandchildren either. Neither is the story, which is oddly useless in the way of building the characters or interest. Even though the characters have a background, its really only clear for the moviegoer who has seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and Hulk. The monsters are just a big unknown with no depth at all. 
 The big problem of this movie is its emptiness. Like a big, colorful canister of metal that makes lots of noice, it failed to attract. Mean looks and one or two witty but silly lines, with some cool special effects, is not enough to save it from being lost in the midst of meaninglessness. Just a toy show. Certainly not worthly of over 90% ratings!"
"Dec 30, 2012",positive,the finale in this film is fantastic - the ultimate HULK SMASH !!!!!!!!
"Dec 29, 2012",negative,"This is a blockbuster in every sense of the world. Taking the levels of explosions, action, and villians to an extreme, The Avengers in theory has the right recipe for a hit movie. But for me, the Avengers themselves come off as shallow, one-note archetypes that never really go anywhere. Black Widow and Hawkeye are shoehorned into the story for reasons unclear to me, as the film doesn't know what to do with them, as the least extreme/most human of the bunch. I think that's the film's biggest problem: It's so concerned with being super, that it loses most of what makes it human."
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,One of the coolest movies and ideas for a movie I think I have ever seen
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,Watch until all the credits roll!
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"Action packed and it was great, can't wait to see avengers 2"
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"This was an awesome movie and for all comic book fans, and movie fans in general, it's a must watch!"
"Dec 29, 2012",negative,"Worst movie ever! There wasn't really a plot, it was just screaming and fighting. It kinda seemed like I was watching Transformers. It was too generic, I would've liked it better if the superheroes actually got a specific power, they all had the same fighting technique. Meh"
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is easily the best superhero movie I have ever seen in my life. Now before Christopher Nolan fans get mad at me let me clarify that I'm not counting the Batman movies since they are almost a completely different genre and can't really be compared. However The Avengers was a fantastic film! The only down side I can possibly think of is that it makes me not as eager to watch the previous films, all of which pale in comparison. http://storyhobby.com/reviews/film/theavengers"
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,Sämre än vad jag hade trott. Hade hoppats på mer djup. Men den var ändå sevärd.
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,Greatly anticipated and absolutely loved it!! Great start to hopefully a new series of comic movies.
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,The Avengers RULES! Great movie. Great Cast. Great Effects...
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,It's awesome except for the main plot. Thor and Loki are kind of boring.
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"This is the best movie ever, no dout about it!!"
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"Well written, beautifully choreographed, with amazing acting! A must own!"
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"If you wanted X-Men with 10 times the explosions, watch Avengers.
Edward Norton was missed, the new guy wasn't bad, but Norton would've been better."
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,"If somebody told me 10 years ago that there would be a Live-Action Marvel Avengers movie i would have thought they where insane. Finally at long last the fans got what they wanted and what they deserved, a well thought out story backed up by 5 well done movies that have built up the premise that it was all leading to this movie.
Honestly the best film of 2012 and a movie that not only the kids will enjoy but adults who where fans of the comics at a young age and newcomers to the franchise will still enjoy with open arms."
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,The Avengers is an epic motion-picture! It has the comic-book atmosphere and great interpretations of Marvel's characters. Joss Whedon did it extremely right!
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,BEST FILM OF 2012! PERIOD!
"Dec 29, 2012",positive,It was amazing movie
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,awesome movie!! i loved it.
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,Awesome movie and it was even better in 3D. I liked how no one out shined the other â?¦can't wait to see more and this time with Wolverine and Spiderman (Toby Maguire's Spiderman )
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,So good.  Definitely a great movie for a Marvel fan.  Hulk was particularly funny in certain parts.  Captain America is fierce.
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,great movie and great actors.
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,A comic book fan 's dream come true. Best Action Movie of 2012
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,"Awesome, totally awesome. Great special effects and a good story line supported by great direction and snappy dialogue from Joss Whedon. This is one of those films where almost every scene and one-liner can become a favorite (""so...we have a Hulk..."" - LOL!) One of the few comic book films that lives up to the hype."
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,Best film of 2012 by far... Unless you hate superheroes!
"Dec 28, 2012",neutral,"I enjoyed it the first time around, but it is not worth a second watch.  If you want to keep thinking it's good, stop at the first view."
"Dec 28, 2012",positive,"Unbelievable film! Just unbelievable! The story, the action, and the sequel lead-in!"
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"holy shit, what a great movie."
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"No doubt, one of the best movies"
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,The best mega film of 2012z
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,i loved it my fav m8vie
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"very good movie, can't wait for the sequel..."
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,Spectacular!! This was the culmination of several movies all coming together. It was directed wonderfully. It had great action and lots of comedic value. I could watch this movie again and again. Must see.
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,I was told this was kid-friendly. Maybe if your kid is 12.
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"I won't say that this is the best film if the year, I love superheroes, and this blockbuster, although silly, is thoroughly enjoyable. Definitely the funniest comic romp made yet, a little more hulk would have made it better, but all in all a decent popcorn movie."
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"Thoroughly entertaining. They pulled off the impossible. This could have easily been a cluttered mess of characters doing explosions (think Transformers 3) but it had some heart and I'm a geek for comics. While I do not agree that it was ""movie of the year"" it certainly was excellent and the build up from all the solo flicks was just brilliant. Unfortunately, I fear this is the pinnacle and from here on out the movies will decline."
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,So good! Entertainment value through the roof! I especially love the Hulk hammering Loki.. Puny god..LOL!
"Dec 27, 2012",neutral,Too much background history. Looks more like an Iron Man Movie. Hulk is the movie best supporting character.
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon has done the unthinkable by not only making the first good Marvel movie for half a decade, but by devoting enough screen time to each of these iconic heroes. The Avengers is a funny, action packed thrill ride that just flies by without a single hitch (aside from the expendable alien antagonists). Downey Jr. deserves special praise but Whedon is the star here for sure."
"Dec 27, 2012",positive,this movie is off the fucking chain
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,Really good watch got plenty of action in it & a few surprises loved it
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"LOVE this movie!  Plenty of action, comedy even and great feel good super hero movie!"
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie ever
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Directed by a nerd, loved by everyone."
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,Pretty good for a super Heroes movie
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Fun but not great. Someone needs to explain to Chris Evans that the Cap does NOT remove his mask that often... dude needs to watch Dredd to understand it's not the actor but the character that matters. Renner almost put me to sleep as Hawk Eye, Ruffalo is so depressing he makes everyone else want to kill themselves, Johansson is completely useless.... everyone else was cool and should return for the sequel. At the end this was made too family friendly and not dark enough."
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"I really like the Avengers. Great Acting, great comedy, great action, but i thought the plot was a little thin (ex. how can the Hulk now be controlled when it represents something that can't), and i don't really call it the greatest superhero movie ever, more like the most anticipated, but everything else was great, but i won't give it a 100 or a 90, a 70 or an 80 is a more accurate rating."
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Good movie, nicely set up by Marvel"
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,DC Comics will do justice league way better than this crap!
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Awsome movie but it ended to suddenly so it get 4 stars!  

                                    :)"
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,Great movie for all ages it just took a little too long for the movie to come together
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,A lot of exposition and setting up before the big fights but it builds nicely and the end fight scene was awesome
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Great movie, can't wait to see the next one."
"Dec 26, 2012",positive,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!"
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,All the super hero action you need.
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,I was surprised about this movie... it was REALLY good!
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,They brought all the characters together in a great way and made it make sense.
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,Big Time Awesome!!!!!
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,Great movie. a must see for any age group. Really brings the characters together without under demeaning any ones role.
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,"MARVEL has actually managed to make a live action interpretation of something that comic readers always have in mind, and that is CREATING A UNIVERSE from which each character can feed itself to the point where ""events"" of this magnitude need only so little to become a reality.

AVENGERS is a well made movie, in a sense of the light nature of its script and plot in general, it has comedy, so many action to make your eyes explode, and so much superhero fan-service that you won't be able to come out of it with a share of critics to the portrayal of some of them, nevertheless it is the perfect overall construction of the movie that make the whole experience worthwhile, you can see the whole idea behind it clearly as day, and that is an unassuming movie with a lightweight plot and fast pace that only needs a little argumental thread to survive and can easily just focus on action, and not any kind of it, but SUPERHERO action... the secret to sustain itself lies in the construction of the movie-verse, because for the first time the characters don't need to overindulge in mediocre growth, that's what their own movies are for. Overall the movie is nothing exceptional, but as I said it is so well made that it's impossible to see common flaws, only behind the flag of hardcore comic critics or Hollywood artsy bullshit critics, but as an average comic reader and a fun-time looking spectator there was no other experiences like AVENGERS during 2012, there's absolutely no doubt in my mind.

in conclusion, AVENGERS is a well made movie, where all the pieces fall exactly where they belong, thus making it a enjoyable fun experience, and has the great PLUS of proving that making a serious statement in comic book movies is totally possible, and so AVENGERS and the whole movieverse of MARVEL studios films have created a new world for comics adaptations and have achieved a new standard for the genre, where quality movies come to terms with comics whole way of life."
"Dec 25, 2012",positive,"It's alright, but I kept getting the feeling that it was something I had already seen.  Maybe I just had high expectations because of everyone hyping it up.  Although, I did especially love everything with the Hulk.  This might as well be the official Hulk movie."
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,I want to rate this movie an 11.
"Dec 24, 2012",negative,"With nothing but things blowing up, the mains doing nothing but complaining to each other and loki doing nothing but bitch and whine. The Avengers was extremely disappointing in all aspects."
"Dec 24, 2012",negative,i saw it and it sucked. Everybody said to watch it. It sucked so much
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,"Great, great movie. :D 
Best in 3D"
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,hulk smash loki.  fun superhero movie.
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,The nerd in me was incredibly happy during The Avengers
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,http://three-reviews.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/avengers-assemble.html
"Dec 24, 2012",positive,"A simply fun action movie done well.  My one criticism is that the hero's invincibility renders pretty much all the action and fighting pointless.  But turn your mind off to that, and it's a wild, thrilling ride."
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,wow had lots if fun.
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,One of the best comic book movies I've ever seen.
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,Best movie of all time!
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,"Thrills at every corner, the looming threat of cosmic ultimatum and all our favorite heroes and villains colliding into a lot of onscreen brilliance makes The Avengers the monumental movie going experience that it is. Great acting synergy brings the characters to life and the amazing effects and vision make this movie a must see."
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,Few films actually embody the acclaim that their hype foretold. This is one of the chosen few. A film that lacks nothing yet still leaves room for the story to progress is a lacking quality in most superhero movies. Any sequels to this has been gifted with a beautiful set up and the chance/potential to improve on perfect.
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,This movie moves to number one in superhero movies! Must watch for everyone
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,The most anticipated movie of 2012 is definitely one of the best movies of 2012. Joss Whedon's direction makes this an enjoyable film that is easy to follow. The story has more than a few plot holes but the chemistry between all the actors/characters makes up for it. Editing is top notch and the score fits perfectly with the movie. I left the theatre satisfied and excited for the next phase of Marvel movies.
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,"Robert DJ steals the show. Great pace, action and laugh out loud gags throughout."
"Dec 23, 2012",positive,"Loved it, can't wait for 2"
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"I really don't like superhero movies, as a rule.  I went to see this on the day it came out because I heard such insanely good buzz all over reddit.  I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't like most of the characters, but that didn't matter, because the screen time is divided up well so that no one obnoxious character is forced on your for an unbearable amount of time.  Then there's the Whedon humor, I love Whedon humor.  Okay, what really made this movie so good was Tom Hiddleston.  That is some incredibly nuanced acting for a Marvel villain.  It was a pleasure just watching him do anything."
"Dec 22, 2012",neutral,"I suppose, as far these movies go, it's ok. But I wasn't interested."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,great overall comic base movie....the action don't stop from beginning to end
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"""The Avengers"" delivered an iconic blockbuster that surely is an unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,It's one of the best films adapted from a comic book yet.
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power, but our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow. The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?"
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"This is definitely a Whedon film, but still very enjoyable. The actors' performances are good, and the production quality is quite good, even if the story is thin. A great continuation of the recent rush of Marvel films, and a great summer blockbuster, even if it is ultimately forgettable."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"Oh, wow.  Joss Whedon+Robert Downey, Jr.+eye candy (Chris Evans & Chris Hemsworth)=PERFECT.  Throw in a shawarma joke and this goes on my keep it forever list."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"On first viewing, I loved it! Thought it was awesome entertainment, but then on repeat viewings, the excitement was not there... apart from some witty one liners from Robert Downey Jr, a visually stunning third act, the first 2 thirds are quite bland and hollow - the whole movie itself rests heavily on CGI, explosions and Robert Downey Jr."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"Took me 8 months, but I finally saw it, great movie!"
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,This was possibly the best super hero movie ever!!!!!! And it was just as amazing the second time!!!
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,"Everybody take note! The superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two, in fact, someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is Joss Whedon. 

For those of you who donâ(TM)t know who this man is, heâ(TM)s been around a while, but not as famous as other directors. First and foremost, he is a writer. We have him to thank for films like Toy Story, Titan A.E., Atlantis and Alien Resurrection. He is also the writing and directing genius behind TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Dollhouse and the short lived Firefy (among others) and he is no stranger to directing big action movies. He helmed the Firefly spinoff movie, Serenity.
But, this is Whedonâ(TM)s first big feature film, itâ(TM)s also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film.


The Avengers is a long time coming. There have been numerous directors attached to it, a number of scripts, and of course, six other films preceding it (I am including the original Hulk). Making it work has been no easy task.  Each character has their own successful film franchise (Thor 2 and Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 are due out in the next two years) with plots, subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short end-of-credits scenes involving Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative.

The film has been on Marvels radar since Iron Man first appeared on our screen on in 2008.
For the uninitiated, The Avengers comic was released in 1963 and was titled âEarths Mightiest Heroesâ? and starred Iron Man, Ant Man, Wasp, Hulk and Thor. (As an interesting sidenote, in issue 4, the Avengers find Captain America, trapped in ice). The comic has had a number of incarnations over the years and has spawned a couple of animated series, gaining other popular Marvel heroes along the way, most notably and more recently, Spiderman and Wolverine.

In the first issue of The Avengers, the team are assembled to fight Thorâ(TM)s brother Loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the Hulk onto a part of destruction.
Whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities (and egos) and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal.

The story is over the top, but not enough that you find yourself scoffing. The reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds, aliens and magic! And considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway, the beauty in Whedonâ(TM)s script is that it never once takes itself seriously. (SPOILER) Even when S.H.E.I.L.D.S super-sized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress, Nick Fury states, âLetâ(TM)s danceâ? as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirror-ball, rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye! Over the top? Hell Yes!
The first act sees the assembly of the Avengers. The Cap and Bruce Banner are asked to find Loki and the Tesseract he has stolen from SHEILD. Later Thor and Iron Man join the team with Hawkeye and Black Widow. What works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together, each thinks they will save the day, but as their egos compete against one another for attention, the typical alpha-male muchoness comes to the fore, causing disunity and damage â"" a lot of damage!
 It is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good, which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of Loki and his alien army.

The script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust âfanboysâ? with comic book adaptions. Whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films. There are plenty of references to the âprequelsâ? and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans, easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite.
It is film is funny. Very funny. The Hulk almost steals the show (spoiler) when he throws Loki around like a ragdoll during his âI am a Godâ? speech, but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular. 

At times I thought I was in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, considering the scale and grandeur of the filmâ(TM)s final act â"" the near destruction of New York. Although there are hallmarks to DOTM, Avengers is nothing like it, in fact, Whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences, action, explosions, while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense, but doesnâ(TM)t get lost in the enormity and scale of it all.

The production flawlessly merges CGI and live action together, but the 3D conversion leaves little to be desired. Considering the success of Tron Legacy, I am surprised Disney (who owns Marvel) didnâ(TM)t pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3D.

I have long appreciated Whedonâ(TM)s film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in Serenity, those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here, but not overdone. He also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames, which many fans will appreciate, but most will miss.


The Avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with.

This is the BEST comic book â"" SUPERHERO â"" film I have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by."
"Dec 22, 2012",positive,Awesome movie great storyline funny humor great action good action even girls like it people who are not into action movies would still like it a lot
"Dec 21, 2012",neutral,Didn't quite get the hype
"Dec 21, 2012",negative,"Awful, dreadful, puerile, lame, stupid, laughable. The critics must have been paid to give raves for this dreck."
"Dec 21, 2012",positive,Amazing movie! So worth the extra $ to see it I-Max 3D! I would totally pay to see it in the theatre again! Definitely a must own!
"Dec 21, 2012",positive,"Very good movie, but something stops me from loving it. I think I'm just more of a broody DC guy."
"Dec 20, 2012",positive,The HULK is the daddy!!!!!!!!
"Dec 20, 2012",negative,"Did not enjoy it all. *Spoiler Alert, it's retarded*"
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,A great popcorn flick that will satisfy every movie goer
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,Just plain out AWESOME!!!!!!
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,"Refreshingly clever script, great film, see it."
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,Brofist to Mr. Whedon.
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,Just great all around.
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,Ridiculous and fab at the same time.
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,"This movie was very well put together, the story made sense and all the tie in elements were very well explained. My 3 year old made watch this movie like 12 times."
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,"Read my review more easily here as part of the summer 2012 series!
http://wingspan.lccc.wy.edu/issues/Sept12/a&e/summer_movies.html"
"Dec 19, 2012",positive,Ironman and Thor were my favorite.
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,I've seen it and had to watch a couple more times. The adrenaline rush during the action scenes are top notch and the underline theme of this movie is spot on. It was excellent.
"Dec 18, 2012",negative,"Visual and technological overkill, way too long, and zero emotional bonding with any person/thing to care one bit who wins in the end. It was visually appealing, although the 3D was nothing special. All the special effects were integrated perfectly, but it lacks soul...all the humans might just as well been machines right along with all the other animated metal. Special effects and explosions alone do not make for a memorable movie experience."
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,"Its a beast of a movie. when I say something is a beast, its official in awesomeness"
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,"For someone who had directed just one film in his career, Joss Whedon did himself credit in the spotlight as the man in charge of The Avengers.  If you have seen ""Serenity"", or even his TV series ""Firefly"" you know this guy can tell story and keep an audience interested.  If I throw in that he wrote the screenplay for the original Toy Story, that should get you involved even more.  

Led by Robert Downey Jr, and the immaculate Chris Hemsworth, The Avengers is a phenomenal display of superhero power and finesse.  With the spicy script, great special effects, and the favorite Marvel characters coming together it hits the mark."
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,"Ummm it was entertaining to watch at first but now that ive seen it multiple times its not that good.
The first hour is kinda boring 
Rest of it was entertaining 
did anyone realize  that Captain America never really did anything? He was just sorta there
Hulk was kinda ehhhh no
Ok lets be honest this was just Iron man 3 and friends
Its definitely not the best super hero movie ever that many people claim it to be
I'm not saying it was a bad movie I'm not saying that at all it was good but it didn't live up to the hype
Looks good on bluray  though"
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,Best super Hero movie! Wish Capt. America was real!
"Dec 18, 2012",positive,"This might have been the most entertaining and humorous movie of the summer. It's a pretentious movie and makes no excuses about some of the ridiculousness, unlike Battleship. As usual, Robert Downey, Jr. carries the entire movie on his shoulders. The rest of the cast is more of a supporting role. The Avengers are from the Marvel comics of my childhood and Joss Whedon delivered 120% on those expectations. Can't wait for the next installment."
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,"Great comic book film. I couldnt have asked for a better ""supers"" team up movie."
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,"Welcome to super hero madness. Where the beginning brings in a promising tale that no super hero will get along, but in the end, everything works out. Action is sorted out quite beautifully, while emotions can play a great deal throughout the movie at the right places at the right times. ^_^"
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,The whole time the movie was playing I felt like little progress was being made.  The action sequences are top notch but forgettable.  I can't say I was pleased with how this turned out.  It was just o.k. in my opinion.
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,"The comic book flicks are showing viewers  they're not a fad of the last decade. The Avengers is a great example of that. 
As long as they continue to be entertaining with a great story-lines, which Marvel has countless amounts of, then I'm gonna continue to pay to watch them."
"Dec 17, 2012",neutral,As Good As Joss Whedon Movies Get!
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,love Joss Whedon's work
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,"The best superhero team up movie ever! Hopefully, future hero group movies take notes from this one. Are ya listening Fantastic Four reboot?"
"Dec 17, 2012",positive,great movie Joss Wheaton is a genius
"Dec 16, 2012",neutral,A pretty shitty affair.
"Dec 16, 2012",negative,"I wasn't going to watch this film mainly because I my inner critic was already cautioning me against subjecting myself to the experience. I should have listened to my inner critic. This film gets one star for the awesome CGI and half a star for Iron Man. The other half star goes to Hulk for smashing Loki, and then at the very end punching Thor. Hard. I enjoyed Iron Man's wise-cracks, but as for the rest, the dialogue made absolutely NO sense, and characters absolutely lacked any motivation. I'm sorry, I don't buy the ""I'm going to conquer the world because I've got problems with self-worth"". So, yeah, if you like lots of explosions and attempts at humour with ""witty"" one-liners, this one will appeal to your inner twelve-year-old. I won't be watching the sequel and I'm going to bite the friend who suggested that the first was any good and that I watch it."
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Solid. Solid. Excellent work. This is one of those times where I want to give it a 90% because I know how difficult it to write an ensemble story line with multiple characters and give each character their due, but they some how did it with this. Also the special effects and CGI were excellent. One of the best moments in the film was when The Hulk beat the living hell out of Loki like he was a rag doll. Now, while the film did all these things, and did them well, for me personally, it was good, but still typical. WHICH I HATE TO SAY. It almost makes me feel pretentious. Maybe there is no way around that. Typical is typical. And I feel like 90% - 100% films need to be special. Maybe Part 2 will do that? Good movie Good concept. WATCH IT!"
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Great superhero movie. After watching all the build-up movies, this one paid off pretty well. Badass fight scenes, good writing, Loki getting smashed to a pulp by Hulk. All good."
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Grew up with Marvel (and DC) as a young kid and love seeing it now<33 It's so exciting seeing it from comic to ""real life""."
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,At its best when it lets the heroes bicker and banter among themselves though the surprisingly underdefined alien threat means it fails to live up to its full potential.
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Great superhero film! One of my favourite film's. The last 30 minutes, especially is just epic!"
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon, gives us a 2 1/2 hour epic, that's well deserved and wanted by fans. Whedon does an excellent job of making every character relevant and interesting, which is a high point with so many larger than life characters on one title; and leaves you yearning for more in the best of ways."
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie, the Hulk finally gets the true role he desrves..puny humans..."
"Dec 16, 2012",neutral,I am literally the only one on this planet that found The Avengers such a huge disappointment...
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,AWESOME movie hands down!!!!!!! Hulk Smash!
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"I thought this was a great movie. Knowing the back stories of the characters definitely helped, but I really thought each characters were played very well and the movie really came together to become its own. The action and visual effects were obviously a highlight and the comedic comments and personalities keeps you entertained throughout. I'm surprised I didn't watch is sooner as it actually exceeded my expectations and I look forward to watching it again another day"
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"Marvel has finally done ,they have made the best comic book movie ever with a epic showdown"
"Dec 16, 2012",positive,"I have no words but an ""Unstoppable Force of Awesomeness!"". Best Super Hero Movie EVER. It is certainly deserve 10 out of 10!"
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,Spectacular! Hands down for this masterpiece.
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,One of my absolute favorite movies! I seen it 3 times when it was in theaters.
"Dec 15, 2012",negative,I was shocked at how average this movie was. The FX where equally bad and inconsistant. However it had a couple of good moments. How on earth this is considered a good movie is beyond me.
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,4 meses atrasados de ratings... empecemos. Tom H hizo la película para mí.
"Dec 15, 2012",negative,This movie is so ludicrous it's not even funny. It's just another run of the mill superhero movie. Nothing new here.
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,Best of the Marvel movies.
"Dec 15, 2012",neutral,"Good job connecting the stories of all the heroes, but come up with a more interesting plot. I enjoyed the heroes more when Iron Man was fighting terrorists and Captain America was fighting Nazis. You, in my opinion, didn't need to bring another overrated alien-fighting movie into the mix. Sure, the action scenes are cool, but most of the time I sat there bored."
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,"Too many (loved or not) comic characters together, trying to fight evil and save the world. Its been a while I have seen it, but I remember I liked it... I really found usefull HOW ""HULK"" controls his anger."
"Dec 15, 2012",positive,"The Thor is so sexy, I watched this movie several times just to see him again."
"Dec 14, 2012",positive,"Funny and intense, but bordering on self-indulgent. Great film nonetheless"
"Dec 14, 2012",positive,"It's about as close to a perfect superhero movie as we're going to get. Fun, self-aware, nerdy, fantastic special effects, and full of basically the most attractive actors known to man, the pacing never lets up and The Avengers has single handledly made superheros cool again. Plus, effectively pulling together several different stand-alone films is a genuinely cool cinematic task."
"Dec 14, 2012",positive,Fantastic film can not want for next....
"Dec 14, 2012",positive,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
"Dec 14, 2012",positive,"Can't believe that our ""superheroes"" can't even maintain a moment of seriousness when the world is in trouble :'("
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,I have no idea how they could have made a better film other than a certain agents fate.
"Dec 13, 2012",negative,"This movie is insanely overrated. It was exactly what i expected it to be, a typical generic summer blockbuster with typical cheap laughs and boring action sequences.The build up was dull, just the avengers meeting up and angry at each other. Loki and his army were dull antagonists, and the hulk easily crushing Loki was lame too. Do yourself a favor, and see Dredd 3d, The Dark Knight Rises, , or even the amazing spider man over this."
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,"When I first saw the trailer for The Avengers, my initial reaction was ""What in the world are they thinking?"".  Combining the recent Marvel characters from their top blockbusting films into one 2  1/2 hour film?  But Marvel truly outdid itself with this one!  All the characters get just enough screen time to pull off a believable mash-up of power that left me wanting more!  I caught this in 3-D Imax in Nashville and even two weeks after the release, it was a sold out audience.  The 3-D wasn't too bad, but I wish the whole novelty of 3-D would fade.  The music score was breathtaking and fit perfectly with every scene.  Marvel knows exactly what they are doing with this franchise.  I have to admit, I wasn't a big fan of the Thor or Captain America films.  However after watching the Avengers, I find myself hoping for future sequels individually as well as Avengers 2.  Great film, well worth your time!"
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,(singing) We're in this together now!
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,"hulk and iron man completely stole the show, but i loved it"
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,yakla?may?n ???k ç?kartan gereksiz bi asam var :)
"Dec 13, 2012",positive,"Despues de los X-men, ahora llegan los Vengadores. Son personajes atractivos que poco a poco se fueron dando a conocer y que ahora son reunidos para salvar a la tierra. Verla en 3D es de otro planeta. La acción es trepidante. Los efectos y el sonido son fabulosos. Mi unico pero fueron los dialogos cientificos entre Stark y el Dr. Banner que me resultaron complicados y enredados y un poco aburridos. Fuera de este punto, es entretenida."
"Dec 12, 2012",positive,Waited for this film since 2008.  They dd a great job combining all five films into one incredible action packed thrill ride.  Another big plus was the humor throughout it.
"Dec 12, 2012",positive,"Suprised, that I really loved it. XD"
"Dec 12, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a popcorn movie full of one-liners, cheesy jokes, and little substance.  But that's okay, because the film knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else; its just a load of fun.  There is no complex storyline to follow, there is very little character development, and the premise is very cliché.  Yet, in the end, you are almost guaranteed to have a good time.  The best thing about the film is that it established the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and opens more doors to new opportunities with other comic book characters.  Lets cross our fingers and hope that other heroes like Spider-Man or the Fantastic Four will get a chance to appear in one of these films someday."
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,A great movie with great  characters.Good performances and very entertaining.A must watch.
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,"Holy heck!!!! What an amazing movie...has amazing superheroes,good graphics and good storylive even though it's about rescuing the Tessaract...still...amazing!!!"
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,"Being a comic book geek, this is one of my favourite films. Great cast, superb acting and one hell of a story!"
"Dec 11, 2012",negative,"Lets face it, watching Mr. Indestructible #1 and Mr. Indestructible #2 fighting for 2 hr. 22 minutes isn't interesting."
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,"Being a comic book geek, this is one of my favourite films. Great cast, superb acting and one hell of a story!"
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,a really great movie packed full of memorable scenes  and an awesome script .
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,"I had no idea The Avengers would be everything it was cracked up to be. Hollywood actually blew their wad on something definitely worthwhile this time. There's not a boring moment in it, thanks to genuine consideration for the contrasts and chemistry between all the heroes uniting to share the screen together. Some work well with others, some don't, and it always makes sense which is which. It's exciting long before the mass-destruction climax, as Joss Whedon treats us to an endlessly entertaining rendition of the Seven Samurai structure of introducing everybody and laying down the plot points without being lame or by-the-numbers about it."
"Dec 11, 2012",positive,"Lots of action, some laughs, lots of fun!  One of the best super hero films ever!"
"Dec 10, 2012",positive,"This is the perfect superhero movie because it brings the hulk, iron man, Thor, captain America, black widow, and hawk eye all together in one amazingly epic movie. This is actually one of my favorite movies of all time!"
"Dec 10, 2012",positive,A good action movie with adequate humor in the right places that is sure to make just about anyone laugh.
"Dec 10, 2012",positive,"Great visual effects,decent story,great fantasy characters....bit slow in places but overall a decent film..good superhero movie not great but good....."
"Dec 10, 2012",positive,Robert Downey stole the film!! It was great summer movie.
"Dec 10, 2012",positive,"I really like Joss Whedon and superhero movies - but I just am not interested in any of the Avengers really... it's really more that their particular superhero powers are weak compared to (pretty much) every other superhero I've seen in the genre, and for that it's hard for me to really dig this the way everyone else seemed to.  X-Men, Superman, Batman, Spiderman... all so much better to me.  I don't want to say it wasn't entertaining - just wasn't as epic as friends and the critics seemed to think it was."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"The ending was really entertaining, but I thought it dragged on so long till the film reached the final battle. There were moments were I was so bored with the film, I found myself more entertained looking at the floor then at the screen."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,I so love this movie.
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"This movie was undoubtedly awesome, from the fantastic cast line up to the breath taking action scenes. 

Audiences always love it when there favorite characters come from different films and merge into one kick ass movie. And this film is not different. The only reason this movie is not a 5 star movie for me is because of the way Loki is bluntly portrayed.

The film is lead by brilliant actors Robert Downey JR, and Samuel L jackson, with supporting actors such as Chris Hemsworth and Scarlette Johanson. With supporting actors as good as these, you cant get much of a better movie than this."
"Dec 9, 2012",negative,"An overlong, cheesy borefest choc full of cliches and bad dialog that fails to provide a single shining moment to back up how incredibly well received it was.  It is the comic book movie equivalent of ""New Years Eve"" or ""Valentines Day"".  I can't wait to see which awesome superhero pops up next to save the scene!  It's mildly amusing at best, laughable at worst but mostly just bland.  At least it looks pretty."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"Boring. Trite. Mostly humorless. Absent-minded. Predictable. Tired cliched action sequences. Okay at best, IMO. Shawarma was probably the funniest scene."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"Saw ""The Avengers"" on Saturday and the movie is well worth the wait. It's the greatest Marvel movie all time and comes really close to being the greatest superhero movie ever. The Hulk truly steals the flick unexpectedly. Can't wait for round 2. Now bring on Batman!"
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"I admit to not being a fan of the superhero comics. That said, you can definitely appreciate the fact that I gave this movie, for all its cheesy dialogue, stupid/predictable plot points, and one-dimensional villains, the high rating I did. Because despite all that, it certainly became a rare, guilty pleasure right alongside the first Superman movie."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,The most awesome action superhero movie of all time.
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"After being hinted at for quite some time and having been 4 years in the making, The Avengers delivers it's 'A' game. Being funny, action-packed and a pleasing superhero party that will please fans of all ages."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,One of the greatest super hero movies to date
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,"Aside from some impossibly bad dialogue and unthreatening antagonists, the film manages to deliver in a way you're not likely to experience with WB. It embraces the fact that it's a Super Hero movie, runs with the premise and leads to a conclusion all too satisfying to find fault with."
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,frikkin awesome! I watch it over and over. <3
"Dec 9, 2012",positive,OH MY JESUS this movie was amazing great action and comedy all mixed into one couldn't be better.
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"Overstretched sequences seemed necessary in such a simplified story, yet offered me no sense of connection, care, or intrigue. As this movie is far from the epic you'd want and expect, there's a real hero who saved this production, Joss Whedon. This movie knows it's not about the delivery of something pure, powerful, and viewers can use to reflect in our world. It's all about the entertainment quality, and yes, the direction of these hugely iconic superheroes was extremely engaging with fun, witty dialog within the interactions and arguments of these characters. But the movie's tone, pace, and story is nothing more than averagely entertaining and, if not, sometimes dragging. It's simplicity, in which people seem to be attracted to, will give it it's success. Yet for those many insightful ones, nothing is here except brawny and brained superheroes clashing and fighting. An exciting summer blockbuster, however marvellous it is not."
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,MARVEL EXCELS AGAIN!
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,Amazing!  Can't wait for the next one...
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"Who would have thought that the man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer would be chosen to both write and direct The Avengers; that man has delivered probably the most entertaining super-hero movie of all time. The fact that he was able to bring such big names and egos together, and manages to fit in some clever lines, laughs, and action sequences is a testament to his skills (the studio should beg him to return for the eventual sequels, though I donâ(TM)t see how you can beat this effort).

The star of the show is the best actor in the movie, Robert Downey Jr. His characterâ(TM)s comedic wit never gets old and few actors can match his charisma. I also have to give a shout out to Mark Ruffalo who probably played Bruce Banner better than anyone in my opinion (much to my surprise). And when his character transforms into The Hulk it brings forth the movieâ(TM)s best moments. Even the interaction between Stark/Iron Man and Banner/Hulk was extremely effective,

Moreover, Capt. America and Thor do fine, in fact they were more effective here than in their solo movie efforts. Also, I am glad they picked Hiddleston who plays the villain Loki (the only good thing about the Thor movie); he is a good actor and is effective despite his cliche â~takeover the worldâ(TM) objective.

Overall, Whedon has taken the simplest of plots (good vs. bad) and infused it with clever lines and well-thought out action sequences (yes itâ(TM)s possible to do that Michael Bay!?) to deliver perhaps the most perfect entertainer imaginable."
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"The Greatest action film of all time! It made othe action films after this quite dull in comparison, this is one for the books and one that has a fantastic sence of humor!"
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,Loved it! I can't wait until the next one comes out.
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"Fun. Not sure it lives up to the hype, but I did enjoy it. Fantastic 3D effects."
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"I've deduction one half of a star for Captain America's suit. Otherwise, brilliantly executed."
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"Great movie, the HULK stole the show, powerful, funny, with an action packed adventure, best two plus hours I had this weekend, WOW!"
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,Here's a tip.. Watch the movie Thor and 50 percent of the movie will make more sense. But this movie is a definite must see.
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,"Very cool, there's not one scene that bores you or doesn't have a taste of action"
"Dec 8, 2012",negative,Not that good The Dark Knight Rises was way better. This movie had a whole bunch of Lame And CORNY Jokes
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,awesome movie definitely a must -see! loved the hulk special effects were great all around good movie cast was great together! can't wait for a sequel at least I hope they'll be 1!!!!:) very pleased with this movie and audience really seemed to get into it at the theater myself included!!!!
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,A warm combination of marvel characters to produce something spectacular
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,Smash bang kerpow! A truly wonderful ensemble superhero movie. It screams blockbuster and hits the spot.
"Dec 8, 2012",negative,Better than expected from the plot but still a essentially a kids movie if you were hoping for something different.
"Dec 8, 2012",positive,100% of action and the world has never been full of heroes.
"Dec 8, 2012",negative,"Muligvis den dårligste superhelte filmatisering de seneste par år. Der er en grund til at The Avengers tegneserien aldrig blev rigtig populær uden for USA.

- Possible the worst superhero movie adabtion in the last couple of years. There is a reason for why the avengers comic newer really became popular outside the USA."
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,"Though the movie is awesome -- like really, really awesome -- it's not perfect. There are some yawn-worthy bits of dialogue and the story is sometimes just...meh. Regardless, the action sequences are fantastically directed and the visual effects are inspired to say the least. 8-8.5/10 (depending on how I feel on the given day)"
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,Good action. Ironman was the best.
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,"Hey where was superman, shouldn't he have been around to fight Zod and his army? A competent entertaining film following the old pattern of evil edward scissorhands bringing a mutant metal ghost army through a portal ripped by a very strong LED with batman flying a nuke to safety. You think I'm confused? well apart from this being a glorification of smash everything using very impressive cgi - there was little substance to this film. the Avengers kinda assembled unnaturally. Doesnt come close to X-men in depth of character - iron man stole the show. Costumes were on the whole ropey, apart from iron man. Captain America's costume was utterly ridiculous. You'll love this film but will come back feeling there was too much bang and needed a little more heart."
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,"Avengers is a great action movie. However while the action is good, the comedy is what makes it a truly amazing flick. I still laugh at the puny god scene!"
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,"One of the greatest superhero films ever made, The Avengers is an awesome movie! The plot may be a little thin, but the script is well written. The actors are brilliant in portraying our heroes in this superpowered epic. This is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and I think that we still haven't seen the best that Marvel has to offer with this franchise! It is a wonderful time to be a comic book fan and I want to thank Marvel studios for their attention to detail!"
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,"I'm afraid it didn't do much for me! After all the hype I think I expected too much. There were a couple of good lines of dialogue but my overall impression was that it was just another action movie. Better than Captain America, but to be honest I enjoyed Thor more!"
"Dec 7, 2012",positive,I wanted so much more from this movie It was a great movie but I'm left disappointed because it is still lacking for me. The storyline is just underdeveloped it need an edge to because it just felt like one more superhero movie when it should have been the ultimate superhero film ITS THE AVENGERS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!!
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,"Quite possibly the most entertaining superhero film ever made - so far. Yes it doesn't have the same depth of character as X-Men: First Class or the visual artistry and  nuance of The Dark Knight, but I had a great time watching it!

Breathtaking special effects. The Hulk was probably my favourite character in the film. I was never a huge fan of the Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo's interpretation and Joss Whedon's script has produced the best version so far. 

Speaking of script; You have to be impressed with a movie with this amount of characters, yet everyone always has something pertinent, entertaining and often funny to say."
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,Could be the best movie of the year
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,Action packed with great characters from start to finish.
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,"It is one of those rare blockbusters that actually work, if only for its aesthetic or tied by its script that gives him the luxury of taking several comic relief."
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,"The Avengers are Fantastic.  I thought it was so good.  As close to perfection as a multiple superhero movie could be.  I was a little worried going in that there wouldn't be a balance between all the heroes and their abilities, that one would be the clear hero, but Joss Whedon wrote a very well balanced script with a clear plot and a great threat to the earth that the heroes would have to be assembled to fight against.  A good chunk of the script also dealt with the conflict within the group itself which lead to some really fun scenes.  That is the other thing that made the movie great.  The right amount of humour.  I could certainly see Joss Whedon's touch.  Somewhat reminiscent of Joss's Buffy the Vampire Slayer's humour.  I could easily see this again and I imagine a lot of people will see it multiple times which will continue to gross even more money than it already has.  Crazy.  But so worth it."
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,This movie blew away my expectations and then some!
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,It was good and a fun movie.
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon two on two.
"Dec 6, 2012",positive,Good special effects.
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,For once I cannot describe the movie that I watched. Well almost. Twpo words do the movie justice: Epic Nerdgasm.
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,Great idea executed wonderfully
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,"Ironman, Thor and Hulk saving the world. Oh Captian America helped too. Avengers done right, great movie."
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,"This is the superhero movie that many didn't think could happen. Stays true to the characters and is great fun! Witty, action-packed, fun. Awesome summer movie power-house!"
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,"It's fun but becomes another typical Marvel superhero movie that doesn't do anything special aside from putting these characters together. The middle drags down the movie and the final action scene doesn't make a lick of sense. None of that is what matters and at the end of the day, it's exactly what it needed to be."
"Dec 5, 2012",neutral,"Bon le Marvel c'est pas trop mon truc, surtout 1/4h de combat ... Une super brochette d'acteurs heureusement !"
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,"Great movie, the total package!  Will see it for a 3rd time with my daughters This weekend!!"
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,Awesome. Really good movie. Got to watch it on blu-ray. No way else.
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,THE best superhero movie of all time and was not broken by the hype. Everyone in the theater was cheering over this fine marvel of a movie (pun intended)
"Dec 5, 2012",positive,[After watching with an anti-biassed attitude] A deserved block buster. Why can't DC makes movies like this one?
"Dec 4, 2012",negative,"The dialogue and storyline are so elementary, that a five year old could think this up. I actually got bored in the middle of the movie. Additionally, it seems like every character is a form of tony Starks sarcasm, even the Hulk ( last time I checked Bruce banner was a nerd, not a cynical person in the comics). And why the hell do you need to play ACDC every time Tony Stark enters a scene!?"
"Dec 4, 2012",neutral,"I am a Joss Whedon fan, so I could see a lot of him in it. The effects were pretty awesome. A little slow in the beginning but when it picks up, it was great. Samuel L Jackson is amazing!!"
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever!
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie. The story is great, the acting is top notch, and the action is unrivaled. Better than I expected it to be."
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,"A well put together, action packed flick. A must see."
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,"Entertaining, but it's a little overrated."
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,"slow beginning to middle (in the eyes of one who isn't passionate about superhero movies), but VERY entertaining afterwords"
"Dec 4, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is indeed enjoyable as an entertainment. It seems very funny. I technically smirk when I watched this movie. I think the movie concentrated WAY too much on the conflicts of the members of the Avengers. Their fights made them look like idiots. Even though the world is going to END, they still can think like kids and fight each other (and I don't accept the excuse of the presence of Loki's scepter), instead to put every conflict down first and SAVE THE WORLD! Only one word to express this: Seriously? Anyway, if you are those don't-really-look-deep-into-movies kind of person, then this movie can be considered favourable."
"Dec 3, 2012",positive,"This movie shows all the famous superheroes fighting side to side. I found it really exciting, but funny at the same time. The ending was a bit confusing, but in the end, good movie."
"Dec 3, 2012",positive,Amazing film - totally packed with action. Boy film.... loved it!!
"Dec 3, 2012",positive,Film was fun to watch but didn't feel as though the characters in this had any real threat with the villains (loki and aliens) good but had the feeling of was that all by the end
"Dec 3, 2012",positive,expected it to be good ...but it was bloody brilliant to say the least.
"Dec 3, 2012",positive,Best Marvel Movie No Contest!!
"Dec 2, 2012",positive,Greatest movie ever period.
"Dec 2, 2012",positive,mainly just action. no real story to it. they just came up with a shallow reason for all the action heroes to come together
"Dec 2, 2012",positive,just sheer epicness!!!!
"Dec 2, 2012",positive,"Great movie 5 stars in my book, lots and lots of nostop action"
"Dec 2, 2012",positive,Awesomest movie!!!!!
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"Fangirl/boy heaven, and just a really fun movie besides."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"kool as hell
great family, guy, or kid movie."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"A perfect superhero movie with exciting characters , breathtaking action and some bad ass visuals , ""Avengers"" is the best film of Marvel's phase one and probably the best superhero movie of all times"
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,It takes its time to settle down but this seriously has one of  the best take-it-home blow-the-fucking-roof-off ejaculate-all-over-the-place third acts I've ever seen in an action/adventure film. Crazy stupid hilarious fun with a perfect amount of fan service. You crazy for this one Joss Whedon
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"The same cookie cutter, underdeveloped, one-liner heavy fare as every other Marvel flick."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,not bad at all although they could have kept captain americas suit the same from before
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,If you are into super hero movies this will be a great pick. Great plot for the hulk
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is driven by its strong character development and immaculate script. I've never seen so many characters execute their purpose so well. Although a more colourful and fun superhero movie than Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy, it never takes itself too seriously by offering a genuine humour in this already flawless script."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,Amazing film everyone should watch it including mavel fans
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"The movie plays out like a comic book, and has the same feel.  There's some drama between the characters, but ultimately the movie does what it promises to do:  Show a lot of really cool action scenes back dropped by a really expensive set."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,Now this is a superhero movie. I now have a taste for some Shwarma. Thanks Tony.
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"I liked it very much it had action,adventure,and suspence. It was nice to watch with family and friends."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,I really enjoyed this movie.
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"A cinematic masterpiece. No, it's not an art house film, but it is a work of art. And we know that it's based on superheroes, but it's definitely got something for everyone. This is Marvel's landmark film."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"Amaaaaaaaaaaazing!!!!  Best super hero movie since Batman (1989), Dark Knight & Superman the movie."
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,puny god = epic movie
"Dec 1, 2012",positive,"Marvel is the best! If you haven't seen it , u need to!"
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"I liked it, but left a little to be desired in terms of a story."
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,Just lots of fun and entertainment the whole time.
"Nov 30, 2012",neutral,"Don't get me wrong. I liked ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Thor"" were disappointing in my opinion, but I was still anxiously awaiting ""The Avengers."" Now, after having watched a couple of times, I can soundly say that ""The Avengers"" is a disappointment.

While ""The Avengers"" isn't all bad, it fails in many departments. For starters, Loki is a terrible villain. He never felt like a threat and neither did the Chitauri Army which appears in the film's final act without explanation. There is lack of suspense and the film suffers as a result.

Meanwhile, the plot is also contrived and clichéd. The death of Agent Coulson kind of fails to evoke any emotion as he isn't fully developed as a character. For some strange reason, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner can now control his powers for the sake of the story. The main heroes fight among themselves before finally realizing that they're all being selfish. The story here is nothing more than the good guys versus the bad guys, something that has been seen countless times before.

The performances, meanwhile, are passable, but not commendable. Robert Downey, Jr. has the pleasure of saying some of the film's best lines, but at times, it feels like the movie revolves around him. Mark Ruffalo does an okay job as Bruce Banner, but I dare say that I would've preferred Edward Norton. Meanwhile, the two Chrises do the best with what their given, compared to Scarlett Johansson (who merely serves as eye candy) and Jeremy Renner (who is largely forgotten as Hawkeye.)

The movie ends with the same action-packed explosion-fest that has ended so many past Hollywood blockbusters. Yet, despite the caliber of the people involved with ""The Avengers,"" the finale feels like something out of the ""Transformers"" movies, which isn't really the best comparison.

All in all, ""The Avengers"" is a disappointing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it offers some witty dialogue every now and then, along with the occasionally exciting action sequence, it is bogged down by clichéd storytelling and a remarkably weak villain. Considering this film cost $225 million, it could've been much better.

5/10"
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,The best movie I have ever seen.
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,funny as all get out!
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,Can't get any better
"Nov 30, 2012",negative,the hype about the avengers is merely justified by the action sequences the plot (which was non-existence) none of the characters were developed. my question is WHAT ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. The hulk whom we havent seen in a while was barely ever on screen. he could control himself now we should have more of that.
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"With all your favorite superheros jam-packed into one film, what's not to like about Marvel's: The Avengers? An action-filled experience with awesome special effects made it great to watch."
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"great, if you want to have some fun. it s the perfect movie"
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"Ok, we'll done but not for me"
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"Great movie for Marvel's and superhero's fans: stars-studded, entertaining, spectacular."
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,Review at: http://jennielyse.com/movie-review-the-avengers/
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,The greatest superhero(es) movies of all time! I'm glad it lived up to the expectations.
"Nov 30, 2012",positive,"Well despite some bad casting choices namely Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo (seriously they should have brought back Norton as the Hulk as he made the character likable unlike Ruffalo who gives off this creepy awkward pedo vibe throughout the film) Chris Evans (who needs to stop being in superhero movies already) and of course Sammuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Now all the actors mentioned above other than Jackson were not good in the film and were all rather unlikable. They have Thor who just says his lines louder and hammier when he is trying to act all angry which honestly made me laugh when I saw this movie and when I saw that terrible Thor movie. I already explained Ruffalo. Chris Evans is just not a good actor. He always comes off as a smarmy douche even when not in a fantastic 4 movie. Jackson was good but he was a bad casting choice. For Nick Fury you need more like Jeffrey Dean Morgan who would have been perfect for the roll. Jackson did a decent job with his role. However this movie was really about Loki and Tony Stark. That is who people care about in this film. Now I was never an Iron Man fan as a kid and I used to actually hate Loki and I liked Thor. However in this film, they make Loki in a way where you kind of want to root for him. You feel bad for him if you saw the Thor movie.  He also has this onscreen presence that is just amazing, no matter what the scene is he takes it and makes it his own. His acting was so brilliant I was near convinced that he was less acting and more just living the character. Tony really steals the show from the rest of the Avengers since most of them are less than likable so the movie felt like Iron Man 2 1/2. Not that I am complaining about Tony stealing the show as he and Loki were what was so great about the film in the first place. Honestly they should just have dropped all the other Avengers as no one with any taste likes them in this movie anyway."
"Nov 29, 2012",negative,offers nothing new.Just the same old predictable story showing a bunch of USA badasses saving the world.Poor character development.The movie doesn't make u feel for any of the characters.And the film is needlessly long i think.But there r some good action sequences and CGI are impressive.But that doesn't make up for the overall failure of the movie.
"Nov 29, 2012",negative,"pure entertainment, and that's all to it... I would have liked to see the director take a little bit more risks as to the characters and the story... Oh well, I guess there'll be another Avengers movie where they can try it..."
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,Great action...loved it!
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,Amazing! Epic! Must own!
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,awsome movie cant waight for 2 to come out
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,Really good very entertaining
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was probably the best non realistic super hero film that I've ever seen. Logic tells me that these powers and capabilities are not possible, but it did not stop me from enjoying the film any less. Well done, guys!"
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,me and husband really enjoyed the film. so many of them together in one film. need I say more!!??? ?????
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,"Highly entertaining. I still have an issue with the whole nordic mythology interacting with the more ""realistic"" superheroes, but it didn't bother me as much as I expected. While sitting in the cinema, it puzzled me why a lot of the audience, did a lot of giggling and laughing in the heroic/patriotic/americanized scenes... what did they expect?... A serious realistic film?! It's a Marvel superhero film, it's suppose to be like that:-) More please! :-)"
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,A+++++++ Worth Watching!
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,I cannot express how much I love the actor who plays Loki.
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,It's just mostly fighting but goodð~
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,best super hero movie yet I rented and watched it over and over
"Nov 29, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is the best superhero movie iv'e ever seen! The movie is not boring, this movie had a lot of action, funny humour and fantastic and well-maded actors. The interesting thing in the movie is when the MARVEL superheros like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow are working together to save the world. See this film! Rankning: Four strong stars."
"Nov 28, 2012",negative,"A lot of smash mouth specaill effects and sappy one liners, too long and boring."
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,awesome action. played the character roles well. loved the brother like rivalry between hulk and thor. hulk had attitude and rocks.  iron man played the sarcastic billionaire that makes his character funny and witty.
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,one of the best movies of the year!
"Nov 28, 2012",negative,"Eu nÃ£o vou gostar de um filme por causa dos 30 minutos finais. O filme, por completo, nÃ£o tem ritmo e enrola demais na parte da nave da SHIELD. O que vale mesmo Ã (C) a batalha e mais nada."
"Nov 28, 2012",neutral,I did not really care for this movie. It was definitely bellow my expectations.
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,"Great mindless action. But I'm hugely disappointed that there isn't much of the dialogue and absolutely none of the deep story which I have come to expect from Whedon films. In fact, there was no point in the story where I felt like ""Whedon wrote that"" like there was with Cabin in the Woods (which he didn't even direct!). Still... great mindless action!"
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,"A fan boy's dream, this film is filled with so much eye candy, and so many witty one liners, that you'll forget that it has virtually no plot.  You'll also not notice the lack of character development amongst the ridiculous amounts of action and fan service.  It's hard to laud the film for treating its audience with such cloaked contempt.  Then again, it's hard to condemn the film when so many will assuredly enjoy it."
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved it!!
"Nov 28, 2012",positive,One of my favorite movies!! ;)
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,"Needed more Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo....kind of a slow start, but the ending was bombastic."
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Amazing. Everything a super hero movie should be
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,"I liked it, but there were parts that made me start to snooze... When the backstories of all the characters are so intricate and they have to explain them throughout the movie it just gets boring. I also like a movie with comic relief, and unfortunately Iron Man just couldn't hold it up all by himself. That said, I'm glad I saw it, but it's not on my list of movies I need to see again."
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Pretty fun ride. Does everything its supposed to. That said it isn't better than sliced bread  or free tacos. I'll only watch it again when the boy will want to.
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Excellent movie. Definitely well done and worth seeing.
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Possibly overhyped for me. Slow at first but picks up as it goes along. Enjoyed Robert Downey jr. And the schwarma (sp?)
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,"Although I was expecting more with the complexities of all the different characters, this movie still did not disappoint. High impact action, wonderful story line, excellent fight scenes. One thing, why Samuel L. Jackson? With his recent onslaught of terrible movies, it kinda ruined the impact-fulness of his role, when they were in the zeppelin all I thought was ""SNAKES ON A PLANE""!!!!!!"
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,awesome comic book movie
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Watched it like 5 xs great all the way!!
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Lives up to the hype thanks to THE HULK/Bruce Banner (surprise!!!!)
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,"Not what I expected. Two hours wasn't enough, it seemed rushed."
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,Disney did a GREAT! JOB with this one!!! Best super hero movie I have seen in a loooong time!
"Nov 27, 2012",negative,"Lacks a developed storyline, meaning that it wasn't enjoyable, however, if you're just looking for a film with a bunch of explosions and fight scenes, you'll like this."
"Nov 27, 2012",positive,"Simply one of the best comic book adaptations in a long while, the high action and humor that holds the plot together as the characters become more integrated and The Hulk (Ruffalo) who becomes the films smartest addition and a surprising highlight, as well as Natasha/Black Widow portrayed by Scarlett Johansson who after her role in Iron Man 2 exerts her force as one of the most brilliant and believable female super-heroes, and Robert Downey Jr as always is exceptional as the Iron Man."
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,cant wait for part two
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,"3 stars for the action. Robert was funny as always. Scarlett was pretty cool.
Hulk was insane."
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,Better than most super-hero movies I have seen as of late...A marvel to watch for action fans!
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,Hilarious and very entertaining
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,One of the best super hero movies. Ever.
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,awesome adventure; endless laughter!
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,"Saw this movie for the second time a few days ago.  This is just a dang watchable movie.  The character chemistry, plot twists, and humor is spot on.  Almost every character got massive amounts of screen time (with the Hawkeye exception) and their stories were woven together very well.  Joss Whedon can do very little wrong!  I can't wait for the next installment."
"Nov 26, 2012",positive,I'll have to say one of the top super hero movies I have seen. It has a ton of action and I love how they incorporated the comedy in the movie. The storyline is great and this is definitely something to own.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Like an omelet- it gets better and better with the more you throw in it!
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,"""I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats. You can smell crazy on him."""
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Packed with action and fun.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,One of my all-time favorite movies. A great summer blockbuster. Robert Downey Junior steals the whole show!
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is bursting at the seams with action, but doesn't fail to address each character individually and learns from the weaknesses of some of its prequels - it gets rid of the overbearing cheesiness and near-mockery of science that Thor presented, primarily. Each of the four Avengers is distinct and interesting, from a man out of time who coping with a new era, to Stark's perfect balance of wit and cockiness.

Except you'll note that there are, in fact, more than four Avengers. Lacking any real background that was granted to the other four by full feature films (or two, in the case of Iron Man), Black Widow and Hawkeye seem a little foreign to all but well-versed Marvel fans. While their stretch of the storyline is itself well-written, I never really got the feeling that they were part of the larger story.

Other than that, and a slight criticism on that overly bearing cheesiness put forth by the arch-villain-who-isn't-Loki that we don't really come to know, I have few bad things to say about this film. It is one of the few films that manages to balance a coherent and fresh plot, intriguing characters, and intense action, and for that, I can only recommend it."
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,What's not to love? Especially since it's a Joss Whedon project. Can't wait for the next one.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of the year.   What i found fascinating about this movie was how the director was able to give almost equal screen time to all the main stars.   I bet if you broke down dialogue and screen time you would find all the characters pretty much dead even.   Maybe a bit more to Robert Downy Jr but its close.   Many great scenes with different members of the cast interacting with each other.   Nobody is forgotten and each person is given the opportunity to shine.   The story is a little weak in some places explaining why certain things are happening but over all a very well directed and scripted movie.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,would have been a three star if not for the Hulk
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Best Marvel movie to date.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Lotta action great movie
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Fantastic movie. Now one of my favorites
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Good actions scenes. The Hulk steals the show followed by Iron Man. Not sure why an Archer is so helpful. This is a fun movie.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,The most awesomest movie ever
"Nov 25, 2012",negative,"Stupid, bad. Stupid...bad."
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,"Very funny and well-written. Could take the action down a notch, though."
"Nov 25, 2012",negative,"I think I'm just out on superhero movies as a whole, because despite all the acclaim this did absolutely nothing for me. The Dark Knight Returns will be my final shot, I guess."
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,I would give this movie 5 stars I really loved it
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,I loved seeing all my favorite characters from childhood. There was actually a good plot and the action was great. The characters/actors had good chemistry which helped the comedy relief.
"Nov 25, 2012",neutral,Sappy attempt of superhero action. My Avengers is Watchmen.
"Nov 25, 2012",negative,Marvel's The Avengers is so bad.
"Nov 25, 2012",positive,Awesome grate movie!! A awesome thrilling movie... Awesome for all audience adults and children.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"Great flick. It was interesting and entertaining to see that the real villain of the film was the conflict between the heroes. You don't often see that in the movie. I'm not saying that Tom Hiddleston was bad, but he didn't seem to be as significant. Loki did turn out to be a ""puny god"" and all. 
Also, the visual transitions were beautiful. One of Marvel's best films; I can't wait for them try to trump this in the sequel."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Great action movie & lots of fun.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Finally watched it and it...was...awesome!!!!
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Looooong. Ladies..it may not be your cup of tea but it isn't painful to sit through either.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Entertaining & lots of great special effects.  Iron Man & Loki were my favourites.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,One of the greatest super hero movies of all time
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"I was entertained. Not great, but decent and enjoyable."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Wow.  This movie was amazing!
"Nov 24, 2012",neutral,"Thought it was amazing how they brought all these historic icons together, but the acting was not that good. Also did not like how easily Loki's army was defeated."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"This movie is fine for what it is, Disney's greedy attempt to appeal to as many demographics as humanly possible. This was the movie I could show my little brothers without having to worry about them 1) having nightmares 2) learning new bad words. For me, this was just something I watched during the summer to pass time until Dark Knight Rises."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,When you take alot of the main superheroes of marvel and put them into one movie you get one of the best superhero movies ever.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,worth watching for the hulk  smashing the bad guy around the room
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Watched it 4 times already
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,liked it even if it was quite silly.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"Its first act is nearly excruciating. Nonetheless, once the shit hits the fan, this is the best Marvel and superhero movies in general really get."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"Simply one of the best superhero movies ever made. I expected a ton of action and got it but wasn't expecting the great humor, one-liners & interplay between the heroes that left me laughing more than most comedies!"
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"This is how it's done. A rollercoaster ride worthy of many repeat viewings. Ruffalo, Downey and Scarlett - bravo!"
"Nov 24, 2012",negative,Zzz bla bla bla bum bum bum bla bla Zzz.
"Nov 24, 2012",neutral,"If you go with an expectancy to watch a cartoon film, you will find it an epic. All massive action set pieces with zero gravity."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"This movie is totally epic! There were a lot of action-filled sequences, and the confrontation between the two adversaries (being the Avengers and Loki), which is what people often look for in superhero movies. It's a really awesome movie, and I would definitely see it over and over again if I had the chance."
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,This was much better than I thought it would be. They finally did the Hulk justice bringing his Hulking character to life. There are a few really good laughs along the way. Looking forward to more from this team.
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"Finally got to see this after months of waiting.  I thought the ensemble casting was great and I thought the choice of central character very interesting (but I have not seen the latest ""Hulk"" movie after Ang Lee's car crash).  Whilst it was superbly filmed, I just didn't buy the whole McGuffin and the finale I thought was just a bit flaccid - I got bored of about 40 minutes of non stop action.  Which is a shame because the story telling up to that point was very good.  I thought it was a good movie, but not quite the bollox many have made out."
"Nov 24, 2012",neutral,I missed what everyone else saw that's good
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,Loved it and a must see!!!!
"Nov 24, 2012",positive,"Marvel never fails to disappoint. I had seen all the individual movies prior to watching the Avengers but I'm pretty sure someone who hadn't seen Thor or Iron man or Captain America would have also sailed smoothly through this movie. Everyone is given equal amounts of the spotlight and the special effects are brilliant. If you have seen this movie, you obviously loved it, if you haven't seen it, what the hell is wrong with you?!"
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,I totally enjoyed this movie. The eye candy doesn't hurt either!
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,This is the best marvel super heroe movie of all time
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,"From the man behind Serenity and Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes a remarkably action-packed and limitlessly comical movie based on the comic book about a team of unlikely and reluctant superheroes fighting to keep mankind safe. After the mischievous god Loki inexplicably returns to Earth to find an endless source of colossal power in the shape of a cube, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of a strategic military division called S.H.I.E.L.D, decides to pull through with a cancelled recruitment plan called the Avengers Initiative, which was created to form an unconventional team of extraordinary people whose mission is to fight the foes no single man can withstand. Though not as sophisticated as other comic book films, The Avengers can still be a great popcorn flick for audience, critics, children, and adults alike."
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,The Avengers is a fun action pop corn thrill ride but it isn't flawless like TDK. It has a very boring first 70-90 minutes. And a few more nit pics. But it's fun!
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,"What can I say? Should I start by saying that this is going to go down as my favorite superhero movie of all time? It indeed is now! This film broke box office records for a reason!

The movie itself started off slow, but checking out the running time of the film, that should be expected. Not to fear, because that was the calm before the storm! I love how even though, sometimes movies with multiple characters in films like this, it can be difficult to put together time and effort for as much equal playtime for everyone...but that indication paid off, and the quality of the characterization was put together very well. The story was intriguing and brilliant! The action was solid, and the effects were astonishing! Some people maybe could find flaws in this film, but I simply couldn't. This is the superhero film for the ages, and every Marvel fan should love this flick!"
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,"It's environment and chemistry on occasions is disappointing and generic, but The Avengers is a lot of fun."
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,"Great action, great characters, great humor... Not so great plot."
"Nov 23, 2012",positive,"The 2nd best super hero movie I have ever seen. The 1st being Batman Begins, but that is besides the point. Almost everything about this movie was amazing. The story was just so-so, but I was willing to ignore that because they did everything else right in a movie that did not have any room for screwing up. The acting the special effects and the action all amazed me. Now you might be worried right now as to whether or not the action would be split up among all the avengers equally. But do not worry, everyone got their fair share and nobody was the center of attention. The fight scenes were very well constructed and thought out. It didn't matter if they were fighting alone, against one another or alongside one another. They each got their fair share. The whole point of this movie was to show what it would be like if super-heros were fighting as a team and Director Joss Whedon pulled it off BEAUTIFULLY.I will be honest the main focus of the movie was to get the special effects as good as they possibly could and in any movie the more special effects that are used the more obvious it is that the movie would be nothing without them. This is not to say that the plot or screenplay was ignored. The Avengers as most of the critics will say had a great sense of humor, the story unfortunately was very generic, not bad it's just not something that introduced anything new to the world of cinema. The character development was also very much lacking in alot of ways because these characters are so unchangeable that it was actually kind of annoying to watch as they never changed, but after being blown away with all the awesome in the movie I really didn't care.On one final note that I can't ignore. The fact that my favorite actor Edward Norton was replaced by Mark Ruffalo a guy I know nothing about was just extremely annoying. Edward Norton was my favorite portrayal of Bruce Banner, but to be fair I've only seen two portrayals: Eric Bana from the 2003 HULK(which was terrible) and Edward Norton's portrayal from the 2008 version which was absolutely phenomenal.  And when I compare Mark to Ed I can't help, but think Ed would have done a much better job at this and at the same time would have had something really cool to say he was in and I don't even know what the hell he was thinking when he didn't want to be in the movie. But I am willing to say that Mark Ruffalo did a decent job at the role of the Hulk.All in all, a truly fantastic action movie topped off with a satisfying conclusion to the first avengers movie. The next Avengers movie needs to surpass this with a far better story and Special effects if it wants to impress me. And this movie is receiving a much deserved 5 stars. :)"

"Nov 22, 2012",neutral,The biggest letdown of 2012.
"Nov 22, 2012",positive,Pretty cool. The acting and story was a bit corny at times but I guess that is to be expected from this genre of film.
"Nov 22, 2012",positive,Absolutely mind blowing of course I'm a marvel fan but the perfect balance of story humour gripping moments and heart
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"This has to be one of the best superheroes movies I have ever seen because of the assembly of great heroes and the balance of star power. No one character seems to outshine the others, there is a decently gripping story, and it all culminates in great action sequences with the eye candy you come to expect with Marvel. This film built nicely off of all the individual films and I gather it is not the last we will see of Marvel. Lets get shwarma everybody!"

"Nov 21, 2012",neutral,"If you're looking for lackluster plot, countless inconsistencies, but good dialogue, you came to the right place. Though somewhat entertaining, this movie's lack of theme or direction makes it much of a let-down."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,Impossible. How can a movie that consist so many superheroes can be told awesomely and not a single character overshadowing the other?! Well done Joss Whedon!
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"I was not a huge fan of the humour, saying that I think they pulled of the big trap of giving to much line light to one character and sharing it out fairly amongst the rest of the cast."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,Will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,Could have been better.
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"A all time great superhero films, it doesn't quite compare to Nolan's Batman series but its in a different ballpark to it. The avengers combines not only some of our favorite Marvel heros' but combines massive action and humor to just make a pure enjoyable film."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"Director and writer Joss Whedon spends his time wisely developing the superhero team as a whole and its heroes individually, inserting the action to thrust the story forward to its tightly satisfying conclusion, leaving room for a sequel, which he will direct."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"On the surface: borrows heavily from Dark Knight with Joker as Loki and Batman as everyone else.  Underneath: eye candy for women.  Confusing hierarchy of power:  apparently, everyone can kick everyone else's ass.  I'm surprised Scarlet Johanssen didn't kick the Hulk's ass."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"The best movie that I've seen in this year ! :D
It's very interesting to see the mosts populars heroes from Marvel make an incredible team .
I hope there will a second movie ."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"A well written and well acted superhero film that sets new standards and forces other studios to rethink their property strategy. As a comic fan, I was pleased seeing all of my favorite characters (except Johansson's awful performance as the Black Widow) in screen. After it was over, I wanted to view it again and I hoped to see more in the future."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon did wonders incorporating all these different characters and not favoring anyone of them too heavily.  He spent time reintroducing each character and didn't spend unnecessarily on non stop action.  The action sequences were well though out and much detail placed into the choreagraphy.  Well timed placed humor lightened the mood and was not forced.  Can't wait for #2, as long as Whedon and the principles return."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"An amazing super-hero movie, honoring the comic's tradition and giving a gift to the nerd folks."
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,Great movie alot of action!
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,action movie of the year
"Nov 21, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon, we bow before you in thanks. You have not destroyed our collective childhood. For this, we shall always love thee. Amazing in every way. There is no reason not to see this movie."
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,"I have to admit that I was a bit nervous going into this movie. Despite the glowing reviews it had been getting for its characterization, I hadn't really enjoyed Captain America or Thor. The latter of which I watched in dull 3D, souring my experience and leaving that taste in my mouth as i went into watch this one. 

But I've always been a great fan of Joss Whedon, having watched and enjoyed most of his shows (dollhouse was decidedly average in my honest opinion), so I went in with great expectations. 

This movie fulfilled them. Well most of them. 

Firstly, as well as being action packed, it's also funny as hell. It proudly displays what we all know Josh Whedon is...well...known for; flashy banter, great characters and a gripping storyline. And it's the first time since watching Avatar in 3D where I haven't been straining to see something on screen because it's whizzed by too fast, or been obscured by darkness. 

All the characters are right there, fully realized on screen, even characters that had no right to work, Hawkeye and Black Widow being two such examples, but they do because of the time and care given to making all the heroes human. Yes, it does have a problem with favoritism from Joss. Robert Downey. Jr as Iron Man sparkles and zaps with one liners that are hilariously droll, whereas Chris Evans has to play the moralistic (read: boring) straight man. And comes across as the least interesting of the heroes. Even Thor has a zinger that made me laugh out loud. And he doth wear his mother's drapes. 

Hulk is well rounded and not just a big green rage monster when played against Iron Man, though he does suffer from a deus ex machina moment, which looks cool but makes little sense from what we see of his development on screen.

And Loki, already being fleshed out in Thor, is great. Although not enough screen time is given to him to reiterate his motivations. And the...um..alien race is generic as anything we've seen before in alien invasion movies but are interesting enough and threatening enough that we care about our characters stuck in this blitzkrieg.

Did I mention the movie's funny?"
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,It was a dream come true to see the Avengers heroes team up in the big screen. It was successful in making the audience look forward to the sequel and the heroes's individual movies.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,Not better than Batman.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,I would give this 10 stars if it was possible on Flixter. Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,A very well done movie :D Love the small fun qoutes in the movie. We laughed with tears in our eyes when we saw it. Great job :)
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,This was a good movie. I actually liked Thor and Captain America better as standalone movies though. Loki is a really awesome villain.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,Superhero movies usually aren't my thing but this one was tight. Hulk's a funny dude. It wasn't all special effects and show as I had expected.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,Just awesome! One of the best movies of the year.
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,Possibly the best comic book movie ever
"Nov 20, 2012",positive,"Awesome!  Equal time to characters.  ""Puny god.""  I love that scene the best."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"Large scale epicness - I think that's the best way to describe it. And really, that's the only decent way to describe a movie with so many superheroes in it. I haven't actually seen all the lead in movies (and by lead in, I mean the movies that starred our superheroes before they all came together for The Avengers), and this movie only made me want to see them all. Yes there are flaws, but you don't really care about them - this movie is just that good."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,Excellent movie! Exciting from beginning to end!
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,Perfect action movie.
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"There is little doubt that anyone but Joss Whedon could have combined such levels of wit, depth, and spectacle to bring The Avengers to such glorious life."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"After the surprise ending in Iron Man four years ago and all the build up by nerds and comic book fans and people who just love these movies for four years, the avengers does not disapoint."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,of course this movie is good. whoever thinks otherwise is an idiot
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"Ever since Firefly, Joss has been on my radar. Knowing only the basics of the Avengers, with my girlfriend being the comic specialist, I loves the movies leading up to this and has high expectations. This movie did not disappoint."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,great movie one of the best i have ever seen
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"Whoever digs deep to find the faults of this film will also have to dig through an epic amount of fun in the process. I thoroughly enjoyed this film for exactly what it is: a Super Hero movie. I wasn't overly convinced with some of the 'phase 1' films, Thor was average, Caption America was fairly poor and the Hulk films where dreadful. However I loved the Iron Man movies as Robert Downey Jr. Is exceptional and he's even better in the Avengers. Joss Whedon is a genius for making this work as I was never convinced he would. I'm also pleased he's over seeing the 'phase 2' projects as he's shown he understands the production values of what makes a perfect Marvel movie.

The cast is superb, Robert Downey Jr. steals the show delving deeper into the complex character that is Tony Stark. Other than Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Christopher Reeves' Superman, I think Robert Downey Jr. is the best casted actor to play a superhero to date. There's been multiple incarnations of Batman, Spider-Man and the Hulk, but the thought of somebody else playing Iron Man other than RDJ feels like having Christmas Day without a Turkey. It just would not work. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans convincingly make the numbers up but neither of them stand out from the crowd. Scarlett Johansson is brilliant again as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow. Her character deserves a stand alone movie and although she's more like Tomb Raider than a superhero, a Black Widow film would be awesome. The surprise of the film is Mark Ruffalo who's nailed the character of Bruce Banner. Third time lucky for Marvel who tried Eric Bana and Edward Norton previously to play the Hulk but they where both unconvincing and instantly forgettable. I think what worked third time around was that producers focused more on getting the character of Bruce Banner perfect before they worried about the CG of the alter-ego the Hulk. To add to that, the CG for the Hulk in the Avengers is the best to date. I'm not a massive Hulk fan but I would happily welcomes a Hulk film if it casts Ruffalo again. They've found a winning formula with Ruffalo so I hope Marvel stick with him.

The biggest disappointment is Jeremy Renner. He's a great actor playing the great character Hawkeye, but I think Joss Whedon presented this character wrong. Jeremy Renner's acting talent was wasted and he just seemed to be forgotten about. I hope there's a Hawkeye movie for Jeremy Renner's sake as he deserves the chance to show everyone he can offer more to the role. Tom Hiddleston does well to fill the big role of the villain considering he's competing alongside a huge array of talent. His performance as Loki however is by no means up there with the best of cinematic superhero villains. For example Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor and both Jack Nicholson's and Heath Ledger's performances as the Joker are timeless. Samuel L. Jackson is on form and has a larger input in this Marvel film which is good, I hope he's involved in the Shield TV series but I doubt he'll step down to TV. Last but not least without further a do, Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson deserves the last word. I was gutted that he got killed off, but he's apparently reappearing in the Shield TV series. He's consistently been brilliant in all the 'phase 1' films and its a shame to think he won't be involved in 'phase 2'.

Overall Avengers is a great film, great visuals, great choreography of action and great performances. Its the first super hero film to give Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy a taste of competition but in a totally different way. This is by no means award winning material, but the Avengers doesn't want awards, it wants everyone to have an epic amount of fun. Joss Whedon I salute you!"
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"The only negative is this movie involves alot of stupid mistakes that a viewer would only catch if they watch it again otherwise its a fun movie, and deserves a second."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"A fun, entertaining superhero epic. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man steals the show"
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"Sure, it's shallow, but do all movies have to have a higher purpose? A spectacular and thrilling summer popcorn movie."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"The movie was overall great! The action was intense every time a problem came up. The problems that I had was the fact that the enemy was not as serious as it could have been. I felt like one superhero would have been enough to take out all the bad guys. Iron Man could have made a bunch of his suits since he has them at his disposal and distributed them to the army. That would have been enough to take out Loki and the army. Thor is Demi-God and they proved that heâ(TM)s much more powerful than Loki. Thor could have just called in his friends from Asgard that they showed in Thorâ(TM)s movie. The Hulk seemed to have gone unscathed the entire time when he was facing the entire army. The Hulk could have dealt with everything by himself just by âsmashingâ?. Not only did the movie have heroes with too much power for the threat but they also had heroes that seemed âout-gunnedâ? for the job. Black Widow is only skilled with a gun and interrogating and Hawk-eye was good with a bow. These two should have been in a movie with a lot less serious of an enemy. And the ending with the nuke? Why didnâ(TM)t they toss a nuke into the warp hole when they saw it opened up? Why did S.H.E.I.L.D. want to make weapons from the tesseractâ(TM)s energy when nuclear power did the job very  well as shown in the scene where everything blew up from the nuclear bomb? All criticisms aside however, the movie was definitely the movie of the summer. It was action packed the entire time and the story was very well put. I liked how they incorporated The Avengers Initiative in the other movies to build up to this one. It definitely caught my attention as well as millions of others who watched this movie. I would give the movie a solid 4.7 out of 5."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers, is a movie that appeals to the senses. No not touch or taste, but with so many special effects,  great sounds quality, and so many different scene set ups it makes you feel like youâ(TM)re actually there in the movie fighting alongside with The Avengers. Hey, you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew. Avengerâ(TM)s style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past. Marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army. 
Every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up. Yeah Marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately, but that way is a thing of the past. Whatâ(TM)s better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask? How about ten birds with one stone? Thatâ(TM)s what The Avengers creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie. Just the idea is pure genius. Yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money. So thatâ(TM)s why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the Marvel Company. 
The way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date. Even if the viewer didnâ(TM)t watch one Marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on. Marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time, not just by plucking them from thin air. 
	Now on to the bad of the movie. It was very hard to find the bad in this movie but there were a few things that could be pointed out. The fact that Marvel decided to only go with a select few of their characters and not bring all of them into this movie could have been heart breaking for all of those Batman fans out there or even the little kid with his Spiderman underwear, but except for those few and very small details The Avengers is a must see."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"From the opening scene to the final seconds, Marvelâ(TM)s âThe Avengersâ? is an action packed thrill ride thatâ(TM)ll leave you begging for more. The overall storyline is nothing special, bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army, but the true genius of Avengers lies in its execution. Joss Whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed. The threat is quickly established, but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team.  Though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore, it is another credit to the directing/writing of Whedon. By slowly introducing each character we are better able to see each heroâ(TM)s personality bounce of the others in a sort of entertaining experiment that takes place right before our eyes.
	A good super hero movie often hinges on its villain (âThe Dark Knightâ(TM)sâ? Joker), and it isnâ(TM)t an easy task to make the audience doubt the heroesâ(TM) ability to come out on top. Especially when there are six of them, but Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, acts the part to perfection. And speaking of acting, it would appear that the third time is in fact the charm as no one could have predicted the show stealing performance by Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk who succeeded where Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not. His role as the cool, calculating scientist with a touch of emotional instability, âIâ(TM)m always angry,â? was highly engaging. As for the rest of the cast, they benefited from the group dynamic. Each hero was the star of his own movie and when they come together their respective egos clash resulting in action such as the fight between Robert Downey Jr.â(TM)s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworthâ(TM)s Thor, or hilarity in the case of Iron Man calling Captain America, played by Chris Evans, âOld Man.â?
	Amongst all the stars of the movie, there is still one more, the special effects. Delivering one the best action movies of the year could not be possible without serious CGI and Avengers delivers in outstanding fashion. From the ascension of S.H.I.E.L.D.â(TM)s mother ship to the moment the alien armyâ(TM)s arrival in New York, the art department shows it has what it takes to compete with the likes of Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan. The Hulk is brought to life in astounding realism as well as the character many forget isnâ(TM)t real either, Iron Man.
	As a whole there is little that can be said against Whedonâ(TM)s new masterpiece. The expectations of every comic book fan and superhero movie buff must have hung heavy on his shoulders. The buildup to this was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood.  Whedon, in his magnum opus, reveals himself to be the true hero of âThe Avengers.â?"
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"A really enjoyable movie, it's not a Dark Knight style, but it wasn't supposed to be, it was supposed to be a amazing action-packed blockbuster with beloved Marvel characters, and they deliver it in a almost flawless way."
"Nov 19, 2012",positive,"This is a good movie, but completely overrated."
"Nov 19, 2012",negative,"The Avengers
	One thing that can be said about Joss Whedonâ(TM)s âThe Avengersâ? is, it stole from me the longest two and a half hours of my life.  Never having been a fan, or should I say victim, of the Marvel comic character movies, I found this to be very hard to follow.  There is no back story.  Hell I didnâ(TM)t even know that Natasha Romanoff was the black widow until the ending credits.  Itâ(TM)s all just a typical superhero movie.  The bad guy takes something that is going to destroy earth as we know it and the heroes must band together to save the earth in time.
	In the opening sequence, we are introduced to Samuel L. Jacksonâ(TM)s character, Nick Fury.  He has come to investigate why the tesseract has begun to take on a life of its own.  As he is conducting his investigation, a portal opens to release none other than the bad guy of the movie, Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston).  After an extremely short and unconvincing battle with security, Loki takes off with the tesseract.  The rest of the two and a half hours is spent trying to get it back.
	After the bad guy has taken the one thing that can destroy earth as we know it, all the worldâ(TM)s superheroes must be found and brought together because only they, teamed together, have the power to destroy Loki and recover the tesseract.  Fury scavenges the world afar to locate all of the players.  He rounds up Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) from places such as India, Russia, and Outer Space.  After a short and unconvincing battle between Iron Man and Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Thor all of a sudden becomes one of the good guys to help take down his brother, Loki.
	The rest of the movie is spent trying to locate the tesseract before it can be used for evil.  After the first two hours of unclimatic happenings, the superheroes must come together as a team for a good versus evil battle in which they hope to regain control of the tesseract.  In a clichÃ (C) filled ending, battle ensues in which we get to see all the heroâ(TM)s exhibit their super strengths and powers.  The whole thing is very predictable of whatâ(TM)s going to happen next.  Never having seen any of the other movies involving these characters, I must say that I had a lot of expectations of this movie that went unfulfilled."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE BY A FAR SHOT THIS YESR! AMAZING GRAPHICS! GREAT ACTION! THEY DID AN AWESOME JOB ON THIS MOVIE!
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is by no means just one of your average superhero movies. If youâ(TM)re a fan of comic books or superhero movies, then The Avengers by Marvel will surely not disappoint you. Compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have came out in theaters in the summer of 2012, this movie seems to top Spider-Man and Batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie. 
This movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie. With the names of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, this movie compares to an all-star game of athletes in any given sport. In comparing the movie to other movies by Marvel, this movie stands out in a good way. This movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of. In terms of putting the superheroes together, The Avengers does a marvelous job. 
The Avengers is essentially a sequel to Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Incredible Hulk, taking elements from each movie. After Loki gets exiled from his home planet of Asgard, as seen in Thor after attempting to rule Asgard, he seeks out to rule again.  After Captain America gets unfrozen, he is seen working out when Nick Fury stops by. Nick Fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the Avengers. 
At first, things are shaky as the superheroesâ(TM) egos clash rather than mesh together. This is easily done by Loki, shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the Avengers. The constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience, but it doesnâ(TM)t diminish the movie as a whole. In the movie, the characters donâ(TM)t seem to have changed from their own movies, although Iron Man learns the value of working with others. 
Joss Whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions. In my opinion, this movie sets the bar for superhero movies. Itâ(TM)ll be a great challenge for DC and Marvel to top The Avengers."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"The Avengers brings together the Marvel Superheroes Iron Man (Robert Downy Jr.), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Joss Whedon does a good job of bringing all six of these comic book characters together in one movie. When Loki (Tom Hiddleston), a villain from outer space, threatens the safety of the world, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. finds himself in a predicament and needs a team to help defeat him. Loki pairs up with an unknown alien who promises him re-entry to Earth in exchange for the â??Tesseractâ?? which is a cube of energy that creates a portal from his world to Earth. This portal is needed so the alien army can take over Earth. It is the Avengers job to capture Loki and defeat the alien army before it takes over Earth.
	The movie in general is pretty good. The idea of taking the superhero characters of several other movies was unique. On the other hand, to understand the movie fully you have to know the original characters and their stories. For a comic book buff or an action movie buff who have seen the movies â??The Hulkâ?? or â??Captain Americaâ??, the movie is easy to understand at the beginning, but for a person who has never read the comics or seen the movies, it can be rather confusing. 
	Looking at the actual movie, the actors did a good job and the roles were believable. Whedon does a good job by bringing different emotions into the movie. It is humorous, thrilling by keeping you on your toes, sad at some points, and has a happy ending. The bickering between the characters about who is the strongest or best superhero was comical, along with the witty remarks by Iron Man. The climatic last battle between the avengers and Lokiâ??s alien battle fulfills the action and thrilling part. This is the part where you do not want to take a bathroom break. It will keep you on your toes the whole time. The special effects during the whole movie really bring everything together. 
	All in all, this movie was good. It ranges from funny to action filled and good for all ages. It might be recommended to watch the movies that each avenger is in if you want to fully understand the movie, but if you just want to watch a good action movie with your favorite superheroes, this movie is for you."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,Expensive work that paid off profit wise... My trouble is the lackluster plot with the worst villian casted in a movie since the tomatoes from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.  Honestly without Iron Man it would have flopped in comparison.
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"i laugh and scream ""hell yeah"" thru out the movie. awesome"
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was a good movie, but took a little while to get into. At first I was very confused, seeing as I have not watched any of the other Marvel movies. Nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was, it was just assumed that you knew. As I was watching the movie I asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on. Without these people to clear things up I may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch.
As the movie began things jumped around a lot, which made the storyline hard to follow. Characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason. Further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable, but they could have done a better job writing the beginning. Again, without explanations from the people I was with I would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it.
The only reason a person would not like The Avengers, in my opinion, would be because they had not seen previous Marvel movies in which these characters were featured. Once things were explained to me and I understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie. The plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess. Things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day. It is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times.
All of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultra-powerful force from outer space, but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world. Besides personality clashes, the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart. This nerve wrecking movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you watch hoping that everyone can get along in time to defeat the villain."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"Loved It, Want It On Digital Copy."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,Superb performances and jawdropping special effects. The bar has been raised for superhero movies. A+
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever made. Brilliant use of every character. Joss's screenplay is incredible and direction excellent. A must see if your into Marvel or superheroes  in general!
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"was hoping for more action,but good story line...."
"Nov 18, 2012",negative,"-Joss Whedon's most recent film The Avengers is more or less the generic superhero movie but with the twist of it being based on a team of Marvel superheroes. The team is comprised of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and to a varying degree Hawkeye and Nick Fury. Notably, the majority of the team has their own movies already and I think it's safe to say that if you're unfamiliar with the Marvel mythos or haven't at least seen one or two of the other films you are at a complete disadvantage. I say this because I personally have only seen Iron Man and am severely lacking in my understanding of Marvel characters as a whole. If it wasn't for my moderate knowledge of Norse mythology I would have probably been even more lost.
-So let's assume that going into this film the audience had never picked up a Marvel comic before in their lives, was completely in the dark in regards to the Thor-Odin-Loki relationship and never saw Iron Man, Thor, Captain America or any of the Hulk movies. Not only would they have no idea about who half the Avengers were or their back stories but the several characters without movies of their own have literally no history given to the audience. Black Widow, Nick Fury and Hawkeye are seemingly important characters to the film and yet I personally had no knowledge of them prior to seeing the movie and still next to nothing after seeing the movie. In all actuality Marvel knows who their target market is and knows that the average Joe going to see and actually care about The Avengers will undoubtedly have a greater understanding of it than myself but still. If I was this lost there must have been others just as if not more confused.
-Now let's assume that back-story wasn't a key priority for Mr. Whedon and the Marvel people. All right, fair enough, it was a superhero movie after all so itÃ¢(TM)s more about the plot, character development and of course the fight sequences. Well unfortunately the plot was weak beyond belief. How many movies, novels, games, etc. have to lay waste to New York City before the audiences realize,hey, we've seen this dog and pony show before.' But I digress.
-The films plot is simple: good versus evil. You can't really screw that up without trying but because it is so cliche, it does take a certain prowess to present it in a new and unique fashion. I can't say with a clear conscience that The Avengers did that. One does notice the World War II undertones, if they can be called undertones as opposed to slaps in the face. For instance, Captain America's flashback and the scene in Germany where Loki forces the crowd to kneel before him and the brief dialogue between Loki and Captain America, which follows. That scene was less than necessary and seemed to only be used to fuel the connection between Loki and Hitler.
-While the plot could certainly have been more avant-garde the character development was so slight and unrealistic that it may have not been there at all. While all the characters in the film are for the most part static there are two points of revelation. The first being when the team actually begins to act as a team and the second is toward the end once Loki has come to understand he has done something very wrong. This may be the lack of back-story, but I find it rather farfetched that the previously squabbling and bickering team would rally around the death of Agent Coulson as the link to unite against Loki.
-When it comes to the fight scenes one can't help but feel that they occur quite often and are nearly always overly exaggerated and overdone. I know it's a superhero movie so it is to be expected that there be some intense battle sequences but the one-on-one duels are sickening to say the least. It's almost as if those parts of the movie were made either to distract from the weak plot or used as entertainment for those of the audience that look for more brawn and less brain.
-The Avengers is a decent movie for avid fans of the Marvel Universe and those who enjoy a slugger film. However, it could have certainly been done differently and in a better way. The plot could have been stronger and character development could have been more evident than it was. After seeing the movie and writing this review all I have to say is I hope The Avengers 2 can avenge the first movie."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,awesome full of action
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,Better than I ever anticipated. IMO best superhero film ever created
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"Amazing. Every aspect. Acting, camerawork, plot, casting, just everything. One of my favorite movies."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"S.H.I.E.L.D., the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, opens up the movie with an experimentation and activation of the Tesseract. It is said that the Tesseract holds the key to unlimited power, hence the experimentation, however to the dismay of the humans, the exiled Norse god, Loki, (Tom Hiddleston) steps out of a portal and proceeds with a killing spree in the base. He then leaves the base with the Tessearct in his procession and Clint âHawkeyeâ? Barton and Dr. Erik Selvig (Jeremy Renner and Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd respectively) under some sort of mind control.
The movie has a relatively generic plot introduction; the antagonist enters by some unforeseen means and takes something vital to the protagonist(s). A central theme seen throughout the whole movie is how the Avengers have little to no trust in each other. When Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles the Avengers Initiative he sparks rivalries between each hero and there is frequent infighting. One such example, and my personal favorite, is the fight between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Tony Stark: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) after Thor takes Loki out of their procession. This reveals the pent up aggression because of the high-stress situation that each hero is facing due to the circumstances and gives Whedon a good outlet to express some of the power and potential they hold.
In the grand 55-minute finale fight that takes place in Manhattan, in and of itself something every American can resonate with being iconic to our culture, Loki brings forth an Alien race called the Chitauri with his use of the Tesseract. Throughout the development of the storyline and each character, they all learn to feed off of each otherâ(TM)s strengths and become all the more powerful. The infighting stops and because of their teamwork, the world is saved. 
Simple things, such as when Captain America (Chris Evans) gives Agent Natasha Romanov, âThe Black Widowâ? (Scarlett Johannson) a boost up to an alien spacecraft when she takes a running start at him and he launches her with his mighty shield, exemplify teamwork. This, among other small things, such as Iron Man flying Hawkeye to the top of a building to provide a better vantage point that would complement his archery show teamwork and are easily relatable to the average moviegoer and produce a sense of connection with the heroes.
The theme that focuses on teamwork and exploiting one anotherâ(TM)s strengths is important to our society and I think often something we shy away from. Whedon uses this central idea to his advantage and draws in an entire audience that can benefit from this, sort of like a moral at the end of a childhood storybook."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,great family movie!! saw it in the theaters and have rented it a few times since then.. great for the boys and the girls! - p.s. anything with Chris Helmsworth in it is going to be amazing!!
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"Little to add to the comments already made. Very good uptempo action movie which only pauses (if you are lucky)  for a good laugh. Maybe no brainbreaker and  the concept of superhero movie is really no novelty, but plain good FUN."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,Amazing combination!!!
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"As a fan of the comic book series, I was pleased with the film. My only disappointments were the lack of 2 of the founding members, and the lack of the legendary battle cry ""Avengers Assemble!"" That doesn't hinder the film from being enjoyable. Definitely one of my top favorite films."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,nothing not seen before stuff other than a lousy super villain. over-hyped. will come down to moderate ratings in coming years i m sure
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"Writers, Directors learning from Dark Knight Trilogy, that superhero movies could be so much more.. Avengers has every thing going for it.. the pace, dialogues, comic timing, tension and action, story and above all.. the traditional sense of heroes overcoming all the odds to win."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,this film has it all plenty of action.humor. drama and visual effects it was well worth the 4 year wait
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"As a comic book geek as a child I longed for this movie to be created - and was not disappointed! Even the absence of Avengers characters Spider-Man ('cause which one would they go with?!), Wolverine and Blade (can't really have an aged Wesley Snipes appearing as an apparent immortal can they?!) coupled with the slightly Stark centric storyline did not dampen what was a well placed movie with strong CGI and imaginative battle scenes. 

Yes there was the inevitable corny lines,  ""Hulk smash"" comes to mind, but the movie delivered entertainment from start to finish, and provides good lead in to the next round of Marvel movies."
"Nov 18, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers gives us a terrific cast with great performances and brilliantly crafted set pieces to bring us the ultimate pay off after a string of solo films starring its' heroes. The story is humanized and balances the characters very well with each having their own time to shine and while the action is abundant and never-ending, it doesn't distract the amazing plot penned by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn. The cast is charismatic and has great banter which produces memorable quotable lines and the action sequences are rather crafted masterfully with a great amount of fun. Marvel's The Avengers is a two and half our romp of endless fun, giving it a high re-watch factor. It might also be one of this decade's most memorable films, but it is definitely an impressively made popcorn flick that you might never get tired of.  

-4 stars"
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,absolutely perfect movie
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved it.. Ruffalo was the best choice for the hulk and Downey Jr. Is always hilarious.
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,"Definitely some cliches, but they're executed so well and on such a massive scale that it's kind of hard not to enjoy it anyway! Joss Whedon gets extra points for being the first director to successfully put the Hulk in a movie that doesn't stink."
"Nov 17, 2012",neutral,"Many people disagree with me, critics and audiences alike. It's just not my kind of superhero film. I find the plot to be messy, the characters not having any dimension whatsoever, the villians to be some of the worse excuses of villains I've ever seen. Too much flash, too much flair and not much else to offer."
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,All round great fun. Spectacular action scenes and the performances are spot on. The only let down for me is that the plot is very predictable.
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,Unbelievable!  I can't wait for the next one.
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,"Good action movie. I don't think it deserves a 96% by users though. Fun to watch on a Saturday night with the family. Has a lot of action as well as some comedic relief. Worth a rent, but no more than that."
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,Excellent film from start to finish. The reason to own a 3D television.
"Nov 17, 2012",negative,"I enjoyed the special effects and Iron Man and the Hulk's bromance, but for the most part I was bored and on the brick of falling asleep."
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,A good movie! needs a betty storyline!
"Nov 17, 2012",positive,"The Avengers: Astonishingly Amazing
	The Avengers is a movie that is action packed and it made up of many different characters from former movies. Joss Whedon, the director, decided that he would get all of the super heroes from the former movies to one location so they would be able to work together to complete an important task. The super heroes, Captain America, Hawkeye, Hawk, Iron Man, Black Widdow, and Thor, were brought together to defeat Thorâ??s brother, Loki. This was an important mission because Loki had the tesseract which would be able to open the world to other worlds. The tesseract was a source of energy that was stronger and more powerful than any other type of energy. Loki needed to be stopped because he was in charge of letting the world of Asgard take over our world. 
	The main action began in the movie right after Nick Fury made the announcement, â??As of right now, we are at war!â?? This is when the heroes all got together to perform their mission to defeat Loki. Joss Whedon did a great job by showing all of the special affects throughout the movie. Whedon shows effects really well when the Hawk is chasing after the Black Widdow right after the Hawk turns into his green monster self for the first time in the movie. The way that he was able to show the Hawk running through and breaking everything in his path was phenomenal. 
	Humor is used in a very interesting but entertaining way throughout this film. The way that Joss Whedon used humor was a dry sense, and it was easy to understand the funny statements made by the character. During the film Agent Coulson was talking to Captain America when he told him that it was a pleasure to be able to meet him. He kept going on about how big of a fan he was and how he collected all of Captain Americas cards. After he was done describing to Captain America on how much of a fan he was he told him that this was actually the second time he has met him. â??I watched you while you were sleeping,â?? Agent Coulson described to Captain America. This immediately came across a bit creepy to Captain America, and it was a way the Joss Whedon was able to pull of his sense of humor. 
	Joss Whedon did a wonderful job casting this film and making it film that is put up to the top of my list of favorite movies. I would recommend this film too many friends for it is worth your time to see all of the amazing special effects and the way Joss Whedon uses his humor throughout the film.

"Nov 17, 2012",positive,"Entertainment Value:8.5/10 to 9/10. Movie Quality:8/10. One damn overrated movie. Yes, it is a great movie but it is short of amazingly awesometacular like everyone else says. Hawkeye and Black Widow are kindof completely useless, and although I like archers (Green Arrow FTW), if he wasn't in this movie it wouldn't have changed. 
Seriously overrated, I mean it's average here is technically a 9.
Really great movie though.
8/10"

"Nov 16, 2012",positive,Love Thor! Good flick.
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,Some superhero movies dont work this is not one of those action from begining to end. awesome movie maybe the best superhero movie to date
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"Amazing comic book movie. One that is greater than its individual characters. Comic book fans have been craving live action depictions of their favorite stories for years, and have gotten hit or miss results over the past decade. This was the movie we have been waiting for. Hopefully it's only the beginning. 

(not saying that Xmen, Iron Man, Spiderman, etc were not good movies. It's just we could find many faults. There were not one complaint from many on this new film)"
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"One of the best action films ever made, hands down.  There's no reason why you shouldn't see this."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"Avengers: A 21st Century Masterpiece
As film making progresses over time, technology and cinematics help to amplify its brilliance in the theater. Joss Whedonâ??s, â??The Avengers,â?? is no doubt an exemplary model of the advancements in modern film making, but this is not all the movie offers. From the very beginning, the movie thrills and seeks to entertain, justifiable in its cinematography and modern graphics. Viewers are offered a dark entering scene, that stimulates questioning and suspense early on. While acting and the plot line may be a little rudimentary at times, I feel this can be disregarded as â??The Avengersâ?? is, after all, a super hero movie solely set to entertain and thrill. Its very nature is set to be action packed and visually appealing to a widely diversified audience. Throughout â??The Avengersâ??, the plot is thickened by revealing the superheroesâ?? pasts, utilized to construct a complex array of relationships among the Avengers as they assemble. The charactersâ?? unique personality profiles create suspense as the viewer attempts to predict the means and terms of cooperation among the heroâ??s. The overall building of tension in the movieâ??s plot is catalyzed by the tension that is built between heroes. One such example of this is the rather heated confrontation concerning the Atomic Bomb between Captain America and Iron Man aboard their airborne craft. Soon the other heroâ??s safety is put into jeopardy with the hulk on board, and serenity returns for a brief moment as the heroâ??s put aside their ideological differences. Witty punch lines and sarcastic humor adds edginess to the characters amusing confrontations, examples can be found littered throughout the movie. Witty punch lines and one liners fill practically every minute of â??The Avengers,â?? pleasing to those critics who look for such literary keenness. Viewers who like deeper subject matter would also like â??The Avengersâ?? as social commentary can also be found within the context of â??The Avengersâ?? such as mans subservient duty to those in power. Lokiâ??s role in the Avengers is to highlight this controversial aspect of human nature as well as the human condition. Loki notes of humans, â??You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers,â?? in regards to war and the violence and greed found in human socio-political systems. One prime example of this in the movie is when a group of societyâ??s social elites are thrown into chaos and shortly subdued thereafter by Loki, who has them kneel before them. As the movie continues on, the viewer is given a variety of epic superhero match ups who fight and further the plot, such as the battle between Iron Man and Captain America in the woods that leaves the movie attendee wanting more. It is towards the end of the movie that an interesting end and ultimate conclusion result from the cooperation of heroâ??s who decide individual differences behind them for service of the greater good."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"Outstanding flick! Not 100% true to the source material, but still a cinematic masterpiece."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,Fantastic movie. Kept u on the edge of your seat... Great concept and great to see all the superheroes we know and love fighting for the greater good
"Nov 16, 2012",negative,"Unbelievably overrated, virtually  plotless, badly cast, boring, sloppily directed, missing a beginning, a middle and an end. I'm flabbergasted at how this could become so popular. X-Men (e.g.) is so much better, in all respects.
The only one that escapes the below average misery of this caricature of a film is Downey Junior. His zest makes some scenes worthwhile."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"Few movies capture the fun of superheroes like The Avengers! I was in love with this movie from the start. From witty one-liners to an interesting and twisted villain, The Avengers definitely is the most fun I've had in a theatre even after seeing it 3 times."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"A bit of bore at the beginning, but it's visually intense, almost as good as Prometheus when it comes to CG.  When it does pick up, it picks up well and it's definitely a movie to own. So far probably the best movie of the year, but I haven't seen Batman or Twilight yet........Get the 3D bluray set, it's worth every penny!"
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,great movie wish is was longer about another hour would have been good lol.
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,Very good for the type of movie.
"Nov 16, 2012",negative,"My rating for The Avengers is poor. I didnâ(TM)t care for the movie because I am not into the whole action movies. It doesnâ(TM)t help when I didnâ(TM)t know at first who each character was and what their super power was and used for. I donâ(TM)t like the fact that the place that it took place was New York City, I feel that every movie that has disaster happens there I donâ(TM)t get if they are trying to prove a point or if they use that city because itâ(TM)s a popular place. 
	The visuals in the movie were not really good. You have to watch the movie in a dark room in order to see the dark scenes due to the fact that the lighting was poor.  The animation was not realistic with the cars flying the bombs exploding. The big flying dragon/snail falling from the sky from the hole didnâ(TM)t seem so real because you wouldnâ(TM)t see that in an everyday life event. With Hulk throwing the Loki around the room hitting the floors and walls, in real life if someone did that the person would be dead from the impact. The buildings getting smashed into and only some falling but the ones with the worst damage didnâ(TM)t fall. 
	The music I have to say was good in the movie; it would follow the scenes when they were fighting. It would have more intense music when the dragon/snail fell from the sky. The acting was always good except I didnâ(TM)t like how Ironman acting was.  A couple quotes that stood out to was, âFreedom is lifeâ(TM)s great lie.â?(Loki), âThere was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles then we never could.â?(Nick Fury)
	I believe that you have to be interested in the whole comic book for superheroâ(TM)s to get the movie and know what each superhero powers are because if not then you will be confused in the movie. And I think this movie is more towards the guy side of a movie if it had more scenes for the girls then it would have turned out better. âAlright. Hey. Alright. Good job guys, letâ(TM)s not come in tomorrow. Letâ(TM)s just take a day off.â? (Iron Man) If superheroes were supposed to save people every day then why would they need a day off? I would not recommend this movie to anyone if they are not into the whole superhero, non-real creatures and if they are not in a dark room."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"Unfortunately The Avengers was not a good movie, it was an amazing movie! With my expectations high from the monumental amount of hype, I was hesitant to jump on the bandwagon in fear of being disappointed. However, I was far from let down when the epic story unfolded before me. Bringing together iconic Marvel characters, the film flowed in an almost flawless manner fully developing each character in their own way. Joss Whedon mostly known for titles such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Cabin in the Woods truly outdid himself in the action packed suspenseful flick. 
	The cast was perfectly chosen and their roles were executed properly. With an all-star cast consisting of Robert Downy JR reclaiming his role as the arrogant, egotistical hero Iron Man. Chris Evans played the fantastic classic, Captain America. Scarlet Johansson played the mischievously dangerous Black Widow. Jeremy Renner playing the part of the bow wielding Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo acting the part of the ingenious scientist, who just happens to turn into a massive green monster that can destroy anything it comes in contact with while angry. Last but not least, hammer-wielding God of thunder Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth.  Each of them brought a unique and diverse talent to the table. When forced to come together to save earth from total annihilation, thanks to the brother of Thor, Loki whom is played by Tom Hiddleston. The acting was superb, and the blend of each character really added to the overall effect of the Plot. 
	The visual effects of The Avengers alone are enough to get you pumped for a fantastic movie. From the breathtaking CGI, to the integration of what is real and animated it's inarguable that the budget must have been out of this world. The music was professionally composed, and suited each situation vastly. The production quality was not lacking in any department and it greatly showed in the overall plot through the mood, lighting and story progression. The story behind The Avengers is very interesting and easily one of the most action packed Marvel films up to date. A mostly action film incorporated with a comedic undertone it can leave you at the edge of your seat at one moment and laughing the next. With all of these qualities, the film has defiantly lived up to the comic series revealing its self through different means, over all The Avengers is a fantastic film and is definitely worth a watch, I highly recommend it to anyone.

"Nov 16, 2012",positive,A movie that fan boys like me have waited for and prayed for. Since the first movie poster and after credits teaser. As a fan boy we've seen comic movies tank and suck but since Thor moving the comic book movies back to awesome The Avengers take it to another level to amazing.
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"I was told it was a very good movie from the start but I really wasnt much to watching superhero flicks but everyone changes their opinion at times. Watching the beginning it was a little slow on what was happening and why they were there in the first place, didnt take too long then it actually started to make sense on what the plot was going to be about for the entire as well why they tried to get the avengers all together. I didnt know all of them who was in the group but probably a couple so seeing them all appear one by one was pretty good and helped out where they all came from before becoming a group. The action was nicely done with a few times I wondered what was going to be around the cornor, adding on to more of the suspense even when things were a little slow in the story there was still a slight excitement factor being portrayed on when the plot is going to turn. The best part is that it wasnt just an all action packed and sealed movie but added on parts when it gets tense or funny at times. Those alone were put in the film very nicely as a sort of recovery from a scene of action, switched to serious, than a funny time here and there. Of all the movies I watched I was very impressed at the computer graphics they used in many of the fighting and chase scenes, with some movies you are able to tell whether it looks real or fake. For this movie it was very hard to tell at times what was computer graphic and what was actually done on the set, that was what got me the most and most of the time I can tell when something has been added in to make a movie better in quality. The acting cast was well picked for this movie because of the fact those who played the avenger characters before knew how the character acted and used it to their advantage on how they would react amongs eachother for the first time, with some ending good while some ending badly which was funny to the audience. Along with the characters i liked how they brought in the character Thor into the picture, even though I thought it was odd he came from another world and all but then again I didnt know much about him except what I learned in Norse mythology on Thor and Loki. I knew they were brothers but from how they acted in the movie it was a perfect match to fables on those two. Overall I was surprised at the end that the movie was done very well this time around, I would even watch it again just to get a better grip on the Marvel characters a little more. This was a pretty good movie and well recommended."
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,not better that Wreck it Ralph
"Nov 16, 2012",positive,"A nerdgasm for comic enthusiasts but informative while, at the same time, not delving too deep into comic myhtology to make sense for the casual moviegoer. Apart from the filler roles of Black Widow and Hawkeye, every Avenger has been beautifully potrayed by their respective actors. Mark Ruffalo, as the only one not to have portrayed Dr. Bruce Banner in the past, fits in perfectly with the rest of the team and is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best incarnation of Dr. Banner to date."
"Nov 15, 2012",positive,Way better than I thought it'd be. If this is what Disney is doing for Marvel than I can't wait for the new Star Wars movies!
"Nov 15, 2012",positive,"Stunning. This does the job, complete with bangs, Hulk bashing aliens, Downey Jr., and Shawarma."
"Nov 15, 2012",positive,"Fun, entertaining family action from start to finish. A great array of characters and a film for everyone to enjoy!"
"Nov 15, 2012",negative,"I remember when Joss Whedon was interesting: for plot, character, subtle and interesting human themes, sheer surprise and delight. Remember Firefly? What happened to the extraordinary talent that made that possible?

Meanwhile, this Avengers thing: doubtless making lots of money for somebody, but take away the costumes and explosions, you got nothing. Just so much noise. As comic movies go, Thor was way better."
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,"An awesomely fun, on-the-edge-of-your-seat, graphics-loaded festival for all five senses!"
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Amazing!!!!! Hulk is the best followed by Ironman then Thor!!
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,"It should be acknowledged that putting this movie together is a historical feat. Never has a major cross-over film with an enormous ensemble cast been pulled off so well. 

It's been four years and five movies in the making and it delivered. None of the lead up movies have ever really taken themselves too seriously, the exception probably being Incredible Hulk to which we should fault Edward Norton. 

At times childish but still packing a lot of action, The Avengers was a great ride and no one should have wanted more then to be entertained. The characters were at times monotone but the chemistry between the actors was there and you can sense they had a great time making the film, because you have a great time watching the film."
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,I think they spend a lot of money doing this movie .........And really is a good movie.
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Well done. This movie did not disappoint.
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Better than I ever imagined! Marvel is kicking DC Comic's butts big-time on the big screen!
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Great addition and collaboration of the modern superheroes and very well done. It is no surprise it has done so well.
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Hulk steal the show...but overall brilliantly acted with great action and deeper character interaction than you might expect...
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,"I know I'm about 5 years late, but I finally watched the Avengers.
 Hats off to Joss Whedon not only on the directing but classic Joss writing. The interspersed hilarious comedic moments within the heavy drama of the moment. All of the action was great there was not a dull moment. The cast did an amazing job. Comic book lovers will love this movie."
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,"The avengers suffers from one major problem: It has absolutely no story, and is completely style over substance. It feels more like a fan service and a showoff of special effects than it does an actual movie with an arc. It's also full of cliché, and it plays everything safe. A little too safe, which makes it all feel like wasted potential for more substantial sequels. 

Another glaring problem is the extremely underdeveloped and uninteresting side characters. The movie obviously tries to make the audience care about the characters, but with so little development put into them, it is hard to take seriously. A lot of the supposedly serious and emotional moments come off as laughable instead of genuine. The screenplay also ignores a lot of the character traits and abilities for the sake of bad jokes and fights between the main characters, obviously to please all fans in every way. The other problem is Loki, the main villain. His motivations are what makes him an uninteresting character, as he really does not have anything special to do. As a villain, he is pretty bad. The only saving grace is Tom Hiddleston, who is undeniably charismatic and entertaining as Loki. 

But with all those problems, one simply cannot deny the extreme entertainment value there is to be found. The last 30 minutes or so are a complete joy to watch, and there is an undeniable chemistry between the actors, who all fit their role very well. It is an excellent movie to watch purely for entertainment, even if it sacrifices what could have made it great for cheap jokes and forced fan-service.

The Avengers is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie. It's not a bad movie per sé, as there is a lot of great action, which doesn't feel as poorly directed as Michael Bay's films. It's the direction of the action sequences that really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like Transformers and G.I. Joe."
"Nov 14, 2012",positive,Absolute top class. What a film!
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Frikn love this movie!!
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Absolutely love this movie! I will see it again!

"Nov 13, 2012",positive,"For an action / comic book flick, this is very enjoyable. Not much depth to the plot but HIGHLY enjoyable on all counts."
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Very good movie even if you havent watched the individual movies that go along
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of 2012
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,"Out of all Marvel Movies that have been produced The Avengers is the best one yet. It is a great movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next. Not only is it a great action movie but the conflict and sarcasm between the characters definitely make you laugh at the same time. This is a great movie to watch with family and friends. Marvel has been making movies about different heroes like Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk for many years now, and they have finally joined together to make The Avengers.
	The Avengers consists of Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, The Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Their commander is Nick Fury. Each one of these characters has a specific set of skills, which is why they were selected to be on the team.  From the beginning all the way to the end of the movie it throws twists. Within the First 5 minutes a member that is on the avengerâ(TM)s gets mind washed to the bad side. The twists in this movie kept my attention the entire time. There was so many different wars going on as one massive war was about to break out. There was Brother against Brother, Selfishness Vs. teamwork, World VS. World, and also friends vs. friends. As I watched this I could see all the different conflicts arising. The best part was watching the conflicts be resolved through different ways. Some was fighting, and some was talking.  This made this movie even better. There was never a moment when something wasnâ(TM)t going on. Every Hero had their own fight in this movie. It showed who they really are. 
	In my personal opinion Iron Man is my favorite character. He is funny throughout the movie, but also selfish. He is a one man type of guy and he doesnâ(TM)t like teamwork. As I watched the movie I noticed Iron Mans attitude changes. He becomes more of a team player as the movie goes on. He also encourages other members. If it was not for Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, the Hulk would not of found out his key on how he can control the monster inside of him. If the Hulk didnâ(TM)t find this out the whole world could have been destroyed as he was a key part in the final battle.
	This movie is a fantastic movie with many details that keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. I highly recommend that you take the time to watch this movie because I would give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars. The only negative to the movie is it would help to watch the movies of the heroes separately before jumping in to them becoming the Avengers. I say this because if you donâ(TM)t have any background on any of the characters you may be confused on who is who and the role they play in the movie. For example if you never watched Thor or read a comic about him you would have no idea who Loci was (Thors adopted brother who is trying to take over earth). If you didnâ(TM)t know who Loci was then you would not understand the entire evil vibe the movie gives off.
	Other than the one and only one negative about the movie, this is a must watch movie. Itâ(TM)s an intense action that involves comedy that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie.  Take the time to watch this movie and I can almost guarantee that you will love it. As you sit and watch the movie all that keeps going through your head is what is going to happen next. The movie grabs the viewersâ(TM) attention right till the beginning all the way to the end. They play the music perfectly so it keeps you thinking and puts you in a mood, but it doesnâ(TM)t overpower the movie. Everything about this movie is amazing and I would definitely take the time to watch it if you have not seen it yet."
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Truly best action movie made.
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Its super amazing to see all of these characters on the screen at the same time.
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,Great movie...loved it!!!
"Nov 13, 2012",positive,"Ugh. It's Joss Whedon and the avengers. 

I need say no more. If you like the idea, you'll love it."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,I really like this movie.
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,best comic book adaptation I ever seen so far. great character driven and storyline plus special effects.
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"It was nicely made, and surprisingly funny. It got a little to chaotic, and I was slightly confused on black widows background, but still a fun movie for everyone in my opinion."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"intense and action-packed (as expected)
what you think this movie is: it is."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon is amazing, i'll just start out by saying that. As a fan of his tragically cut short TV series' ""Firefly"" (as well as it's Whedon film adaptation ""Serenity"") I knew this was going to be good, but my problem going into the film was that I had only seen Iron Man and it's sequel. I only knew who 3 of these charcaters were, and I was slightly worried I wouldn't be able to follow, understand, or care about the other Avengers, but Whedon worked his magic with being able to handle an ensemble cast, and make sure you know and care about each one of these guys! Just only seeing this film, I was able to pick up on, and understand each one of these characters and their stories who I hadn't seen anything of until this film. That in itself is feat. But you take that AND have an awesome story, filled with excitment, excellent humor, epic action, AND Scarlett Johansson!? It was awesome! I don't know anyone who DIDN'T like this film, and it's definitely one of the best Superhero films ever to date. 5/5 GO SEE IT!"
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,Clearly the best superhero movie that's been made. The character depth was incredible and Whedon was genius with knowing how and when to use each hero without 1 overpowering everyone else. A must buy
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,Six superheroes in one movie - what more could you ask for? Except for fine screenplay with loads of action and humor quaranteed.
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is action-packed star studded film was completely and utterly awesome.  The action scenes were very detailed, they went and followed the individual heroes and showed their adventures together and alone.  I really liked that, and how they would throw little funny skits in the middle of a serious event.  The entire movie was great and I don't think that I would change a thing if I could.  I just hope that they will come out with sequel just as great.
	One of the most thrilling action sequences, in my opinion, was the city under attack by Loki's alien army.  This whole section of scenes was zooming in on each character and showing their awesomeness and their ability to work as a true team.  Hulk and Thor took down the flying whale blimp things, and Hawk eye went for the alien fliers.  Captain America, Black Widow, and Iron Man took control of the ground.  Other than that, I believe that most of the other action revolved around Black Widow.  First, time you see her she takes out over four men while tied to a chair; it was spectacular.  She also gets chased by the Hulk, fights her friend Hawk eye, and gets into a psychological argument with Loki.   
	All this action needs some time to laugh.  Iron man was probably the majority of my laughter in this show.  His sarcastic comments aimed at Captain America, intriguing prodding to Dr. Banner, and joking towards Thor. Iron Man says, ""Dr. Banner, your work is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster..."" To Thor he says, ""Shakespeare in the Park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?""   Other funny scenes that really left a impact on me was Hulk.  Hulk and Thor took down the flying blimp monster and then Hulk randomly punched Thor into the wall.  Later, Hulk started throwing Loki around like a rag doll, and walks away saying ""puny god"". Thor says when he first arrives on the flying battleship, ""He's my brother"". Black Widow was he's killed 80 people in 3 days."" ""He's adopted"", says Thor. 
	This movie was beautiful.  It had plenty of thrilling action, good humor, and full-filled my expectations.  I give this movie the best rating possible.  I was a great combination of actors coming together to make an amazing family film."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,Awesome in pretty much every way. Everybody can find a character to love in this movie and the fact that so many heroes are involved doesn't really detract too much from the story development. The action scenes are the best and the humor is what puts the movie over the top for a 5 out 5.
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"Avengers Assemble is truly a blockbuster epic that deserves the billion+ gross it managed to get in box office. 

The film is colourful and fun and is not weighed down with exposition as the universe has already been established and we have already met the characters so we arealready emotionally invested in the story. The movie manages to allow each character to shine in the 2+ hours of running time that it has. Each character makes a valuable contribution and all the actors rise to the challenge of embodying these larger than life characters. 

Tom Hiddleston wows again as the emotionally conflicted Loki although I do feel that Loki doesn't have enough depth to the character which made him so endearing in Thor. However, with what he is given Hiddleston portrays the character with charisma as he embarks on his plan for world domination. 

Avengers doesn't disappoint in the action department and there is explosions aplenty throughout the film. 

Avengers Assemble is a superhero film accomplishment as it seeks to higher the stakes and push comic book movies from being grounded in realism ala The Dark Knight or the X-Men movies into being larger than life and ultimately more comic bookish whilst not being so overt the top that audiences cannot suspend their disbelief for the films duration. 

A wonderful epic that weaves an exciting tale. 

4.5/5  stars"
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was a great well thought out movie. I would have to say it was the best movie of the summer. I didnÃ¢(TM)t really have any negative thoughts towards it, and it never ceased to grab my attention. I was a little worried about how all the main characters were going to interact with each other for meeting for the first time as super heroes and very well known, talented actors that are used to having their own movies. I was quickly surprised at how well all the characters performed together throughout the movie. I enjoyed watching them size one another up the whole movie whether itÃ¢(TM)s Iron Man and Thor ripping each other apart as Loki is watching from above, or the Hulk and Thor destroying the Badass invisible hover command center testing their immortality. I am also very happy to see that for once a movie follows the Comic books.	Mark Ruffalo did a great job at being the new Hulk, and he better be in the next movie. The Hulk is my favorite character by far in the marvel world as he is invincible, ridiculously strong, and only becomes stronger when pissed off. His strength is practically unlimited and I loved the part when the Hulk slammed LokiÃ¢(TM)s body on the ground repeatedly leaving him practically shell shocked on the ground whimpering.  While when the Hulk walked away, he called Loki a Ã¢puny godÃ¢?. Though the movie is very action packed there is a few hilarious parts like when the Hulk punches Thor out of nowhere right after they took down one of the alien ship thing together. Another was when the Hulk tried picking up ThorÃ¢(TM)s hammer and couldnÃ¢(TM)t succeed. Then of course you have Iron man whose random quirky comments are always funny, but it breaks up all the seriousness in the scene. Scarlett does a great job at being the Black Widow because she is a smart and hot fighter; she was able to outwit Loki in their very hateful conversation to find out what heÃ¢(TM)s planning on doing with the Hulk to bring down the command center. 	 After watching this very awesome movie I can say I am highly anticipating a sequel that blows this one out of the water. They could have amped up the story in some ways like give more on how Thor got to earth, and explain more about the Tesseract."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"fun, action packed, great fit with the individual films"
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"When you mix things up, usually things get messy. Yet this movie shows at times it can be a nonstop roller coaster too."
"Nov 12, 2012",neutral,"To put it simply: Marvel's The Avengers does exactly what it's supposed to do.  If you are looking for a big fun comic book movie then you will most likely be delivered exactly what you are looking for.  I give it only a fair rating because I found that after I had seen this flick it quickly faded from my memory and doesn't stand out as anything special despite how well it does its job.  It is, however, a faithful adaptation of the franchise and plenty of good fun."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,"Love this movie hands down one of the best action movies I have seen this year. It was worth the wait. Good acting, funny, with a good but of drama."
"Nov 12, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,Hands down THE BEST super hero team up movie.  DC Comics now have their work cut out for them with The Man of Steel followed by a 'Justice League' movie.  The bar has been set extremely high!
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"I feel that Joss Whedon has done an excellent job in creating a film that is the culmination of some of marvelâ(TM)s biggest heroes. The film does a great job of combining a quality superhero story line with Whedonâ(TM)s witty humor. The way six big super heroes are brought together to fight in order to defend planet earth was masterful. From this movie we get a feel of the previous marvel movies while bringing something entirely new to the table. This is definitely a stand-alone movie in my mind, but it does not hurt to have seen some of the other recent Marvel movies to have an even stronger connection to the characters. Itâ(TM)s tough trying to fit six story lines into just over two hours of film, but in my eyes it could not have been done much better. The fact that the half a dozen heroes were not just fighting to save the earth, but also battling each other at the same time gave much more depth to the story as well as the characters.  Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and all the other stars do a great job in performing as their respected characters and though the storyline is great they each bring something different to the table to add to the films entertainment and quality. Joss Whedon has outdone his previous, very popular, marvel movies with a movie that is not only filled with the action and thrill that you'd expect from a super hero movie, but also depth and strong characters who we really start to root for even when they are at odds with each other. Although two hours and 23 minutes may sound like a long time this film's fast-paced witty entertainment makes time fly. This movie will satisfy action movie fans as well as die hard superhero movies fans. It has a little bit of something for everyone and that's really what makes this movie so popular. All in all when you see this movie you don't have to analyze it to know it is a greatly entertaining movie, but it doesn't hurt that behind it's popularity it is a solid story with strong protagonists and amusing humor.  Whedon has done well for the franchise with his renditions of Marvel heroes and I am looking forward to more iconic films like this one in the future. Keep up the good work, Joss Whedon."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,this movie runs an average of seven to eleven times a week at my house since its been out!!! posted 11-11-12
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"It was OK I suppose. But I left the cinema with the feeling of 'yeah...and?'

Downey Jr is true to form at speaking too quickly and being irritating as Stark, Johanssen and Renner are pointless characters"
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"This movie is pure-popcorn entertainment. It boasts two of the longest sustained action sequences that I can recall for any film (one on the hellicarrier, and one in New York). Though I like the villain Loki, I think his emotional arc was better played out in the movie Thor, thus making him a slightly silly villain in this movie. The most impressive thing about this film is Joss Whedon's script and direction, juggling so many big characters while still keeping the movie comprehendible and entertaining."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,Movie doesn't disappoint in ANY phase. Masterful
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,SFX galore mixed with good balance of comedy and story. Very glad to have seen Thor and captain America relatively closely to  watching this though!
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,The cherry on that Marvel film cake! Fun at the movies returns!:)
"Nov 11, 2012",neutral,Et bien ç'est pas glorieux tout ça...encore un film pour les gosses...merci à Hulk et Scarlett Johansson d'être présent
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,Was better than I thought it would be
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,Funny and entertaining. Good action.
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,simply amazing. Well paced decent backstory filler without over whelming. Easily one of the best
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"I loved this film so much. However, that does not make me blind to its flaws. 

Sticking quite close to the comics, it was pretty much what most people were expecting and was enjoyable. However, trying to equally split up a couple of hours between six protagonists is never easy, especially when a large chunk of your target audience want effects effects, violence, effects, violence, violence and effects. As such, I really saw no point in Captain America in this film, I mean seriously? What did he actually do? The same can be said for Black Widow and Hawkeye.  
Downey Jr, as always, was hilarious, but (also as always) the centre of attention every time he was on screen. I can understand why they did it; Iron Man was the most successful of the films and (at the moment) is the most popular of the Avengers, but it made a job that was always going to be difficult even harder.
Loki was acted convincingly except for the ""mewling quim"" remark which, although amused me greatly that it was allowed into a 12, seemed completely out of no-where. Yes, yes, they were trying to set him up as THE bad guy, but it seemed out of place. 
Thor, let's be honest, was only there to give Loki a reason to attack and to look pretty. (Which he does very well) But hey, at least there was no annoying and pointless romance between Portman and him this time round. 

On to my main point, you do not put Samuel L Jackson in a movie and then give him so little screen time. 

On the whole, I watched the film seven times in the cinema and loved it every time. However, it was a thoroughly flawed film that hid behind its visual effects and relied on most of its audience knowing enough about the original comics and films to fill in some emotional attachment to the characters."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,Currently the greatest superhero movie to date.
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,This IS definatly my favourite film of all time. Excluding the predictable ending (its a marvel movie and lets not forget more kids are into marvel than dc so there not actually gonna kill off an important character like on of the avengers....they might do in the sequel) not a single bit failed to meet my expectations. It was fantastic
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"A fun movie to watch, because providing more comedic approach to superhero movies, unlike movies like The Dark Knight Rises, it's worth watching. If you do not like a 'comedy' superhero movie, then it isn't for you.

Action fills the gaps left by the story, and the acting is great. One of the reasons to watch this movie are the Hulk scenes, no questions asked.

I decided to rate it 4.5/5, because even though I like action, story still is a big part of a movie, which this lacked."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"Excellent film, all character interactions were well played."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,awesome flick!! i wanna grow up and throw people around like the hulk!!! but seriously the avengers is a good movie. very well put together. awesome action! and some humor.
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"If DC can get a Justice League movie this good, I might die happy."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"One of the best films i've ever seen, pure class. Little slow at start as builds up story and the rest of film is just great entertainment"
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"It was the perfect movie, it felt like you don't want it to end. comedy,drama,action, etc. all in one in this one of a kind masterpiece."
"Nov 11, 2012",positive,"This movie set a new standard for Superhero movies. Fun, exciting, dramatic, and attentive to portraying each hero with depth, Avengers is a superb action flick."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"So good, even my 3 yr old loved it."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"This was freaking AMAZING!!!! The cast, the story, the music, EVERYTHING! Loved every minute of it. It was one of those movies that left me feeling all amped up & ready to save the world! It's always a good sign when you leave the theater with the message & mood of the movie. Super super awesome!"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,Iron man's the bomb!!
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Well now see I'd have loved this movie to the moon and back if it hadn't been for:
1. The hulk sulk. Throughout the movie. YES you have a problem, YES it's not exactly fun and crackers but GEEZ, get over yourself already.
2. Black Widow and Hawkeye were in the film for what reason?
3. Captain America - sanctimonious much?
4. I thought they were meant to be action scenes not Action epic dramas! Cut those battles to a third of their length and they'd still have been a tad too long. Look! He hit a monster! Oh and another one! And another and another and another and... suddenly a colon irrigation sounds more fun. 

So a good movie, some nice laughs, but not as awesomely wow as it was made out to be."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"A Great, Crossover film. Marvel has done a really great job with this year's blockbuster!"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"eith the complex cast and player, Joss whedon is able to direct them effectively. the plot is simple, every character developed effectively..Cant wait for the sequel.."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"My ultimate confession: I saw this entertaining garbage at the theater. Whedon is an overrated douchebag but I won't neglect his intelligence at establishing a specific fan base with stupidities like Firefly and Serenity and adding it to the enthusiasm that the already hyped world audiences were feeling. It's Michael Bay with better orchestrated CGI. Wow, that's just... the perfect homo-economicus strategy. Go back to Final Fantasy: Advent Children and see how this business is really run!

66/100"
"Nov 10, 2012",negative,"boring, boring, boring. my brain cells stopped working for low activity required on this shitty movie. I never slept so good in a movie theater. I will recommend this movie to my enemies"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,one graet action packed movie loved this movie id see it again and again
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,This was very entertaining.  Enjoyed it alot!
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Great Actions set pieces, but it lacks a strong story."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"I thought that one movie with this many unique character stories and personalities and stories would try and do too much and in turn fail miserably. I was pleasantly surprised to see I was completely wrong. This has a well-constructed story that successfully brings together all of these superheroes in an effective manner and offers a nice dynamic as they struggle with their egos to come together and work as a team. The villain is good and is actually formidable enough and merit putting this dream team together. It is a long movie but it never feels like it drags or seems overly long. It successfully avoids stepping on itself by contradicting earlier set ups and pervious movies, a task that was not as easy as it sounds. We were familiar with most of the loaded cast from previous movies but they work even better when they share the stage as a team. This movie has a great soundtrack, a strong cast, good direction, quality special effects, and a solid story to make it stand out as a special superhero movie."
"Nov 10, 2012",neutral,"The Avengers is not told by an idiot, but it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But that nothing is nonetheless everything. What Marvel and Joss Whedon's grandiose, overstuffed airborne beast of a superhero ur-movie signifies is the feverish daydream of an American mass culture entirely unmoored from the necessitous advantages of signification. It is epochal, in its way, for its times. But that is not to say that it is, in the narrowest sense, good or bad. It stamps such distinctions into the dirty earth. As a film, it does not seduce or persuade or convince. It tramples.

To kvetch so about The Avengers's lack of underlying meaning is to be a hopeless bore. So let's be hopeless, though hopefully not boring: for all there is to recommend it, I cannot. Or rather, there isn't any point in recommending it or not, which is the exact problem. The Avengers is not merely post-criticism (this concept might sound like a good thing to many, but then it sounded pretty good to Stalin, too). It is - in its elaborate, all-encompassing, inevitable dominance - post-ideology. Slavoj Zizek said in a recent television appearance that ideology functions even if you don't believe in it, but even this gnomic inverted-donut Slovenian Marxist-Lacanian logic is no match for The Avengers. Thought crumbles in the face of its enormity. Faith is not even in the conversation. It's pointless to even criticize it as a simple overblown corporate product, although it is one. Its fundamental commodification explodes, reconstitutes itself from the energy of the blast, then implodes until nothing is left to grasp onto. It is a mystery, wrapped loosely in an enigma, reclining on a bed of money, oysters, and looted art, inviting us puny mortals to lick its toes. And who are we to say no?

If these issues seem tenuously drawn or overly theoretical, it's because a traditional critical dissection of the film's cinematic parts cannot avail us in comprehending the excessive lack before our eyes. By all the terms by which we ought to understand the movies, The Avengers is a wild success. Presaged by no less than five previous superhero films, it represents an ambitious culmination of the translation of comic-book storytelling form into motion pictures, for good or for ill. If Whedon has no particular style worth pointing out as a filmmaker, then he gladly indulges in destructive visual fantasies of gigantic scope like a good Hollywood sport and a well-versed comics fanatic. In particular, extended action and battle sequences aboard a secret security agency's flying aircraft carrier (your tax dollars at work, America!) and in midtown Manhattan are grand and exhausting exercises in violent vision.

Additionally, because this is Joss Whedon working from his own script, every character banters fluently in Whedonspeak, which is sometimes amusing in its witty inertia but just as frequently oddly defamiliarizing and capable of pulling us out of the moment. And The Avengers exists in nothing but the moment, ultimately, so allowing the audience to be yanked out of it doesn't work out in its favour very often. Whedon's cadre of actors are happy to meld into the larger picture and grab at their own moments here and there. Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo have some nice beats together as Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark and Bruce Banner (the Incredible Hulk may never catch on with audiences in his own flick, but is compelling in small doses here and gets one of the best gratuitous violence gags with Tom Hiddleston's villainous Loki), and Chris Hemsworth's buff Thor is a magnetic, laconic delight again. Most of the other actors fill the eye-candy role (although Jeremy Renner needs a non-action role or two but quick to avoid career stagnation) and serve some useful function in the plot, which, for all of its reliance on a shiny MacGuffin (the Tesseract, or something), is very much constructed with interlocking intetionality.

By any measure, then, The Avengers was a triumphant commercial success and is perhaps an aesthetic one as well, at least in its given context of cryogenically-preserved eternal male adolescence. But if this exquisitely-mounted pile of absorbing emptiness qualifies as a success, of what use can the term be to us anymore? This movie represents ""success"" in the post-millenial sense that has given us hedge-fund billionaires and reality-show debutants and very nearly President Mitt Romney. It's not that The Avengers itself is terrible; it's just that, in its undeniable accomplishment, it embodies a particular economic, cultural, and social context that is terrible. ""Terrible"" in the anachronistic meaning of great, imposing, and irresistible. Alternately, one could employ ""awesome"", and not in the sense that the word was used by the movie's fanboy target audience, which it seems to have thoroughly conquered. The Avengers, as its smug, snobbish demigod villain does at one point (in Germany, of all places), invites us to bow down to its superiority because that is our nature as pathetic humanoids. Unable to fathom disappointing the film in all its impressive glory, we obeyed. And perhaps that says as much about us as it does about the movie."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Totally good casting, great special effects and a neat story make this a powerhouse and it doesn't ruin the effect Joss wanted"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was Incredible :)

RDJ was his usual weirdly funny/comical Iron Man. Post-rehab (hopefully the last & final one) I feel that he plays the same character in multiple roles/costumes? Imagine Iron Man with a British accent like Sherlock & Sherlock wearing an Iron Man...and it fit, perfectly :D

The no-bromance-bromance between the Hulk & Thor was hilarious! 

Blockbuster with high repeat-value! Must watch."
"Nov 10, 2012",negative,Over hyped dullness.
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Hands down one of the best superhero movies made!  With an excellent ensemble cast, The Avengers is everything you want in a blockbuster movie.  The performances by Downey & Ruffalo were very good, and the story did a good job of focusing on the individual characters, and they became Marvel's best team.  Check it out!"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,Why is captain America in this movie? Also...Thor...mmmmm.
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,Fantastically brilliant!
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,One of my favorite movies
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Surprisingly good, minus one point though because Samuel l Jackson is in it."
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"boring at first but from mid to the end, they make you don't want to blink even for a sec..:D"
"Nov 10, 2012",positive,"Only supplanted by The Dark Knight Rises as top movie of 2012 in my opinion, this film had my attention from the start. I was curious to see how each character was going to be handled, and if each would receive a fair amount of screen time. This aspect was handled flawlessly. Bring on Thanos!"
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,One of the best Marvel movies ever made!
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,"Awesome.  Enjoyed it immensely.  Best quote: ""Puny god."" -- The Hulk"
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,BEST Superhero Movie Combination
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,Moral: Super hero's must cooperate. Excellent action and special effects
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,"Whedon captures lighting in a bottle with a movie that blends action, humor, good character development, and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable."
"Nov 9, 2012",neutral,"Nothing compared to the Dark Knight. The Avengers takes a different approach to the adaption of comics. It brings a humorous side of Ironman and the action of Captain America. A fun and explosive blockbuster but in terms of cinematic pleasure, The Avengers is in no way an amazement. It's full of unneeded blasts of huge buildings and needless action. Overall, a great blockbuster to see that brings respect back to the Hulk."
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,Great! Can't wait for the rest of the Marvel movies!
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,It was an outstanding film I have seen it 3 times and want it for Christmas
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,"This movie has everything a summer blockbuster should have. Great characters, dialogue that is great when it takes itself seriously or lightly, and of course plenty of action."
"Nov 9, 2012",positive,This was entertaining as shiznitz. I loved everything about it and didn't even have to use my brain once. There's some avesome laughs too.
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,"Just watched, obviously was majorly hyped up. Thought the story was food considering they had to combine a bunch of characters and develop new ones. Some of the humor was funny some was cheesy, I just wish there was more action scenes...."
"Nov 8, 2012",neutral,"It's confusing, Joss Whedon is touted as a writer with ingenuity after making ""Firefly"" and ""Cabin in the Woods""... so why is ""The Avengers"" so awfully predictable?"
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,"Starts off slow but once all the gang come together take a deep breath because the action never stops, great effects mixed with good humour."
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,i'm not that big on Avengers but i must say this movie was great  and well put together  kept me entertained through out  its must see for all you Marval fans..
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,It's hard to make a more entertaining movie. Super in 3D!
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,loads of action more to come i hope
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,"Very good, not transformery and actually very funny"
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,Really enjoy this movie!
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,A big collection of the heros.
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,"I was expecting it to be an absolute perfect film, knowing that I love these types of films, but unfortunately I was not met with that. Overall an incredible superhero film though."
"Nov 8, 2012",neutral,"The film has it all: wits, action, superheroes, visual effects, villain, a kick-ass Robin (HIMYM), and a cameo of Stan Lee. Sum it all up and you'll find yourself a box-office hit action film . . . but the usual kind where the film comes off as ""overrated"" and ""foreseeable"""
"Nov 8, 2012",positive,"Love the battle, fight scenes! The ending where all 7 fight as one to fight off enemies is my best part of the movie!!!!!!!!!"
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,Good movie...Love Thor..
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,Good movie. Gets a little slow for having so many superheroes. For me the best parts were the ones with the Hulk.
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,My brother loved it. I felt it was pretty good but I would have liked it if they would have already had the story's for hawk eye and black widow out before they put this movie out.
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,"First thing I'm gonna say about this movie, it is a MUST-SEE in the theater. This movie was actually a lot bigger than I thought it would be. They actually had lines for it, it was crazy. Going in, I will admit I had some doubts about this one, after all, Hollywood sure ain't what it used to be. But I was very pleased with this film, and pleasantly surprised as it turned to be far better than I expected. Lots and LOTS of good action throughout, along with a good storyline, awesome characters that clash when they are all put together at first, and then later learn to work together as a team to fight one of the baddest villains I've seen in a while. You can't get much more epic than this group of superheroes. I never read the comics or saw the tv shows, but this is one EPIC movie. Lots of humor in this one too, but not too much to overshadow the film itself. All around, GREAT movie! If you somehow missed seeing this in the theater, then am I ever sorry."
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,"If your a fan of Marvel Comics or superhero comics in general then this is your wet dream this year, however, if like me your not that fussed on marvel/comics then it is an enjoyable hi-octane action movie with the usual predictable action film plot, I wouldn't pay to watch it again but I would watch if it was on the television."
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,"I thought the Avengers was probably one of the best superhero movies ever made. Good effects, the acting was amazing, and the plot was spectacualer."
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,One word Magnafuckingriffic
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,Glad to see they got the Hulk right.
"Nov 7, 2012",positive,Not bad film can't wait for the Nxt one
"Nov 7, 2012",neutral,"The most that ""The Avengers"" manages to get off the ground is their falling base, which I must confess was a wonderfully executed and exciting scene. One of the few praises I can give this film. My problems? The pre-established characters are the same (as in undeveloped) or, in some cases, just plain unlikable (Whedon's tendency to use snark instead of development doesn't help). The new character(s) are put aside, making it very hard to connect with them. The climax, which was hyped up prior to release, is disappointing and plain predictable. You've established (most of) these characters with other films. Now that you have them all in one place, do something with them."
"Nov 6, 2012",negative,Couldn't get past the first scene. WHAT IS A TESSERACT? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT IS THIS PLACE? WHY? WHY? WHY? et al. Basically breaks every rule of filmmaking and storytelling that I hold dear.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,More than I could have hoped for. This is the film that brought back my hope in group superhero movies after the disappointment that was the X-Men franchise.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,love it seen it 3 times in 2 days
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,Not only thrilling and intriguing but so hilarious at all the right moments.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,"Very entertaining movie! I like lots hero unite in one movie, it's like u collect lots DVD and play it at once..good story too, good effect, I think the scene are flawless"
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,Loved it! Put it together Really well exept one thing: The person that did the hulk should still be the guy from the original film.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,96% of the audience liked it. The other 4% need to go watch Christian Bale climb out of a hole for a hour again.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,"As a whole, the film fulfils almost every expectation that any fan could have had. It is a magnificent spectacle, with an enviable cast and it fully delivers. Unfortunately the story is hardly revolutionary, but did we ever want it to be?"
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,"As a whole, the film fulfils almost every expectation that any fan could have had. It is a magnificent spectacle, with an enviable cast and it fully delivers. Unfortunately the story is hardly revolutionary, but did we ever want it to be?"
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,Awesome movie if you haven't seen it do! I love the whole story and how it connects to captain America. The only down side is I think they push to hard for comedy they don't need other than that I love it
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,"The Avengers delivers. The film is solid, and the characters, although are depicted more as squabbling, complacent heroes up at the front, still entertains the audience. The only problem is, Avengers did not tug at my heart. I received a simple moral message from it, but I derived nothing else that really impacted."
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,This movie had some of my favourite marvel characters. Everyone interacted with the others the way you think they actually would. This movie was just amazing.
"Nov 6, 2012",positive,"Oh, so that's what all the hype was about."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Great Action from beginning till end.  Amazing special effects, and a great mix of super hero characters.  Only thing not too attractive was the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as a super-assassin.  Otherwise, very smart and genuine.  Great super hero action film."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Marvel did a good job of making the individual movies leading up to ""The Avengers"" that it was pretty hard to fuck up. Even if it meant getting critical darling but commercially unsuccessful Joss Whedon to direct the get-together extravaganza. The dialogue may be campy, and the story is utterly predictable as well. But it is a lot of fun, and you'll get a lot more out of it by watching all the previous films. Newcomers will be scratching their heads a lot, but the explosions and fights make up for it very well."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,beefy hot super heros and good acting can't go wrong :)
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie, some of the lines were corny comedy but they really made it work because it balanced out all the intense action scenes. Robert Downey Jr. was phenomenal in his role as Iron Man and i believe this will be one of the top films of the year 2012!"
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"A fun and highly energetic superhero flick that, although i had great doubts, works surprisingly well.  Given by now that almost everyone has seen this superb blockbuster, I won't go into any plot details, but I will say this, The Avengers is one of the most tightly scripted and enthusiastically produced films that i have ever seen.  The production value was high, but it was obviously put to good use as every cent shows up on the screen of this ambitious action extravaganza.  Those looking for intense action, grande visuals, and a thrilling ride will have to look no further.  All the superheros play off each other superbly, the signature humor of the past Marvel iterations is bumped up a few notches (but not so much so that the film becomes a silly testing grounds), and the creativity that Whedon brings is on full effect here, taking the crown of summer blockbuster with ease.

With that said, the film holds little to no emotional context as one would come to expect, and there are a few holes within the film's plot that are noticeable after two showings.  Still, The Avengers is one of the funnest times I've had as a movie goer in quite some time.  Definitely one of the greatest superhero flicks to ever grace the screens.  A heroic spectacle of the largest measures!"
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Going in skeptical of another heartless, action-saturated hero flick, I was blown away by the reach and resonance of the film. It has all the elements of a typical superhero story, but its execution took me by surprise even at the expected plot points."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Great Movie, now I see why everyone raved about it!"
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,Best Movie I have seen in my Life but I am sure Avengers 2 will be better
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,Awesome movie ill will be watching it again soon
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"They must have had a ball making this. Make a big jug of Margaritas, grab a slab of chocolate, a couple of friends, whack this on and crank up the volume."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Waited years for this movie and it exceeded every expectation and then some. Fantastic performances especially from its lead villain. If there ever was a movie you had to see, this is it."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"A familiar superhero film with visual effects, ensemble cast...but The Avengers delivers some more laughter and a great cast"
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"pas trop mal, un peu long sur la fin..."
"Nov 5, 2012",positive,"Reflecting over the 'Blockbuster' season of 2012 - despite the release of the forthcoming 'The Hobbit' - it's safe to say that 'Marvel's The Avengers' will take the crown for the biggest and most successful film of the year. Besides the likes of 'The Dark Knight Rises,' the hype for the first assemble of Marvel's beloved heroes was unparalleled. Beginning with the success of 'Iron Man' and Nick Fury's final comments ""I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative,"" the hype began to build. With the additional efforts of 'Thor,' 'Captain America' and the continual drip feeding provided from the after credit sequences; all that was left to do was to assemble each individual into one juggernaut. In terms of 'Blockbuster,' the film ultimately succeeds in providing the balance of entertainment and laughter while still containing the essence of the Marvel universe. Despite such virtues, the film is all formula; not even attempting to challenge the generics and continually injecting comic relief to the point that the characters actions becomes tedious and robotic - Explosion, laughter, explosion, laughter. But maybe I am being too harsh? Well, what I mean say is that I don't think 'The Avengers' wants challenge the generics, and maybe it doesn't have to. The film simply wants to display a universe that does not crumble around the structure and accumulation of such grandeur characters. Thankfully, due to Joss Whedon's screenplay, the film juggles six separate superheroes with a sense of exhilarating ease, which is an achievement in itself."
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Awesome entertainment!
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"This has to be one of the best superhero films of all time hands down.

The fantastic performance from the whole cast is quite incredible. With none of the characters felling minor or major respectively. The new cast member of Jeremy Renner's hawke-eye is probably the weakest of all of the character's but still dose not feel to weak that he comes boring so to speak.

This is defiantly the credit of the director Joss Whedon who blends all of the characters to perfect balance and also proves that the team is not ""Tony Stark and co"". All of the characters have there moment as the hero of the moment which is great to see.Although full off plenty of plot holes the film is a whirlwind ride while watching it and once leaving the cinema you can only ask for more, more and more."
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"Hilarious, witty, and on key all the way"
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,loved it! also got it dvd
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"This movie is flat-out-fun! It is one of the best super hero movies I have ever seen! The film moves along at a quick clip, as the back stories of the characters have already been addressed in previous films. We move right into witty dialogue and action, there is rarely a dull moment. Big super hero flicks tend to have a fair amount of cheese; but this one manages to keep it minimal. The writer and director manage to give the impression that the characters might actually be in real danger - you aren't always certain any one of them is going to make it to the next scene. There is suspense, comedy, and action by the bucket-loads. If you are a fan of action or super hero flicks, then your money and time will be well spent."
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,My favourite part is when hulk smashes loggy in the ground a bunch of times
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,And then there was this...!
"Nov 4, 2012",negative,It's got explosions!
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Flat out awesome. Incredible wrap in of so many characters. The dynamic of all these guys together is off the charts. Then they throw in a few extras. A revisioning of the Hulk and Hawkeye. It has been the best film I have seen in the theatres since Lord of the Rings. It is clean and funny and definitly woth seeing.
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"One of the most fun, action packed movies I have  ever seen. Got to Watch it!"
"Nov 4, 2012",negative,I have no idea why everyo loves this movie.  I thought it sucked.
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,would like to see it again
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Along with the 1st Iron Man- A shining example of what a fun superhero movie should be.
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"There's no scenario where Joss Whedon gets the credit he deserves for The Avengers. Certainly he'll be lauded for the cash this box-office bogart is already piling up, and critics seem impressed enough with the film to plant it firmly in the upper echelon of ""comic book"" movies. But the success Whedon has achieved is far loftier than that, encompassing years of Marvel canon, hoards of characters beloved to fans, and unparalleled expectations. Put another way: making this movie was an unprecedented challenge. And The Avengers isn't perfect, though that was never really an option in the first place; there are far too many elements that would have to be handled flawlessly, far too much scrutiny from far too many directions to ever truly be called ""perfect."" It is, however, as good as it was ever going to be, and considering the circumstances, that's pretty damn good.

The Avengers kicks off with the villanous Loki (Tom Hiddleston)-last seen falling through a wormhole at the end of Thor-stealing the arcane and apparently dangerous Tesseract. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), appreciating the threat this combination poses to the planet, sets in motion the Avengers Initiative, calling together Earth's Mightiest Heroes to protect her: Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Not surprisingly this collection of super-powered personalities struggles to fuse, resulting in a variety of heated discourse, sharp-tongued invectives, and punching.

What fans of the comic book (ideally, fans everywhere) are going to appreciate most is Whedon's ability to maintain these characters' personalities. It's not overstating anything to reiterate just how wildly difficult this movie was to make. There are, frankly, an absurd number of characters to keep track of, and that's just in making sure the audience knows what's going on. The task of building these characters, and their relationships, and their ability to work as a cohesive (and believable) unit in battle? Coupled with the inevitable heat that comes when you reprocess cherished source material? That is a job very, very few individuals could handle. Yet Whedon, in his first stint with a feature Marvel production, does the job quite well. Certainly Avengers will be remembered for its bombast (as it should, which I'll get to momentarily), but there's no shortage of subtlety in the characters and relationships. Whether it's Cap's old-school patriotism vs. Iron Man's contemporary egoism, or Hawkeye's brash militarism contrasting Widow's expert manipulation, Whedon makes it startlingly clear just how deeply he understands the characters he's wielding. And that deep understanding isn't just apparent in the discourse, but the action as well. Which brings us to the climax of The Avengers...

At a basic level, all of these Marvel films are about the live-action portrayal of characters who, while built around visual dynamism, are generally restricted to the static two-dimensionality of a comic book page (and please, don't let that read as slander, for I am now, and always will be a huge comic book fan). Seeing Iron Man fly for the first time is thrilling in a way that can't really be matched, and if you can add to that some strong character moments and a despicable villain, you're set. But this is a collection of unique characters with unique abilities. The clear challenge then for Whedon-specifically in approaching The Avengers from an action standpoint-is how to maintain these characters' unique personalities within a battle. Well, rest assured, as Joss proves more than equal to this task as well. In the film's 40 minute climax, the role each of these characters plays as a member of a team is beautifully articulated: Iron Man is the mind, Hulk and Thor the big guns, Hawkeye the steady-handed vet, Widow the sly warrior, and Cap, quite crucially, as the leader. And not only do Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn clearly define these roles within, perhaps, one of the best extended action sequences ever put to film, but they somehow do it organically, allowing the characters to develop and grow together as the world crumbles around them. While there's never any fear that the Earth will actually be destroyed, there is nonetheless a reasonable question mark surrounding how six individuals-and three of them plain ol' humans!-could possibly save it. Yet when it's all said and done, nothing about the film's conclusion or the way this team comes together feels false. In fact, the final set piece of The Avengers is probably Marvel's best cinematic moment to date.

As I said, the film's not perfect. There's some awkward dialogue and squeaky exchanges. Mark Ruffalo is great, but it's hard not to imagine Ed Norton being just as good (if not better). And for whatever reason, Samuel L. seems to be mailing this one in, which is a shame; Nick Fury could have been a fantastic character. But besides these smallish missteps-which we've frankly grown accustomed to in our summer movies anyway-The Avengers is a thoroughly successful achievement on a grand scale. It is well-written, well-acted, and breathtaking from a visual standpoint, but more than all that, it's just a lot of fun. It's the sort of film you want to watch over and over again, because of all the stuff you know you missed. And while Joss Whedon seems destined to always fly just a little under the radar, his name is going to get quite a bit more mileage than he's used to in the coming months."
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"A fun popcorn movie, but people need to settle down about this movie."
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Greatest superhero movie ever.
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Well done.  Iron Man continues to steal the show.  We just need Thor to toughen up a little; Captain America to stay frozen; and Lou Ferigno to come back because he always gives 110%.
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,Loved this movie! I could watch it over and over again.
"Nov 4, 2012",neutral,Definitely not a chick flick
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,"Action-packed and full to the brim with A-list stars, Avengers Assemble is a great summer blockbuster which would be perfect if it weren't for a collection of tedious scenes - Act 2 is where the film suffers, yet Act 3 is where it picks itself back up again, delivering an exceptional climax. Justice League of America watch out."
"Nov 4, 2012",negative,"Why is one supposed to write a rational, logical review on an illogical, irrational movie with no connection to human beings. This movie is utter rubbish. Special effects are interesting, but can be incorporated into any movie. Why not make an incoherent movie with disconnected sequence of special effects?"
"Nov 4, 2012",positive,By far the best Superhero movie I have ever seen! and was super funny! Cant Wait to watch it again and again!
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised by just how well this movie played out. Never before had I been so overwhelmed with such good plot twists.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Best movie the hulk is beast in it
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"cast=A+
script=A real funny like other marvel films
action=A
special effects=A+ some of the best ive seen
villain=B+ probally the lowest part loki is kinda getting old but hiddleston still was great anough to keep me feeling like he is a threat to them the alien army was like useless pawns"
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Nonstop thrill ride.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Simply one of the best movies in 2012. It has amzing graphics and breathtaking special effects
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Awesome action packed w some funny bits added to it.. Really great entertaining movie
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"Although I am giving this 4 1/2 STARS, I am STILL more with Batman & DC Comics!!! I am very disappointed that Warner Bros. & DC Comics could have released a Justice League live-action film at least five years before Walt Disney Motion Pictures & MARVEL released this film. I am sure they (and I) are having the ""Sputnik Syndrome""."
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"awwwsome has everything comedy, action and story"
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"After seeing a couple of disapointing Marvel movies, I finally got to see not only one of favorite film of 2012, but my favorite superhero movie of all time!  Almost all the marvel heroes are finally together in this epic film!  It's funny and its one heck of a rollar coaster ride.  Sure, its a really long film, but I never got bored of it.  When the movie was over, I wanted to see more of it."
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"Loved this, was right up my street."
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,This was more than a decent romp and well worth a watch. if you're a sci-fi or comic book fan I would say it's a must watch! Enjoyed it so much I'm sorry I didn't get round to watching Captain America.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Mildly entertaining would not watch again
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Not a bad popcorn flick but it lacks the substance to make it truly great. Maybe Iron Man 3's darker tone will have influence on the Avengers' second outing.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,The hulk basically made that movie.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,It was a good ok movie it was more of an Iron man Hulk movie but I can't wait for the sequel
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,What a visual treat! Best Marvel movie so far.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,It was an amazing superhero movie! Better than I thought it would be. Some parts were boring though.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Pretty close to a perfect super hero action movie. Extremely close.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Great movie....loved the Hulk-Loki thing.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,Amazing!! Marvel's best movie.
"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"Best superhero movie of the year, hands down!"

"Nov 3, 2012",positive,"Simplistic. A double-edged sword which works out for character development, plot and ""the movie-going experience"" , and yet after watching, the film still lacks an unknown element, but a great film nonetheless."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"This movie is awesome.  It's kept from being epic by lack of a worth-while enemy, but believe me, it's awesome."
"Nov 2, 2012",neutral,"The film has a bad history, but a good development."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Good action movie, 92% not way"
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Despite suffering from a slow start, The Avengers delivers excellently as soon as it gets into its groove. Whedon has created a wonderful script, that never fails to underdeliver on humour, action or excitement. The best thing is the fact that Whedon makes superheroes appealing and relatable to everyone, definitely no mean feat."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Es una pelicula spectacularrrrrrr! Of course not of the 250 best films in the world; but a quality action flick. Also, the Avengers eating shoarma is the best final shot of a an action film I've ever seen."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Just about everything you could want in a film, and a bonus for having no cheesy dialogue and a bunch of actors/actresses all eager to recite every line as if the academy is considering them for an Oscar.  Awesome flick - can't wait for more."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. Marcel did a great job with Iron Man leading the way. I would like a better Cap but oh well. He dont really seem like the leadership guy.
"Nov 2, 2012",negative,"1 minute of trite dialogue, 30 mins of trite fight scenes. Sam Jackson is given one line dialogue (probably because that's all he can handle) such as, ""Hey we don't come to your planet and blow stuff up!"" ""Talk to me.""  Lame from start to finish!"
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"It was decent, took a while to build up. Overall good movie."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Enjoyable, but over-hyped. There's something about it's enjoyable blandness, that helped it make a lot of money."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"Best value for my $ in years,cost me 98$ for tux n concessions for four.I would have paid double that.I just paid 90$ to take the fam to Cloud Atlas and I left feeling like I've been hoodwinked..it fits all genre's. comedy,sci-fi,drama,action,suspense..must see"
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"The movie that Marvel has been building up to several films in advance - and it does not let you down. It seems Marvel has actually aimed to perfect its art. Through the dismal Fantastic Four series and the mediochre X-men and Spider-man franchises to the positive surprises of Iron Man and Captain America - and this! This is how comic book adaptations should be made. While the movie might drag slightly when each hero is dutifully given his'er due screen time, the overall result is near flawless in its genre. One of the best super hero movies out there."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"I don't get the hype. Yeah the action is great but most the characters are so unlikeable. And this is brought over from their solo films too. To me, Capt. Is the only one to cheer for. Ever."
"Nov 2, 2012",positive,"This is officially atop my all time favorites list. solid story, superb acting, non-stop action. a pure action flick!"

"Nov 2, 2012",positive,Easily one of the best movies of 2012. I think the big green guy steals the film.
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this far more than I expected to. It has a lot of fast paced action, an interesting storyline and some great comedic moments. Robert Downey, Jr. totally ruled the movie as Iron Man however Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has some terrific moments. The two extra clips at the end were fun-one dramatic and one hilarious."
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,Probably the most fun  action movie I've ever seen. loved it!

"Nov 1, 2012",positive,Awesome movie overall. Whedon did a good job and the special effects were great! I think they are making a second which I will gladly see. One of the best Marvel movies.
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,And they said Disney buying Marvel was a Bad idea.
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,Still looking for words to describe - 100% cinema - instant popcorn feeling! You Think it's the showdown - nope that's what this movie does from start to end. And on the technical side: Picture and sound are perfect - this is the right software to test drive your system to the limit. THX Ultra 2 recommended

"Nov 1, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic movies ever made! Although the story had its holes, it was just what it needed to be.

"Nov 1, 2012",positive,"Enjoyable movie with characters that actually have personalities (for the most part) instead of relying solely on the audience just knowing them as superheroes. They actually made the Hulk an interesting character. That said, I have literally no idea why this movie made everybody crap their pants..."
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,This was my favorite movie of the year so far! I actually watched this first before any of the individual movies so once I saw this in theaters I had to go home and watch all the ones before.

"Nov 1, 2012",positive,It was a good film.  Wish there'd been a story in there somewhere.  I miss the heart of Thor and the wit of the original Iron Man.  This one felt more like the explosionfest that was Iron Man 2 with better writing.
"Nov 1, 2012",negative,"A get together of superheroes should have been set more entertainingly. When you don't have a story good enough, even a lot of superheroes fail to keep you hooked. The Aviator might have sounded exciting on paper, but what I watched was a let-down. I take consolation in knowing that it worked out for the majority of its audience (purely going by the ratings shown here). Can't wait for the sequel!!! With all due respect, 1/5 sounds fair enough for the experience. Miss the good old days wherein I can picture myself enjoying this sort of movie."
"Nov 1, 2012",positive,"Marvel Studioâ(TM)s action packed superhero film The Avengers, summerâ(TM)s biggest movie premiere, lives up to the expectations that were placed on the movie, but misses in terms of a great central plot. While the movie was a huge success, especially at putting multiple heroes into one movie, the movie lacked a strong plot. When watching an action movie we suspect that things will be blown up, which is exactly what happens for a good part of the movie. The plot of the superheroes unwilling to come together to fight an alien race from taking over the world could have been expanded, rather than spending half of the movie destroying New York City. The plot of The Avengers may have been weaker than expected, but in no way does it disappoint movie goers with its star-studded cast and action packed pace. Not only is the movie a must watch, but a must have on DVD, Blu-Ray may be a better choice, where the sounds of the action is intensified, and the quality of the movie is better detailed.
	The cast composed of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston, was a bunch of actors and an actress brought together to make this superhero movie a success. Usually superhero movies focus on one character, with the exception of the X-Men series another Marvel Studio Production, because the stage time is not enough to suitably cover more. What makes it different is that while  X-Men is consider a team in the Marvel Comic series, The Avengers is more of a handful of individual superheroes forced to come together. It makes The Avengers a little more difficult to give each superhero the time needed to tell the story of the character. Joss Whedon, the director of the film, brilliantly makes sure that each character shares the screen time, and he puts the characters in a situation that would fit the person of the character.
	While I felt that the chemistry of the cast showed throughout the film as the acting was very well rounded. They seemed to play the part of the character very well, and each complimented one another. Each actor and actress played a huge role in the film, but I felt that Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston did not completely live up to the role I had imagined and which the movie demanded him to play. While Lokiâ(TM)s character in Marvelâ(TM)s earlier film Thor was more mild mannered, The Avengers demanded him to be more dark. Even though Tom Hiddleston for the most part played the character well, I thought that he could have made the character Loki someone to fear which we all had imagined he would do. Though Tom Hiddlestonâ(TM)s performance was mediocre, the well-rounded cast was more than enough to enable the superhero movie to be a success.
	Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers comic series was a common backbone of the reference for The Avengers. In the comic series the main characters based upon were the four main characters of The Avengers movie. The comparison was strengthened by the fact that the first villain faced by the Avengers was Loki. While the comic book series and movie had plenty of commonalities in the movie, it definitely missed on some parts. In the comic book series the Avengers consisted of a few more superheroes that werenâ(TM)t included in the movie, Ant-man and Wasp. When the movie was in production it was speculated that they would introduce the last two characters during the film. After Marvel announced that they wouldnâ(TM)t be in the movie, the Avengers team didnâ(TM)t seem as complete as it should have been, as many were hoping to see the complete team. While the addition could have made the movie much better, the effort to introduce such characters would have dragged out the showing time, which could have had the audience sit through another hour of the film.
	While sitting through the film, I couldnâ(TM)t help but notice the bland plot that surrounded the movie. The plot focused too much time on its action packed scenes rather than on character development. The explanation provided for the creation of the Avengers team is espionage organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D. The leader or director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, brings the team together in hopes that they will be able to put aside their differences of working together, and defend the Earth from the incoming alien invasion. The antagonist and leader of the alien invasion is Loki, the brother of Thor, who was exiled from his home and is now working with an alien race to invade Earth and become its ruler. The Avengers had to somehow put their egos aside and work together. For example, Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., always works alone. There is a brief conversation in the film where Iron Man states, âI thought I didnâ(TM)t qualify. I was considered, what was it? Volatile, self-obsessed, and that I donâ(TM)t play well with othersâ? (The Avengers 23:20). It is well evident that in the first hour of the movie that the conflict was how the superheroes would be able to work together. They rally behind the death of one of their comrades and finally set aside their differences. As one might predict, they destroy the alien fleet along with Loki and save the Earth from destruction.
	While the plot seemed very interesting, I thought that it was not strong enough to support the movie. The audience should be compelled or moved by the climax, twists and turns in the film. While the action scenes were very entertaining, focusing more on the characters would have made the movie a lot better. For example, Christopher Nolanâ(TM)s The Dark Knight Rises another summer hit, about the comic book character Batman, focuses on the world of Batman and his surroundings giving the plot of the film not only a good side but a dark side. Nolan based the plot around the character of Batman, while The Avengers at times moved away from characters and emphasized action a lot more. While the action was mainly the talk of the movie and how the superheroes work together, I think if the movie focused more on the team, then we would be talking about the superheroes rather than the action.
	Nevertheless The Avengers serves as a stepping stone for superhero movies. The Avengers did not disappoint in pure entertainment. From the movie goerâ(TM)s point of view who wouldnâ(TM)t love to see stuff blow up with your favorite superheroes, itâ(TM)s like a comic book readerâ(TM)s fantasy. If you havenâ(TM)t seen The Avengers you should, due to its success the film has become the third highest grossing movie of all time and a hit with the new generation. Even though it may not be in your genre of movies you will still be entertained by the filmâ(TM)s explosive action scenes."

Huge, and hugely entertaining."

Ok so for the two of you that didn't see it yet I will not spoil it...but as Comic Book/Graphic Novel fan this had a great story, great visuals, and it was just an overall fun film.

"Oct 29, 2012",positive,"""Bam!"" ""Ka-Pow!"" ""Bonk!"" â"" as they say in comic books. While that's not really what the superheroes of The Avengers have to say (they are much more articulate), their actions are fairly true to their comic book roots. KIDS FIRST! youth film critics Julianna Noone (age 12) and Talia Rashba (age 11) each give the film a full 5 out of 5 stars, and are quite articulate themselves on their reasons for the top rating.

""This action-packed and comedy-filled film is a movie that not only will appeal to comic book fans but all movie-goers, as it has a great storyline and a strong cast to support it,"" says Julianna. And Talia is equally enthusiastic: ""This movie was absolutely fantastic! It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad.""

This movie was absolutely fantastic! It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad. 

The story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil Loki, who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world. The superheroes include Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Each one has a unique and special supernatural power that they use to help them do their job. At first, the superheroes fight about being a team, but, eventually, they work together to complete the mission. 

The Avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie, but it isn't. Because there are so many heroes, it is much more creative and entertaining. The Avengers is packed with fabulous actors. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man. Just like he was in the Iron Man movie, he thinks he is better than everyone else, but luckily, he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot. Captain America (Chris Evans) is strong and serious, and he is always ready to get the job done. Actor Mark Ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the Incredible Hulk. He really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in. Superhero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has some of the most incredible battle scenes. And Black Widow, portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other. 

An interesting fact is that actor Lou Ferrigno, who has played The Hulk in almost every film since 1978, is actually the Hulk's voice in the movie. 

The Avengers is written and directed by Joss Whedon, who does an amazing job. He makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention. The special effects were incredible. The superheroes change from their everyday selves into their supernatural selves in an interesting and fun way. The fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable. Also, there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself! 

Even though it is rated PG-13, I think kids ages 11, as well as all adults, will love this movie, especially if action is their thing. I am giving this film a 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away!

Looking for a hero? Well, look no further, because The Avengers is in theaters everywhere! This action-packed and comedy-filled film is a movie that not only will appeal to comic book fans but all movie-goers, as it has a great storyline and a strong cast to support it. This movie will attract all demographics and has already set many box office records. 

The basis of this movie is the world is under threat from another world, Chitauri, and there is a need for more than just all the worldâ(TM)s defenses to save it. The world needs the âAvenger Initiativeâ?, which is a plan put together by S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace-keeping agency, which calls for S.H.I.E.L.D. to bring together some of the worldâ(TM)s greatest heroes: Iron Man/Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr; Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth; Captain America/Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans; The Hulk/Dr. Bruce Banner, played by Mark Ruffalo; Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff , played by Scarlett Johansson; and Hawkeye/Clint Barton, played by Jeremy Renner. Nick Fury, played by the always intense Samuel L. Jackson, leads the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. There is a great supporting cast as well, that rounds out a star-studded cast. 

Now, I have watched all of the individual movie releases of the Hulk (both movies), Thor, Captain America and both Iron Man movies and loved them all, but, as most, was concerned whether they would work together to create a great movie. Well, they have done that and more, with a storyline that allows the main characters to, at times, shine on their own but at other times pairs them up perfectly to bring great balance to the story. 

 Josh Whedon, the director and co-writer, and Zach Penn, co-writer, do a great job in blending the action sequences in with very well-timed comedic moments. I also love how they bring so many different levels of conflict into the movie. There is brother vs. brother, between Thor and his evil brother Loki (played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston), the film's antagonist. There is internal conflict each of the main characters has with themselves, as we watch Dr. Banner trying to control his inner demons. And there is the overall conflict of our world vs. the other world, called Chitauri. 

There is also the conflict between the heroes themselves, which leads to many of the funniest parts of the film. Two of my favorite scenes are these parts of the movie. First, when the heroes first come together on the S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft, they are discussing the devastation that Loki has brought to Earth. Thor jumps to Loki's defense and states, âHeâ(TM)s my brother,â? to which the Black Widow responds, âHe has killed 80 people in two days.â? Thor responds, âHeâ(TM)s adopted!â? and itâ(TM)s one of the many laugh-out-loud moments. 

My favorite character(s) would be the Avengers as a whole, as they each have their own unique and likable traits. I love the special effects, particularly the touch screen computers that float in the air, and the use of CGI in this film as it was worked into the live-action sequences. The CGI Hulk was especially well done and was much more human-like in this film and funny as well. 

This movie is great for all ages and I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. Itâ(TM)s a must-see movie for comic book and non-comic book fans, and I think many will see it more than once, as I know I plan to."
"Oct 29, 2012",positive,TOTALMENTE INOLVIDABLE!
"Oct 29, 2012",positive,"Great acting paired with excellent special effects, what more could one ask for?"
"Oct 29, 2012",positive,"Whedon comes through again with interesting character interpretation and use.  He ties the story together and slams the whole thing into an action roller coaster. Thankfully, he also redeems the appearance of the Hulk in movies, twice maligned in his two previous appearances on screen.  Mark Ruffalo did a great job playing Banner as well.  As a publication, The Avengers has a very long history and dedicated fan base.  You can please them all, but the vast majority should feel pretty good about dropping ticket money on this movie.  Definitely worth seeing."

"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"Great, great movie! I couldâ(TM)ve watched it again and again at the theater! The action is so much fun and the special effects are really good! And who doesnâ(TM)t like Thor or Iron Man?? :)"
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this film, and yes a large part of this is due to a) Hawkeye's arms, b) Captain America's butt and c) Thor in general. But aside from drooling over unattainable fantasy superhero men, I also enjoyed the film for its sensible and uncomplicated ""save the world"" plot, its large cast of interesting characters, and its moments of genuine comedy. Just great fun."
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"Although I did not see many of the movies leading up to The Avengers, it was easy to follow and fun. There was a great cast and it was humorous and fun to watch."
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,great but disappointing hulk made the movie
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,action packed!!!!!!!!
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"This is a movie with great character development, awesome fight scenes and great visual effects"
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,I happen to love Joss Whedon movies! I love that they kept the same actors as the individual movies!
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"Great fun movie. Thankfully, Robert Downey Jr doesn't overtake all the scenes as the rest of the cast manage to hold their ends up well. The Hulk sequences are great fun. It may be a touch long, but it's not an arse-numbing bore-fest by a long chalk."
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,Best movie of the summer
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,They assembled flawlessly!
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,this needs 20 more rating stars!
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,seru sih.. entertaining
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,"Hot guys (Thor or Tony, hmmm, yum), hot action!"
"Oct 28, 2012",positive,Spectacular movie.  Unlike any superhero movie i have ever saw.
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Yeah the Hulk scenes are cool, but Loki is not a villian worth the film's time and it creaks along for too long before any fun happens. The first 45 minutes is a recap, basically of how the characters are for the one note they will carry for the rest of the film."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Hilarious and awesome.
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Totally awesome. Saw it several times in theatre. Love it!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Good Marvel movie, but vastly overrated. Predictable ending with not enough thrills to last the duration of the film"
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Pleasant experience.  Coherent story (which is no guaranty in a comic book based movie!).  Fabulous special effect (which IS a guarantee in a comic book based movie).  Definitely worth seeing.
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Best movie I have seen in a long time
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,great movie was exilarating the whole time
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"I am not a huge fan of the Marvel movies, but the Avengers was awesome!!  Action packed!  Loved it."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Although a very classic action movie in its directing and plot, The Avengers has a badass side thanks to the costumes and visual effects that will get you stuck on screen."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,best film of the year easily
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Legendary superheroes at their best!
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Ok....glad I watched some of the previous ones, and it was worth a watch!"
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"So much fun -- great action scenes and special effects, but more importantly, great one-liners that undercut these scenes -- great job of not taking this kind of movie too seriously."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"A lot of superhero action within 2.5 hours time frame. Seems a bit forced, but it is adequately entertaining."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,One of the BEST superhero movies EVER!!!!!!
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"That movie was amazing!
Everything was spot on: action, humor, drama. Even Thor, Hulk and Captain America were funny! (at times, they were also very serious... unlike Iron Man!)
Every character was exciting and interesting. They all deserve a separate movie (we are missing two!)
Hulk was not disappointing at all, even with another actor. 
The actors did a wonderful job and every single member of the whole team behind the movie is a hero to me: the special effects, the sound effects, costumes and design, make up, script, editing, filming... All baffling."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Action Movies do not come any better than this, incredible.  Even after everyone hyping it up for me it still did not disappoint.  I would have to say that anyone giving this a poor review is stupid and just trying their best to be different.  Do not listen to these miserable numpties.

Joss Whedon masterfully brings together some already fantastic characters, there was always the worry that they may loose their edge that they had from their own individual movies, but they all work so well together and all play their part.  Even Captain America, who, was probably the weaker of the single movies, ups his game and plays a very important leadership role.  As always Stark brings the best entertainment value but the big surprise is just how the Hulk steels the show.

This Movie has a big heart, the humour combined with jaw dropping action and Alan Silvestri's thumpingly dramatic score makes for pure entertainment, it may not be Oscar worthy but it could and should go down as one of the best action Movies of all time,  The last time I felt this way after a movie was probably when I first saw Jurassic Park, I was buzzing like a kid the night before christmas.  Bring on the sequel quick!"
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Purely awesome ride from start to finish! Visually stunning and the story is really engaging! Cool characters and excellent character development as usual by Joss Whedon!
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,While I dont enjoy super hero movies like I used to Joss Whedon writes a good script and knows the genre.
"Oct 27, 2012",negative,Immensely over-rated and over-hyped. I doubt the dialogues would even exist without Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. A huge let down for die hard comic fans.
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"It was well packaged....
It's not easy to put all these superhero in one movie altogether as a main role...
Well done.."
"Oct 27, 2012",negative,"Aweful.  If this is truly 96%, I shudder to think what the future of cinema holds.  Lame, humour-less, predictable.  No sense of peril.  No characters.  Nuff said."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,"Entertaining value: 90. The movie is very pleasant, and teasingly inflicts some character and dialogue that is not unfitting. The atmosphere of The Avengers, though, is sometimes mechanic, where it should be heroic."
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,The coming of together of Marvels best except for Spiderman. Absolutely Loved it!
"Oct 27, 2012",positive,Great Action! Fun to watch!
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,The best adrenaline rush that I have ever had while watching a movie
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,"It's like when you were little, and you're playing with action figures. They are all over the place causing so much damage. Joss Whedon is that kid and the actors are the toys. This is a phenomenal action film that is just so much fun to watch, it really makes you feel like a little kid again. Augh, it's just so awesome. Words can't even describe."
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,Best Marvel movie yet
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,"This movie is great to watch as a super hero fan, but watching in on bluray makes it seem like home movie."
"Oct 26, 2012",negative,Bien fait mais tellement exagéré. Histoire pas écoeurante..
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,what is all the fuss about the avengers is pretty good but nuthing really special.
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,"What is The Avengers? A sequel? A spin-off? Its own franchise? Does it really matter? Marvel is going into unchartered territories with this behemoth and the world is following.  Hiring Joss Whedon was the smartest direction to go with in terms of script. He gets characters and is great at writing--maintaining the right balance between humor, adventure, and dialogue. He isn't the strongest visual director, but he knows when to pull the (Hulk) punches and make the audience cheer. And that's exactly what The Avengers is; A film all about spectacle and the fun of the movies."
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,i loved this movie especially iron man and captian america
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,"The Avengers sets the bar for future superhero movies - it successfully blends Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, and more.  Not to mention, Joss Whedon is rather skilled at bringing the whole thing together with a script that more speaks character drama than big exploding things."
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,the perfect balance between comedy and super action!!!!
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,Magnificent movie! Special Effect over the top! Will buy it for the home!
"Oct 26, 2012",negative,"It was cliched and the storyline was thinner than air, this is an overrated piece of junk."
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,Marvel's PG friendly universe just works - flat out entertaining with great character interaction.  A lack of a great villain keeps this away from being the perfect superhero flick.
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,"Good family movie. Keeps your attention. 
My Boys LOVED it, for me it was Ok. Not something I's watch again but one I would buy on DVD for my kids."
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,not wat i thought it would be
"Oct 26, 2012",positive,you can not not like this
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,One of the best comic book films yet. Super fun and often hilarious. A rollicking good time.
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"The standard of Marvel Movies has been set. Good job, Joss!"
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,wow what a long wait and it didn't dissapoint!
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,good but may improve....
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"Hilarious, intense, heartful, entertaining and never boring. The Avengers is everything a suphero movie should be, and it marks for the best superhero and action movie ever known to man"
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,How can Captain America find fault in this pitch perfect film?! The Hulk was great in this one. The story was excellent and the pacing was super.
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"Really enjoy that movie! Great story, super cast and lot of action! A must to see!"
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"I would've given this movie a full 5 stars but there wasn't a great variety of camera angles that I'm used to seeing in a super hero movie. It would've been better if the friendly neighborhood spiderman would've made an appearance in this movie to give it something more special. Overall, this is a great movie and a feat for Joss Whedon."
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,Best movie out at the time Fo Sho!
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"Enjoyed this film, and it really helped to have gotten familiar with the characters from thier own films first which added more depth to the film. Nice!"
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,Amazayn movie!!! hilarious! Especially when hulk punches that evil person hah(:
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,Just amazing. To think WB just announced they are releasing Justice League against this movie's sequel!
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"Awesome film, bought it on Blu-ray special edition. A must-have for geeks like me"
"Oct 25, 2012",positive,"The wait for this movie was definitely worth it, was speechless after watching it!, Joss Whedon portrayed this comic book adaptation perfectely, the sound and visual effects were amazing, not to mention a great storyline that doesn't insult your intelligence....A must see for any comic book fan or just anyone a fan of this genre, you won't be disappointed!"
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"My Grade:  A- (92%),...Marvel Studios presents Marvel's The Avengers-the Super Hero team up of a lifetime, featuring iconic Marvel Super Heroes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. When an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins."
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Don't really like the hulk, but he was AWESOME!"
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Never to old for comic loved all the charters !! A must have
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Very enjoyable, it does help to have seen the related movies to understand the background of the characters, so not entirely a standalone, some slow bits but overall funny and worth watching"
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Loved this, if I had my hands on it and I could edit/change anything about it I wouldn't, ill not say perfect, because I do not think a perfect movie exists, but this is a great effort at a comic based action movie, far more fun and friendly than the Nolan Batman franchise. Joss Whedon will be sought after a lot after this."
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Marvels fans should be craving to get their hands on this humorous action sci-fi movie. Its very well structured plot makes the viewer feel like their in the movie.
"Oct 24, 2012",negative,"if you are a kid or comic geek then this is for you, movie for most part pretty stupid"
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"My son took me to see this movie. He explained the back story, which helped me enjoy the story. It was really fun seeing it on a huge screen. I didn't fall asleep! Nail-biting intense."
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,If you like the comic book heroes then you will love this
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,spider-man better be in part 2
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie out of iron man captain America Thor hulk
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Film was great, saw it twice!
The hulk was my fav!"
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Loved this movie. A great movie and I especially liked to see all the superhero's working together to save NYC. I wish they were around for Sandy
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Uh, what should I say? Maybe nothing!? Not what I thought, weaker than any of the constituents; proof being its Ironman centredness, just to save appearances. Not a complete failure, with Hulk's remastering a good idea, but pulling hairs with an annoying Loki. Unfortunately with Captain Yankee Doodle not my favourite, I might never bother pulling it out of rack again. Maybe my kids ""forcing"" me? Maybe..."
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon has found his super hero stride!  Well done blend of comedy and super hero action!  Ready for round 2!
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,Awesome awesome awesome
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,An excuse just to get a bunch of superhereos together in a shambles of 'bang bangs' and 'take that.' What really fails here is the flimsy storyline and irony that the reunion of all the superheros is far from it.
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Very entertaining.  Better than all of the previous films that lead up to this one.  I always had something bother me in each film.  Iron Man's were too anti-climatic.  Hulks was boring.  Captain Americans was unconnected and seemed like a B movie.  Thor was the best of each characters, but it still had a lot of flaws.  Avenger was funny and I never was bored.  I connected to the characters and wasn't disappointed.  Not sure if I could watch it over and over since the non action scenes  weigh too heavily on punch lines and comedy, but the first time was awesome."
"Oct 24, 2012",positive,"Big, shiny and amusing. Shame about the quickly glossed over 'off-panel' moments and constant feeling of it being a set-up film. I miss Ed Norton. Johansson and Smulders' surprisingly weak roles (from what I expected) and the overly cartoony tone stop me from giving another half star."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,Hulk! amazing! What a wonderful movie! complete taste of actions and explosions! and Captain America! still the most handsome superhero! and the sexy black widow! Thor was soo cute here! and the annoying attitude of Iron man! hawkeye was pretty cool too! a perfect movie for superhero avid fans!
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,Best movie I watched in 2012.
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"74%
As time passes this becomes less and less memorable and the sequel is an improvement. It has some eye candy, but the story and the action scenes are copied from Transformers 3. The villain Loki is bad and the film ruins the character of any depth that Kenneth Branagh so effectively created in Thor. However, Mark Ruffalo fives it his best."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,BEST Marvel movie hands down!
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"The Avengers shows glimpses of brilliant character development and a few good plot elements. The action scenes are awesome and something to watch over and over again, But the other hour and a half all leading up to the big fight in NYC is just kind of there cause there has to be some plot around the action scenes. In the end a great popcorn flick with a huge payoff from the 5 medicore films that lead up to this (except Iron man of course). To many things that when given a second thought just really seems like there forcing alot of the things that happen in the end. If Avengers 2 is going to play out with how a think it will. That will be the 5 star movie of the Marvel cinematic universe but I just can't give this action movie that 5 stars I for sure thought it would get."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,Much more hype than actually enjoyable content but nonetheless a fun film.
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"Great movie, extremely entertaining!"
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"Mildly entertaining with a few really funny moments, but for me the whole thing unravels with yet another alien invasion force that proves less formidable than your average National Guard detachment. There is never a sense that the world or its superhero defenders are in any real danger. Hence a complete lack of emotional weight.  In this regard, Avengers is light and largely lifeless blockbuster movie fare."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"This movie was a non-stop action thrill ride, but not only that it actually had a very deep plot. I can see why the critics loved it and why it made a killing at the box office."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,This flick is awesome!!
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,Best movie in the whole comic genre...
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a good movie, I did see an exciting encounter but I saw it more as a story of Thor and Lucky."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,This is another nearly perfect movie by Marvel. The action sequences are so realistic that you can see it like a new superhero classic. The performances of the great cast are excellent.
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"It was alright, but if you like a bunch of convoluted action with a slightly thought out story...this is your movie"
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"All right if no one else is going to say it. The casting of Mark Ruffalo for Banner was a stroke of unparalleled genius. In so agonizingly few scenes, Ruffalo brings a new, deeply human side to the hulk we didn't see in the first two movies. For once, we see the apology, the regret, the anxiety and painful resolution of a man who has accepted this as his permanent fate, but nonetheless tries in vain to be part of society. Anyone who has dealt with anger can finally relate to this man's interpretation of emotional instability, which I feel is what the Hulk is really about. Quite an accomplishment for someone not in the center of the movie. I was dying to see more of him (and Hawkeye too, as a side note), which is what movies and actors are supposed to bring: an aching need to see more. Bravo, man."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,normally this isnt my type of movie. but i really enjoyed this one! i'd even watch it again.
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"For the first hour nothing at all happens then it's chaos. I hate the new Hulk story line, Tony Stark was really the only one who could put up any fight and well if it wasn't for Robert Downey Jr, this movie would have gotten two stars."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"I really didn't think this movie would be as good as it was. I expected an enjoyable superhero mash-up, but it amazed me how they were able to balance all of these strong characters and create one awesome blockbuster."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"This movie provides the most monumental summer movie that anyone could ask for, but can be slow in a few parts."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"A geek's dream, but was it too soon. The characters of the avengers each have their own movie (except for hawkeye). The movies were shot out there like no tomorrow not that it was a bad thing.I believe that the avengers was a fine film and it was packed with enough comedic puns and juicy action scenes a teenager would be more than excited to see it. Although the movie couldn't be more formulated the blue cube is all powerful and the bad guy wants it, good guys have to stop him. The budget was more invested towards the action rather than plot. For those who disagree look at batman and now look at the upcoming superman. DC seems to take there time with these fragile tales.  I give this film 3 and a half stars."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"This has to be one of the greatest superhero movies ever. I'm not lying. I went to see this at the midnight release at my local theater, and I loved every minute of it. I admit it has flaws, mainly Hawkeye doesn't really... do anything, but all in all it was vastly enjoyable. I loved the butting of heads between Cap and Tony Stark, Mark Ruffalo did an excellent job as Bruce Banner, though my personal favorite will always be Edward Norton, and Chris was amazing as Thor once again. A must see, and even a must own :D."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"This film is undeniable fun. Great casting, all the characters bring the humor and the action. Once the ball gets rolling it doesn't stop. A very enjoyable film from beginning to end. The film has a meta feel as most of Whedon's outings usually does, and it definitely works."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,one of the best super hero film i've seen in my life.
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,AMAZING!!! Best superhero movie yet!
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"Full of action, humour, a decent plot, and excellent visuals, this movie was fun but never takes itself too seriously. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and expected it to be overly complicated, or nothing but action, and yet it holds things together pretty well despite covering the brief but well told backstories of all of its main characters."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,Haters gonna hate. This is how big summer blockbusters should be done. There's enough fun going on and snappy dialogue and character realisation that the SFX work as an added greatness and don't drown the film. Michael Bay beaten at his own game...
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"Best of Movie of 2011!!! Best Cast set-up Great story-line. Just an amazing action packed marvel film.
#TeamMarvel forever"
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"This is definitely a must see film. It has a way of introducing comedy, even in the middle of the most suspenseful, serious situations. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time."
"Oct 23, 2012",positive,"The action gets a bit repetitive, the dialogue is trite, and it lacks a strong/compelling villain (sorry Loki), but it's still pretty fun to watch, if not overrated"
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"Great movie, a must see."
"Oct 22, 2012",neutral,"It was OK.  Disappointing, but OK."
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,most epic comic book movie ever
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,The Hulk was finally given the credit he deserved.
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,best super hero movie ever
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,This movie... Is possibly one of the best superhero movies I've seen yet. I loved it. I live it. I LOVED IT!!!
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,Brilliant on any level. waited a long time to see it after seeing hints for over 5 years...was worth the wait!
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"The script packs enough action, humor and heart and everybody gets enough screentime.  But let's face it, in the end this is a pretty conventional superhero flick."
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"Wow. My respect for the writers of this epic piece of entertainment. They were able to pull off a movie with multiple main characters without one of them overshadowing the others (even though Robert Downey Jr tends to steal the show as well as the movie poster). Well done, Joss Whedon."
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"As a kid, I loved the Avengers and collected the comics.  As an adult, I've kind of shifted away from exploding action movies, but the kid in me loved this film and, with the small beef I take that Hank Pym was inexplicably taken out, I think this was a great movie"
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,It was good but confusing and that was only covered up by the jokes and action. Robert was hilarious as always but he never went serious except for one moment and that lasted for 5 minutes.
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,Fantastic film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,The best and most entertaining superhero movie I have ever seen
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"The movie is a little over hyped.  It's not THAT awesome. The script spends more time developing the characters more that the plot itself, which is really annoying.  The movie still has its high octane action that keeps it interesting despite having one of the worst and poorly made-out ""villains"" I've ever seem (SECRET: it's Loki!). Still, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the most entertaining  movies you'll watch  during summer 2012."
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"The performances are top-notch across the board, particularly from Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk far more sympathetically than in the two previous films that starred Eric Bana and Edward Norton as the angry green fellow. Ruffalo nails the almost precarious relationship between Dr Banner and his alter ego, and delivers plenty spontaneous laughs.
In the end, The Avengers isn't just an ultimate spectacle, but also incredibly smart and surprisingly humorous"
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"It's a film full of supermans, so there's no tension. I don't know what it is with Hollywood recently, but I've seen about 15 films recently that use a zoom-lense, including this one. Well acted, well written, and entertaining, it has it's flaws and certainly doesn't deserve a 92%"
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,The Avengers and Dark Knight were the best action movies this year thus far.
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,What do you expect by grouping a lot of superheroes and giving them a chance to blow up some aliens? An amazing movie!!!
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"Superb culmination to an extensive Hollywood experiment. By seamlessly bringing together individual film franchises, this action feature succeeds as the comic books it was inspired by did almost fifty years earlier, illuminating those same characters on the grandest scale imaginable."
"Oct 22, 2012",positive,"Best marvel movie ever. It was outstanding! Action packed, funny, great."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,awesome movie definitely will watch again
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!  Action packed throughout the entire movie
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,The best super hero movie ever made.
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Awesome best movie ever so cool
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Love Joss Whedon and super heroes. (See firefly)
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"The idea of bringing a combination of super heroes into one movie is an idea that I could never have thought of. But the result was very satisfying. The Avengers was funny, the combat was intense, and had a lot of great moments. It's not the best story plot wise but  the action set it apart."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Fantastic! One of the best superhero movies I have ever seen! The Hulk totally steals the show.
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"This was an amazing movie, fantastic fantastic acting, writing, directing, everything"
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"It's hard to describe this as anything other than 'fun.' Excellent character balance, acting that's anywhere from good to excellent, and exhilarating special effects. Definitely worth seeing, though it's nothing revolutionary."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"Awww hell yeah!  Joss Whedon proves his worth. I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. And to see him get to direct this high budget movie was great.  Whedon has always been good at juggling multiple characters, so I was not worried about this movie. Watch it!"
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Awesome!! Love this movie!!
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"While The Avengers stands strong on its own, prior knowledge of the Marvel Film Universe makes this an adventure like any other. Whedon juggles a cast full of strong characters with the greatest of ease and adds in his trademark touches to create an adventure full of heart. The film captures the essence of the comics while creating its own space."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,full of action good movie
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,my 4yr old son and i love it
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a hell of a ride all the way through. Very few things hold this powerhouse of a movie back. One thing was  the Hulk. As a fan of the Avengers for a long time, I know that the Hulk is in fact, not an Avenger but a neutral faction. They fight with him and the reason he can't be an Avenger is because he's uncontrollable. Thats what makes him awesome. Another thing is the portrayal of Thor as a demigod. In his own movie he was a god but he can't be one in the Avengers because of political reasons. Overall, the Avengers is a thrill all the way through with an appeal for everyone"
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,It was a great movie
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,the villain felt really flat and boring...other than that this movie was good
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,You already saw it. Everybody saw it. The Avengers was as good as it could have been. So good that nobody even noticed all the glaring mistakes that occurred the entire movie.
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"This was more enjoyable than I thought. I am not a fan of superhero collaborations, but this movie balances some of the best-known Marvel Super Heroes.

Samuel Jackson plays Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peacekeeping agency featuring several Marvel heroes like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They all need to work together to stop Loki (yes, Thor's adopted brother) from destroying the earth. Of course, they eventually do just that. And they look good doing it.

Somehow, the script works. Some of the heroes complement each other in several scenes. It just works well together. I was waiting for a ""well, Batman could have done it alone""-moment, but didn't experience any while watching. In hindsight, maybe Batman could have... well I'll leave that for another time.

I felt entertained for 140+ minutes."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"Buena pelÃ­cula de acciÃ³n centrada en un grupo de superhÃ (C)roes que intentan salvar al mundo de una debacle inminente.
RÃ¡pida, entretenida, emocionante, una montaÃ±a rusa de efectos especiales."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,A movie me and my kids enjoyed.
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,Everything a good Superhero film should be.
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,This movie rocks!!! very good job!!!
"Oct 21, 2012",negative,"Boy, am I in trouble. Because I hated it.

I think my problem is that I haven't seen Thor. Because I found Tom Hiddleston so ludicrously miscast as Loki that I could no longer maintain suspension of disbelief.

First, this deity who arrives in an awesome burst of netherworld energy has to escape sitting awkwardly in the back of a pickup truck for God's sake. But then when he stands up in his silly horned costume and tells a crowd of people to kneel to him, his complete lack of gravitas in the role just set me laughing.

I couldn't watch it after that."
"Oct 21, 2012",positive,"A well executed three act super hero popcorn muncher that balances characters, action and story that practically anyone can enjoy but offers little depth and meaning."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"Average, just average."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"wasnt really into seeing it, but it turned out to be very good, with some very talented actors!"
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"2012. A great movie but hulk should of had more of the actions, best quote in the movie ""hulk smash"""
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"A super hero movie that's done right. With the drama, action, and humor, Avengers ranks up as one of the best."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,Seriously. 10x better than I could've ever imagined!
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,was a great movie..it had just the right type of elements for everyone...I like most how each heros attitude was different..its a type of movie I think any person would love...
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,One of the best hero shows of our time. Love the humor.
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"I've been underwhelmed by a lot of these superhero movies lately, but this one was near the top of the genre."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,fantastic movie!! worth the wait to see all of them together.
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"Top notch entertainment, but X-Men 2 is still the winner in this genre for me."
"Oct 20, 2012",negative,Only watch this movie if you read all the marvel comic books because you will be confused!
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"In my view, it's the biggest movie ever made. Nothing like has ever been done before and the movie wasn't too bad. It's a shame that too many kids watch it"
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,best super hero movie ever!!!!
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,The best damn thing you will ever watch.
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"This movie was Fantastic! It instantly is one of my favorite comic book movies, as well as one of my favorite action movies. I think Jeremy Renner is a bit overrated and one dimensional as an actor as is Scarlett Johansson. But the rest of the actors play their parts beautifully, huge props to Downey Jr. who's Tony Stark/Ironman is iconic and a surprising result from Mark Ruffalo as hulk. The acting was terrific, the story was acceptable, the pacing was well done, the dialogue fantastic, bordering on perfect. Just loved this movie, I can't give it 5 stars because I haven't watched it again. We'll see how it stands up but I sat in my seat demanding to be entertained and I found myself laughing, cheering and having a fantastic time at the movies because of this film so that's pretty much as good as it gets for me."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,Great for comic book fans.
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, awesome effects, awesome hulk."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,I thought the action was good the acting was decent and the overall movie received 4 1/2 stars.
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,"Kind of ""a little bit too much"". 
Action movie with old ideas: invasion from another planet, group of ""freaks"" saving the earth. All characters are well known, none of them is really controversial. The main evil counterpart is a ""god"" which seems to have some untold mother complex, who isn't the best evil character at all. Seems only to be an preparation for a new chapter. 
Watched it three times, all in all nice action, best seen after the other Marvel comic adaptions."
"Oct 20, 2012",positive,what's not to like? love the trending comic hero movies
"Oct 20, 2012",negative,"Continuum of ongoing Hollywood trend of churning out a new Marvel superhero film yearly, The Avengers is either a great or a very bad thing depending on whether superhero films appeal to you. 

After having depicted most of the Marvel superheroes in their own tittle films, the natural next step is to gather the most famous superheroes under single tittle. And predictably The Avengers turns out to be like a huge melting pot, combining all known block buster elements into one single mega action film. 

Story wise The Avengers is simple and unimaginative as I have come to expect from Marvel films. A team of superheroes are gathered together to defend earth from the Norse mythology character Loki and his army of Alien henchmen. Seriously there is not much else to it and the viewer is up for 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of sense bombardment and brainless entertainment.  

Even if The Avengers did not manage to impress me much, it must be given that the film is quite stunning visually. Never before have I seen so fluent and well made special effects and it's integration with live actors. But other than great visuals, The Avengers did have much to offer and managed to keep me interested only barely through the running time."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"A dream come true for loyal Marvel fans. Few things are better than a 3D screening of a film that has audience member erupting like fans at a football game. The Hulk stole the show, and it's safe to say this is in the top 3 most epic movies ever made. An instant classic."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"please sir, I'd like some more."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,This movie blows me away!! WOW!!
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Booyakasha. Good shit.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,I hope this lives up to the trailers. all of the heroes movies have not been great.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Me and the kiddo laughed the whole way through.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,excellent movie. I love marvel. if you haven't seen it yet you need to
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Great movie like always I wished I could have more characters..
"Oct 19, 2012",negative,Boring and not believable
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"This is probably the best ""comic book movie"" out there. By ""comic book movie"" I mean it does the best making you feel like you are inside a comic book. While Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy may be better films, they are taking the characters from the comic and placing them in the real world. Joss Whedon's Avengers takes the audience and places them in the comic book world."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Possibly the best movie theater experience that I've had in a long time. Good film for the whole family and has left me anticipating all the upcoming films in the Marvel Universe.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,One of the best Super Hero Movies Ever Made A+
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"Enjoyable... a good bit of fun. Parts were just a bit too cheesy to bear, but some good humour. Adored Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo. Just wished it delved a bit deeper.. not easy when Hollywood try and market it for children though :("
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"Words can not describe how good this movie is, just go and watch it right now, if you haven't already seen it."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"Pode parecer preocupante quando o melhor personagem é CG, mas é o que vai acontecer aqui: Hulk rouba a cena quando aparece (e pra mim o Ruffalo é o melhor Banner até o momento). No geral é um bom filme, mas a história é clichê demais da conta, podiam ter feito um roteiro melhorzinho."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Awesome is the one word in my head while watching this film.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"I had a ball watching this multi-hunked cast.   Very rarely can Downey do any wrong in my book and he excelled here.  I even like Ruffalo better as The Hulk this time around. 
Not much else to say but it's a perfect weekend film to enjoy with your popcorn.  
This film should be watched BIG and LOUD>"
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Its not often that after im done watching a movie i want to start it over. Only con for the whole movie was that the hulk was really annoying for the first half of the movie. but overall it was an all star performance by all star actors in all star roles.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,I watched this in 3D. There was more action and 3D effects that it was a total sensory OVERLOAD.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,best movie i have ever seen
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Everything I hoped it would be.
"Oct 19, 2012",neutral,"PRETTY RUN OF THE MILL IN ITS GENRE, WITH A TERRIFIC CGLAST 40 MINUTES OR SO"
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,best super hero team up movie ever.
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,"Crash Bang Wallop.

Possibly would have been better in 3D.

Please Flixster stop posting this shit to my facebook."
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,I LOOOOOOOVE IT! Fullt ös medvetslös. Och kul. :-D
"Oct 19, 2012",positive,Best Super Heroes movie ever !!!!!

"Oct 18, 2012",positive,fun popcorn movie. no more no less
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,"See it, own it, live it. Humorous in just all the right places with enough action to make it entertaining. For me it was just Hulktastic."
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Entertaining comic book saga - well executed and enjoyable
"Oct 18, 2012",neutral,"not bad but greatest superhero movie ever?not even close,sorry downey but you will never b the actor ledger was."
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon did the highly anticipated series the justice it deserved. It is a lot of fun. There are mistakes but it is so fun that you can overlook those mistakes and just enjoy the movie. Loki kinda annoyed me, He was a good villain but he is just so childish and not scary (Well he looks exremelllllllly creepy in the first scene he's in, but after that, he is kinda just like an annoying brat.) I am excited for Thanos next time, And hope that maybe the Red Skull could come back into one of the stories, or Avengers two, because Hugo Weaving was AWESOME as Red Skull. The movie isn't the best movie of the year, But it is one of the funnest."
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,"Funny, thrilling and full of action. I love this film. The down sides are few. Spider man isn't in it and Edward Norton should of reprised the role of the hulk. Apart from them small things its perfect...well for me any way."
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Greatest movie ever...........!
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Best action movie of the year

"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Great movie even tho I am not a big fan of avengers i still liked it and all the action.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Instantly became one of my favorites!
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,I guess my best observation is that Maria Hill wasn't a cranky Sue.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie I have ever seen please make more!
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Awesome. Iron man makes this all star cast really blend together well. Leaves you wanting more.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,What comic movies should be.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,The most fun I've ever had watching an action film. Never takes itself too seriously and has lots of laugh out loud moments. Brilliant!!
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,A mega movie that brings dreams to reality...on screen that is
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,excellent! gimme more.
"Oct 18, 2012",neutral,Over-hyped. Overrated.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,a fantastic movie the hulk is awesome the scene with the hulk and Loki is so funny. eagerly awaiting a second. ps watch right to the end of the credits.
"Oct 18, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon......nuff said
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"An incredible super-hero film. Joss Whedon has outdone himself, and I am incredibly thankful for it! This is one of those films that I can watch again and again without getting tired of."
"Oct 17, 2012",neutral,Its okay but nothing special. A very overrated superhero movie that people don't care about anymore.
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Love it waiting for another
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,best superhero movie ever made.
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,totally love this movie ! great action!
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Great superhero movie! One of the best Marvel films yet!
"Oct 17, 2012",negative,"I'm really surprised to see this many people really liked it.  I thought it was meh.  The plot was impossibly weird, the heroes fought amongst themselves far too much, and the deus ex machina ending was contrived.  Who the bleep would nuke New York while heroes are still fighting to contain the threat and they don't know if that would stop the tesseract anyway?  I actually found myself laughing out loud when they started to talk in Hollywood science jargon/nonsense.  I was expecting good, but was sorely disappointed."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Great movie! It kept my attention the whole time and I never got bored. 2 thumbs up!
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Exceptional continuity!
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"kicks ass, i wanna be the hulk!"
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Brilliant movies - cant wait for the next one
"Oct 17, 2012",negative,"Mixed all ingredients in disproportionate quantity,making it sound totally absurd. What a waste."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Wow!!  Loved it!!  Especially Hulk Smash!!  Lol
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,The Hulk is the only one with any damn sense.
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"This movie was the underdog. I thought that it would be too much, but it was just right. Amazing movie, really really funny. You don't have to watch all the movies to understand everything. And anybody who likes action or superheroes would love this movie."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"This movie is the pinnacle of movies for the year! Sorry, but batman did not beat this. This was too well written, acted, and carried out. It's a MUST see."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"It was cute. It was clever. It could have been better. Then again, it's a chore bringing The Avengers to screen. Dull plotline. Silly one-liners. Poor integration of each character's individual story."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Awesome movie best marvel yet
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"Just an entertaining movie. Nothing more. nothing less. Iron Man (Robert) owns the whole freaking movie, while Hulk gets to shine at the end. Rest of the case...meh, didn't really care about them. It's all visuals and not really a substance-driven fare. And yes, Scarlett was bloody HOT, that's all."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"Getting old. Can only enjoy the ""back story"" half of these epics and then about 1/3 of the giant confusing CGI battle scene--then I get bored. Its good if you're like me. If you live for giant confusing CGI battle scene, its great."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"A good movie. The smaller actions scenes worked better then the samller ones, like the one between thor and stark. Great humour like always especially from stark. A few shots that shoot at angles and didnt need to be. Also a couple scenes in the city the cinematography was off. Killing off Coulson wasnt necessary! Cant wait for the next set of individual movies."
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,Huge amount of fun better watched after the previous Marvel films (which have all been a lot of fun too). Finally the Hulk finds a home in movie land! The way he deals with Loki is genius :0)))
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,I totally love the hulk smash
"Oct 17, 2012",positive,"It had to be a tough movie to make but it ended up an amazing movie to watch, I have no idea of how Whedon juggled all those main characters but what can I say, he nailed it. The main story is little more than an excuse to showcase the Avengers, but can we really complain about that? the action is clever and well shot, the characters work well together and the whole movie is a long fun ride."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"What a fantastic film, PERIOD."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"With a tight, well structured script that features excellent dialogue and doesn't undermine its well-fleshed-out characters, as well as some great performances, enthralling action sequences and some excellently timing and execution courtesy of Joss Whedon, this movie is a perfect example of a good comic-to-screen adaptation."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon knows how to make something that is so outrageous and subjectively ""comical"" into a grand piece.  Though at times its fan service and lack of gravity stop this film from being truly exceptional, it is nevertheless the epitome of hard-superhero movies."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"Not as intelligent and self aware as the Iron Man films, The Avengers suffers from a ""by the numbers"" formula. That said, its an entertaining popcorn movie."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Everything you love about the other marvel films but bigger and better !
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I have ever seen
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Comic book movies don't get much better than this.
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"Bunch of super heroes in the same movie, what's not to like?"
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,"Great cast, Action done right, Killer plot, the3D is grabbing. This is about as epic and awesome as it gets. Not much else to say."
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Fun and entertaining but also consistent. Robert Downey Jr. owns the movies.
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Not my kind of movie.
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Was a good action movie with loads of fan service.
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,I love the captain!!!!
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,I love the captain!!!!
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,what isn't there to like about this movie. it has everything you would want in a movie. definitely a movie that should be in your collection
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,Not as good as I was hoping.
"Oct 16, 2012",positive,A wow smack in the face action packed movie. Watch as tony stark and his iron suit meet captain America and the rest of the avengers.
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,Marvel does it again!
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"My favorite pick for 2012! It was a close call between this, Prometheus & The Dark Knight Rises."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie. Very well made :) Graphics, storyline, and music was wonderful :)	 Kept me going the entire time. I didn't feel bored, but couldn't wait to see what happened next. I'm looking forward to the next movie :)"
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,for me was ok but didn't really see what all the fuss was about
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,The true hero of the Avengers? Joss Whedon. There was no better person for the job.
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"When I heard this movie was going to be made, I thought it would be TERRIBLE.  Then they made Iron Man and Thor and hired Joss Whedon.  This movie was entertaining and, while a bit silly and predictable at points, is about the best it could possibly be expected to be."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Absolutely amazing.  One of the best live action comic book movies of all time, hands down."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,It was a good movie but it's not as amazing as it's hyped up to be.
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,could have been longer and better
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,A movie that has action and adventure and great for marvel fans .
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers is a two and a half hour thrill ride that will entertain whether youâ(TM)re 
young or old, a fan-boy, or casual viewer.  From start to finish, the action only stops temporarily, and the
 thrills will stick with you for years to come.
	One would think that an eye-candy filled super-hero film would be lacking plot and character development, but I found that not to be the case here.  The phenom writer/director Joss Whedon has found a way to balance story and action so that they do not conflict with each other.  Of course it helped that two thirds of the main characters have had their own character developing feature films recently.  There are critics who have taken jabs at the lack of character development in this film, which I find to be without merit for many reasons. 
	First of all, as said before, the main characters have already been developed in their own individual movies, which frees Whedon up to spend more time elsewhere.  So, in place of character development, he develops the relationships between these characters.  In this, he excels masterfully.
	Spoiler alert!  From this point on, readers will be subjected to blatant spoilers.  Beware!
The villain in The Avengers is Loki.  He is Thorâ(TM)s demi-god brother, and villain of the movie which bears his brotherâ(TM)s name.  A quick look at Loki will tell the observer that he does not compare physically to the heroes.  In fact, the villain is more of a side note as far as the conflict in this movie goes.
For the Avengers, conflict is found within themselves more so than from Loki.  When looking at the team of heroes as individuals it is easy to see where the conflict will emerge.  Of the six Avengers, one is a King and a god of Norse myth.  One was a Captain in the U.S. Army during world war 2, and possesses super-human strength.  One, the most arrogant of the group, is a self-proclaimed billionaire playboy philanthropist superhero.  Of the remaining three Avengers, one, the Hulk, avoids conflict at all costs, and the other two are card carrying members of S.H.I.E.L.D. the founding organization of the Avengers, and view the others as newcomers. 
With three chiefs and only three Indians, the Avengers find working together to be difficult at first.  Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a born leader who prefers to work alone in most cases, barking orders and holding all the reigns.  To work with him is to submit to his arrogance and dominance.  Something Captain America finds especially hard to swallow.  Thor, while willing to work together with the others, barely accepts them as equals.  
The relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man is of particular interest as it encapsulates the difference between following authority blindly, and questioning authority constantly.  At first, the two argue about attacking a problem head on or waiting to develop a plan.  Later they argue about accepting authority blindly.  And then their differences spill over to Iron Manâ(TM)s inability to sacrifice for others.  âYou donâ(TM)t know what itâ(TM)s like to lay down on a wire to let the next man cross,â? accuses Cap.  âI think Iâ(TM)d just cut the wire,â? retorts Iron Man.  This interaction totally captures the underlying differences in style of leadership between the two men.
Among the not-so-super heroes, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen) uses less physical prowess and more intellectual combat to disarm her opponents.  This caters to the female audience, and probably to the males in a dominatrix role as well.  
When it comes time to fight a common enemy, the Avengers are a little slow out of the gate.  This is precisely what the villain Loki is hoping for, and he uses it to his advantage.  During this fight, the Hulk takes on the Black Widow as well as Thor.  Iron Man works to repair their broken airship, and Captain America fights off enemies to buy Iron Man time to make his repairs.  When Iron Man sacrifices himself to keep the airship aloft, Captain America realizes he was wrong about the eccentric billionaire.
When the film draws down to its final climactic end battle, Iron Man chooses to relinquish command of the tactical side of the fight to Captain America.  His ability to acknowledge Capâ(TM)s experience and expertise in battle shows his true leadership, as well as his acceptance of Captain America as an equal and a colleague.  
The Hulk is a bright spot in this film as the previous two Hulk films have fallen short in creating a good hero to look up to.  He really steals the scene when in Hulk form, and is a Marvel to behold (no pun intended).  Whedon portrays him as a mild mannered scientist when in Bruce Banner form, afraid of nothing but his own ability to harm others unintentionally.  But in Hulk form, it is non-stop smashing time which young viewers especially children will enjoy.  
 In short, The Avengers is an excellent film with lots of action and a lot of Hulk!"
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Exciting, fun and innovative. The Avengers is definitely a bigger, better superhero movie but I think I'd prefer a different mix of heroes."
"Oct 15, 2012",negative,"Movie night with Iris.

God another geek superhero film really. I've seen Captain America (alright), and i've seen Thor (pretty good). But i haven't seen Iron Man (i'm not a geek virgin sorry). And who's the Black Widow, oh she's hot in leather that'll do. And is the guy with a bow and arrow important, and the guy with the trading cards? HELP! And its 2hrs 25mins. REALLY??

But wait a minute it rumbles along ok and is actually quite funny. The action is boring, it always is. I should just ff those bits. So hoorah, but wait a minute there might be Avengers 2. STRESS."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,Great movie! Action packed!
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,a very nice movie with a great plot not that shallow
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, one of the best marvel made movies yet"
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"Surprisingly I just could not get interested in it, think if I watched it again I would but watching action films during the day is always hard to get into it."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"I don't know how to review this.  It is not great cinema.  But it is a perfect homage to the comics it is trying to portray.  If you enjoy marvel's mythology, and enjoy a romp, this film will not disappoint. Nor will it challenge you in any way."
"Oct 15, 2012",positive,"The movie, one of the most expected for me in the year, can be summary in one sentence: ""- Leave your brain in home and go there with your friends""

In my opinion, the movie has some mistakes in the sequence that the things happen and the focus gave for some characters who I don't care about (a person who doesn't read the comic books). In the few years, the interest that involv the construction of all super hero movies what intelligent and makes this movie be bigger than actually is. After a lot of ""funny scenes"", great GC and good action scenes, 3.5 stars was a good punctuation and I think that the next movie can be better and bigger than it already was."

"Oct 14, 2012",negative,"I already knew I wasn't a fan of super hero films but I did love green hornet, Batman and Iron man.. But for me Uneventful"
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie ever and one of the best action movies ever.  Fanboys dream

"Oct 14, 2012",positive,"Yeah, I finally watched Avengers."
"Oct 14, 2012",neutral,"eh. would it have been that hard to shoot in real NYC and not green screen NYC, i mean really wtf."
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,"Action, funny, character driven, awesome! Doesn't get much better than this, and family fun too!"
"Oct 14, 2012",neutral,"Seriously this was the film that people were wetting their pants over this summer, I guess I should have known really by the level of box office grosses this film attained that it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Practically no plot whatsoever and apart from some sharp dialogue with Downey Jnr. and the ever reliable Mark Ruffalo as the new Banner, the script was very poor. I will say they've lucked out with Ruffalo his casting, he's easily the best fit for the role of Banner/Hulk yet.

I found myself checking the time quite a bit and the climatic G.G.I soaked finale just went on forever. Hiddleston is OK as Loki but his computer generated army were just visually and physically underwhelming. I actually thought I was going to watch this and feel like I really should have seen this on the big screen but you know what I'm glad I saved my money.

Despite liking a certain character very much in previous films when it came to their fate being the catalyst of the superheroes being bought together as a cohesive unit to fight the enemy I never felt any great sense of loss that the film intended or it grabbed emotionally at any point. There is some rare moments that raised a smile but from the very beginning it's all over the place, maybe I need more of a background to these characters and to have read the comics but I had no problem with The X-men or Batman, maybe it's too grounded in those universes for me, Nolan was criticised for his stories not being like the literary version and upsetting many a purist but I found his Batman films far more compelling and entertaining than this meandering mess of a film. Whedon's involvement might have made the fans get excited but for me he's got far too much going on and it's just confusing most of the time. Jackson's Nick Fury ambiguous motives hint at something intriguing but are never really given much room to breathe and character development is pretty much zero. 

I don't think The Dark Knight Rises was the second coming and my favourite film of the summer is still The Raid but really I wasn't expecting such a bloated uninteresting film as this. It's clearly far too long and could have been under 2 hours easily. I just think I've come to the end of the line with these Marvel films, I though Captain America was utter garbage and while I don't think it's as bad as Cap it's about on par with Iron Man 2, I enjoyed The Incredible Hulk and Thor much more and the first Iron Man still remains my favourite from this franchise, as these films have gone on they've got bigger but dumber.

I'm sure this franchise will go on to gross billions but with Nolan's Bat trilogy now over I very much doubt bar the new Superman film next year that I'll be paying to watch any more comic book films again. With Dark Knight Rises slightly disappointing me and this mess of a film I say it's all still to play for when it comes to the most impressive blockbuster of the year especially when we have The Hobbit and the return of a certain British Secret Agent to come."
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,Just a perfect blockbuster.
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,OF COURSE IT WAS AWESOME!
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,"A big gamble that hits the jackpot with a perfect balance of comedy, action and fan service. Possibly the best comic book movie ever? Certainly is for me!"
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies.
"Oct 14, 2012",positive,Loved this movie. Enjoyed Stark and everything they did with the Hulk.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Overall GREAT MOVIE! I was entertained
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Really fun superhero action. If you have watched all the individual films it closes everything out well.  Iron Man is still the best of these heroes.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Loved this movie. It was great the story was awesome the acting was great the special effects were amazing. It was  just such a great movie
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Great movie nothing like seeing super heroes come together to save the world it looked great 3d a must watch with the kids
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"Good movie, worth watching"
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"I have to say that usually I'm not into superhero movies in general wtih the exception being Captian America, but this is now my absolute favorite superhero movie. Captian America is now my second favorite."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"I LOVED IT, IT WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 2!!!!!!:-)"
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"Awesome, tons of action"
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"I guess I'm just not a huge fan of this genre'. Not bad. I certainly don't get the hype about it, though."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,It is funny sometimes!!!!
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"The funnest Comic book movie ever made, Whedon has shown the world what us fans have been dreaming of since our boyhoods."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Entertaining and great action ;-)
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"very entertaining, slightly cheesy."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Dude! Best movie of '12
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,greatest of all time
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,One of the 2 best movies of 2012
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Amazing film Joss Whedon doing what he does best making kickass films for the fans not the bucks
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,One of my top 5 super hero movies
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,The movie is off the chart. Worth watching again and again.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"Very few movies make me as undeniably happy as this one. Scene after scene, line after line of memorable stuff that is full of what we go to the movies for: big action, genius dialogue, a killer villain, perfect humor, and just the right amount of self-awareness. I recognize it has problems, but when those issues are overshadowed by the sheer size of what might be the best comic book/superhero movie of all time, they pale under the greatness."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Typical summer action flick.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,it SH*TS AWESOMENESS!!!
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,best action movie ever
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,"Will go down as one of the best comic book movies to date. It has it all and then some. Humor, Action, and good acting (from 3 of them). The Avengers is a great popcorn flick and is one of Marvel's best movies."
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,great dialogue and action packed.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Downey was great. Hulk not so much. Scarlett should stick to chick flicks. Overall good time
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,this is the best movie I ever seen
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,a little bit over rated
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,An extravagant movie that's surprisingly down-to-earth. I like it.
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie EVER! was a great action ride from start to finish!
"Oct 13, 2012",positive,Excellent entertainment.
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a spectacular action epic gathering Marvel's best superheroes and putting them together. The result is action film bliss with many great action scenes, a hilarious sense of humor, and great acting. While I wish the story had more depth, I had a great time watching this film and I can't wait to see what the future holds for another installment."
"Oct 12, 2012",neutral,Wow not really my thing! Great effects lacked script! Don't understand all the high ratings ! The first 3/4 snooze fest
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Warning! This movie may cause, but not included to: high addiction to marvel, the want to watch time after time after time and all around serious badassness. But kidding aside, this has become my third favorite movie yet. It doesn't matter what type of gene you are, you will love this money. Even haters were like ""DAMN""."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Even the hardest cynics would have a difficult time finding fault in a movie with just the right amount of action, humor and character development."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"They all came together after one agent dies, and Loki goes back to asgard."
"Oct 12, 2012",negative,"Stupid. Loud. Shallow. Paint-by-numbers, cliche, studio summer film, with the emotional depth as a cardboard box, and zero reason to care. Literally just a child with action figures, and someone hit record on the camera. Nothing is ever at stake, and no reason to believe the good guys won't win."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Director and writer Joss Whedon takes what has been established in terms of the character development in the other Marvel films and makes it his own. He gives everyone in this movie their own moment to shine. Whedon also uses his ability to write humorous and witty dialogue to inject this movie with some good humor. The best part about watching ""The Avengers"" is seeing the superheroes squabble with one another as they throw insults and fists to each other in top-notch fight scenes, which leads to the ultimate smackdown between two characters that have had history with one another in the comics: The Hulk and Thor. The third act featuring Loki leading his army of aliens to attack New York City is a fantastic action sequence that shows the Avengers uniting and working as a team."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,Instant classic. Best modern superhero movie.
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, wish i can buy it"
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Awesome,  Flawless..."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Saw it and already have it on DVD. one of the best super-hero movies made. Sideline note. Great action movie and The Hulk was the surprise hero of the film.......""Puny God"".  Hulk needs a sequel."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,It's got Robert Downey Jr.  How could it not be great...
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,This is a great movie all around...great for kids...and funny adult humor
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,Booorrriinnnggg. How can you have so many good superheros in a movie and make it completely boring and insignificant? This should have been Transformers 3 on crack and instead just plain sucked.
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,Way too many puns for a superhero movie. I kept wondering if they all remembered that they were supposed to be saving the planet. They didn't seem to take it seriously but in the end how could I not like it.
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,"Fun, fun, fun - every minute."
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,Special effects 5/5.
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,What can I say.....SMASHING!!!!
"Oct 12, 2012",positive,Bought the four disc set and a 3D blu ray player. I never get tired of watching Hulk punch Thor in Grand Central Station and sending him flying.
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Awesome combination of good actors, good story line, great dialog at many moments, outstanding special effects and a near perfect amount of screen time (and timing). Keep it up Marvel Studios!"
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Avengers Assemble! MARVEL hits it big with this epic and terrific comic book film which is one of 2012's two great comic book films, the other being The Dark Knight Rises. Joss Whedon, creator of Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was the perfect choice to bring this superhero assemble film to the screen. The main members, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk and Thor, are brought together after Loki arrives to Earth with a threat to take it over with the help from a dangerous extra-terrestrial force. 

All of the actors are superb and get a good amount of screentime. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo steal most scenes, with Ruffalo being the best actor to tackle Eric Banner since Eric Bana and Edward Norton. Loki is also a superb villain, with Tom Hiddleston once again bringing a terrific sense of malice to the character. A few scenes featuring Lokin bring a feel of comedy to the film, especially his confrontation with the Hulk, which is another great addition to the film. Samuel L. Jackson also gets a larger role in this film, than he did in the earlier MARVEL Universe films, which include Iron Man (in the post-credit scene), Iron Man 2, Thor (another post-credit scene) and Captain America: The First Avenger. The film ends on a high note, with two great post-credits scenes (one of them making hints to who the possible villain could be in a future installment). Undoubtedly MARVEL's best film to date."
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Better than most super hero movies.
I thought the dialogue between the various superheroes was very interesting and the plot was at least slightly better than some others in this genre.

All in all it was an entertaining movie, worth watching."
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"I'm not a big fan of Marvel superhero type movies, but this one pretty good :-)"
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,The best superhero movie of all time period!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,bothe me & my son loved it!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Just superb. The first of this kind where I'm not saying ""enough already"" at the final fight. Very well made."
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,Great action & comedy mix.
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,The last scene was about half an hour too long. Some nice Joss Whedon one-liners but they're too few and far between to save this film.
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,This was so good I would have watched it again straight afterwards (if it hadn't already been past my bed time). Absolutely brilliant! Such a shame my 6 year old boy can't watch it yet.
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Was funny, but you know... more special effects and less script... But it was funny, no doubt"
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,Epic. Need anyone say more?
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,Odavno nisam gledao ovako dobar film!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,I'm a marvel's fan so this movie was right up my alley....All my favorite characters and villains...Scar Jo...ehh...movie would have been just as good without her. But this movie does not disappoint. Its just LONG....but action filled non the less. So all you marvel nerds...get your underoos ready!!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"just nearly the ending, I think this flick is good enough. in the beginning? it's typical hehe"
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,"Finally... Missed it in the Theater, avoided conversations about it, and waited until I could quietly enjoy it.  Yes I did enjoy it, but I think I built myself up for a slight letdown.  Not sure i am feeling Ruffalo in place of Norton as the Hulk, but there have been so many Bruce Banner's at this point who really cares.  I find that it seams to be hard to find/create amazing original special effects anymore  the flying Carrier was cool but didn't knock me outta my seats.  The fight seens between the Characters were ok but the Aliens wern't impressive  perhaps a couple of detailed close-ups  anyway I still loved it but wanted to love it more......"
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,i love this movie i so it when the hulk just makes thor go flying after they kick some alien butt lol
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,Love love love this movie!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,By far the greatest superhero movie ever made!!!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,IT WAS AWESOME ALL THE WAY THEY DIDN'T PUT THE ATTENTION ON JUST ONE HERO.YEAH.
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,liked the moive and it was really good
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,loved it! ill admit i was rather bored towards the beginning but it picked up quick!
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,Lovely lovely movie. I saw it twice. The actors work so well with each other. Ironman makes it! :)
"Oct 11, 2012",positive,One to watch with friends. A notch above the usual superhero fare but the more I think about it the lesser its sheen becomes. Everybody gets a smart line or two and Hulk almost runs away with it. Not something I would watch again though.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,hulk and iron man = instant classic
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Entertaining, but mindless. Where superhero movies are concerned, this is of the more uninspiring variety. Visually top-notch, though, with some thoroughly epic sequences. The dynamic between the Avengers was a highlight, also, the banter being quite cleverly written."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Marvel does it again
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,One of the best marvel films yet!!!
"Oct 10, 2012",negative,Just didn't make it.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,I hadn't seen Thor so it was kind of confusing but after I saw it I understood it a lot more :)
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,A Great Action movie. Liked the fight scenes and like the modernized outfit for Hawkeye compared to the old comic book. Definitely liked those few funny scenes in the movie.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,I didn't expect to laugh so much! One of the best comic book movies ever!
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Love love love thus movie.  Hulk makes it
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"A dazzling, surprisingly cinematic adaption of the the most epic proportions Marvel has yet to craft until now."
"Oct 10, 2012",negative,Loki vs Avengers. One man with a stick vs countless superheroes. This movie looked more like a great advertisement for a toy line than a movie.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Thor and Iron Man in the same movie :D
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Standard blockbuster style movie. not mentally taxing. Always enjoy Robert Downey jnr as Stark.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Fun and entertaining. Great FX, good comic book adaptation."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,primeira vez que gostei   do Hulk em um filme...........
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Found it to be a little long, but overall good. I LOVE Joss Whedon, and he rarely disappoints"
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Love the action the humor and just seeing the Avengers come together. Great movie!
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie of all time. Just go watch it. Now.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"I was expecting more, short but worth watching... feels like an animated marvel comics plot."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Typical Marvel movie. Never read the comics, but all I gotta say is better than the Spiderman trilogy."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,mmmm Chris helmsworth is yummy
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Very well made movie.  All characters have great interactions with one another.  The movie will keep you on your feet the entire time.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Good movie, but was expecting a lot more."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,Man.........this has got to be the most successful films in history! It has crazy sound effects and it fits JUST perfectly for the film. I never noticed that Marvel would actually make a better job in the year of 2012. I gave this rating a 5 out of 5! It was amazing.
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Fun movie, lots of CGI eye candy. The villain is actually interesting, while the story isn't particularly deep, but generally awesome. Aside from ironman, the hulk, and thor, the other 3 heroes (hawkeye, the chick, and captain america) seem fairly redundant. But I guess that's just stating the obvious. Watch it for the fun experience."
"Oct 10, 2012",positive,"Best movie I've seen in years. The cast works great together and I can't wait for Part 2.... If you have not yet seen the movie - don't stop at the end --- Watch all the way through the credit's for something special... Best ""Hulk"" I've ever seen!!!!"
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Honestly is there anything else that needs to be said about this movie? It is amazing in each and every way
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"By far the most entertaining film I've seen all year. Many have been waiting for this kind of movie for a long, long time now and I am glad to say that it was worth the wait. 
For those who have seen all of the movies leading up to this one, you will be rewarded and much more involved in the story. For all of those who haven't seen the other movies I ask, why not? The movie starts where the others left off, specifically Thor. Loki is involved with some space kind of evil-doers (to put in basic terms) and he uses the Tesseract to come to earth. It doesn't take too long for Loki to begin starting his plan as he manipulates S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to do his dirty work. That is...he is creating some sort of device to create a portal so that tons of alien-like creatures can invade earth. It doesn't take too long after that for Mr. Fury (played by good ol' Samuel L. Jackson) to start working on contacting all of the superheroes from the past films. After all, they are heroes. So who needs the Army?
Sure, this movie is filled with huge action set-pieces with good vs. evil. But the real joy in this movie is how the heroes interact with each other. Ever wonder what it would be like with Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Bruce Banner, and Black Widow all talking to each other? Well, now you'll get to find out. But I'll take it a step further; and this is what I truly loved. Did you ever wonder what a fight would be like between Iron Man and Thor? Hulk and Thor? Black Widow and Hawkeye? Well you're in luck. 
It's truly a nerd's paradise watching this film. The actors are better than ever as their superhero counterparts, the action scenes are well-done, and the movie has a great sense of humor that keeps the movie fun at all times. Is this movie technically a perfect movie? Well, not really. How does Hawkeye carry all those arrows with him? How come Hulk can seem to perfectly control his rage near the end? Answer: Who the f@!% cares? As far as entertainment value goes, you can't get much better than this. It's the most fun you'll have at the movies all year, guaranteed."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Great movie!  Absolutely. loved it!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,best superhero movie yet.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,It's the type of movie you plan to watch again even while you are watching it. Worth multiple cinema views.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"Security Guard (Harry Dean Stanton): Are you an alien? 
Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo): What? 
Security Guard (Harry Dean Stanton): From outer space, an alien. 
Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo): No. 
Security Guard (Harry Dean Stanton): Well then son, you've got a condition.

To me this movie was just alright I guess because I had seen all the awesome parts on-line (i.e. Black Widow interrogation scene, the Hulk punching Thor, the Hulk's scene with Loki, etc.), so in a way it spoiled the movie for me. I do like shawarma scene-- that was hilarious and Robert Downey (Tony Stark/Iron Man) was the higlight of the whole film, followed closely by Mark Ruffalo who, IMHO, may have portrayed the best Bruce Banner/Hulk I've seen since Bill Bixby. Chris Evans (Captain America) was cute, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) was hawt, ScarJo (Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff) was well...very ScarJo and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye/Clint Barton) was kinda cool, but there was just too much of him. Maybe it would've been better if there was a little less of him and a wee bit more of Tony (also lose Pepper a.k.a. Gweneth-- boring!). The film started off a little slow (going over the backstories for each of the heroes for those who have not seen the other films solely dedicated to Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk or Captain America. But IMHO they should've Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows it, which basically employs the if-you're-not-familiar-with-the-backstory-by-this-point-were-not-explaining-it-to-you,-so-go-see-the-other-films first mentality....but that's just me. Anyhow, the film was enjoyable and fairly entertaining. The cast were awesome and did a splendid job sharing the spotlight with the other actors; they had good chemistry as an ensemble and I can't wait for the next installment (although next time, I think I'll steer clear of the tidbits they show on-line  ^_^)."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"One time where the quotes on the package actually mean what they say. In the Marvel Universe, this is the best superhero film to come out of that mess thus far. A great blend of onscreen acting and action sequences that will blow you away. Some great cinematography on the heroes during their escapades and well written dialogue to keep you entertained."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,The Avengers is an entertaining movie. It has plenty of action and destruction.
"Oct 9, 2012",negative,"Ruffalo is good, the action entertains, and the visuals are AMAZING. Everything else is an unmitigated disaster of futility. Joss, where are you?!"
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,This movie is great!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Wow! You are in the comics!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"Giving all of it's heroes moments in the sun, a intelligent humorous script and fantastic action and special effects make this installment in the Marvel film universe a cut way above it's predecessors!"
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"Some of the individual films (Iron Man, Hulk) are much better than this amalgamation that gets a little too caught up in its own making.  It's still incredibly thrilling, but not nearly as all the fanboys are making it seem."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Excellent film... Quoi dire de plus ?
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"Movie had plenty of action throughout to the end, but the rivalry between all of the hero's was needless and THAT alone took up over half of the movie, Although I think that they were just trying to captivate viewers of the power the hero's had just incase everyone forgot?"
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Absolutely awesome!!!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,A lot of action great movie!!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,my nephew loved this movie
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,the most epic movie of super heroes

"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Best movie in a long. Hulk. Smash.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"I'm really not a big comic book superhero fan & got this movie for Connor cuz he loves the Hulk, but after watching it I want to see all the rest."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,It played up to all the hype.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Certainly one of the greatest movies I've seen. What impresses me most how the directory managed to let every single actor shine.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,"Not the best comic hero movie I have wet seen (the dark knight) but definitely in the much larger 2nd tier group. If you like action and or comic movies, then this is a must see."
"Oct 9, 2012",negative,I never get it from the moment I've watched the beginning.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,The story keeps you glued to the screen with not even a single moment of  dullness.. most of all the weaving of characters from all the legendary creations of Marvel is truly commendable.. By far the best movie in its genre till date. Looking forward to the sequel..
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,SOBREVALORADA!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,Another piece of good 'ol family entertainment. I felt this one was more comical than the rest (example: Hulk smashing the crap out of Loki).
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon needs to be given more projects.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Best comic movie I've ever seen.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"For pure entertainment value, this is the best super hero movie ever made.  Such a good time!"
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"This movie was incredible! I haven't even seen the previous individual character movies, but after seeing this, I am officially an Avengers fan!!"
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,This is how superhero movies should be made.  The future of marvel movies is lookin bright
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Excellent!! Loved it!
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"As good as the second film was, the X-Men movies made me skeptical about how good a ""team"" movie can be. With plenty of attention and well-crafted one liners given to each central character, The Avengers successfully makes even X-Men look like something Ed Wood filmed in his basement without a script. This is a fun, ridiculous movie, and also a good one."
"Oct 8, 2012",neutral,this movie was good but i don't understand using two people without super powers that was a bit point less this was a good movie
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,The best of any movie Marvel has put out to date!
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"Superlative superhero action flick-no question, the best Marvel flick to date! Plot, characters, action, special effects and humor all hit the mark. Really nothing to nitpick.  The only problem I see is Marvel living up to mark this one has made."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Loved it. Very fun movie
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"Fantastic flick with incredible action, and I think many woudl agree that the best part is the onscreen chemistry. Downy and the crew work great together, and the dialogue is great. Mark Ruffalo- GET THIS MAN A HULK MOVIE! Restart, I don't care what you have to do, do it! The Avengers is right there with the Batman trilogy as the greatest superhero movie ever made."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,One awesome movie if you read marvel growing up you'll love it.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,The Avengers is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment. The experienced Joss Whedon and his very firm vision on the superhero world is tightly scripted and full of spectacular action.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"Think that maybe I lack the background to appreciate what most see in this adaptation. As someone not moved by Ironman1 and less so by 2 and moderately entertained by Thor, the Avengers was better but nothing more than that...better."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,good misses my rewind button felt like I was missing stuff. wired ending anyone understand it?
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Great movie. Satisfied my expectation.
"Oct 8, 2012",negative,"Slightly visually entertaining, however it was extremely unoriginal and action-packed, a Transformers film disguised as something greater by the occasional use of bad jokes."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Hulk stole the movie. A little long to get to the action but an awesome movie
"Oct 8, 2012",neutral,"While the movie does the action you crave from a superhero movie, the trailer for the movie is better than the real thing. You get all the best moments, minus one moment with the Loki-Doll fling but don't have to pay attention for the whole two and a half hours. The action was great, the execution of a full-scale movie, not so much. It was flashy, that was all. The substance was akin to eating a rice cake. My fix for men and women in spandex was barely satisfied; after watching, I feel like I need another two hours of something better. 

Will I buy it? Yes, because I have a superhero movie collection. Will this movie be forgotten in the bottom corner of my DVD case? Yep. Maybe in a few years it'll be slightly more interesting. 

Not once was ""Avengers, Assemble!"" uttered by the Captain, and that made me die a little inside, even moreso than the exclusion of Wasp and Ant Man in the lineup, but that could just be fangirl Nerd Rage speaking. I'll stick with the Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon series-- which was more hard-hitting and visceral than this thing."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,one of the best super hero movies ever.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,"The movie seemed to just fall short of the hype. The effects were interesting, but I felt there could have been more dynamic characters. The plot was predictable, but the humor was still enjoyable.  Of course, it's still a fun movie, and if people take it as that, they will probably enjoy it."
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Really slow and boring. Annoyed that Scar Jo wouldn't even attempt a Russian accent.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,When was the last time you had this much fun at the movies. honestly?
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,They all look great in the screen.
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Kanonbra underhållning!
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE OF THIS DECADE
"Oct 8, 2012",positive,Perfection!  Two and a half hours of superhero bliss.  Loved it.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!!!!! A stunning achievement by marvel that surpasses previous greats like iron man and Thor. Jose Whedon has done an amazing job not only bringing all the superheroes together but also the execution was perfect. The way that he incorporates all the heroes in it giving all of them plenty of camera time and serving an important function in the movie was vital in this movie coming together properly. The cineomatography was great and you can really tell that Whedon is not only a great director but also a fan of the franchise and being a fan he knows what other fans want to see which I believe is a big reason the movie was near perfect.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,http://zakzakaryas.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-avengers-2012.html
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,awesome movie! where was Spider Man?
"Oct 7, 2012",neutral,"I have to be honest and admit that the first time I saw 'The Avengers', I thought it was one of the greatest movies ever made.  I was so pumped coming out of it, I was extremely impressed..  But then I saw it two more times.  The second time my thoughts were ""Okay, hurry up, hurry up.  Lets get to the climax.""  But coming out of it I was still thinking it was a good movie.  Then the third time came around.  And after knowing everything that was coming, and giving the movie in whole a more in-depth look, I hate 'The Avengers'.  I'm one of few to say this.  

This movie is by far one of the most overrated movies I will ever see in my life.  It's box-office numbers and records will say otherwise, but I do believe that 'The Avengers' sucked.  I know that when I saw it the first time I came out like ""Holy crap!""  Well that was just awe at the magnitude of the final 30 minutes.  Maybe I am a little bias seeing I'm such a DC fan and I will never say there was a Marvel movie better than the TDK trilogy.  Yes, there were exciting parts to this movie and it was impressive how Joss Whedon was able to create this film.  But this movie was nothing special.

Now for me to get to what my personal problems were with this movie.  The two biggest problems I had were the length and the main focus on characters.  While making my complaints, I'm going to do a lot of comparing to 'The Dark Knight Rises' because that was the other HUGE superhero movie being released in 2012 (no offense to 'The Amazing Spider-Man' but I'd consider that a BIG movie, not HUGE).  

The most annoying problem for me was the length of the movie.  Only 142 minutes long? I know that still 20 minutes less than 'The Dark Knight Rises'.  But 'The Avengers' problem is that no one cares about Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Evans.  It's all about Downey Jr.  No one came to 'The Avengers' to see Scarlett Johansson or Jeremy Renner.  No one really cares much about Tom Hiddleston either.  If you thought Loki was a good bad guy, you're crazy.  Dude, we get it, you're still mad about the whole adoption thing.  These characters are the reason why this movie moves so slow.  I don't care about seeing all of The Avengers talking to each other.  I don't care about their problems with each other or what their inner demons are.  Or do I necessarily know where some of their inner problems even come from.  I mean, why mention Black WIdow's past if WE HAVE NO CLUE ANYTHING ABOUT HER.  Whedon tries to make every character matter, when they really don't.  Everyone just wants to see massive battles and huge explosions.  That's why its too long.  Too little fighting and too much talking.  Yes, he does make up for it at the end.  But save the audience the pain of listening all of the Avengers bitch and moan at each other.  Cut out most of the flying ship scenes and you've got a quicker pacing movie which would have probably been more enjoyable.

My second biggest problem goes off something I mentioned in my first complaint.  ITS ALL ABOUT ROBERT DOWNEY JR.  No one cares about the others? And why should they?  You've got Chris Evans coming off the weakest of all the Avenger movies, with 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.  There is Chris Hemsworth and his ""eh"" 'Thor'.  And there's Mark Ruffalo who is making his debut as Hulk.  But then theres the face of Marvel, RDJ.  With two huge 'Iron Man' movies, he's the man of the hour.  Or the man of two and a half hours.  This movie might as well have been called 'Iron Man and Friends'.  He is by far the biggest focus of this movie and for me, it takes away from the whole 'The Avengers' concept.  Whedon is lucky to have such a star save what could have possibly been a disaster.  I could not stand how much this movie relied off of Tony Stark.  Yes, he's the most famous.  And yes, he's by far the most humorous and complex character in the movie.  But this isn't 'Iron Man'.  This is 'The Avengers'.  Quit kissing up to RDJ and give the other actors a little more attention.  I would like to see how this movie would have turned out had there been no Downey Jr.

So to sum it up, I have a big distaste for this movie.  Maybe its just the fact that I hate so much humor in a superhero movie.  Maybe that all the humor comes from one actor.  Maybe its how thin this plot is.  Whatever way may be, I was thoroughly disappointed with the highest grossing movie of the year."
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,Another marvel movie that is ok with an average save the world plot and use of CGI makes it the ending fell very unbelievable.  My other complaint is that there was a lack of story for Nighthawk ( and dont say that just beacuase he was mind controlled that lets him have more wiggle room than any of the other characters) and also Black Widow ( who also is useless most of the movie and the only attention she really gets is in the beginning of the movie.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Action filled, good portrayal of the marvel characters! Didn't care for the actor changes from movie to movie but was still a great movie!"
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,just another high-tec movie!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"the best marvel movie ever , overall pretty messed up but very entertaining"
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Very good entertaing movie
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"The best superhero film ever made ! No loose ends, a highly entertaining story line with a strong dose of visual ecstasy and unexpected witty humor. The summer perfect flick."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"I enjoyed the avengers, was amazed that they were able to pull off this big of a cast with this many back stories.  While somewhat cheesy at times still entertaining."
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,"After years of buildup, and anticipation, its disappointing to think that ""The Avengers"" is just Average. If you have not seen all the previous films, you don't know whats going on. The film is over bloated and looks like a messed up rainbow."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"It stood there, but didn't try to jump higher. I had to sit and wait for it to be over. It wasn't a failure. Just average."
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,"I will never understand the hype about superhero movies. They're all the same. This one is no exception. Since it was such a huge blockbuster, I almost caved to the peer pressure and saw it in theaters, and now I'm exceptionally glad I didn't. I imagine it's probably well made and I guess I can almost understand why it appeals to its target audience, but it was not for me at all."
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,For the action lovers that dislike real story. Bring on the fire works and leave your brain at the door.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Hulk is a bad ass! Really good movie. Great effects and seeing super heroes in tiff with one and other... Is really cool. If they can keep the cast together they can keep making these indefinitely and I will watch them
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Absolutely love this movie! Thought I was going to be disappointed but I've been proven wrong. Right amount of humor right amount of action right amount of everything. Love love Love!!
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,"Sorry Comic Book fans. Typical comic book movie. Lots of exhausting CG, Lots of predicable action sequences and a very predictable and lackluster ending. These movies will continue to be produced and make lots of money, but that doesnt mean they are good. The Avengers will be productive in the box office but its trilogy will not hold up to the Dark Knight trilogy."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,a cinematic historical masterpiece!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Omg this was an amazing movie and hilarious!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,I actually own this movie and loved every second of it. i love ironman and lokie!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Most amazing superhero film ever!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Awesome film! Love the Avengers
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Another awesome Marvel movie :-)
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,It's so awesome and Action packed
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Whilst it was good, the story didn't particularly follow smoothly from the independent Avengers films (Iron Man, Captain America etc). Nor did the characters entice the level of emotion needed to watch the film, however it was incredibly funny."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Great movie. Perfect blend of action and comedy. Robert Downey Jr makes this movie hilarious as Tony Stark. Not as good as Nolan's Batman trilogy but a great comic book movie. Can't wait to see what happens next.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,If ya like ironman etc you need to watch this
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Awesome on Blu Ray! Love RDJ and Mark Ruffalo!
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Perfect comic book action movie. Blending cheesy one-liners with fantastic battle scenes. It ranks among the best super hero movies.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Easily the best film of the year, Marvel's ""THE AVENGERS"" follows the members of the Avengers Initative, Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (played by Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo), Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye/Clint Barton (played by Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (played by Scarlett Johanson), as they try to fight Thor's adopted brother, Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) with help from Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson). The last half an hour of this movie is easily the best fight of the last decade (maybe aside from Harry vs Voldemort in DH: Part 2). With some great character development, and a lot of hype due to the individual films leading up to this masterpiece, this film really knocked by socks off. I own it on DVD and Blu-Ray, and I'm proud to have it. Great film to watch when your bored, or if you just want to get yourself into an action mood. Rating: 4.5/5."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Very good and solid movie, in my opinion the Hulk stole the movie. Thor and him had some really good scences that were funny. Iron man and Captain America were really good too. Black widow and Jeremy Renner were outstanding in their characters. Saw it at the movies and bought thed dvd and will continue to enjoy it more."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"The beginning is just awful, a God escaping by truck and all SHIELD can throw at him is pistols, boy I feel safe, throw in a mysterious energy source and you have a small bang.  Fortunately it picks up quickly as the special effects are grand, the one liners are quick, and the fight between Thor and Iron Man is fun.  But right after that all the ruminations among the cast and an arrow can take out the helicarrier is another low point.  The large flying aliens have a definite Shadow of the Colossus look to them, which are spectacular.  Once the attack on the helicarrier happens the film moves along very fast with tons of action and lots of fighting.  At times the dialogue is witty other times just plain bad, especially when the superheroes get reflective.  This is perhaps the only superhero movie that looks and feels like it came from an actual comic book, this is due to all the characters are developed and the massive budget was well used.  The only time I could say they skimped on the budget was at the end when Iron Man is down and the Hulk screams at him.  I am sure that initially that Thor was supposed to hit him with lightening, like he did in their fight to boost the suit to 400%, to jump start him but they went with a scream.  The other obvious budget choices were Hawkeye and Black Widow, who have no superpowers and with the extensive lineup in the Avenger universe to choose from, most of whom are far more interesting than these two, it can only be deduced that these two were picked for budget.  But I am only complaining about two scenes and a continuity oddity as this is a highly enjoyable movie where the end battle with the invading army is very satisfying."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Marvelous, entertaining, suspense.... Best movie of the year. Love the combination of all hero! Can't wait to watch them again"
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Action from start to finish. I laughed out loud a bunch of times, the humor was very well done and timed. The story was a little too much but that is to be expected. A great ""popcorn"" movie."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon balances the story with the fim's star-power and character-strong front to create a one-of-a-kind comic book-based film.
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Saw this last night with Kristina......Enjoyable movie, Robert Downey steals every scene he's in! Lots of action and if you're a Marvel Comic fan or just love the ""Super Hero'"" movies, then this movie is for you! The special effects are awesome and there really is a story  line behind it.  All the other characters , Hulk, BlackWidow, Capt. America,Thor and Hawkeye all get their chance to shine. Looking forward to the next one!"
"Oct 7, 2012",negative,"With such high praise for this movie, I was excited to see it myself, hoping it would be the one to finally revive this increasingly trite genre. Disappointingly, this was nothing but re-purposed scraps of meat, ripped from preceding Marvel carrion, calculatedly sewn together with strings of transparent dialog, and re-packaged in a shiny new CGI facade."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"Iron Man, Captain America and Thor all in one movie, 'nuff said!!!"
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,Action action action. Almost as if I had Adhd
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,awesome movie! hope there is a sequel
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,"The best movie ever. (besides some others) Joss Whedon knows his stuff. He lets loose everything fanboys and girls wanted, and then some. I had high expectations, and this blew them away. I don't know how Finding Nemo got a better rating on Rotten Tomatoes, because this is the better film. Good humor, action, clever characters and writing, wow, what a movie. It redefines the superhero movie, and sets the bar very high for any sequels or other blockbuster films to come."
"Oct 7, 2012",positive,There's not much to say about this movie...except it is awesome. Nuff said.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"great way combo of super heros, just like the comic book"
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon continues his trend of high-quality works with The Avengers, which is easily one of the best superhero films of all time."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Very good super hero blockbuster that just fell short of amazing, top notch special effects including all your favorite heroes packed into one equals a unmissable two hour plus eye candy"
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Really funny and I love the action in it .. Awsome movie to watch !!!!!
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"When you have an all-star cast you are begging to have something good (Marvel's The Avengers) or something bad (Grown Ups), It's a good thing that is was a good movie. It has all the things an action movie needs, all the things that make good comedy, great performances for the cast, a lot of energy, ETC.!
If there's only one fault of the movie it would be the fact that you may need to see like 4 or 5 other movies to be ready for this... but you won't care once you get to this film, it more than lives up to the hype and it sets the bar higher for action and comic book movies."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,booooooooyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa imba hulk
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Good movie, about what you'd expect."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Was alot of fun, enjoyed it."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,GReat film. Keeps you engaged.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,This one is a lot of fun.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Honestly, It was just okay. 

You can completely tell that there was so much interest and hard work into making this film, especially the screenplay. The screenplay is the strongest aspect of the film. The special effects are a marvel. The acting was solid at best. The drive was surprising from the director, Joss Whedon. 

My only complaint would be the empty tragedy of the film, I never felt what the characters were feeling when they lost a member of their team. (Okay, I get it, it's an action film - but it doesn't mean that it has to be the only factor.)

Side Note: Although a tad over-hyped, it was still the best action film that I've ever seen from Marvel. Would truly be a wonder how Joss Whedon can outdo himself again for the sequel.

From,
Daniel V."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Hands down best super hero action movie I've ever seen. Amazing visual effects with great dialogue. I actually want to watch it again....
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Great movie :) I loved Robert Downey Jr. - he plays a great Iron Man.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Can not think of a dull moment in the entire film, amazing movie, amazing cast."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Better than I thought ;)
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Love it even more. After watching the prerequisites. Captain America, Thor and Iron Man.

I prefer the guy used here to the guy used in The Incredible Hulk."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,How in the world can you not like this movie?! AVENGERS RULE!!!!!!
"Oct 6, 2012",neutral,Fulfills general expectations.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Quite possible the best marvel film so far... Hulk was awesome(about time), mark ruffalo made him his own, should of play banner in last hulk movie..."
"Oct 6, 2012",neutral,Boring!  The end was ok the only good actors were Downey and Ruffalo as the Hulk.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,an excellent movie of its time I love how they blend all the characters together after their own movies
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"I absolutely loved this movie. Witty, good one liners, explosive action throughout, and first class special effects. utterly brilliant."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,the movie was pretty good. the action was great. was pretty funny at times as well. some of the scenes were a bit too cartoonish for me but it didnt take away from the movie overall. its the best film i have ever seen but its up there
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Gillar Iron Man mer.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,One of the best super hero movies I've seen in a very long time!
"Oct 6, 2012",negative,Uggg.  I could barely get through it.  The plot was atrocious.  Robert downey is still a treat though.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Fantastic super hero film and a great joy to watch. Would whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone and everyone!
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Graphics were amazing enjoyed it
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Excellent thrill ride. The single best superhero movie ever made. Joss is king!
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,You'd be loath to find a better medley of superheroes anywhere.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Very entertaining I'm just sad I missed it in IMAX
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,A lot of action and a good story plot.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Very high expectations, very low encounters."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever - bar none.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"absolutely brilliant. its just a damn shame that the uk release did not get triple play or at least a digital download so i, like others could add to their digital collection."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Best movie ever! Absolutely Awesome!
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Fun to watch Marvel super hero's.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Best part Hulk smash. BTW, how do Hulk's pants stay on?"
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,ALMOST NEAR PREFECT SCORE. The way the characters were brought together was great. *********Spoiler Alert******* Just did not like how Loki was able to turn other against the Avengers.
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,I like iron man the most
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"It was good but these Marvel movies are all the same to me...except ""Thor"", but that had a great Shakespearean slant."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"Really cool seeing so many superheroes in one movie; we even get to see them beat each other up. Good plot, good plot development; although I was expecting it to be a little more epic. Gets close to the boundary of being awesome without being cheesy, and there were a lot of ""man, you really should have seen that coming"" moments..."
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Surprisingly entertaining!
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"2 words! Marvel, Hulk!"
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,"This movie was action packed, had a great storyline and kept you on the edge of your chair!"
"Oct 6, 2012",positive,Great entertainment!:)
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,its so cool to see them together. a funny movie though not a comedy... i just expected more from this (=
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"While the action and the CGI are all fine and dandy, what makes the movie really pop is the humor and the humanity given to these larger than life characters. Even though they are superheroes out saving the world, you get the feeling that after they defeat the bad guy they would meet you to grab a beer at the bar."
"Oct 5, 2012",negative,"Bleak. Senseless. Over hyped. Not even Joss Wheadon could save this, though Downey tried."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,love it gotta see it now
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Robert Downey Jr. elevates the material.
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"The one disadvantage that this movie has is that if you don't watch all the other movies prior to this one, it won't make any sense. Nonetheless, The Avengers is a great film all the way through. By the end, youll be laughing, crying, and cheering for these heros. This is without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever made."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"Fantastic movie, I was thrilled through out the entire movie! Loved every second of it, and as soon as it came out on dvd I immediately bought it. Great group of actors and actresses, each playing their role to perfection. I would absolutely recommend this movie! Please watch, this is how every movie should be... the perfect amount of action, the perfect story-line, the perfect humor, the perfect amount of incredible sexy actors! Highly recommended!"
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, an so funny!!"
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Awesome superhero movie!
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"Puny God.  Nuff' Said.

But, seriously, I didn't think they could ever do an Avengers film right.  First of all, unlike the Justice League, these characters come from such diverse backgrounds that are completely in conflict with each other.  Well, color me wrong, Marvel.  You did it.

It was an extremely smart move for Marvel Studios to create links to each other within the main heroes' films.  But, at the same time, you don't have to see any of the individual films to understand ""Marvel's The Avengers.""

I think I can honestly say that this was the best superhero film to date."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"There were some funny moments, but there were a lot more moments where I knew the line was supposed to be a joke, but I wasn't laughing. There were big fabulous explosions and fight scenes and everything you would expect :) I though the characters were all giving a fair amount of time. Overall, a well made movie, but not one I fell in love with."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie! A few flaws, but who cares it has the HULK!!!!  HULK SMASH!!!!!"
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Favorite movie off the entire movie movie..make anther asap
"Oct 5, 2012",negative,...zzZzz...what the heck...what was this movie even about
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Perfect Superhero movie. There isn't a single flaw in it that I can find.
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"awsome hulk smashed, irion man rocked, thor brought the thunder, black widow and hawk eye were pure coolness, and captain america ruled. THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,A fun film that brings a story line and great acting all around. With a crew like this what could go wrong? (except for the unnecessary bow preparation every time you see bulls-eye) Funny and exciting with great CGI.
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,one of marvel's best movies yet
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"The assembly complete on what turns out to be the strongest movie of all the entries. This is down to a lot of things including Whedon's skill as a director and love of the source material, the fully formed characters that we have grown to know in the individual movies,all getting equal screen time and action, action, action! Hiddlestone is great as Loki but the movie needs a bigger villain and because of this, by no fault of his own, there is never really any doubt who will triumph. Superhero films don't all have to be dark like the Burton/Nolan Batman saga and can achieve greatness with a great director, fully formed characters and care for the comic material."
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,this is just my kind of movie.
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,"What a visual thrill and delight!! The Avengers delivers big time especially when watched in blu-ray on a big screen. I just wish I had an 80 inch screen because the FX's on this one were spectacular. Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army. Ironman is my favorite because of the remarkable gadgets and super cool mansion he has (he is quite arrogant but so smart) and his ironman suit is amazing. So Marvel's heroes are back: Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Ironman, Thor (Loki's brother), Black Widow, Hawkeye for the battle of their lives against Loki and his minions. Excellent special effects, battle sequences and frankly the last hour and 20 minutes was my favorite part. Highly recommended in blu-ray splendor!"
"Oct 5, 2012",neutral,Nice but nothing more...
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Great. Funny. Entertaining. Had great time watching it. Superb sense of humour. Gonna watch it again
"Oct 5, 2012",negative,Aimed towards boys in their lower teens. Boring. Seen it all before. Nice special effects though.
"Oct 5, 2012",positive,Very fun.  Good super hero movie.  Lots of playful cheesy goodness and awesome special affects.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Suddenly I care a lot about comic book super heroes. I never got it before this movie. Tom Hiddleston is the highlight.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Ultimately the greatest super hero flick I've seen. Extremely badass & out of this world action seen.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Great movie for any marvel fan!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Marvel has indeed set the bar up high... the question is whether or not they can top it in The Avengers 2.
"Oct 4, 2012",negative,Big scenes with Big machines.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"Its remarkable how well they did and how easy they made seem the task of bringing all of these characters together, everything feels so well assembled you wonder how any of these guys are going to work as individuals again after this. This is quality superhero movie making."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Awesome... ending was cool too. Watch all of it.... till the very end.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"I am a mom of boys, so I have to like superheroes; this was a good superhero movie."
"Oct 4, 2012",negative,crappy movie... totally disliked it !
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Great movie saw it twice
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"Okay, if you like super hero style movies this is as good as it gets! Worth it for the Hulk scenes alone. Story, acting, and cinematography are all actually very good. Of course, the special effects rock."
"Oct 4, 2012",negative,Too boring I just couldn't get in to it took an hour and a half just to get to the action and the previews are the last half hour of the movie it's a waste of money!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Best movie. Movie of the year
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Perfect superhero movie by marvel! Probably the best part is the surprising depth and the welcomed comic relief along with the crossing of ideas from previous movies!

"Oct 4, 2012",positive,AMAZING! I didn't even read the MARVEL comics but I loved that movie!
"Oct 4, 2012",neutral,Not a bad film. The idea of using Gods from Norse Mythology as Villains was a disappointment.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,this movie was great
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Dug it. Maybe Joss will take his loot and make a firefly sequal? ( please! )
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Best movie this summer!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"very good live action interpretation from the animations version, good act, good actors, i love robert downey jr as stark, and mark rufallo's banner is perfect, satisfying enough plot (fury: ""it's about him"" pointing at thor), little details jokes here and there (hulk riding the motorcycle anyone?), it's so good i will definitely buy the originals DVD or Blueray, and i rarely does that."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"I was doubtful this film would be successful, as I am with any comic book movie as they are a hit and miss genre, but wow! The Avengers was awesome! It was so much fun and I can't wait to see what Joss Whedon does next with his new franchise. Oh, and I'm sorry for doubting you Joss, I know I shouldn't have as everything you've done is brilliant (except Dollhouse - I wasn't into that)."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Is def a good movie. I can watch it over and over again and still be entertained every time I watch it
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,I've seen bits and pieces can't wait to see it
"Oct 4, 2012",negative,"Joss Whedon's widely influenced summer spectacular offers 130 minutes of popcorn-friendly fun, yet fails to deliver anything more than run-of-the-mill escapist entertainment. Tom Hiddleston is superb as Shakespearian villain Loki and Mark Ruffallo gives The Hulk some heart, yet the film's character development is minimal, its plot slow and formulaic, and its screenplay drizzled in gooey one-liners and excessive fanboy cream. Things pick up a little during the final act, but even a swooping, snarling Manhattan sky-battle isn't enough to save The Avengers from feeling bloated and underwhelming."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,The story is great. The acting is great. The action is great. I'm glad this movie is in my DVD collection!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a perfect example of what a large ensemble superhero movie should be. All the characters are well rounded and their motivations are also not lost in the shuffle. With real drama, comedy and great dialog The Avengers delivers on multiple levels and will likely be the measuring stick by which future (non-Batman) superhero films will be judged by.

Marvel did a brilliant job of marketing this film by releasing ""origin"" films about almost all of the characters. You can certainly watch and enjoy The Avengers without seeing the other Marvel films that came out in the last few years but your enjoyment and understanding of the plot and it's subtext will be far better understood if you watch the other films (Like Thor) prior to seeing The Avengers.

Definitely a ""Must See"" for anyone who loves Comic Books and/or Superhero movies. You won't be disappointed by ""The Avengers."""
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"This was an incredibly fun film which rarely takes itself seriously but with such a witty script and great action along with some good performances why should it? Its not a perfect film by any means and some of the jokes are a bit too silly but you will still have loads of fun and despite the pace slowing at times, it makes up for it with the huge fight at the end."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Love to watch it again and again! excellent movie for all
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,it was funny and action packed great movie
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"I don't think that this movie could've been better. It was really confusing in the start, but you're really in it in the end. It hat some really funny moments in the movie. And specially mr. Banner (Hulk) did a really funny entrence. I look forward to the next movie coming."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,perfect just perfect wouldn't. change anything...
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Whedon impressively manages to give attention to 8 primary characters. When the movie deals with humor and interpersonal banter it's fun and enjoyable. When it deals with action and emotion it is uninteresting and false.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,This Movie Is Awesome!!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"nice action scenes , i like this movie"
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,One of the best marvel movies ever.I loved it.
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"In 2008, audiences everywhere were thrilled by Iron Man, a smart, funny, and exciting superhero film that knew exactly what its audience wanted. But what really made audiences go wild was Samuel L. Jackson's appearance in the end credits as Nick Fury, talking about the ""Avenger Initiative"". Since then, Marvel has released a slew of films that all tie in to the same universe, including Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man 2. While all of those films were good, none was able to match the charisma of the first Iron Man. When The Avengers was inevitably announced, two possibilities arose: Either Marvel films would return to Iron Man glory, or the steady decline of quality mixed with the excess of characters would create an absolute train wreck.
The Avengers doesn't waste time bringing you in to the story, and it makes no effort to introduce the main characters to you. It assumes you've already seen the origin films, and chances are, if you are seeing The Avengers, you have. Still, for a new viewer, this may make the first 20 minutes of the film awkward and confusing. In the first five minutes we meet an alien race called the Chitauri; are shown the Tesseract, which is an energy cube that is capable of destroying the entire planet; and meet the villain, Loki, who has come to Earth via portal. If you aren't Marvel savvy, these are the kinds of things that will confound you in the beginning.

"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"Tom Hiddleston is an enticing Loki. Robert Downey Jr doesn't just play Tony Stark he IS Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo takes the Hulk to a new level. Scarlett Johansson returns as a badass Black Widow. I love this movie. The actors are completely invested and I can't think of any weak links. Joss Whedon, king of nerds, does not disappoint. This is quite frankly the best movie I've ever seen."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,BEST FILM EVER!!!!!!!!
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,great but too much drama
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"Great action and plot, I can't blink or I will miss something type of movie."
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,Fan boy dream come true
"Oct 4, 2012",positive,"I'm sorry but this film is but a action movie that failed in the narrative section for me. I was hoping for a marvel story that took itself a lot more seriously. A lot of the humor in this film was misplaced and some of the plot items did not really settle well with me.
Overall, a mediocre action movie for me."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"This is my favorite movie. It has everything, action, comedy, drama, everything anybody could want."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,can watch this movie over and over :-)
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Possible the best superhero mash up of all time. If not, then it is one of the first! It is very hard not to like this film. You got the following heroes: 

Iron Man (my favorite) 
Black Widow (girl in leather, like all the other girls)
Captain America (cough, nerd, sorry I meant to say nerd)
The Incredible Hulk (smash!)
Hawkeye (wouldn't even survive the Hunger Games!)
Thor (he's a DEMIGOD here!)

Great writing, plot, and action with very stunning visuals, Marvel's the Avengers is one heck of a ride! I really enjoyed watching this film and hope the sequel (obviously) is great and not just ""thrown"" to cash in the success."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Its testament to Joss Whedon's talents that he was able to inject more character development  into a single movie containing four superheroes than any of the four individual movies about one of those superheroes. The Avengers greatness lies in the relative simplicity of its story and the reliance on the heroes to move that story along in an entertaining but emotional - and often humourous - way. The film has three very distinct acts - 1. Loki's threat is revealed and The Avengers are assembled 2. Loki makes his move and 3. All hell breaks loose (literally!). All the main heroes get equal screen time and equal chance to shine - bringing their unique talents to the fight - and even the two side heroes (Hawkeye and Black Widow) get a nice little sub-story each. The Avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies promised and it doesn't disappoint - amping the action up to 11 in a finale that the Transformers franchise attempted three times and failed at three times! Awesome!
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,One of my new favs!!
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie period.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"While I enjoyed The Avengers, I still think it is very overrated. A good, but definitely not great, superhero blockbuster, filled with many flaws and dumb dialogue."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Ca donne le resultat escompter un gros paquet de heros, de l'action bien ficeler. Tres bon mais rien de jamais vu.."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,wish Hawkeye and the girl got more screen time but it is a big cast of heros so i understand
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,An entertaining movie that has nothing going on beneath the surface.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Loved this movie....but not as much as Batman!
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Loved it and funny never watched the other characters besides iron man now I want to see the other movies
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"A ""fresh"" rating well-earned. Iron Man and Cap are the best"
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,A great movie compendium deriving from previous multiple marvel films. A great movie for all.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Really good. Really funny.  I didn't have high expectations because I thought it would be TOO much, but it could've been a better balance. Really fun and awesome."

"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Ok, This Worked. Especially The Ending."

"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"In my taste of action movies, the theme is off, though some of the details aren't so bas."
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,A fun summer movie. Loved the pairings of the leads.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,By far my favourite super hero movie...
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Proper enjoyed this film, it was gripping, I bought the box set which included Thor & Captain America, and I'm glad I didn't watch Avengers before watching them two first as it would've been a waste of time.
Was a brilliant storyline though and having it bring back characters from the previous films (which weren't quite as good) is what made the film and brought the characters together.  Can't quite understand how Thor got back to Earth though... since they blew the bridge in Thor.

Marvel's best character has to be Iron Man though, I think Cobie Smulders did a fantastic job, especially if your a follower of HIMYM then it's good to see her in something else doing something quite different to the norm.  

Was disappointed to see that Ed Norto wasn't the Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo did a good job of it.

A must see *****"
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever! It has an unforgettable story and suprising humor!
"Oct 3, 2012",negative,Crap (brilliant effects and sound) but still crap.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"this movie is a comedy, superhero rock star.............the AMAZING visual effects, the awesome attitude of Tony Stark, the awesome hulk..........and the funny-looking villain.......!!!!!
These all things make this an awesome movie.....and a BILLIONAIRE......!!!!"
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Great movie for a sequel to all of them.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,This movie is nothing short of Satisfactory! Awesome cast! I love how they brought back (almost) all the original cast members from their own movies into one great movie. Only con about it is they changed Hulks character again.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,Full of action...effects are awesome.
"Oct 3, 2012",positive,"Exhilarating, visually superb, thoroughly acted, and action-packed, The Avengers is one of the greatest action-hero films in recent years."
"Oct 2, 2012",neutral,"weak. weak weak.  haven't seen Thor, but captain America was a weak movie as in keeping your interest.  story doesn't flow smoothly.  avenger is just a loud exploding mess of superheroes.  like transformers 2.  iron man 1 and 2 are the best of the group.  RDjr. is the only thing saving this movie"
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"The Hulk's one-liners and Iron Man's snarky-ness make the movie.  The action sequences are very well done but drag on a bit.  Per usual, Samuel L Jackson is so foul."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"One of my favorites. Why? Great cinematography, especially the Plan style scene during the invasion. Acting was fantastic, with even better chemistry with the characters. The film just pulled together so well in all areas. Yes the story can be predictable, but usually a Hero's Journey structure is. Also the movie has explosions and people assume it is a Michael Bay film... what else do you want when a city is being invaded? Puppies? Some need to get off the high horse and realize how films are made."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"Good, a lot of action and fighting."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,awesome action packed.  definetly lives up to hype. also a comic relief
"Oct 2, 2012",negative,Superhero films are quite repetitive.
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Probably the best movie EVER! ? it!!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,I really enjoyed this movie
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"Liked it, but didn't love it. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo were the best, but I like them in anything. A fun, mindless superhero movie."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"Funny, captivating, strong, active and good texts. Usually not my type of movie but this one smokes!"
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Best movie!!!! Even for the second time.....I would watch it again too!!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,An excellent movie all around. Good character development good plot development.
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,I enjoyed this movie!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie ever.
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"hulk class..iron man class....thor = cheese, loki = gimp, hawkeye - cool, capt america = lame, hot chick = hot, nick fury = fustrated pirate"
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a must see with superb special FX, and plot development.  So far there is nothing that can top this."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,PEWNY GOD AWESOME MOVIE
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Loved this movie. Can watch this a zillion times over!!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,a really good marvel film. it is a action packed blast.
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"Great, but not brilliant.  There was no real point in the film being in 3D (I've seen it in both 2 and 3).  A good start to an Avengers franchise, so I'll look forward to the follow-up"
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"""This was great! I have watched it three times so far. I am going to watch it again."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"At least half an hour too long and the Avengers fighting as one are underused, but that aside and you've got a visual treat, with Tom Hiddleston's performance to steel the show."
"Oct 2, 2012",neutral,"In order to understand the situation of my review I'll clear some things up. I saw this on a regular movie screen, no 3D and no IMAX so maybe I wasn't fully engrossed in this film due to the medium I chose to view it in, but lets cut the crap, if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and IMAX sized screens to be ""TOTALLY AWESOME, BRUH."" it was never that solid to begin with. That being said lets analyze the film shall we? So here is the main problems with The Avengers as a whole, it relies too much action with too little meaning. What did I expect though, right? Well I expected something a little less cookie cutter than this.

If Transformers is a bad movie (which it is and far worse than this.) for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to, The Avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason. God bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years, because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service. There is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades. Everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much Star Wars prequels-equse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious film.

The avengers isn't irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly Colby Slomders of How I met Your Mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and Mark Ruffalo's take on The Hulk impressed me. The action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film.

At the end of the day I think the film was too much Bang and not enough buck. As I was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said ""I thought there would be a lot less talking."" my inner monologue rebutted ""Wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched?"" but this is what it is. If you are a fan of superhero movies you'll probably love this. If you are fan of things that blow up and implode you'll probably love this too. Fans of focused films with a little more story and character development, maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way I do about it.

My one sentence summary of The Avengers, ""2 and half hours of non-specific escapism."" I that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then I recommend it. If not id pass or wait for a rental."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,As much as everybody said they loved this movie I still would only watch it once.
"Oct 2, 2012",negative,"Miksi miksi miksi??!!!??? katon taas näitä Marvelin elokuvia! X-Menit oli hyviä, Daredevil oli tosi hyvä, Ihmeneloset oli hyviä, Wolverine oli hyvä, jopa Hulk oli ok, mutta sen jälkeen onkin pitkä matka muihin. Näyttelijät on todella epäuskottavia, ja aina jotain ihme örkkejä hyppii liukuhihnalta vaan lisää tapettavaksi. Ei näissä oo enää aikoihin ollu mitään juonta. Ja mitä on tapahtunu Samuel L. Jacksonille? Joskus taitava näyttelijä on vain varjo entisestään näissä mikkihiiri-rooleissa. En tajua miten tätäkin elokuvaa on kehuttu niin paljon, koska mun mielestä tämä oli aika paska. Jos / kun toivottavasti joskus tehdään vielä elokuva Deathlokista tehdään elokuva, aion katsoa sen, mutta vastedes yritän pysyä näistä elokuvista kaukana. Ajanhukkaa."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Great superhero flick! Good storyline and special effects ! Two thumbs up!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Brought all those super heroes into one giant movie and it didn't fall apart! Job well done!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,"if you saw the trailer, you know what the last 20 minutes of the this movie is.  If you want to see a better movie, watch Iron Man, Thor or Captain America."
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Sooo much fun to watch. Watching all the prequels is a must though...
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Is an average movie without 3-d !
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,loved it! its funny as well
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,awesome movie! got my copy on blue ray
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,Huge success! Perfect everything! I am buying this when it's out on DVD!
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,This was great big blockbuster fun.  Entertaining for its superhero action and its witty script.  Also Cobie Smulders.... hot.
"Oct 2, 2012",positive,The Best Of The Marvel Superhero Movies By Far
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,well im more of an xmen girl but this is still a great super hero movie
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,The best movie ever!!!!!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Simply put... The best superhero movie of all time hands down...
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,I saw this movie with my 13 year old daughter and was pleasantly surprised. I'm more of a drama movie person but there was so much going on that it held my attention. Great flick!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"magnifica pelicula...no da respiro ni por un segundo. Además del hecho de que no se necesita ver las peliculas como thor y el capitan america para entenderla, la historia atrapa al expectador desde el principio hasta el final"
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Absolutely awesome movie from start to finish!! could watch this 1000 times and never get tired of it!!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,I loved seeing all those characters!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"Hands down one of the greatest movies I have ever watched!  Characters, nailed. Story, terrific. Non-stop action!  Joss Wheadon, you've done it again!  #serenitynow"
"Oct 1, 2012",negative,"I did not enjoy this very much. I usually like these kind of movies but this one was just beyond lame. Archery is not a super power. Scarlett Johansson is not special either. It was weird and stupid that there were like 0 casualties. There should have been lots of bloody, dying, screaming people. I'm amazed by how many people really liked this. For real. Amazed."
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,not only is this the best superhero movie ever but this is one of the best action movies ever!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Awesome! Funny and brilliant cast!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Awesome especially when hulk slings lokey around lokey I think is thors adopted bro
"Oct 1, 2012",neutral,"I really liked Thor and with all the good reviews I was really looking forward to seeing this movie too.   The villain in Avengers was Loci from Thor, a character I liked.  Maybe not the best character in Thor, but I thought the conflict in him whether he wanted to be a villain (by wiping out the Frostgiants) or whether he wanted to be a good guy (like when he killed the leader of the Frostgiants after he invited him to kill his sleeping father) was fascinating.  However, what we got in Avengers was a Loci that was the stereotypical villain only.  The plot was very boring and predictable too.  I am only marginally reccommending this movie because the action is good and Robert Downey Jr. gives his usual strong performance as Iron Man"
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Great shoot-it-up fun with a stellar cast makes this Marvel's best film to date.
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Absolutely brilliant great comedy but still able to be taken seriously. Storyline absolutely well done.
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,It's everything a superhero movie should be and so much more.
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"You have to suspend disbelief for a superhero movie anyhow, but the flying aircraft carrier is jumping the shark a little too much...otherwise good movie..."
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"Good movie, but Hunger Games was better."
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Best marvel film to date
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen...A MUST C!!!
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Nothing new here guys. Lots of shit blowing up. Lots of iron man. Lots of the same ol' stuff over and over again....
"Oct 1, 2012",neutral,Very mediocre...not a great story or action
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,Best movie I've ever seen hands down
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"an amazing movie, great lead up linking up with all the separate movies & I'm glad they didn't rush the story AWESOME MOVIE! if you haven't seen it go watch it! :)"

"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"This movie was one of those rare instances of piling a bunch of stand-alone characters together in one movie and still being able to make each and every one of them shine. With a coherent plot, I might add!"
"Oct 1, 2012",neutral,"Hero,Heros Boom,Booms there... it OK."
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"In itself, this is a fantastic film. But it manages this because of its past. The movies that followed before help set up much of the backstory, so there isn't any real time wasted on explaining things. It's a luxury most movies do not have.  And being the first film to really have a team of superheroes, Avengers gets an automatic induction into awesomeness, helped by some spectacular setpieces. 

But don't be fooled: it's actually pretty hollow and there are numerous strange plotholes. The film's sheer momentum gloss over these and it deserves all the praise it got. Yet a sequel will expose these shortfalls and The Avengers might be the highwater mark for this franchise."
"Oct 1, 2012",positive,"Hilarious, exciting, and a lot of fun, The Avengers goes above and beyond the average blockbuster."
"Oct 1, 2012",negative,"terrible, i don't understand why superhero movies are so popular, this movie sucked big time"

"Sep 30, 2012",positive,loved this movie! Full of action!
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"After taking some time away from the movie & revisiting it on DVD/Blu-Ray

It has first act pacing issues.
There is friction between characters for no reason, they just start off that way...
Lame alien bad guys are a MacGuffin that never actually feel that threatening. We're just told they want to conquer earth.

Thor was excellent but his journey in the first movie is useless and completely wasted because his relationship in this movie with Loki is incredibly different. They don't feel like brothers, they feel like James Bond & Blofeld.


I could go on but the thing is, this movie, dispite all of it's flaws is fucking fun. It's pretty clever as far as dialogue play is concerned & the camera work is awesome. The characters are great and loveable, driven by a very strong cast.

I'd watch a 2nd Avengers, I just hope we spend more time with the characters battling a WORTHY opponent."
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"Some apparent weaknesses in the plot, but the witty dialogue and the well directed action scenes still make this a worthwhile watch: 85/100."
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,Awesome movie must own

"Sep 30, 2012",positive,best movie of the year!

"Sep 30, 2012",positive,Action packed but the story is very shallow.  Would liked to have seen some back story to add to the comic book series.
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,Great just watched it on demand gonna grab the bluray for all the extras
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"Just enough of everything to make it alright.  Good action, characters, special effects, script, and finale.  You just can't really fault it."
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,May be the best hero movie ever!
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,It's a fun and entertaining eye candy filled adventure.  Tr banter with Downey Jr. And the others is what stood out the most and second is the weird relationship between hulk and Thor. I recommend a blu-ray an HD tv and just take in the summer block buster.

"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"Storyline was pretty stupid. I feel like I've seen this phallic energy shit a few times too much. I enjoyed Hulk & Thor. RDJ is hot. The rest are sideshows. And again, why the fuck is Nick Fury black?"
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,It was ok better than the franchise films the characters are assembled from enjoyable couple of hours had
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"My bros' and my childhood crush ""The Marvel's Super heroes""... :)"
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"This movie is what it is. I have heard people say they hated and and being over critical of it. But the reasons they presented for hating it were ridiculous. Mostly being points about plots and dialouge. The movie puts together a fantastic cast of  
Rober Downey Junior (Ironman), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Chris Evans (Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Jeremy Rennor (Hawkeye) and Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), (ie eye candy that doesn't have to be saved every five minutes, Michael Bay im looking at you).  It sets itself up quite early were your ineveitably going to end up with a big face off between good and evil, and as the action in this film goes, top notch. So if you enjoy action, superheroes and a bit of comedy it is a fantastic watch. If your going to question the dialouge (essentially witty banter among all of the superheroes) don't bother, go read a book, ensure its not a graphic novel as you may fall into the same pitfall."
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,WHAT GOD.... BAHAHAHA!
"Sep 30, 2012",positive,"Oh yes, vengeance is indeed oh so sweet... in the second half. Granted, these people aren't entirely clear on who in the world they're actually exacting vengeance for, though it's a safe bet that they're avenging the poor victims of sick evildoers like Jeremiah Chechik. Sure, other than the title and having a redhead in a cat suit, Chechik's ""The Avengers"" has pretty much nothing in common with this film, though it nevertheless pretty much tainted this film's name, which is probably why the Brits, the people who did the TV show upon which Checknik's flop is based, titled this film ""Avengers Assemble"", and why plenty of people, including Rotten Tomatoes, in the States make good and sure to distinguish this film by suddenly refering to it as ""[u]Marvel's[/u] The Avengers"". Personally, I think that this film's title probably should have been ""WWE Presents the Real World: Marvel Ultimate Universe"", and for all I know, that may very well have been the original title. Shoot, forget crossover between some of the latest Marvel films, with all of the brawling and bickering going on, this film is more like a crossover between reality TV and professional wrestling, only much better, not just because everyone's likable or because so much is well-done, but because this film doesn't mess around, and lets you know that its world isn't real. We're talking about aliens, a super solider, a god of thunder, some dude who turns into a green muscle monster when stressed, then, evidently, subsequently changes into a different person (Seriously, how many people are they gonna get to play Bruce Banner?), and a, as Tony Stark himself put it, ""genius billionaire playboy philanthropist"" in an armored battle suit, and last time I checked, the titluar leads's ex-husband from ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" and Robin Scherbatsky from ""How I Met Your Mother"" (Wow, these film's casting director must love CBS sitcoms) as high-ranking agents for a highly advanced peacekeeping organization is far-fetched enough, though at least all of this over-the-top stuff have sure made for some enjoyable films both by their own rights (Except Ang Lee's ""Hulk"") and when they're all together. Still, as good as this film is, it's not quite [u]Marvel[/u]ous (Get it?), being unable to avenge the bite that it should have had and goes struck down by quite a few factors.

Clocking in at 143 minutes, the film provides more than enough time to flesh itself out, yet the problem is that when I say that this film provides more than enough time, I mean, ""more than enough"", as this film goes excessively padded out, not by filler, but by way too much material, and material that's often rather bland. The film's expository aspects and, by extension, the film itself are at their most flawed during the immediate development segment, which has occasions in which it slapdashes certrain crucial pieces of story establishment and exposition (Thor's means of arrival to Earth is ever so briefly mentioned and the point in which Thor comes to fully recognize the Avengers as his allies is hardly even touched upon; it gets that messy), thus creating an awkwardness that goes bested only by the awkwardness found within the early acts' much more prominent flaw of, ironically, providing too much exposition, to where things drag on and on and get to be repetitious, as well as even a bit bland, and it's made all the worse by the film's taking on a dry atmosphere that all but dulls things down. Don't get me wrong, with all of its having spots that hit lower than others, this film is ceaselessly, at worst, quite good, so of course the early act isn't too terribly problematic or bland, yet the damage that it deals to the momentum of the film still stands, and firmly enough to where, after a while, the film nearly lost me, only to quickly pick up at its body, though not take off too far, for although the body of the film is particularly strong, and grows more so as it progresses, it all too often continues to be near-blandly over-expository and excessively overdrawn, not to where the film falls too short, yet to where just about every particularly high, if not all-out excellent spot in the film finds itself undercut by the more prevalent extended periods of relative blandness that both slow down momentum and remind you of this story's not having as much sweep as the film would like. Something that goes underemphasized is the fact that this film's scope is surprisingly minimalist, isolating all of the many things that it has to cover within a timeframe of just barely over 48 hours, and in that timeframe, and with subject matter such as this, you can't do much, so this film was always doomed to fall short of truly marvelous (Marvel pun not intended that time), which isn't to say that the it doesn't try, tackling its limited subject matter with inspiration and depth, though perhaps too much. As I've said time and again, this film delivers on too much exposition for its own good, and before you know it, a film that should clock in at just under two hours clocks in at just under two-and-a-half hours and goes overblown with too much ambition-driven depth that contradicts the intentions of the minimalist subject matter, to where you really do see the fine line between depth and mere blockbuster entertainment, and to where the film often gets to be almost awkwardly overambitious, thus pronouncing the limitations in bite within the story even more. I'm not gonna lie, I was going in with, not simply high hopes, but high expectations, and at times, this film does, in fact, meet expectations, yet those truly remarkable moments stand few and far between, and divided by long periods in which this film finds itself limping along, until the final product finally falls short of its potential for excellence. That being said, this film doesn't fall too short of its potential, for although the film has its shortcomings, and just enough for it to be not much more than adequately rewarding, the fact of the matter is that it does reward, delivering more often than not on what it should, while never ceasing to deliver on a stylistic level.

Seamus McGarvey's photography is handomely defined in its lighting and color, to where it breathes both livliness and even a degree of grit the atmosphere of the film, while quite a few nifty, or even grand shots supplement a sense of sweep that nearly takes your breath away at times, much like the film's more technical aspects. Yet another highly intricate and seamless testament to the magic of modern filmmaking technology, this film's visual effects range from phenomenal to something you've to see to believe, fitting into this environment very convincingly, to where it helps you in buying into this world, while boasting dynamicity and livliness that dazzles, especially during the action sequences, during which, this film particularly accels. The photography, visual effects and other production and technical aspects are all remarkable by their own individual rights, yet when it all comes together in the heat of battle, the film is nothing short of golden, as each action sequence is so brilliantly dynamic and grandly well-executed, being quite well-concieved and very well-staged in a fashion that's nothing short of spectacular, which isn't to say that there aren't pieces of action that are more phenomenal than others. When action comes into play, it goes on and on, until by the time we come to this film's final act, we are left facing ceaseless action, and really, I wouldn't have it any other way, because by that point, the film fulfills its duties as an upstanding piece of blockbuster spectacle, as you'd be hard pressed to not find yourself hooting and hollering during, well, any action sequence, especially the one that occupies this film's lengthy climax. The film is a blockbuster, and a generally entertaining one, going held back by its problematic thematic unevenness, and even then, it's not like the substance that all too often blands up this stylish film of only so much conceptual bite is too problematic, for although the story isn't especially powerful, it remains generally strong, as Joss Whedon reminds you, through his screenplay alone, delivering on sparkling dialogue and sharp humor, as well as many a colorful set piece. As for the depth within this film, I feel as though the flaws within its incorporation lay more within Whedon's direction than his screenplay, for although the script provides perhaps too much exposition, to where things get to be a bit exhaustingly overblown and disconcertingly contradictory to this story concept's limited weight, the fact of the matter is that there is plenty of depth within this film, something that you can't say as much as you should about too many films of this type, and while I wish this film had more scope to it to back up that depth, Whedon provides inspired characterization and story flesh-out that establishes intrigue and, yes, even emotional resonance. Whedon's script has its faults, yet keeps consistently colorful, with wit and lively set pieces that supplement entertainment value, as well as much flesh-out and resonance that supplement the story with more substance than it probably should have, yet either way just enough substance for you to find yourself intrigued, while what leaves this film's substance to, not simply intrigue, but compel, is the execution of Joss Whedon's script by, well, Joss Whedon, as director.

Joss Whedon goes into this project with ambition, and too much of it, to where he taints his worthy vision overambition to make worse the awkwardness spawned from certain flaws in Whedon's direction, which, regardless of how I make it sound, really isn't too terribly flawed in the long run, or at least not when you compare upon weighing in the strengths within Whedon's direction, for although the strengths within Whedon's direction all too often go undercut by the film's natural and directorial shortcomings, Whedon generally backs up his ambitions with a colorful atmosphere that breathes life into the consistent, if not near-ceaseless entertainment value of this film, yet not at the expense of an inspired atmosphere that goes primarily powered by depth and intrigue. A problem that has held back - occasionally to the state of underwhelmingness - the precursors to this film, as well as other superhero films of this type, is a lack of depth, yet with this film, there's too much depth, to where the final product's thematic intentions are rendered a bit fuzzy, and to where things get to be a bit too bland at times, and that is what keeps this film from being truly excellent; and yet, at the same time, this film's depth - a bit overbearing at times though it may - is a large part of why the final product comes close to excellence, as Whedon crafts a generally compelling atmosphere to make all the sharper the entertaining story and, of course, the characterization, which goes sharpened further by the performers behind the characters. Tom Hiddleston stands out among this cast, for although his Loki character is lacking in the depth that made him a sympathetic antagonist in ""Thor"", Hiddleston compensates by portraying the dark depths within Loki with such slick charisma and effectiveness that he earns your investment in him as a highly effective antagonist just as, if not more sharply than he did in ""Thor"". Still, although Hiddlestone stands out, most everyone has his or her time in the sun, with former secondary characters returning in bigger roles, and therefore with more material that the performers behind them play up sharply, with Clark Gregg, Jeremy Renner and, especially, Samuel L. Jackson charming immensely, while the always stunning Scarlett Johansson, now a bonafide lead, rather than the just-there secondary that she was in ""Iron Man 2"", relies on more than just her darn good look, delivering on charisma and, at times, even emotional range and depth that defines the mysterious Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff and leaves Johansson to also stand out, though not quite as much as her other leads: the people we have seen deliver before and are really here to see, which isn't to say that all of the faces we're eager to see are familiar. Edward Norton may have had little to work with in ""The Incredible Hulk"", but Mark Ruffalo is still stepping into the shoes of one of the greatest actors alive, so of course there's a sense of longing for Norton to go with the initial shock towards the off-putting recast, yet it doesn't take long at all before Ruffalo comes into his own and becomes Bruce Banner through his assured capturing of the distinct colorful and emotional depths that define the character, thus leaving Ruffalo to, as predicted, comfortably fall right into the crowd and stand as worthy in the presence of the more experienced primary members of this star-studded cast of transformative talents, all of whom are as sharp as they were when we were first introduced to them as the characters they so effortlessly became. The Thor character returns as a more relatively human and both literally and figuratively down-to-earth yet still powerful force that Chris Hemsworth once again nails with a powerfully charming yet still somewhat emotionally-involved presence, and Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers returns as a tainted yet noble and more authoritative force that Chris Evans nails with a charismatic and confident presence, while Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark returns as the same-old-same-old, which is just the way I like it, seeing as how Robert Downey, Jr. once again portrays the character with such effortlessly explosive charisma. By their own rights, each performer is as, if not more engaging than you'd expect, and make their charisma all the sharper through crackling chemistry that helps perhaps the most in making this ensemble as sharp as it is, and goes into the big batch of strengths that sadly don't have enough momentum behind them to punch this film out of shortcomings and into genuine excellence, yet still power this film enough to bring it close to excellence, because, when it's all said and done, this film hits much more often than not and ultimately rewards as a strong blockbuster experience, even if it does stand to have a bit more bite to it.

To ""assemble"" (Get it?) a wrap-up, the film is blandly over-expository and disconcertingly overambitious, with excessive material that doesn't quite gel with this minimalist subject matter, thus creating a kind of awkward thematic unevenness and drag factor that sadly stand as just prevalent enough to leave this final product to fall short of bonafide excellence, though just barely, as this film is rarely, if ever any worse than quite good, with quite a few truly remarkable high points, backed up by incredible action - complimented by fine photography and phenomenal visual effects - and a script that delivers on clever color and intriguing, if not rather resonant depth, brought to life by Joss Whedon's inspired direction and a sparklingly charismatic cast, from which, effective antagonist Tom Hiddlestone and leads Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans (There are more Chrises than Bruce Banners) and Chris-I mean, Robert Downey, Jr. stand out and - with the help of crackling chemistry - go into making ""WWE Presents the Real Wor-I mean, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (Evidently, ""Marvel's"" is part of the title) an often entertaining, sometimes resonant and thoroughly enjoyable ensemble blockbuster.

3/5 - Good"

- Very entertaining...enjoyed it just as much the 2nd time, and really got a kick out of Loki.

- This one was very entertaining, Whedon did a good job of balancing the multiple characters.  Ruffalo(Hulk0 and Downey Jr. were the standouts.  Check it out!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,Not bad but not as good as Iron Man 1 - RDJr is as good as always with Hulk getting the other good bits
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,love it it was funny and cool
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,I love the great comedy and exciting action in this movie! I know I will watch it several times!
"Sep 29, 2012",neutral,"Watch the film for it's sensational special effects certainly not for the embarrassing performances of the cast. The actors don't even make an attempt to act with any sort of human realism at all. It's horribly overacted and like every other ""major blockbuster"" has to have sexual implications on an attractive female role (Johansson). It seems like very few people with real respect for film would by into this nonsense other for the admittedly great progress in special effects department. But honestly, it seems that sexual implications and over the top special effects are taking over the role of storytelling in films more and more and worrying about the future of cinema is a reasonable response."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"I liked it but it was to long if they could have cut at least almost an hour out of it, it would have been better. But the action sequences were really entertaining and imaginative"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,A thoroughly enjoyable and humorous blockbuster that richly gathers from both its source material and previous cinematic incantations to full audience-dragging affect.
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"While thoroughly enjoyable, and exactly what you would expect from a Whedon film, the writing deviates from the build up of characters from previous movies and thus detracts from the whole story. Still much fun and humor throughout to make it enjoyable for anyone. Will be interesting to see how the characters develop throughout the future films."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,Gods from the norse mythology and the American superheros... weird combination =)
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"Great movie, the HULK stole the show, powerful, funny, with an action packed adventure, best two plus hours I had this weekend, WOW!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"Honestly, the best movie of 2012 probably. In 20 years it may become something of a cult sci-fi clasic!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"With The Avengers, I had a simple request for Marvel. Don't reinvent the wheel, just give us the biggest, boldest, and possible best superhero movie ever. I'd say Marvel lived up to that request.

Joss Whedon was given the responsibility of a lifetime to write and direct this pinnacle of Marvel's ""First Stage."" All things being considered, he did an unbelievable job. While the story follows a very familiar arc, it's the writing and the action that boost this movie.

The movie is at its very best in the dialogue scenes. Here, Whedon's talents as a writer shine. Like the scenes between Loki and all the separate members of the Avengers. Whedon writes a good amount of wit into the movie, spicing up to the dialogue.

The story is mostly about the fight for the Tesseract. S.H.I.L.D. has the Tesseract and want to use it to make sustainable energy. All until Loki comes back to Earth and takes the Tesseract for himself. With it he will reopen the portal to space, and bring in his Chitauri army. He plans to conquer the earth, because, ""we were made to be ruled."" Nick Fury will have none of it though, and assembles a team: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The movie runs to a sensational climax from there.

Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man. In this movie full of big names, Downey is clearly the star. His Tony Stark is an amazing character, and Downey plays him to perfection. This movie also allows for some of the drama with the character that we saw in the first Iron Man movie.

Chris Evens plays Steve Rogers/Captain America. He may be my favorite Avenger. Steve is good to the core, and a man determined to serve his country. Evens plays the man-out-of-time, and he is terrific, taking the character to new places.

Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor. Of course, every member of the cast nails their part, but Hemsworth is just without question, Thor. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing this character as well as he does. He has some great moments.

Mark Ruffalo takes over the role of Bruce Banner/Hulk. His version of the character is just fine. Ruffalo actually plays Banner very well. But one of the things I really hate about sequels, is when they replace actors. We had a whole movie to form an attachment to Ed Norton's Banner. When you replace him with a different actor, you lose that attachment. Everything Ruffalo does in this movie could have been done by Norton. Wish he stayed with the franchise, but Ruffalo fills his shoes well.

Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson play the S.H.I.E.L.D. assassins, Hawkeye and Black Widow. Renner is sadly underused, but when he does show up, he makes a good impression. Black Widow is much better in this movie then she was in Iron Man 2. She has a purpose. Johansson shows how good she can be with the character.

And lastly, Tom Hiddleston knocks it out of the park as Loki. As good as he was in Thor, he is even better here. Hiddleston brings it all to the table: menace, intelligence, immaturity, and even humor.

As for the action, it keeps getting better and better. The opening actions scene is not impressive at all, and Loki's entrance falls flat. But as the movie goes along, the action matures. The Helicarrier scene is amazing, followed by the show-stopping New York fight scene. This finale fight is far too easy for our hero's though. But I think of it like this. All the Avengers fought their match in their separate movies. So this final scene was like a reward for sticking with these characters for so long. It shows just how good these hero's can work together. Sure I would have like the stakes to be higher, but i'm not complaining.

Overall, this team of hero's almost pulls off the perfect movie. They would've if the ending wasn't so tidy, but the movie gives fans a whole lot of good things. I mean, who didn't want to see Thor fight Hulk? Or Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America fight? I am extremely excited for 'Stage Two"" of Marvel's universe. And definitely for The Avengers 2, thankfully being directed once again by Joss Whedon.

"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"(spoilers) Whether you enjoyed it or not (and judging by it's percentage, most people did) it's hard to argue that The Avengers was probably the most ambitious superhero movie ever (DKR a close second, since it broke the 3rd movie trend of sucking). With 5 movies leading up to this ensemble movie of superheroes, I was very concerned about the film's ability to balance it's characters, story, and action. But with Joss Whedon at the wheel, this massive undertaking of a project navigated through dangerous waters with ease. With a simple enough story  (but large enough threat) plenty of time was spent on these characters and their interactions (and many fanboys got to enjoy them fighting one another also). We also finally got the perfect hulk in the form of Mark Ruffalo, who managed to play Bruce Banner as awkward and geeky. Yes, it was disappointing that Hawkeye was evil for half of the movie and that all of the aliens conveniently died when the mother ship was blown up, but these are only small problems for me in the long run. I really couldn't have asked for a better vehicle movie for all of these characters to be in.  And it was also funny as hell!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,best movie of 2012 so far... haven't watched Batman yet though
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome!
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"Best comic book/superhero movie ever made. Joss Whedon showed how it should be done and exactly where Chris Nolan can stick his ""gritty realism"" and movies that aren't truly Batman movies. Joss is the most talented person ever in the film/TV industry. Glad to see he's finally getting his due in a large scale instead of merely a cult one."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,Yeah as some of you guys know... Im obsessed with this movie
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"Exciting, Epic, Fun, Great Action, Characters, Acting, Writing And Mind-Blowing Visuals, All Of Which Is In The Avengers."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"A cracking superhero film that makes great use of all its characters and comes across as one of the best American action films, let alone superhero films, of the last decade alone. From the mesmerizing opening shot to the picture-perfect performances of Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr to the climactic and brilliant ensemble action sequence, this is an example of how a summer blockbuster should be done, and if there is a sequel, it has a job topping this one."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,Really liked the Hulk in this film. The witty exchange between Stark and Banner is classic. Good action. Cannot wait to see Avengers 2
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"I can't really make up my mind about this. I'd read the reviews, so was prepared for it to have more humour. I saw that. It had an X-Men feel to it, although i'd suggest it was more of an Iron Man 3. I had 2 big problems with it. 1st, all the technology etc, where is the human link? It's like the whole movie was set onboard a spaceship consisting of superheros and super villains. In the end they did come down to earth, but i do miss that Superman style helicopter in one arm and a civilian in the other, with a crowd below gasping in dis-belief. Instead i was treated to some pretty absorbing action scenes that make use of all the superheros for effect of variation. My 2nd problem is with The Hulk. His series of movies are not running smoothly. It's like the character of the hulk changes with every movie he is in. And in this one he has more control over his abilities and can change into the Hulk any time he chooses and has more awareness as to who are freinds and who are foes. I prefer the sadder more lonely Hulk."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"The super flick of the year, it amazes me on how Joss Whedon managed to strike balance among the likes of Loki, Nick Fury, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Hulk. The best ensemble superhero movie yet."
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,Excellent movie loved it so much I watched it again.
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"Good movie overall, slow story to develop in the beginning and the story line wasn't the best but, I enjoyed the idea of all the Superheros coming together to save the earth. Why is it always NY city that we save?"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,was really really good
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"If you're a comic-strip fan then it's your party and if not, still the movie can entertain you with all its superheros and the good point is you don't have to sit and watch a lot of each hero. Overall the action scenes are fascinating (I wish I could watch it on I-MAX or 3D) and the dialogues between the superheros are well-written and funny. Kind of cheap humor but still laughable!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"If you see a ""splat"" in the reviews for this movie, it's simply because that person was watching a genre that they're not interested in and really has no business critiquing it, whatsoever.  It would be like me watching Yentl and complaining that it lacked normally proportioned noses and kunf-fu fight scenes. This film rocked!"
"Sep 29, 2012",positive,"funny at times, acting is fair, some original action sequences, and some we've seen before. but, the uninspired resurrection of an already b-villain and then tacking on some lame alien horde for 15mins during the climax felt forced, not to mention the overall lack of depth or heart, in any of the characters- left the film feeling hollow. Avengers, take note of Chris Nolan and his Dark Knight Trilogy."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,SHEER PERFECTION! XD
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Grei underholdning dette...
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"The rare superhero movie where the dialogue and character development match if not surpass its action set-pieces. If nothing else, Whedon gets credit for making a movie featuring the Hulk that is actually enjoyable to watch."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Extremely well handled and well written.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,A good movie that is nonstop action half way through the movie on.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"The Avengers......flat out ROCKS!!!! All the stars from Marvel's past movies including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk (as well as all of their allies) are here for one of the biggest fights since Optimus Prime and his team took on the Decepticons in the third Transformers! It's an awesome and hilarious thrill ride every marvel fan needs to see!!"
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,2 time and more to come! I love it
"Sep 28, 2012",negative,I had a hard time getting into this when all of the characters are seemingly invincible.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"What can I say? This IS the quintessential superhero that fanboys (and fangirls), have been waiting for. From beginning to end, this movie delivered. Great action sequences, a couple funny moments, and a stellar cast really made ""The Avengers"" arguably the best superhero movie of 2012. Hats off to Joss Whedon for creating a masterpiece for millions of people to enjoy."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"A good film , good effect , good actor, and funny .

all the best."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,It was a pretty good movie.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Comic book geeks stand tall! This movie is for you! Earths mightiest heroes unite as the evil Loki invades earth with alien army. Joss Whedon does a very good job to bring the comic book legends to the big screen. Plenty of story. And great action. You don't want to miss this!!!
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"soooo dOpE. Truly it is a 9/10. (that seems so much better than 4.5/5)  The personalities clashing in various scenes as well as coming together for battle, utter perfection. Loki's character is surprisingly awesome and well done. Iron Man is clearly the majority favorite and always entertains but HULK steals the show! ""You are a pitiful creature! I AM A GOD!"" aaand SMASH SMASH SMASH SMASH hahaha by far one of my most favorite movie moments of all time.  The movie would have PERFECT with less Black Widow , Scarlett Johanson's acting always makes me itch (outside of chick flicks).  This movie is fantastic! Now we wait for IM3, Avengers 2 & many other treats! (Ant Man!)"
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Love when hulk hits thor
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"A highly intense comic book film bringing forth four very renown super heroes into one action-packed movie. Ends with a bang and keeps the humor, to the least bit, fresh."
"Sep 28, 2012",negative,for me is bad....very bad muy aburrida
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Unreal I got chills (spoiler alert sorta) when they teamed up towards the end! I am not a comic book guy but have grown up watching all the shows and movies. This was perfect!
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"Finally took this one in, and it was pretty entertaining! Definitely some great action sequences, and Robert Downey doesn't disappoint. Check it out if you haven't already!"
"Sep 28, 2012",negative,"Im giviing this 1 star even though its about a 4 star movie.Marvel once again gives us a budget cut film ann cheap skates us out of what should have been an epic fight.Thor vs Hulk /Avengers vs Hulk?Hopefully they stop budget cutting and make the next one longer.Good movie that  could have been great...MARVEL,STOP PULLING PUNCHES"" The 1 star is because marvel is getting praised on half ass movies geared towards the main stream fans more than the hardcore ones!"
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Wonderful!! My boyfriend is obsessed with it and now so am I!
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Brest movie. awesome effects.  A must see.

"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"A continuation of the recent Marvel films, this movie is extremely witty in it's cleverly scripted humour, delivers in spectacular visuals and an all-round worthy cast. A certain must-watch for all Marvel and superhero fans."

"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"I loved it, awesome action and very loud!!"
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Best superhero cast EVER! :D pure entertainment
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Saved by the hulk. Its okay to long and no decent baddie
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"Best action movie of all time.  As in all Marvel movies, it is filled with high intensity scenes, humor, and a great plot that is very detail oriented."
"Sep 28, 2012",neutral,The beginning started slow and the only parts i liked was when the hulk (my fav) punches thor and then when the hulk picked up loki and smashed him like he was literally a rag doll
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Superb special FX ... heart pounding action ... wonderfully acted and all joined together with brilliant screenwriting.  A must see for all.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Pure awesome ironman is the best
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"I agree, ""A spectacle in the grandest sense of the word..."". Compelling, well written, engaging, action and likable characters. However, the two assassins seemed to take away the credibility of the whole group. Just because they were what they were did not give them enough credibility to live and fight a vastly superior alien army. I needed more of a background to support their involvement. Samuel Jackson also seemed an unimportant side plot I could have done without.

But, I even enjoyed The Hulk, despite my avoiding him as much as possible. As always, Downey Jr. was great and as feisty as ever, Evans as patriotic and a true hero and Thor was the power blind god. The combination of all them seemed strong since they all held their own rather well and did not lose their individuality during the team work. 

I was disappointed in the ending where they killed the mother ship and the aliens all died. That seemed to have been stolen from ""Ender's Game"". 

I only wonder if this movie will stand the test of time and become a true classic?"
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"This flick was fantastic. The diverse characters, brilliant fx, and witty dialogue were blended perfectly, resulting in a classic comic book film."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,"Quelques super bonnes idées de comics, une fin bien décalée, un départ assez chaotique."
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,An awesome movie for anyone to see. I loved them as a child as i do now and now my children get to enjoy them add much as i did. What a fun way to bond with your kids.
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,It was pretty good. The problem I had with it was that it was a little too long and drug out. But other than that it was a good movie
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! The 3D in this movie was spectacular!^^
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,mindblowing action sequences
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,Everything u could ever want from an action film...oh and the brilliant Robert Downey Jr to top it off!
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,just superb........all the heroes were great.....especially iron man...
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,well built action movie for the comic book geek and those who are not into comics cool storyline and good band of heros can't wait till the next one comes out
"Sep 28, 2012",positive,not as good as I thought it would be
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"A really, really solid attempt at mediocrity. The cast is great but everything else is sub-par."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"I saw it in theaters 3 times! Once was in 3D, but I have to say this will never get old! I feel like a little kid when I watch this, the rush of energy that you feel is so catchy. You just can't help cheering the characters on. I fell in love with Captain America in his own film and this made me love him even more. I just love his lines in the movie and his comebacks. But I have to say by far the funniest was the hulk in the end beating up Loki. I watched it first time in the drive in, and second at the theater so it was funny to actually hear the audience laugh! I knew what was coming, and hearing them laugh made it even better the second time. Finally, I can't leave without mentioning Loki. I know he's the bad guy but I can't help loving him! He's so smooth and so charming, so confident. Actor wise he has come a long way! I just can't say enough good things about this movie! If you love super hero movies then you'll love this one!"
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,It was ok.  The plot was senseless.  Is the hulk dumb? Smart?  I don't get it.  Why does Captain America look like a gay porn star?  I liked the guy with the bow whoever he was.
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,great movie. good to see all the super hero in one movie...
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,great movie a must see good for all ages.
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"He de confezar que me gusto, entretiene aunque es una mezcla de muchas cosas que ya hemos visto en otras peliculas, un poco de independence day, transformers. Me gusta que continuaron la historia que se deriva de cada super heroe y su pelicula, asi no estamos perdidos. El personaje de la Johanson queda sobrando, hay mujeres super heroes que son mejores, con las pistolitas da risa, pero le hace guevo jajaja.. En fin algo comercial que me gusta."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,Greatest Marvel Movie..
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, a must have for any movie collection."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,very good movie can't wait for the next one
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,Very good show! Need to see it again!
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"This is the insane, well acted, intelligently written film we superhero fans have been waiting for. Do not question the power of Whedon!"
"Sep 27, 2012",neutral,"Shipments of rough action and visual and sound effects but basically the same predictable story with good ones and bad ones. Nothing new, nothing thrilling."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"AWESOME!! What more could you ask for in a movie! I really had my doubts that this would work with all the super heroes but it does! Quite well actually! The Hulk has to be the star! You actually start to drool in anticipation of his on screen presence. ok...maybe not but still a real to treat to see some ""Hulk Smash"". The fight scene between Hulk and Thor..epic.. Cast is great all around.. would like to have seen more of Hawkeye but maybe part 2.. My only small complaint is the woman S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Agent Hill?? horrible actress (Cobie Smulders).. i cringe at her every spoken word.. my wife said she has a nice body so just mute the television when she speaks and you have yourself a purely entertaining film experience!!"
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"You get two hours and throw them in a bucket of awesome, you pull out The Avengers. Nice one by Whedon this one!"
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,Good movie. Ready for the next one
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"Overrated!  Great fun and action but acting (except the great Robert Downey), writing and story dumber than the Hulk."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"Excellently paced and remarkable action topped off with iron mans sarcasm. Each character does justice to his/her role making this movie not only one worth seeing, but one worth seeing over and over till you've memorized every bit and detail of its existence."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,really good movie watched it like 3 Times at Edwards
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"In this culmination of four years of Marvel-ous (pun implied) action movies, the team of egotist Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), mighty Thor (Chris Hemsworth), soldier Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and the laid back until he gets angry Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) have to set aside their differences, however many they have, and band together to defeat Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's revenge-riddled brother who has a weapon with the energy to wipe out the whole earth. Helping ""The Avengers"" out are Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the always-cool S.H.I.E.L.D. director with only one eye, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).

Let's get one thing straight to those of you who read this review, how few you are, I LOVE SUPERHERO MOVIES. I love Marvel. Always have. Starting in 2002 when the first Spider-Man was released, and then the Marvel universe opened up in 2008 with the tremendous Iron Man movie, which was really impressive cinema, including Robert Downey, Jr. in one of his greatest roles of his career and one of the best roles of 2008. Then two later with the Iron Man sequel, another good rendition of action and the whole reason I watch Iron Man, Rob Downey Jr.'s terrific performance. Thor came by last year, and I must say it was a really great movie. A truly underrated movie that has action to spare. But however, the Marvel universe proved it was human when Captain America: The First Avenger came, and it was horrible. I know many people will disagree with me, but I think this was the most boring action movie ever.

Now with The Avengers and three out of four franchises having my approval, I was stoked when I heard about the box office records this set, and if it weren't for Jimmy Cameron's movie about the ten foot tall Smurfs from another planet, this would've been the highest grossing movie. Oh well.

When I watch these movies, I watch the acting. As I said exclusively on this and other reviews, Robert Downey, Jr. pulls off with a stellar performance as the egomaniacal Iron Man, who is a delight to see onscreen, and I for one am stoked for Iron Man 3. The two Chrises, Hemsworth and Evans are both good, but I prefer Hemsworth myself, because I am a fan of heroes with British accents. Mark Ruffalo is surprising as the laid back, relaxed, calm doctor Bruce Banner, until that is he gets pissed off, then he goes ape-crap on everything. It's always nice to see Hulk kick some Loki butt in the movie (Oops, mild spoilers...)

I love villains on superhero movies, and in this case, the familiar Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, may not be as amazing as Doc Ock, or The Joker or even Bane, but I must say Hiddleston does a good job playing him.

Director Joss Whedon is becoming a bit of a rising star in the directorial world. He, of course, co-wrote one of my all-time favourite movies, Toy Story. He also worked on shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Glee. For Avengers, Whedon directs this feature with care, he doesn't just string a much of action scenes and sexualized images together like another director whom shall not be named... *cough* MICHAEL BAY *cough* Whedon's script is filled with humor and action but he also makes these characters have humanity and real compassion, to be thinking/breathing things instead of just getting their lines from an offscreen prompter like so many action films.

The Avengers boasts spectacular special effects, and I'll be happy if come Oscar time, that a movie like this FINALLY wins Visual Effects.

With fun action, a great ensemble cast, good score by Alan Silvestri, and spectaular visual effects, while this film isn't perfect, it boasts great fun for everyone, even if you are not a Marvel/superhero fan.

***1/2 out of ****
FINAL VERDICT: 94%"
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"One of the best superhero films, not because of the action, but because Whedon manages to take six heroes who have their own personalities and egos and makes it work. The Avenger's blends action and humor into an extremely fun and entertaining movie."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,I Expect nothing less from Joss Whedon excellence as usual!
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"Better than expected, they keep it simple which is a good thing when involving so many characters. I also liked it how a lot of them didn't get along as this is how you'd expect it to be. For once, The Hulk doesn't come out looking like a damp squib, and Iron Man is very funny. For me just on pure entertainment value, this edges out The Dark Knight as my fav summer blockbuster from this year."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"It's probably one the movies that when I finished watching it the first time, I'd want to watch it again. The Avengers' humane, heroic and humorous dialogues plus all the almost-relentless, explosive, and jaw-dropping action scenes gained itself audiences that some might consider it the best action movie ever made. Whedon, as a comic fan himself, truly committed himself to this film, but I don't see any part of it that he had to take a few risk. Maybe he doesn't have to. Maybe he played it safe. Maybe he just have to give what the fans wanted to see. But, anyway, at the end of the day, to wait for the day that the Avengers had to finally come together in one film has, indeed, payed-off."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"Whenever my friends ask me ""What's the best comic book film release this year?"", I gladly tell them The Dark Knight Rises. Than later they then ask ""What's the star studded movie that delivered?"", I answer with The Expendables 2. Which makes my friends ask ""Did you even like The Avenger?"", which of course I did for several reasons, but didn't leave a huge impact on me like it did on others.

The Avenger is about Nick Fury bringing together a team of superheroes to save Earth from Loki and his army. First, the good, the plot is very well written and surprisingly balanced each character enough to be developed. Every character has their moments to shine whether it 's with a witty comedic line or an action scene. It's also allot more comedic than anyone expected filled with very funny jokes, though everybody favorite seems to be when HULK SMASH Loki before he gets to finished his line. Aside from the well done the comedy aspect, it retains the fun and characteristics that you would expect from these kinds of movies with more superheroes added to the mix. The writers did a great job keeping the viewer invested even when there wasn't any violence on screen. The action scenes are done very well and nice to look at, but I personally do think it did look more like a video game than an actual movie at times. The cast themselves were great in their roles (Scarlett Johansson character should get her own movie) and the special effects were pretty good at all-time despite the all craziness on screen. Overall, it didn't disappoint and is one of the better movies release this year.

Now there are elements I didn't like about the plot. One of them being they fight aliens, this was a letdown for me simply because we already seen people fight aliens. Will Smith did it, Arnold Schwarzenegger did it, Sigourney Weaver did it, the idea has be done to death no matter who you put in the position. Why not have The Avengers fight against a team of super villain, which is something we haven't seen on the big screen yet. My second issue with the aliens is that they're really stupid. So instead of, you know, doing something stupid like spreading out to other states or continents with valuable resources to separate The Avengers. They go with the intelligent plan of staying in one location and allowing The Avengers to stick together which turned out so well for them. My last problem with the plot is there's no tension of any kind. Did anyone actually believe The Avengers were going to lose at any point? Did anyone expect any of our heroes to die? No. This is a Marvel movie where the heroes always come out on top no matter the obstacle. While it might sound like I'm completely trashing the plot, it's actually allot better than anyone expected and delivered on not only good storytelling, but it deliver huge on entertainment. As for the final battle, which many praise to death as one of cinema greatest action set piece, I liked it, but it didn't have any emotional values nor suspense behind it like Warriors of the Rainbow, which was also release this year with a smaller budget.

The Avengers successfully balances its huge line up of superheroes and delivers entertainment whether it plot or violence. While not as good as some of Marvel other efforts, this is a welcome addition to Marvel comic book adaptations.

Note: This debate between The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises is ridiculous. Both are good movies and depending on your taste of movies will determine which one you like better. The Avengers is aim towards a crowd who want big spectacles without a serious plot while The Dark Knight Rises (which I liked better) is more aim towards the crowd who like dark, gritty, complex storytelling. In the end though, you can't go wrong with either of them."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,pretty cool love marvel iron man is a laugh
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"I'm a Big Marvel fan and this one is the best, I mean best superhero movies ever. Take a back seat Batman"
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,Wonderful can watch it over and over bits lost their way but over all a great film
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a big ridiculous multi lead disaster potential - but thankfully the potential is not met and Joss Whedon does an excellent job of providing a great story with humour and chemistry that is very entertaining. It's a popcorn munching, rock fuelled action packed thrill ride. It's everything Transformers wanted to be but wasn't. It's big so it cannot go too deep into any one story but the good part about that is that it sets itself up for a sequel that I am looking forward to.


Rating: ""Avengence is sweeeet.."""
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,jako libilo se mi to.. ale dve a pul hodiny?? 3x jsem u toho usnula!! :D
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,can't stop loving this movie
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"As a long-time connoisseur of super heroes and comic books, I can stand comfortably with the fanboys who hail The Avengers as a watershed success that will single-handedly add life and vigor to a genre that has otherwise suffered some recent failures and setbacks.  

It was a high stakes gamble, a massive undertaking: a movie culminating the strands of a story and characters from several disparate movies, movies written and directed by different artists.  And yet Joss Whedon (legendary comic book/scifi scion of Buffy and Firefly fame) masterfully pulls it together.  In fact, I'd argue Whedon has made the characters all the better for--not despite--their interplay.  Exactly the element of an ensemble movie that is usually the hardest and most awkward to actualize is what Whedon has managed to do best:  depict a sense of genuine growth, cooperation and burgeoning respect from which a team of Avengers could naturally emerge.  And in a super hero genre that is too often burdened with the laborious work of laying the origin story foundation (usually to the detriment of otherwise compelling narrative), that is no small victory, and it's one that will have you alternately laughing out loud or yelling ""hell yeah!"" 

Of course, you don't need to be a comic book fanboy to enjoy this ride.  You don't need to know what an improvement over the non-relationship between The Hulk and Ironman is Whedon's crafty interplay between the two brilliant men who become those aforementioned quasi-heroes.  And you don't need to remember how stilted the comic book versions of second tier characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye actually seem compared to Whedon's reimagining of characters whose lack of super powers suddenly makes them arguably the most interesting among a sweeping cast it would be easy to get lost in.  

But you do have to appreciate just how good a script has to be and how sharp pacing must remain to make sure that silly horned costumes and clunky pseudo-science don't weigh down or distract us from an utterly joyful and unmitigated success of a movie.  

Joss Whedon has recently announced that he's agreed to write and direct another Avengers movie.  That's great news.  Because this is a fragile, difficult franchise that could easily have gone badly.  But, just like the most poignant moments of sacrifice and redemption for the characters in the movie, Whedon used grace and heart to deliver a story that takes itself seriously and treats it audience (and its source material) with respect and genuine enthusiasm.  That's as rare and as inspiring as a super hero."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,what a fun movie!! :)
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,"You'd think that putting all these characters together would make it better than their individual films. Unfortunately I thought a couple of their own were better, i.e Iron Man. It is a good film but like many CGI heavy films, it overdoes it on some of the fight/action scenes to show what they can do with CGI, rather than getting on with the film."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,FUCKING AWESOME FLICK !!!!! Can't wait Til Part 2
"Sep 27, 2012",negative,"It's got special effects alright but you'd be hard pressed to find a story line in this. Lots of eye candy and that's all it should be taken for.
Totally over rated but will fill the needs of the brainless."
"Sep 27, 2012",positive,good one! liked the iron man action a lot
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,It was a fun movie with a decent story line. What really made it interesting was that it was well cast and played by the leads.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"What should be most appreciated about Marvel's The Avengers is the special effects, or the role they play in the film.  The FX serve the story.  The story is nothing from Shakespeare, nor should it be.  It is a comic book movie that, like most of Whedon's past work, revels in what it is.  It is the opposite, and superior, of the latest Batman installment.  The TDKR is about making a myth out of a man, but just a man.  MTA takes the myth, really rolls in the butter of it, and then humanizes them.  It is a superhero movie, through and through, it denies no trope, dodges no stereotype, and yet feels fresh because of its straightforward honesty and professional execution.

Back on the FX, there is no special effect shot that would stand out from any of the regular blockbusters churned out year after year.  Remove the characters, this is the Green Lantern.  On the other hand, if this movie had effects of a decade ago, or even two decades ago, the movie might have been stronger, because Whedon could have written more face time in for each character.  Each character was so well drawn, relative for the genre obviously, that I was left wishing that they played a more prominent role.  The plot was nothing original, and never ever tried to be.  There is something to say about a writer who knows their audience and knows that all deconstructions must acknowledge the standard.  Plots are simply cuts of every story in real life.  A plot simply selects the events in a history which signify an arc that lends importance to everyday life.  MTA uses its standard plot, the simplicity of the genre, the honesty of the characters, and the skill of its direction to create a supremely enjoyable blockbuster.  I hope to see more like it.

For those who liked MTA but have not seen other Joss Whedon films and TV shows, do yourself a favor and get to it.  Best genre writer of the last two decades."
"Sep 26, 2012",negative,"All of Hollywood's liberal elite are in this cast.
Same old, same old.
Nothing here to see, move along."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"With near-perfect acting and scripting, Marvel's superhero team-up is everything moviegoers wanted and then some."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"This movie was the highlight of my summer! I saw it about 4 times, and it never got boring, just kept getting better and better! Stark was hilarious, as usual. Thor was hot. and IT'S JUST A MUST SEE!"
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie to date.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,You can't go wrong with such cast and quality of production...
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,That's my secret...I'm always angry - the Hulk :)
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've seen! The story lines of all the SH came together well. Can't wait for the next part to come out!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Obviously this was awesome!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Seriously... Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr, & Chris Evans all in one movie... hello Mr. SexyPants x5!!!!!"
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Perfect mix of humor and action
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Excellent film :) a Ã©couter
"Sep 26, 2012",neutral,"Fun bit of escapism, with lots of good moments. At times eclipsed by excessive cliche and bad acting, diluting the franchise to an extent.

Chris Hemsworth is a joke, but an entertaining one."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,good movie for fun...
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Exciting? Yes. Great? Well, no."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Awesome movie and the best Marvel movie of all time!
"Sep 26, 2012",negative,"Forget the story; it's traditional comics schlock lacking any wit. But, feast your eyes on some great SFX. So, if you put your brain in energy-saver mode before watching this, you should be safe."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"High octane excitement. A great, fun flick."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,best movie ever..!!!!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Over-hyped movie.  Great effects.  Mark Ruffalo, great actor, bad Bruce Banner.  Thor and Capt America are probably the most annoying superheros.  Bring on Dark Knight anyday."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,it's a Great Movie with Action and some funny parts :)
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,My favorite film of 2012 and arguably one of the best comicbook adaptations of all time.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Solid super hero movie, one of the best yet"
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Wot can I say? Love love loved it!!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,One of the few films in which I can see why it's successful and well liked.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Quem se importa com o roteiro... o lance é ver os heróis de sua infância na telona =)
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,It can be better than that!!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Es buena, esta bien hecha, es entretenida, se puede ver, pero ya a mi me tienen algo harta las pelis de superheroes... hasta cuando?"
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"This is not only a satisfying movie to watch, but it's really, really well done to compliment the awesome cast!!!"
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,This was the bombz. Way better than that turd Batman movie. I don't care what Simon says.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Entertaining enough, but  forgettable."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Four movie franchises and more than five years' work culminate in Avengers Assemble, a movie with a lot to live up to.  Does it succeed?  Mostly yes.  It's not the best film of the bunch, but it fulfils its meagre aims.

The story (such as it is) exists to get all four superheroes (Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America and Thor, plus support acts Black Widow and Hawkeye) fighting side by side against... something.  Anything would do, I suppose, so long as there's room for all the good guys to make their mark.  And it's in that spirit that we have the Chitauri, a bunch of totally interchangeable CGI aliens who apparently came all this way to shoot at cars.  They're not a memorable threat, so it doesn't feel particularly momentous that the Avengers fight and defeat them.  What a pity; given all the iconic superheroes vying for our attention, is Marvel truly this short on decent nemeses?

Okay, we do at least have Loki.  Tom Hiddleston was already the highlight of the Thor movie, and to his credit he does a lot more than just show up again.  This is a darker Loki, a demonic bad guy with a lust for destruction and, in Joss Whedon's hands, a believable quick wit.  But his heart's never really in it, and he basically lets the good guys win.  This is at the same time kind of disappointing and interesting, suggesting both a scary patience for Round 2 and the possibility of redemption.  (And heck, he's mostly just appeasing the Chitauri until he get them off his back anyway, so who can blame him?)  In short, he rocks.  The best thing you can say about his brother, though?  He's in this one less.

Let's face it, in a movie starring four other movie protagonists, not all of them will appeal to everybody.  Thor is only slightly less lunkheaded and dull than he was the first time, and Captain America - robbed of the novelty of the 1940s, where he also happened to be the only superhero going - seems commonplace.  I wonder if Whedon agrees, as both characters are maginalised as much as possible, with only the usual Whedonesque ""everybody gets a quip even if they've never quipped before"" flavouring to perk them up.  Black Widow and Hawkeye are watchable enough, but be serious, did we need them?

Much better, predictably enough, is Iron Man.  Robert Downey Jr's 2008 film made all of this possible, and a big part of that is his natural charisma.  He's comfortably at home with Whedon's dialogue, and effortlessly (if unofficially) takes up the ""leader"" mantle from the other three, and the lion's share of the action.  Also spectacularly good, Mark Ruffalo: finally a Bruce Banner you really believe is also the Hulk.  Ruffalo takes the character to exciting new places, and isn't overused.  Clearly, the Hulk works best in an ensemble, which is a shame as I'd much rather another Ruffalo Hulk film than revisit Cap or Thor.

What else is there, really, other than the goodies and the baddies?  The plot is a list of excuses for the finale to happen, and there are annoying holes, such as Loki's dumb plan to tear the Avengers apart by killing someone they all really like.  (Still, at least Whedon went to the trouble of giving a reason to the name.)  The story takes a while to get going, and the pacing is off, with a hefty airborne scrap occurring just before the much-promised finale.  Still, Samuel L. Jackson makes a brilliant go of Nick Fury, now he's finally got something to do, and Clark Gregg proves he's the only interesting member of SHIELD, which makes it all the more infuriating that he won't be back.  Who else have we got?  Cobie Smulders, as the personality-shaped hole that is Agent Hill?

You get what you paid to see, and Whedon - handling action *and* dialogue with aplomb - ensures that it's a fun ride.  The movie's rapturous reception is an overstatement, however; a run-amok sense of relief that it wasn't just the dumb eyesore we were all expecting.  In every other respect, it amounts to little more than what was expected of it."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Action packed. Great on Blu-Ray 3D.
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Great movie, better then expected."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"As a fanboy I was worried about this one. This was outstanding. The makes of this film aimed to please as they pitted hero against hero and THEN added some of the best action sequences ever made. The cast was great even with a replacement. If you like comics or action, must see."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Breath taking graphics!! loved this movie :)
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie EVER!
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,"Not a terrible film, but it's not the best Marvel film I've ever seen either. Honestly, I think it was a bit doomed from the start. I had a feeling (Even before the film was released) that this film would have a major problem. I had a feeling it would lack the ability to focus on a character, therefore making it difficult to put yourself in any character's position, making the film more personal. I knew they wouldn't be able to do this, due to the fact that it's about a team, and not any specific character. Story wise, I was unimpressed. However, in terms of action, interesting scenes, and whimsical scenarios, I enjoyed it. I would definitely see it again, but the story left me unimpressed, especially when you take into mind how long they'd been building and hinting at it."
"Sep 26, 2012",positive,My boyfriend asked me to go with him to see this movie and I wouldn't.. I just got done watching it and all i can say is WOW!! This movie is by far the best I have seen in a while... Can't wait till we get our 3D tv...
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,The only problem I had with this movie is how can you have a battle in the Middle of Manhattan without inviting spiderman?
"Sep 25, 2012",negative,Was I supposed to see a prequel?
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Great movie with action some laugh & suspense!
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,first of many kind!! highly recommended..
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,So awesome. Leaves you wanting to know what's next!
"Sep 25, 2012",negative,"Belabored plot, took forever to go absolutely nowhere."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"Action-packed, thrilling, and often funny, Marvel's The Avengers, under Joss Whedon's guidance, becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" Tony Stark, and Marvel newcomer Mark Ruffalo gives an amazing performance as two-sided Bruce Banner. Also joining the cast is Jeremy Renner, becoming legendary archer Hawkeye, and the newly revealed history between him and super spy Black Widow is intense and adds another story within a story."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Extremely entertaining. Hulk is awesome!
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,The ending is what did it for me.  Great flick.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"I bought the 3D version on Vudu, since the 3D version is not available on Flixster. I never knew 3D could be done so well on a TV at home! I can't believe how well it was done! Unlike most 3D movies at home, where 3D flickers at different times during the movie, the 3D was crisp when it should have been crisp, a little blurry when it should be a little blurry, and it fit the feel of the movie. I found myself forgetting that I was watching a 3D movie, but rather found myself being more deeply emersed in the experience of the movie. I just thought that 3D was limited by the economic technology being used in most home/consumer TV's, and this movie showed me the importance of the level of effort and know-how put into a 3D movie, and how much it can drastically effect the quality of the 3D experience. I now see that there is a very large scale of quality that is possible for 3D movies using current consumer technology. If it were not for this movie, I would still have no idea how good 3D can be. 

This movie has set the new standard to which I will be comparing all upcoming 3D movies. Before this, 3D was a gimmick, but now it may be a deciding factor in future movie purchases, rentals. and passes. Since I would much prefer to watch a movie in 2D than in poorly done 3D, I may have to start renting 3D movies to determine the quality of the 3D, before I make my decision whether to buy in 2D, buy in 3D, or pass on the movie altogether."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,This was pretty great. Im not a giant fan of the movies leading up to this but this one was pretty damn fun.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,/B-/ A great idea that ended up with a case of action overload in the last hour. The end was an overly-long action sequence that simply became boring.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Possibly the best superhero movie to date!
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year.... If you're looking for full on family fun this is the one.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Loved the action parts of the movie. Throw in a little Tony Stark sass and it was an extremely entertaining movie overall.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Needed someone to Avenge
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"I've seen this twice in the theaters and I would say I liked it a LOT more the second time around. I think the reason for this is that I was in the mindset the second time though: I was more able to just watch it for the comic book movie it was instead of anticipating a more ""real"" comic book experience that the Batman series has provided (I pretty much piggybacked the Avengers and Dark Knight rises within a few days of each other). The writing I would say was freaking amazing. Joss was able to give particular attention to each of the characters instead of just letting larger personalities like Ironman and Thor take the spotlight. The downplayed personality of the doctor with the back-and-forth with Stark makes for a great intro to this Hulk version who has yet to get his own origin movie as played by Mark Ruffalo. Much like the dialogue and smart one-liners, action plays well with longer battles which display each Avenger with equal yet varying skill. This feels like a film made by a fan and I feel true fans (of which I don't claim to be) have gotten a kick out of it.
Vewy, vewy fun."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"Fantastic, a Funny, well scripted and action-packed movie."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"This was one of my favorite movies of the year!!!!! It was freakin amazing. If you hated this movie, then there is something wrong with you."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Great movie! I believe that the writers/directors got it right!  ;)
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Amazing movie!  Loves it in 3D and in 2D.  Can't wait for my Blue Ray to come in so we can watch it again.  Great Movie!!
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon thank you for not f***ing this up. Amazing
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,ALL OF Y'ALL NEED TO GO GET THIS IT'S TOO DOPE STRAIGHT UP.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,Loved it. Some scenes had too much action going on but in all it was a good movie.
"Sep 25, 2012",negative,"Ok, so let's start this of with a huge SNORE.......

The only thing the US can think of to stop an army of alien invaders coming from a portal in space is to nuke New York?  How the hell would that stop them?  

We have several loosely related 'good guys' who spend the first part of the film pointlessly bickering over a villain they don't really understand or know.  To hell with why Loki would want this backwater planet, lets just see Thor hit Iron Man with his hammer again! 

If you sit up late at night wondering if the Hulk could sodomize Captain  America if he was angry enough - then this is the film for you!  Because its chalk full of polt holes, lack of consistency and random points where the hulk smashes or refuses to smash someone for no reason at all!  

In the end we are left with a film that could have been solved by just launching the Hulk at the aliens and having Iron Man and the others run sideline commentary - oh wait - that IS how the film went.  

Lame."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a colossal, potent action movie with enough wit, humor, and drama to evoke fanboy cries of excitement out of the most sour movie curmudgeon, even though the story could have been a bit more original."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"This film is GREAT. enjoyed it immensely and thought it was visually entertaining. The story is quite fun and interesting. And the effects are wicked and the action is top notch. The story is...Interesting and a little cliche in the idea of Loki(Thor's brother) coming back to earth and unleashing a hell with Aliens(this was where I was a little weird ed out) and the Avengers being the only ones who can stop it.

The action in the film is top notch,which is no surprise, and is well executed but the HUMOR in this film is spectacular. It's able to nicely and seamlessly mush top notch action with great one liner's and 1. Not over use them and two make them feel like they where just added in for show. In other words the one-liners appear more as improve lines then scripted lines which makes it funnier and more interesting. 

The story is pretty impressive and fun. It tells the story of the earth being under attack by Loki(Thors brother) and the Other(A mystical alien race) and that SHEILD must form a ""Team"" to help them battle this threat. With this the ""Avengers Initiative"" is formed. Comprising of Captian America,Thor,Iron Man,Hawk eye, And the Hulk The team must battle Loki and his minions to save Earth.  

That's..basically the story it's pretty straight forward and is lots of fun. It's also got some interesting side plot with Captain America,But it's only briefly seen and  really doesn't expand on the story a lot sadly, And also with Thor but they're all brief and not much else. But the action is great the humor is AWESOME,My alltime favorite line is when Hulk takes Loki and smashes the crap out of him and then says ""Punny god"" hahaha. I loved the way they seamlessly got them both in. there really isn't a hell of a lot in this film that is...bad. The effects are great and the story is impressive and right to the point and the humor is nicely added. I guess if I was to nitpick in the film it would be maybe the fact that it doesn't really flesh out the characters that much but..at the same time that's what all the prequels where about so..you can't really complain about that either. All in all this is a GREAT Super hero film and REALLy has set the bench mark HIGH for all other super hero films to follow. I don't even know if the sequels to the other Marvel films or even Avengers 2 will live up to this film but if they do WAY TO GO."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,wish it came with an ultraviolet code so i could add to my collection
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,It is at the top of my favorite comic book movie.

"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon, now everyone knows what a amazing film maker this man is,  the rest of us have known since Buffy and Firefly."
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"Such a corny movie but that corniness works so well.
I usually never really liked the Avengers but now I do!"
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,I'm surprised it wasn't too bad actually.
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"AMAZING!!! Doesn't matter that you have already seen this movie...we all have! My point is that this is a must have Blu-ray for all of the HT enthusiast out there. All the praise and high ratings this Blu-ray has received is 100% accurate IMO. Video comes in at 1080p with a 1.78.1 aspect ratio (takes up the full widescreen). Audio comes in with a 7.1 DTS HD track. Both are reference quality. Hands down the best audio/video of any Blu-ray I have purchased this year. if you haven't seen this movie yet...this is a must see movie, plenty of action for the action fans and its drapped with comedic relief as Marvel has been known to add to all of its movies. You don't need to be a super hero gan to enjoy this one!"
"Sep 25, 2012",positive,"""All I ever did was get angry"". I keep replaying this scene"

"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"I was concerned for a while, but with :03 mins left Stan Lee made his cameo. Great movie! And I lost it when the Hulk kicked butt at the end and even got one last shot on Thor. But like screws in his suit Iron Man held the team together."

"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Ok, by far one of the best action hero movies, besides The Dark Knight Returns of course.  I'm going to be in line with some off duty money stashed away from wifey poo.  Ha.  You can't stop me honey, even she gave it full stars.  Saw in the movie theatre.  In fact it did so well heard they were able to increase the budget for Iron Man 3.  Yep. You don't have to look it up, I have my facts straight.  LOL."

"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Hands down the best movie of 2012, and the greatest superhero/comic book movie ever made."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,this movie was awesome
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"The action and the humor was typical Whedon and done in a way that he knows. The acting was top notch with the cast. The effects helped drive the story at times but over all the movie is a work of modern mythology done to the ""man's"" standard. Stan should be proud of the way that joss Whedon has moved these beloved characters to the next level in this movie"
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"The Avengers finds just the right balance of action, humor, and storyline."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Great movie, put together well with decent dialogue. Hopefully more from the Avengers throughout the years."

"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Good fun action movie, story can be confusing if you have not seen the heroes individual movies that explains it (mainly Thor)."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Entertaining from beginning to end, with brilliant action, superb dialogue and a perfect cast, this is the film that every Marvel fan has been having wet dreams about for years."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,Good but by no means Epic
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,It was packed with action. Loved it.
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,This is what every family friendly super hero movie should be. You nailed it Joss Whedon.
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,This movie is the definition of summer fun!!!! Really amazing movie!!!
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Despite horribly uneaven pacing at times, The Avengers manages to fit in all the awesome character moments and massive set pieces to create a perfect beggining to the end of the Marvel cinematic universe."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon orchestrates these characters into an entertaining composition that builds into a very rewarding crescendo. This is Marvels Benchmark!
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,i liked it when the hulk hit thor
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,What a blockbuster movie should be. Witty & clever. Movie money well spent!
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"All the characters were done right the story loosely follows the comic the ultimates a very good avengers plot, it was funny action packed and had it's share of drama plus it's about superheroes so that's awesome."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"Both superhero amazing and lacklustre stupid it creates what we love - good vs evil on epic proportions, with CGI, acting we've come to adore (Robert Downey Jr) and an entertaining watch, but terrible in its portrayal of the audience. The director mocks you with the too frequent gags, over-used punches and non-dramatic themes. Entertaining, but at a stupidifying price."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,Fantastic film--manages to recreate the visuals of the comics and the characters are treated with the subtlety that we expect from Whedon.  Well done.
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,"""The Avengers"" is some of the most fun, dazzling, often touching, and wildly energized bit of spectacle yet offered to the endless string of new superhero films.  The swarm of leading men (miraculously) never overload the screen and are all able to maintain the charming characters they crafted in each precursing film.  The writing is witty, the direction is sharp, and the visual effects will surely contend for 2012's Oscar in that category.  My chief complaint with ""The Avengers"", as with most of the latest comic book adaptations, is that beyond the usual superhero archetypes and excessive action there's little more to digest.  Now that we've seen superheroes save the Earth again, again, and again from monsters and beings that only seem to arrive in conjunction with the arrival of our fantastic protagonists, when will we see them try to conquer some of Earth's real problems?  Though the Chris Nolan ""Batman"" films, the first ""Iron Man"", and most notably Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" have dipped their toes in this territory, very few other comic book films seem to ask much more of their audience, and ""The Avengers"" is unfortunately no exception.  That being said, it's still one of the best popcorn superhero action flicks you'll see; the execution is irrefutably top-notch."
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,Feels like actual Marvel Comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream. It's simply jaw-dropping. But Hulk does steal the show.
"Sep 24, 2012",positive,Amazing. This movie makes dreams come true. An unforgettable blockbuster.

"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"Good movie.  Worth 3.5 out of 5.  I watched this before I watched Thor and Captain America, I I think I would appreciate it more watching it again."
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,I love this movie love it!!!!!!!!
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever made. It was amazing. Incredible. I was in the edge if my seat the entire. Marvel is awesome. There was a lot of comedy in this. It went passed my expectations. Every person got there own amount of screen time. Hulk was amazing. Mark ruffalo best hulk ever. Captain America was really good in this movie and I loved his costume. Loki perfect villain. I can't even put it in words it was perfect. Wouldn't change a thing
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"Perfect movie, perfect cast, enough said."
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,LOVED IT!!!! can't wait for the blueray!
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"Very good storyline and action packed from beginning to end! Although, I would like a little more action from Scarlett! :P"
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,Funny and one of the best super hero movies ever
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,Very good film with a bit of comedy thrown in
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,...for when you need an 'action fix'!
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,What a show! Best Blockbuster of the year!!!
"Sep 23, 2012",neutral,all that hype for nothing but the scenes with the hulk were pretty awesome.
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"Good old fashioned super hero action, but with Joss Wheedon in charge and a smoking hot Robert Downey Jr......what's not to like :-)"
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"This isn't a film you have to think about. This is a film where you sit back, adopt a vegetative state and stare at awe at the coolest superhero film ever."
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,Was a slow to get going & the bickering was annoying but I have to say The Hulk stole the show...he was hilarious!
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"Joss Wheedon hace un gran trabajo que las 2 horas con 25 Minutos de duraciÃ³n, logra que el espectador se quede en su asiento hasta el final de los crÃ (C)ditos.
Desde el film de Iron Man, que inicio esta larga espera...Todos los fanÃ¡ticos de estos hÃ (C)roes, esperaban que Marvel cumpliera con dignidad y lo logra.
Sorprende mas de lo que esperÃ¡bamos, una maravillosa filmaciÃ³n.
Wheedon y su equipo, lograron que se cumpliera la profecÃ­a ""AlgÃºn dÃ­a veremos a los hÃ (C)roes juntos...en cine""
Una belleza visual, efectos increÃ­blemente espectaculares y sorprendentes. En una pelÃ­cula que no todo es secuencias de acciÃ³n, sino con una buena trama con excelente guion.
Que no hace que ninguno de los hÃ (C)roes o villanos sean secundarios. TODOS son importantes en el film."
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,The perfect popcorn flick. Fans will not be disappointed
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"10/8,4 látványos, vicces"
"Sep 23, 2012",positive,"One of the best action-hero movies I have ever seen. I hope in the future, they add the bat girl known as Anne Hathaway, Batman, and Spider man next. I love action movies that involves different heroes in one movie, such as Expendables. I loved how this movie had a lot of humor too, it was hilarious. There was a lot of intense action, so much thrilling adventures coming from this movie."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"The best superhero movie I've seen. The graphics are flawless, the story is fast moving even at two and a half hours (you don't feel a second of it), it's hilarious and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also keeps a lighthearted tone, which is refreshing. A must for anyone and everyone!"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Took my youngest to see in 3d IMAX , great movie and will buy the blu ray Tuesday"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Saw this in a packed theatre, even though its been out since April.  Great cast & characters, story, filming.. Wonderful sense of humour to it. It was great fun :)"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,Great movie for the genre!! I loved it!!
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"The action was unrelenting and brought in multiple story lines, quite exciting, if not a little contrived.."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,Best movie ever. It had a bunch of action. The heros were amazing!!
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,There should 10 stars for this movie!!!
"Sep 22, 2012",negative,Hated every moment of this!
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,Whats all the hype? Seems like a cash-in to me..
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Great flick, ended up with some awesome action!"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Its perfectly blended together, adjoining worlds, and great heroes."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,The movies the Hulk and modern super hero films are Loki. Hulk Smash!
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,They had no reason to do 4 films before done that one... but Hulk and Tony kept the entertaining
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Very enjoyable although some of the battles went on a bit too long! Good, solid Marvel movie and the Hulk humour was fun!"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,Awesome! Action packed with tons of comedy
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Awesome, epic movie!"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"As is expected in an action film, plot is slightly lacking, but I would have to say that overall this is one of the best, if not THE best, action film I've seen."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Pretty good movie. I didn't think I would like it, not really into the whole superhero thing, but it was really good."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"very few movies love up to the hype. but The Avengers exceeds all expectations. I loved it, my kids loved it, & my girlfriend liked it (says volumes)."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"I was sceptical when I first watched this, as I have watched many a Marvel film, and apart from the Iron Man series with Robert Downey Jr, they haven't been for me, 'entertainment'.

BUT this film blew that perception out the water, its was the perfect mixture of both humour action, which kept you on your seat through either laughter or suspense. 

Robert Downey Jr is the main actor in making his film and with the person who plays the hulk, make this film a 4 1/2 star not a 4 star.

The humour is fantastic, as previously mentioned, especially a scene with the Hulk and the baddie when he just mimics what te Hulk is about.

Now out on DVD, and well worth a tenner to buy, you won't regret it!"
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,fantastic movie! did a very good job at giving each character their moment!
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,best movie we have seen in a while.. it has it all. comedy. special effects. and a decent storyline
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Perhaps The Avengers' greatest accomplishment is that any other film of its type would fail for having ""too many characters."" Miraculously, Joss Whedon moves us to care about every single one-and still manages to include several doses of Awesome-ness."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,A visual effects spectacle. Entertaining if you're not in a thoughtful mood.
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"São vários motivos que faz de ""Os Vingadores"" um fenômeno cinematográfico atual. Primeiro de tudo: temos uma ótima interpretação e super carismática do Robert Downey Jr. (Homem de Ferro), uma atuação charmosa da Scarlett Johansson (Viúva Negra) e uma interpretação super divertida do Mark Ruffalo (Hulk). Segundo de tudo é que temos aqui um roteiro da melhor qualidade, que opta dar realismo e carisma aos personagens como nenhum filme de super-herói jamais fez. Aqui, neste filme, os protagonistas (Os Vingadores mesmo) talvez sejam o motivo do sucesso deste longa, como também os efeitos especiais arrasadores que são usados com genialidade e cuidado. Porém, Os Vingadores falha talvez em precisar da carisma dos seus personagens para ser um filme bom, não oferecendo nada além disto e efeitos especiais, algo que não é um grande problema, mas que para muitos que não se identificam com os protagonistas pode soar um filme chato."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,One of the best movies and a must see.
"Sep 22, 2012",neutral,"Contrary to popular belief, this is not the BEST movie ever.  It is just a very good movie.  It is well made and well marketed.  It has a good plot--very understandable, but it does not make you think (or feel), so therefore it is not that memorable.  I think the problem I had most with this movie was that the 'super'heroes presented here are all 'equal', in a way.  They have equal degrees of power and intelligence, when in the comics that certainly is not so. The fight scenes were very well done and worth watching.  The majority of the film had these heroes fighting among themselves, instead of one lone villain, who is presented at the beginning of the film. Had these 'heroes' put aside their differences early on, the film would've lasted forty-five minutes. 'You don't have to like them, you just have to work with them.' I know I'm not the only one who's heard this quote. The rest of the film felt bloated up with Downey as Iron Man/Stark's ego-ridden one liners and forced sentimental scenes where the dialogue was clearly not made for emotion but attempted to run that way anyway. It also felt as if the ONE villain could've been handled by any one of the heroes, instead for some odd reason they NEEDED to take him on collectively as a group.  The most underwhelming part of the film was the scene in Downtown where all the heroes gather and the camera pans around them. It looked better in the trailer than in the film. I liked this film but it is not something I would remember for years to come.  It all comes back to the plot/storyline for me. If you have to hours to spare and like action (loud noises, explosions, etc.), then by all means watch the film. Also, I just want to point out that this film is not an 'unexpected' hit.  Look at the way it was marketed.  It was obviously set up to be a box-office success.  However, just because it's a 'success' doesn't make it memorable.  It lacked depth. It lacked development. What it did excel in was a more than its fair share of high-profile celebrities."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"Jaw dropping, mind bending, ridiculously over the top superhero-ness. Some expected Avengers to be short on important aspects with regard to charaters / script / plot. But it's not. It's completely awesome."
"Sep 22, 2012",positive,"The movie features iconic Marvel Super Heroes 'Iron Man', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'Thor', 'Captain America', 'Hawkeye' and 'Black Widow' and seems like Marvel's all-star game.  I am not familiar with all of  the super heroes but I believe the more I know them the more fun I will have. Performing as Black Widow, Scarlett is the only girl in the team and her presence harmonizes other strong characters. It must be an important role for this kind of all-star movies. The post credit scene is also must-watch."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"Filled with lots of humor, sarcasm and of course the billionaire, playboy, philanthropist genius (or whatever) of Tony Stark, The Avengers gives viewers an easy to watch super hero flick. Though I feel like not every superhero movie needs the humor kick to succeed at the box office, The Avengers does it justice and well at that. With a team that isn't much a team at first, we see them grow and 'smash' evil in its way to save the city. Was well done for the most part."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"This movie rocks, and hope another one follows. Ironman, the hulk and thor characters were awesome and funny. Plan to buy dvd when it is out in the store."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,This could very well be the greatest comic book movie ever made.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,You got an army... We got a HULK!!! :)
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"Awesome film, highly entertaining & well done to Joss Whedon for some brilliant directing ...

I'll even ignore things like if Thor can rip off Iron Man's faceplate so easily after he fell from the portal, how did he manage to have a brawl with him in woods in the first place !?!!! Thor wouldn't have even flinched if Iron Man flew into him! In fact Tony Stark should be a crushed bake bean can, lol! How can you fight a God? Because its a film that's meant to entertain that's why ... however still not an Avengers purist film ... let's see how they do with Justice League ..."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,phenomenal movie. this is how you do ensemble action movies!
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Disappointing. I expected more. No depth and the humor is awkward.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"Great fun, and surely contains the greatest horny helmet in movie history."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Hulk steals the show in my opinion. Plot and pacing were a little too TV show-y for my liking but the way they rehabilitated one of my favorite characters more than makes up for it.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,wowwwwwwwwwwwwzzzxzzx
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year hands down.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,The BEST movie of the year!!!! Amazingly done and brilliantly written! The perfect amounts of action and humor make the Avengers something you can watch over and over again.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,They did a really good job of developing each of the main characters despite having so many.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,i wached and hatred it.everywhere is dark in a movie.and there is no much action
"Sep 21, 2012",negative,Painfully boring. Ruined the magnificence of The Avengers.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Really liked this movie. It's on the short list of ones I would buy.
"Sep 21, 2012",negative,"What a huge waste of money, talent and my time ""The Avengers"" turned out to be. I don't understand this cult that surrounds Mr. Whedon, as if he is the Bergman of shitty teen television and subpar sci-fi dribble, for his take on Marvel's comic is boring. Too much action, too long, too much of making Scarlett just a sex symbol, too much CGI - not enough Downey or Ruffalo who are the only two shining stars in this mess and it's a shame their time had to be spent on ""The Avengers"" when both actors could've used their enormous talents elsewhere."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is epic on every scale imaginable. Incredibly exciting action scenes, great charismatic performances and overall a deliriously satisfying superhero film."
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Action packed and funny. A great movie to watch...
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,One of this years best movies ever made!! Lookin foward to part two.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,"seen it the day it came out and we all loved it.. bought the bluray and its even better the second time around. if u love action movies and/or super heroes, get this flick!"
"Sep 21, 2012",negative,Pure shite! Good actors burying themselves up to their necks in silage. Hope the kids like it or it'll be a waste of a fiver.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Pure awesomeness. What is better than a group of superheroes fighting together to defeat 1 enemy? Nothing right? I rest my case you honor.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
"Sep 21, 2012",positive,Epicness of superheroes!!
"Sep 21, 2012",negative,I really liked the first half of the movie but then when starting to watch the second half it started to bore me. Still I would recommend it to people who really I mean really like superheroes like them. Also I really do like the characters although it bored me afterwards. I certainly wouldn't say it was HORRIBLE but to me it's a no.
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"my  favorite  marvel film to date  kik ass action all the way   its a very grounded film  , Its for marvel  fans  and geeks alike  its   the best to date  I   love it  ,  Its   comic  to film  in a literal   sense   with cliche and funny dialoge  its  great fun ."
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,Couldn't ask anything for of this film. Definitely a solid and successful action flick. Excellent cast.
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"Whedon does it again! The right balance of action and story, with barely (barely) a plothole in sight. The script is witty and poignant, and the characters are dynamic, and true to the movies before this one. You can't do much better than that."
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,I likes this!!!! And I'm getting it to keep!!!!
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,10/10. Not made out to be anything it's not. Fun from beginning to end. CFX are excellent and none stop action.
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,Excellent !!  It looks amazing on my 3D TV also!!!
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,Now the best comic movie ever!
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,I loved this movie. I thought it might be cheesy with there being so many heroes but it was great
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,THAT'S THE SHIT RIGHT THERE!!!
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"awesome movie .... simple plot line, full of thrills and great visual effects. i wish hans zimmer would have done the score"
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,I saw it twice while in theatres! Great movie!! I'm waiting for the DVD now.
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,just fantastically made great film with heroes
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,very good movie best out of them all
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,one of the best action heros films of the year worth watching
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"Great movie in every way! Superb acting, funny and packed with action, highly recommend this film!"
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"Easily both my favorite movie of the year, saw it 6 times in theaters.  Best superhero movie ever.  It was well worth the wait.   It was genius work, that I was prepared to be dissapointed in but instead I was blown away.  Fan-Freakin-Tastic!!"
"Sep 20, 2012",positive,"The movie was enjoyable, but did not live up to the hype - at all.  When the first Iron Man came out, I was shocked. I had low expectations and it blew me away.  The Avengers seems like just a way to throw all the Marvel (where's SpiderMan?) characters together in one movie.  The story was nothing special."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,A very well thought out cast selection which contributed to this epic movie's success! Heads up for this one!
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is by no means a masterpiece, but in its own limits it's a first-rate spectacle. The story in itself is familiar and worn, the film is slightly too long and the final battle is elongated, but the film is redeemed by its well-constructed screenplay, terrific sense of humor and adventure, massive action and entertaining performances. Joss Whedon manages to balance the screen time of each hero masterfully; when there's a scene concerning Iron Man, it's all about Iron Man, when there's a scene about Captain America, it's all about Captain America, and so forth. The chemistry between the actors works very well, and Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo steal the show. The amount of hype built for the film was ridiculous, but the end result is very satisfying. But if you haven't seen the films that were building up to it, you won't get all the enjoyment out of it. And because this is a Marvel superhero film, the warning is needed: if you're looking for a film with brains, go watch Stanley Kubrick. The Avengers is a Blockbuster with a B; just leave the logic and sense at the door."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,Unbelievably good. I expected this movie to be good like most marvel movies. but it wasn't just good. it took the expected bar of superhero movies and set it at a new high that hasn't been seen since the first dark knight
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"I wish there would have been more from black widow. We need more strong female leads! But iron man, Thor and captain America did not disappoint."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"This is probably the best superhero movie of all time, that is, until the sequel comes out."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,It's The Best movie i have ever seen in my entire life!!
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,Love every minute of this film. I don't mind if they had to change the title or one scene has been altered. It's still an awesome movie!!
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,I love this movie!!!
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,best movie so far i wonder if there well be a second one
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,It is a triumph in fulfilling the dreams of fanboys everywhere.
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,Great fun. Love the bad guy!
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,I knew what was going to happen with the good guy struggle but they managed to make it an interesting movie anyway.
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"Expected a lot more after all the hype, but 4 me it was just average, Robert Downey Junior is defo the best thing about this movie!!!"
"Sep 19, 2012",negative,"ruined my super hero movie experience Total waste of time, couldnt find two things i liked about this movie 90% liking is way off base and you give city of god 88 bs"
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"This is not my thing, but I enjoyed the comradery & sense of humour amongst all the superheroes.  The action was overkill, plot convoluted but that's not why people check these films out.  Best surprise was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk - far superior to the previous Hulk characterizations/films - here's hoping Joss Whedon can provide a reboot for him.  I enjoyed the final shot of the film, too!  You know the one...after everybody's left the theater expect fanboys - not a set up for a sequel, just a bit of normalcy after so much chaos..."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"Surviving largely on the spectacle of icons, this is boisterous and empty and offers little to move its characters forward. By its end, Hawkeye is as insubstantial as his brief appearance in Thor, and only Banner seems to have developed - albeit in the space between his previous movie and this. The impending doom that eventually brings the Avengers together is a vaguely defined generic alien menace with no discernable motive or plan, and the film's 'big bad' is quickly dispatched in a moment of comedy violence that utterly nullifies his credentials as a serious threat. It's watchable as an event; it's ephemeral as a story: and Avengers films are only going to get bigger and louder, which puts them at risk of becoming less and less."
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,Awesome movie will be buying this one :)
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,"a slapstick comedic superheroES movie.
do not watch it for the plot.
just enjoy the laughs and the coolness!"
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,Need more comic hero movies where the heroes doesn't speak like a possessed duck. Better than batman. Easy.
"Sep 19, 2012",positive,This will be classic for decades.
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,"Four years and five movies later and it has finally arrived. The Avengers had the daunting task of bringing together five franchises, giving each character enough screen time, while delivering more than a beat em' up superhero flick. Does it deliver? Yes. For 2 hours and 15 minutes, you're given everything any superhero fan could dream of: The perfect characterization of Hulk (a true show stealer), the hero vs. hero battles, the tragic losses, and a nifty little mid-credit scene that sets up the sequel beautifully. I've always been a sucker for superhero films, and when I first heard the rumor that there was a special cameo after the credits of Iron Man, I waited. I wasn't sure if there was anything, but I stuck around to make sure. Then it happened. Samuel L. Jackson walks out of the shadows and introduces both himself as Nick Fury, and the Avengers Initiative. Not a person on this planet knew that four years later we would be treated to a superhero flick so grand in its execution. If you're a fan of superhero movies, or you just like to have a good time when watching a movie, The Avengers is for you."
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,Awesome idea. A few laughs too.
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,"A thoroughly enjoyable mess... Whedon set's about the task of uniting several relatively uninteresting superhero's for a CGI bash-up and smash-up session with varied results. Away from their separate franchises (if they even have one) each of Marvel's Avenger's are generally undersold - Iron Man 2 was truly awful, Captain America was terrible, all the Hulk films were severely compromised - In fact, only Thor was a capable movie in it's own right, which is probably why those superiorly drawn characters take centre stage in the Assembly. Otherwise, save for a few excellent shots and sequences, Whedon's direction is anonymous, whilst McGarvey has little to do amongst all the glittering chrome visuals and grotesquely unconvincing CGI, the script swings from being pathetic to brilliant within a heartbeat and Mark Ruffalo manages to achieve more in his 10 minutes of screen time than any of the other Hulk screen adaptations put together."
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon does it again only a couple weeks later. And again he steals the show. Coupled with anticipation and a compelling story, The Avengers definitely pulls the individual superhero movies together. They did a great job of spotlighting individual characters and also their teamwork which is core. Highly recommend. Action-packed and full of laughs; you'll come out satisfied"
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,Amazing film and heart pounding climax.
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,the best heroic film of heroes in this world that need heroes
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,One of my favorite movies of all time.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,By far the best action film this year! The Avengers has it all! Love it a lot!
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,Could not have been better!
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,I don't think I need to say how perfect this movie was. You all get the point.
"Sep 18, 2012",negative,Really?? Are movies about ONE superhero just not stupid enough anymore??
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,"Can;t believe I forgot to rate this lol. Sooo deliciously good, whats not to like? HULK SMASH!"
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,What a fantastic movie it was such a pleasant surprise to see the ensemble cast meld together so well.  I think we are going to see many great movies to come out with these great Marvel characters!
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,Slightly disappointing.
"Sep 18, 2012",positive,Great movie cant want for 2.
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,I just watched the bootleg DVD version of Los Vengadores (The Avengers) for the 7th time that I got in TJ and it gets better everytime. Best 15.00 pesos I ever spent. will definitely buy it on  Bluray when it comes out.
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,This is how you get a whole bunch of superheros together in one movie!
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,Hulk steals the show!  And what a show!
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,Loved it and can't wait for number two!!!
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is like an amusement park ride.  You probably already know how its going to play out, but it's still a lot of fun."
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"I think I must have been one of the few people to NOT catch this at the cinema when it was released earlier in the year, but all good things come to those who wait, so they say, and I've now got a nice shiny bluray to watch.

I must admit that I'm not that much of a fan of Marvel superhero comics and the movie spinoffs, and The Avengers does have that comic book feel to it. Quite different in tone to that other big superhero film, The Dark Knight Rises, but I thought it was much better than I expected and really enjoyed it.

It looks like Marvel releasing the Iron Man, Captain America and Thor movies previously worked, as it removed the need to introduce each of the heroes and just get straight to the action. And lots of action there is too, right from the off! It doesn't really slow down much throughout, especially when 'the other guy' goes green!

I was also really loving the soundtrack from Alan Silvestri, very rousing and fit the film perfectly for me. Thought it was up there with his Back To Future scores. 

All in all, this is very much a fun-filled action packed superhero film that definitely pays tribute to previous superhero films and to comic books. As with Marvel films these days, don't forget to watch until the end of the closing credits."
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"One of the finest examples of bringing the perfect team together, this has smashed its way through all of my favourite movies to become the pinnacle of Superhero prowess!
Samuel L. Jackson is great as Nick Fury and it's so good to finally see plenty of him after all his cameos!
Scarlett Johansson is so impressive as Natasha and I really, really like Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner who has greatly improved my feelings regarding the Hulk.
Chris Evans does excellent work getting Cap up to speed and Robert Downey Jr. ups his game as Stark and lives up to the word hero and has many of the best lines.
Chris Hemsworth absolutely nails his performance as Thor and I could happily watch him and Tom Hiddleston's Loki talk to each other forever! It really is like Shakespeare in the park and it gives such weight to the movie and this along with Cap's old fashioned inherent goodness, there's so much to enjoy!!
There are lovely supporting performances from Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Agent Hill and Jeremy Renner also does well as Clint and is very cool to watch as the action heats up towards the end.
As much as I love all of the Avengers, Loki completely steals it! Tom Hiddleston gives such a dramatically malicious performance that I think he tops every bad guy before him and Loki vs the Hulk is something I will never forget!
This has bucketloads of humour and incredible action and considering that this is just the beginning, I cannot wait to see where Joss Whedon takes this!!
Funny, menacing and truly heroic, this demands repeat viewings and a lot of respect!"
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,Transformers 3 with the robots replaced by superheroes
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,A truly exceptional film
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,This was the best Superhero movie ive ever seen by far action packed funny and good plot.
"Sep 17, 2012",neutral,"Personally I thought it was pretty average, I proffered just Iron Man"
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"Loved it, had a laugh, gonna watch it again soon....Iron Man seemed the most prevalent in this film, so expect that type of humour, though the best quip, was between Loki and Thor, when Thor says 'You listen well, brother. I... '.......If youve seen it, you will know what I mean, If not, watch it to find out...."

"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"Just Fantastic, do not read into it to much grab a coke (other fizzy drinks available) and some popcorn and enjoy!  the only question is how do you raise the bar now??"
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,hulk is the only thing that i like about this movie
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"Super movie, I loved it!"
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"Holy shit, awesome movie!"
"Sep 17, 2012",positive,"Love, love, love this movie. I had a blast watching it."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Very real and very fun. Hulk SMASH!
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"While it may not have the depth of some of the best Marvel films, the ensemble performances and visual universe make for a great ride."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,This is what a comic book movie should be like.
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"Excellent acting, you can almost feel their doubts and struggle, very humerous,  action packed, leaving you wanting to see it again or want more if your a superheroe fanatic. Definitely worth watching"
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Pure spectacle. Love the banter with Banner and Stark. They really did pull off the impossible by making a really great movie by tying together a bunch of just good movies! Most rewatchable movie of the year.
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,I loved this movie but in 3D it is awesome
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"I waited my whole life for a great comic book movie, and Avengers delivered"
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"BEST JOSH WHEDON MOVIE EVER!!! He stayed true to the comics! I've seen almost all of Joss's works! Been a fan forever!

Usually not a fan of Scarlett Johansson but loved her in this movie! Loved Robert and Jeremy too!!"
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,fun and action packed.
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"This could have gone soo wrong. Generally when they bring superheroes the balance is well off but it seems that most of the Heroes got their chance to shine. Many memorable, and funny moments. So much fun. Only criticism is that Captain America was a little outshone by Ironman."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Superhero extravaganza with a few special effects ! Lol The Hulk has 2b my favourite :)
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"I don't often give movies top ratings, but Avengers surely earned it. It was directed brilliantly by Joss Whedon and was an action-packed film with a very good plot. And the 3-D was really good for not being filmed in 3-D. Excellent movie. Seeing it again when I rent it."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Very cool. Very cool indeed..
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,Best film ever. If you haven't seen it. Watch it!!
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"These movies always set the bar higher for the next, and I can't wait for whatever that may be."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,"Non me ne Ã¨ mai fregato molto dell'universo Marvel nÃ¨ tantomeno dei film ad esso ispirati. Quei pochi che ho visto mi sono sempre sembrati dei baracconi privi di sostanza. Questo the Avengers invece, per il tipo di film che Ã¨ l'ho trovato in primis divertentissimo e in secondo luogo non privo di buone dinamiche fra i personaggi."
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,It was great! Worth the wait.
"Sep 16, 2012",positive,This was the best concoction of superheroes ever! Loki'd
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"Absolutely wonderful.  Funny, loads of action, entertaining."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"A terrific cast and bang-up dialogue make the first two hours gripping enough to forgive the final (yes, another one) battle to save the Earth (or maybe just midtown Manhattan)."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,Entertaining from start to finish.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"What a superhero movie should be. Action, Comedy, Sci-fi and the hulk smashing everything in sight."
"Sep 15, 2012",negative,"Avengers 92% fresh, Dark night rises 87%, not cannot be right,
""Some men just want to watch the world burn""
Avengers is your typical watered down action movie, for the unintelligent masses"
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,A good movie for what it is; a mindless comedy. No real psychological value.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,Normally not a fan of superhero movie but I find this movie exciting and entertaining! I guess I would have enjoyed it more if I had known more about the superheroes beforehand. Thor and Hawkeye are awesome :)
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,This film makes me Happy
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"Great cast, good story, awesome special effects! Five stars, hands down."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"I have been waiting for this movie since the end of 2008, and it just about surpassed my expectations. It was flat out awesome!"
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"Did a good job of balancing the characters without letting any one character dominate (though you could argue Stark got just a we bit more than the rest).  Very good on screen interaction between the various main characters and it even gave a breakout opportunity to the background characters, I so want to see a Black Widow or Hawkeye movie now, not to mention the shield agents doing a great job.  Excellent writing and balance."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"In a time of cinematic repetition, The Avengers introduces a new type of film that infuses both humor and action in sequences of pure awesomeness."
"Sep 15, 2012",neutral,don't understand really why it's rated 92% on Rottentomatoes.com :-)  For me just an average movie which probably cost too much regarding the result...
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,yet another very well executed marvel movie. Very entertaining and well done.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,Love this movie. It's funny and has a great plot. Iron Man is my favorite but I think Loki is very interesting too.
"Sep 15, 2012",neutral,Meh. Cool action and funny lines but predictable and formulaic. Advise you watch The Incredibles instead.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"I have been waiting for a movie like this since I was a little kid, and it did not disappoint."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,It's like a dream come true to watch this movie... Although it is a Robert Downey Jr. -centric...
"Sep 15, 2012",negative,"[4/10] The Avengers is one of those kind of blockbusters which is all glitter and no substance. Though all the character personalities portrayed in the movie have been true to the source material, the storyline itself however, lacked complexity and the affinity to be taken seriously at all. [4/10]"
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,The avengers is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has lots of action and I would love to own it.
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"Severely dissapointed. Not that funny, way too much action, and too many characters. I have no idea why it has a 96% rating."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"""The Avengers"" displays Joss Whedon's flawless comedic timing, and his ability to balance fun among somber circumstances flawlessly. One can see why Buffy & Angel were a huge success, & Firefly/Serenity a huge cult hit. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Whedon. As for the movie, I enjoyed this movie's Hulk more than the two stand-alone movies. This movie showcases why the Hulk work best as a supporting character instead of the lead. Hawkeye, in my opinion, was an eccentric character to add--the movie could have done just as fine without him. The other characters perform their parts well, although Downey's Tony Stark filches the spotlight each stretch he was on-screen. The chemistry between the casts is seamless. The only downsides are the sometimes-cheesy dialogues--mostly by Jackson's Nick Fury, and the loose usage of technical slang every now and then. Other than that, here is a toast to The Avengers, for having a superb job done!"
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,"Robert Downey Jr is awesome as usual pairs up really well with Mark Ruffalo (Hulk). Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner are really not awesome. Captain America is the party pooper and generally sucks as a super hero. The action scenes are too tame (in contrast to the darker Batman movies) and more suited to kids, however there are enough special effects and witty one liners from Downey Jr to keep you entertained."
"Sep 15, 2012",positive,An amazing movie .. Well written amazingly directed :) Joss Whedon <3
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Entertaining as hell. After getting the Avengers on motion picture, I have started dreaming to see the Justice League in action too!"
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Awesome, best movie of the year.  Simply outstanding blend of talent i dong think any of the actors overshadowed each other."
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Despite the slow start, this movie is chock full of action, excitement, and fun. It's absolutely a blast, and succeeds at everything it tries to be. The perfect example of a summer flick"
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,i really loved this movie
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,Can't wait to own it on Bluray/DVD.  Exciting movie!
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,Exceeded my expectations.  Seriously - how easy would this have been to completely mess up?  And far worse movies have performed just as well.
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Loved it, it has action from beginning to end with humor to match. I want to see it again, soon!!!"
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"The best movie of the year, by far. The only thing that would have made it more perfect for me is if the Hulk got more screen time."
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"I know people love this one but I'm not sure why. Sure, there's lots of action and superheroes but not much of a story or a proper plot-line. And the characters are seriously lacking in substance! Other than The Hulk, everybody else seemed very one-dimensional. Had I not seen any of the previous movies, I would completely dismiss this one as boring mindless action... Maybe I expected too much?"
"Sep 14, 2012",negative,"Terrible, zero actual plot"
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Fun, very well cast, entertaining, lots of action, great popcorn movie. More of a DC comics girl myself, though."
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Pas si mal, mais je crois qu'il faut Ã (C)viter de l'Ã (C)couter dans le petit Ã (C)cran d'un siÃ¨ge d'avion... Bons dialogues, l'histoire n'est pas trÃ¨s convaincante et quelques personnages sont inutiles."
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"An action adventure that truly delivers action adventure...
Well written too!"
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,it can't be better anymore!!!
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Hulk est "" grandiose"""
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,Great movie. Highly recommended
"Sep 14, 2012",neutral,exactly what it should be. nothing more or less.
"Sep 14, 2012",positive,"Funny, epic and the heroes we all know come together for this epic story, deserves its 5 stars."
"Sep 14, 2012",negative,"I feel sad knowing I just wasted over two hours of my life I will never get back. 
 Don't watch ""The Avengers""."
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,Nonstop action and explosions! Hulk Smash!!!!
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,this movie got me bored a little but i still liked this movie it has most of the superheros
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,Pretty much fantastic.
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,I'm keeping it simple.  This movie is everything you'd want in an over the top superhero movie.  See it.
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,all I want to do is repeatedly watch this!!!!!
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,One of the greatest superhero movies of all times!
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,Probably safe to say to best super-hero film ever made besides Dark Knight Rises! 5 stars!
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,great movie lots of action and funny
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,Totalll Entertainmenttt! A great movie. Can't wait long for the Avengers 2.
"Sep 13, 2012",negative,"This movie sucked. Poor writing, poor acting, cliche' set design and not eye candy. Simply had nothing going for it"
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,Its the biggest film of 2012. It should be! 4 stars!
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,"Marvel The Avengers is the best super heroe movies, with more than 1,500,000,000 is the best movie off the last 10 years"
"Sep 13, 2012",negative,Can't understand why this film was do well liked?? Should have been called iron man and his stupid friends. Very poor unless your 10 years old.
"Sep 13, 2012",positive,amazing got it on dvd
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"The movie excels thanks to the power of director and writer Joss Whedon and his very human treatment of superhuman characters, backed by a very game cast."
"Sep 12, 2012",neutral,Captain america is the only good thing about this movie!
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever!!
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"The Avengers contains a vast amount of characters and it never becomes to bloated or stuffed. The set pieces are the reason this film needs to be seen on the largest screen possible and in the end, what was set up six years ago pays off indefinitely."
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,My heroes once again
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,This is the best movie i ever watch! The Avengers really made my day. lol
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,I hope they make a sequel with all the same actors
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"After the hype surrounding The Avengers it was either going to be extremely good or extremely poor and thankfully Joss Whedon has successfully managed to combine multiple superhero stories into one and make arguably the greatest superhero movie of the lot. With the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Samuel L. Jackson on board it was always clear that the talent was there to make a wonderful film but it was how to utilize the talent on board that was always going to be the hardest part of the production, thankfully Whedon manages to construct a plot that has just the right amount of action, humor, thrills and to make it even better the plot isn't even complicated so there should be no problem in following the story line.

When planet Earth comes under threat from Loki a 'God' from another planet and brother to Thor, Nick Fury assembles the likes of Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Hawk Eye and Black Widow to try and put a stop to the hell bent Loki. Their efforts prove to be futile however and Loki soon takes control of some of Fury's best agents to scheme against the Avengers and to make a weapon that will allow his army of aliens to come and start a war on planet Earth. When Loki succeeds in opening a portal to allow his Aliens into the world they begin wreaking havoc on New York City and it is up to the Avengers to fight them off in an epic battle.

With stunning action scenes that are heavily influenced by the use of CGI The Avengers is a breathtaking movie that matches up to the success of Christopher Nolan's Batman films, the cast are terrific as they reprise their roles as superheros and the chemistry among the cast is key to the little bits of humor that are involved throughout the film. A genuinely thrilling movie from start to finish that has one of the best battle scenes in history to round off a perfect superhero movie."
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!!
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Like it when the put all the superheros into one movie. I injoy it in the movies and cannt wait to get on dvd
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,best movie ever funny masterfull arrt
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"Amazing film. When your favourite superhero's come together and make a film out of it, for the people behind it, it is make or break because you can't exactly mess this up. I am a huge fan of Spider-Man and he is my favourite superhero so obviously for me there was something missing the whole time but I can accept that and move on. This film has brilliant CGI, brilliant acting, brilliant direction, brilliant plot and brilliant everything else. Marvel is probably one of the best creations known to man, God bless Stan Lee."
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Some of Marvel's most famous superheros teaming up to take down aliens and protect earth? I think its a must watch..
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Cant wait to rent it
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Very good but far from perfect.
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"Although I have to admit I was really worried it was going to crash and burn horrifically like Transformers 3 by having too much action for no reason at all. I got the same feeling walking out of the cinema as I did when I watched Transformers 1, and for everyone who hasn't watched either of these films it's simply an action film which mixes serious with humour perfectly. Just as each transformation in transformers was as exciting as the next each hulk smash and iron man suit up is eagerly anticipated throughout. Couldn't stop talking about it for 3 days after so ... (Watch with everyone)"
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Alright. I think there was to much hype before I saw it
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Awesomeness in all it's spandex wearing glory. Best file of the year.
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of the year
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,Thought this was GREAT!!!! Every age will enjoy it too!!
"Sep 12, 2012",positive,"Regardless of what anyone else says, watch it an enjoy it for what it is, in my best films of all time list"
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"The movie starts out incredibly boring but just picks up and gets better and better. During the last action sequences with the Hulk the humor almost boarders on classic greatness. Joss really captures the essence of the comic book. Hawkeye and Black Window hardly get hurt and I realize it is supposed to be because of their superhuman like speed and natural potential. But.. not in a war zone like that with flying shrapnel everywhere. All in all, I want more. I love Marvel superhero movies."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"<i><b>  There are moments of genuine pathos, genuine humor, genuine surprise. As much as the film adheres to the strictures of the standard comic-book movie, it also pops with a knowing, loving, Whedon-world jokiness that keeps everything barreling along. The Avengers have been assembled and, for the most part, they fit together superbly. A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick. Big, brash and very funny, Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble is equal to the sum of its parts - and for once, that's no faint praise. Suit up. Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order. In terms of storytelling, The Avengers is for the most part a highly functional, banged-together vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel. Yet the grand finale of CGI action, set in the streets of New York, is - in every sense - smashing.  <i></b>

VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)"
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"Lots of things blowing up, which you would expect in this kind of movie. I have to give props to the studio for giving the major players their own movie first before this one. If only DC/WB did this kind of planning."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,Best movie i've seen in yrs :)
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"Edited (From 3 stars to 4.5): Saw this movie again before watching Civil War. Had seen it before but with a ""looking forward to disliking it"" attitude. Years and a rewatch later... wow. This movie is tight as hell. Less Robert Downey Jr and more Tony Stark, and cool it with the ""yeah!!!"" rock and roll (again, ""Rockstar"" Iron Man), but yeah...this movie is comics come to life. Knocked it outta the park Joss Whedon."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,Movie theatre camaraderie
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,This movie was no joke.
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"Good characters and interesting collisions between them, but in the end, the story is simply not up to the challenge of keeping me as involved as I wish I was. Despite the great effects and awesome performances by the entire cast, I simply found the story bland and simplistic enough to say that the movie was written for kids and hardcore comic fans. The movie is enjoyable, if you manage to turn off your brain and accept that this movie is meant for a younger demographic who might not question the logic and/or meaning of things. Interesting concept, but poorly maintained. My score is generous, when looking back on what this movie brought to the table."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,perfect. I can hardly wait for phase 2
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"An awesome Fantasy/Sci-Fi adventure!  Everybody loves a super-hero, a team of super-heroes is even better!  A must-see movie!"
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"2,5h voll auf die Glocke. So muss geile Comic-Action sein. Ohne Schnulz, ohne Schmalz, einfach nur BAAAMMM!!"
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,"In the year of the comic book movie, The Avengers stands tall as an enjoyable ride populated with thrilling heroics and eye watering set pieces. Each Avenger gets a share of the spotlight, and even though Robert Downey Jr shamelessly steals everyones thunder (sorry Thor) the rest of the cast do an admirable job. Tom Hiddleston is brillantly Machiavellian as Loki and Mark Ruffalo delivers a solid Hulk. Whedon gives his script the usual pandering of razor wit dialogue, which works in places, but upends the tone in others, and the final set piece, though a feast for the eyes ends with a contrived cop out in order to get to the credits. Full of knowing winks and fan service, this doesn't take itself too seriously, and all the better for it. The only issue may be having to sit through another Thor movie before the inevitable Avengers 2. A enjoyable ride, just dont expect the narrative to surprise you and you'll enjoy it."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,darn. no 6th star...
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,this film is awesome
"Sep 11, 2012",neutral,"Graphically stunning, but the story line is ridden with predictable cliches and should feel about 'par for the course' to anyone over the age of 18.  In many cases the script was going to such awkward lengths to stress characters' ideologies that it was difficult for me to keep listening.  Considering that this movie received a 92% fresh rating from the critics makes it an interesting litmus test for critics who vote their interest as opposed to guessing the masses' interest."
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,Great movie! Love that they kept the original cast!
"Sep 11, 2012",positive,Super special awesome!

"Sep 10, 2012",positive,Good fun... and good fun.
"Sep 10, 2012",neutral,"Ridiculous film - this shows what happens when people think the sole reason to make a film is box office gross. Poor characterisation of the ""alien threat""... Downey Jr holds it up."
"Sep 10, 2012",positive,"The best superhero movie ever? Possibly, possibly not. The most fun superhero movie ever? Most certainly. And some people would remove the word 'superhero' from that sentence."
"Sep 10, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies 2012 and i want more.
+ Hulk shows a lot of promise. Coolest superheroes in a one movie working as a team. Nice CGI. New superheroes. Awesome action scenes. Humor.
- Bad guy is not very challenging, Black Widow is weak and not very believable superhero. Heroes has no weak moments, so it looks like they are immortal all the time."
"Sep 10, 2012",neutral,A boring pot full of superheroes.
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Superiorly executed. Good laughs even.
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,"Between setting up, combining and fleshing out the heroes, introducing Shield and giving them all something to fight, a lot got done in this movie with room to spare for humor and fanservice.  Unfortunately, I felt that the villain side of things got left very little consideration.  They got the confused and childish Loki and a pack of generic invading aliens as adversaries.  But it's fun enough to watch these heroes tear through em like paper and save the day, so thumbs up from me!"
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,one of the best super hero movies to date!!!!!!

"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Everybody who stayed to the end of iron man has been waiting for this for quite some time swell of those who watched the incredible hulk. 4 very long years later it came and it delivered. This goes without saying that there hasn't been a film that matched this in character wise and there probably won't be. All there is to say is thank you joss whedon for this brilliant execution of the Avengers
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,The best action movie since Star Wars!!!
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,suspenseful hilarious and awesome
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,The perfect culmination of Marvel's phase 1
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Has everything you need in a movie!
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,One of the best movies ever
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Great movie can't wait for part 2
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,"This is without a doubt one of the best superhero films ever made. Joss Whedon knew exactly what the fans wanted and delivered. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner were excellent, but the scene stealer IMO was Mark Ruffalo, who outdid Edward Norton and Eric Bana as the new Bruce Banner. Not to mention the Hulk looked just like Ruffalo himself! I cannot wait for Avengers 2!"
"Sep 9, 2012",negative,"WHATS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE????? This movie was awful, it's predictable, it's dialogues are full of clichÃ (C)s, it was boring and ugly, a sadly over-rated film."
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Great movie! I liked Batman better.
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,"The more I see it, the more fun I have watching it."
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Summer movie of the year
"Sep 9, 2012",neutral,Was not what I was looking forward to.  I was hoping for more of a story except all it was was stupid explosions and Loki was defeated in barely any time.
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Silly comic book hero film but I liked it.  Well done for getting Johansson into a tight fitting leather outfit Whedon.
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,"When does spider man fits in? and nice one, thumbs up."
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,You want fun? So here it is...
"Sep 9, 2012",positive,Best action /superhero movie for some time.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"None of the summer movies could ever, ever match The Avengers. I'm sorry Dark Knight Rises you had a good and fantastic run, but The Avengers smashed a lot of decent through mediocre movies like Battleship, The Dictator, Dark Shadows, and allcomers. The movie was awesome, my favorite Avenger was Black Widow, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk. The ending was shocking and I don't know who the new villain is, but it's still a spoiler, so I can't write it on this review. With all those box office records, I think it's even way better than Avatar and this year's The Hunger Games. I got my advanced ticket, I wait in line for at least 30 minutes, and when I watched the movie, it was all action. If you haven't seen The Avengers, then there's a good chance to buy it on Blu-Ray on Sept. 23. Don't be late, take your time and get your copy while it last because everybody will be rushing to the midnight launch party selling as much as it could get. I can't wait for the sequel for 3 more years, watch out Avatar 2."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a god!
"Sep 8, 2012",negative,Solid contender for one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Good movie but I wasnt sure what movie the girl was from. That bugged me the entire time since I have seen all of the other movies.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,The Best Hero Film all the time!!!!
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"Even taking into account Joss Whedon's corny dialogue and penchant for shaky-cam action scenes, The Avengers is about as a good as superhero movies get. And watching the Hulk go on a rampage made me giggle like a schoolgirl."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"Does the job, it's entertaining and it does very well, but do not ask for more. The script is simple, the direction of Joss Whedon is dynamic, but nothing more than that. If you want to see is a deeper story, this film is not for you, now if you want great entertainment, clearly the Avengers is for you."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,I love this movie more than any other i have ever seen!!!!
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Just simply awesome! More Hulk in the next one I hope!
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Awesome movie I loved it!!
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"explosions, acting, comedy, and scarlett johanson, don't ask for more."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Hulk is fucking amazing !!!
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,sexy hulk (mark ruffalo.) great movie.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"Being a Marvel fan doesn't mean I liked all movies. I've seen them all and from now on Avengers is my favourite one. By the way, I've never liked Hulk on paper and movie neither (apart tv-movie with Ferrigno/Bixby), but here... I love the character and how he smashes enemies! Big fun."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Loved it! Perfect action & storyline.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,epic rage and derp_swag enough said.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"Stunning action sequences, and though there's the requisite corniness, the writing is surprisingly intelligent."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Freaking awesome so worth seeing again. I def will be buying it on Blu Ray and digital copy
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"The script is downright awful. But the chemistry between the characters works, and the stunning visual effects and humour make watching the movie bearable."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Awesome. Cannot say anymore
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"This action packed movie is a five star rating!  With the actors fully going into their roles as heroes and villian, the magic they display on the big screen is magnificent.  If your fan of the Marvel movies you will love this next installment, and if this is your first Marvel movie then you picked a great one to watch.  All the action and explosion is packed together for the viewers to enjoy."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Totally awesome!  Nothing else to say about this movie.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"This movie lived up to all the hype in my opinion, It focused more on each individual characters strengths as well as weakness, my I only wish is that, Black Panther as well as Ant man/Giant Man and wasp will be introduced into the remaining franchise."
"Sep 8, 2012",negative,What a terrible movie. Nothing happens for long periods of time. Poor dialog.
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,its all about entertainment
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,"I only saw this movie, because it was the biggest film of 2012, so this review will reflect that. Superheroes really aren't my thing. I haven't read comic books, watched tv shows, etc. The only superhero films I've ever seen are Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and the recent Thor film. Thank goodness I saw that Thor movie, or I would've had no clue what was happening in The Avengers. None at all. I still really didn't understand the plot of this movie, because I haven't seen all of the other superhero films (Thor was probably over a year ago so it was very fuzzy in my mind). The bits I did get were from Thor and from me constantly rewinding it and turning on the subtitles so I could try to follow it. Even though it was hit film, I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you are into superheroes and have seen the other films. The graphics were amazing, the plot not so much. I can see how people could be really into this movie. It would probably be very, very good if you have that superhero background knowledge. I, unfortunately, did not."
"Sep 8, 2012",positive,Much better than I expected
"Sep 8, 2012",neutral,"Película larga, lenta y con un guión de todo a cién. Buenos efectos especiales y un infalible Robert Downey Jr en su papel de Tony Stark."
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,awesome film just waiting for 3D blue ray release now
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Loved it! Hulk is hilarious. Lol
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Damn good movie! Enough said...
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"VERY GOOD THIS FILM! GOOD PLOT, GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, GOOD ROLES! THE BEST MARVEL FILM OF ALL TIME!"
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,The Hulk la lleva! :D
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Some said it could never be done but Marvel have proved that hard work and staying faithful to the comic books not only makes an excellent film but rakes in the cash too. The Avengers is what Marvel fans have waited for since the after credits scene of Iron Man and it finally arrived as the star studded cast assemble to save the day from the fantastic Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his army. The Avengers is everything a comic book fan could hope for in a film and more and has opened up endless possibilites for Marvel studios with a whole universe up and running exciting times are ahead for comic book fans.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"This is the kind of movie that Michael Bay would direct if he didn't suck. The only movie this summer I saw three times in the theaters, best time seeing was with my old man who grew up reading the Avengers comics during the 1970's. I remember wondering at one point ""I wonder if dad is having a good time?"" then looking over and watching my dad laughing like a hyena at the ""puny god"" scene. Since then it's become an in-joke with me and my pops we often quote the line when someone with a massive ego in his put in his/her place. 

Also to steal a line from a one Mr. Chester A. Bum...

""It has Sam Jackson as a pirate Yo Mutha Fucking Ho!"""
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"Loved this movie great acting, great storey love the talking comedy Hulk, the effects were very cools must see for those who live the marvel films"
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,la vi la primera vez y me gusto mucho (por mi fanatismo creo) pero  cuando la vi por segunda vez pude ver todos lo errores y son demasiados
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Very entertaining. Action all the way.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,This movie was great. Loved the action!
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Totally loved it..and I was expecting a huge flop...somehow put ALL the Marvel marvels together in a somewhat cohesive story...plus..seeing Scarlett J..in tights..well..that is always enjoyable.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"Stunning effects, good acting and characters. You're going to enjoy this one."
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Cant decide what Marvel film to watch then choose this as it has all your favourite heroes in.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"The ultimate superhero movie is literally a Marvel comic come to life. Simple, action packed and well cast. RDJ steals the show."
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,want to see again. witty funny
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"Brilliant mixture of Superheros, with great on screen chemistry and action"
"Sep 7, 2012",negative,"Sow â??the avengersâ?? movie yesterday, highly over-rated movie.
It was a like someone made a bad (Transformers+Final Fantasy) smoothy."
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Just watch if u like superheroes. In big screen u will enjoy.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,"Everything a comic book film should be and more, but it was missing Spiderman."
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,great movie with exceptional acting from some of the top actors in this day and age....awesome.
"Sep 7, 2012",positive,Better than what I expected!
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,"Probably the most ambitious movie of the modern era, The Avengers set a new, higher standard for all future superhero movies, and man, this film is definitely a must see or buy for everyone. This set a whole new meaning to summer blockbuster!!! 20/10 in my book"
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,This movie was great can't wait for iron man 3 and Thor 2 and captain America 2
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,I hadn't seen any of the other movies in the series but I am a big fan of Moss Whedon so I went to see it anyway. I loved the movie eventhough I did not have all the plot exposition.
"Sep 6, 2012",negative,I NEVER fall asleep at the movie but I fell asleep during this movie
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,It's alright....nothing special in the story.Made me want to see the origin films of the heroes....
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,"film was alright. too much eye candy though, didn't absorb the point of the movie... haha."
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,The best mix of action and comedy I have EVER SEEN in a movie!!
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,This is single handedly the best Super Hero action movie as of 2012.
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,The Avenger's is like five of the best comic book films ever made rolled into one.
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,"Not only is this one of the best *Superhero* movies I've ever seen, it's one of my favorite movies-Probably ever."

"Sep 6, 2012",positive,"Hulk Smash! again
6 9 2012
18 3 2014"
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,A fanboys delight. The Avengers is a fun but ultimately hollow film which is more style than substance and features an annoying over the top Michael bay style third act that doesn't know when to end.
"Sep 6, 2012",positive,"This movie was good, but I still prefer the individual superhero films; I think they allow for more character development. With six superheroes jostling for screentime, it was an inevitable problem though."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,"Best movie I've ever seen, in the action genre."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,best charactor :  the hulk
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,"Somewhat of a disappointment.  I expected a lot mor. A lot of visual impact, but the characters were hard to get interested in.  It seemed like there were too many story lines to cover in a 2 hr. movie. However, it was a pretty good movie to watch at home for movie night."
"Sep 5, 2012",negative,"I was bored, about half way through the final battle I thought to myself ""is this over yet?"" For most viewers you need a character to relate to. All of the characters where flat and rather drab, in fact having like 8 main characters made the movie even more uninteresting. Right from the beginning I knew how it would go, a problem would occur, everything will look okay, a set back will occur, a large battle, someone almost dies, good guys win. These super hero remakes are not good movies. I feel like they have run out of ideas so they are just taking stories right from comic books and making the fan boys go nuts."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,A great movie. Lot of Fun .....
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,"Not quite as enamored with this pic as I was by the first Iron Man, but I still found it pretty enjoyable even if some of the dialogue felt clumsy. I will definitely say, aside from a few earlier scenes (like when Thor and Cap and Iron Man get into it, or when Black Widow pulls her bit of tricksy not just on a few thugs but also on the Norse god of lies himself), I let out a gasp of awe when the Avengers got down to business and did what they do best: Save New York City. THAT was the Avengers I've known and loved from so long ago.  Nice foreshadow of what Avengers 2 will bring... and a real cute bit of whimsy in the freebie after-credits scene."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,Best comic movie EVER! Also movie of the year!
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,Iron Man has saved the world.
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,The best comic book film do date.
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,"I thought that this movie wouldn't have many turns in the events, and it surprised me when I watched it because, it has. However, there has been only one scene of intense in the hole 142 minutes"
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,can I give it 6 stars?  I enjoyed it as it paid tribute to the heroes and had such great chemistry (including the distrust and feeling out of each other). I really can't wait to see where they go next with this as well as the individual franchises. and I hope coulston finds his way back to the shield tv series next fall.
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,sweet movie im buyin dis at midnight
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,"The 8 year plan that Marvel set in motion payed off big time. This is one of, if not the best Comic book movie to date. It was a fantastic film and another to add to my growing blu ray collection."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,Joss whedon is the filosopher behind the knowledge of the avenger and makes it one of the best movies right next to moonrise kingdom
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,If can add more stars I would
"Sep 5, 2012",neutral,"In my opinion, its very overrated. Its pop-corn flick action just reminds of a Michael Bay film, even though the characters are infinitely more interesting and likable then anything Bay has ever done. I would also like to note that I was somewhat of a fan of Iron Man and Thor, but this movie just seemed stupid... seeing them all together. How this film got a 96% from users, let alone a 92% from CRITICS is beyond me."
"Sep 5, 2012",positive,Hulk is the fuckinnnn man
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,By far the best movie of 2012.  It was great to see the hulk steal the show by the end of the movie.
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,Loved it can't wait for Iron Man 3
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Loved, loved, loved this movie! Watched it three times and still catching new things. Joss Whedon brought his genius to this movie!"
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"fun and extremely entertaining. crap story and didn't care about the characters because i only saw the ironman series. saw this in 3d, 3d is garbage, hurt my eyes after two hours of mostly nonsense action."
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Great visual effects,decent story,great fantasy characters....bit slow in places but overall a decent film..good superhero movie not great but good....."
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,Simply the best superhero film ever.
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Greatest movie of 2012 thus far. Great story, amazing cinematography, perfect use of silent action, and amazing character development from everyone. Truly, Joss Whedon directed a masterpiece, even considering the Michael Bay-ish aliens. I seriously couldn't have asked for better"
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Awesome action, great dialogue and a solid story.   Up there with the first Iron Man if not quite there..."
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,Pretty bad ass.  Same group of characters/actors from the other movies with a few additions.  The Hulk was completely bad ass.  I also was totally into Iron Man.  His suit was a lot cooler and seeing all the crazy gadgets was nuts.
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"A pretty decent movie, although Captain America needs a bit of an attitude adjustment versus his movie. He was much nicer then.."
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"the cinematography was incredible and it was put so well together that you can practically go with anyone, the kids, the grandma, the friends. saw it 3 times in theatres, will own on day 1 of its release :)"
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Absolutely loved this movie, my second favorite movie of the summer to the dark knight rises, good humor and great action, a good family friendly movie (for the most part) that the parents will enjoy too, action packed, great movie!"
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Review Number: 5

Marvel's The Avenger - Contains countless of satisfying moments in both action and dialogue in an ambitious team-up that delivers.

It's pretty much almost everything that's fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen. Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, it's well-structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I can't think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups between them.

There's no need to go into detail on the plot; it's a superhero flick so naturally something or someone (Loki, Thor's adopted brother in this instance), threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day. It's formulaic but a lot of fun, if not particularly original or inspiring. It's difficult to surprise cinema-goers nowadays and plots are recycled, embellished and reimagined more often than conceived, but that needn't be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isn't demanding any more than to be entertained.

Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humor. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humor even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard - when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.

""The Avengers"" doesn't transcend; it regurgitates a done-to-death plot. Unlike ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight"" was more than a comic book film. It was entertaining, compelling, yet it explored complex moral ideas, and its plot went in innovative directions. Did anyone know that ""The Dark Knight"" would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the Joker and Batman for Harvey Dent's soul, a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the Joker or Batman really won in the end, a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be? And let's not forget, did you ever worry that any of the Avengers would not survive? If not, then where was the real dramatic tension? One of the things that made ""The Dark Knight"" so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed. Great films--serious or fun--must make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake, not just rely on the continual spectacle of fights and explosions.

The cast is superb and, in the case of the principals, either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here. Mostly they do as you'd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation; it's not that kind of film. However, beyond the obvious star-billed cast, there are some who delight absolutely. Tom Hiddleston (Wallander, The Deep Blue Sea), as Loki, is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards, while Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town) is an actor who's been around for a few years and co-starred in a number of excellent, if not huge, films. As Clint Barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor. It's just a pity that he's given little opportunity to develop his alter ego, Hawkeye, and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that.

I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that's what you're all about, you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.

There have been lots of action films that I've enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didn't have much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isn't one of them. If you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for."

"Sep 4, 2012",positive,solidly entertaining but when are they going to make captain america more interesting?
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,The must see movie of 2012
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Some good writing and characterization as well as effects, however drags on too long in the last act"
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"This could've so easily become a convoluted mess of a film with so many characters fighting for screen time, but Whedon did an fantastic job of balancing everything out and giving each of the individual heroes a deserved amount of attention and development. But what really sets The Avengers apart from the majority of this year's other blockbusters (say, Transformers 3), is that we actually care about the fate of the characters, whereas in the comparative final battle of Transformers 3 we just don't give a hoot.  The Avengers is funny, exciting and just a whole lot of fun - exactly what every blockbuster should be."
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever... no question period!!
"Sep 4, 2012",positive,"Just awesome! Biggest complaints are nerdy in nature. Hawkeye needed a more comic like costume, the aliens should have been kree or skrulls, and I thought it was a little too funny."
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,greatest movie ever point blank period
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"Fun, sarcastic camp. Thanks, Jossy!"

"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"This movie gets you pumped UP.It exciting the whole time..When hulk smash you wanna get up a scream. Only problem is the story line fell apart half way through the move and was replaced but action, which isnt a bad thing really. Just wish that the story line could have been a bit more epic."
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"A very enjoyable movie that gets acting, directing and writing correct. Even though they could have treated Hawkeye a little better."
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"Some cheesy parts, but thats what comic book movies are all about"

"Sep 3, 2012",positive,This movie is one of the best
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, and featuring Hawkeye and Black (giggity) Widow assemble for the Ultimate superhero movie. How can one movie be the sequel to four other movies, kick off more sequels, show how four equally matched heroes can exist in the sane movie unite play off each others' unique abilities and skills while being nearly upstaged by the more ordinary side characters. Love this movie. Great ride and hungry for more shwarma."
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,Lots of super hero fire power action.  If you can get into comic book mode you're In for a fun ride.   Downy Jr. is the standout.
"Sep 3, 2012",neutral,expected more...especially the storyline of the first hour is boring and redundant.
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies ever!!!! Filled with intense action, comedy and well developed characters, toped off with a solid plot!!! AND IT'S FULL OF SUPER HEROS!!!!!! A must see movie!!!"
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"Joss at the top of his game. Great movie all around, worth watching!"

"Sep 3, 2012",positive,"One of the few movies I have rated 5/5! It's great! Humorous, classy, simple and full of action. However, there are some scenes that seem like it only focused on Ironman. Well, I don't care, coz it's really fun to watch. Bravo. Waiting for Part 2?"
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,I admit my surprise. This was one of the most fun superhero movies. Hulk smash Loki. Worth it.
"Sep 3, 2012",positive,a good fun movie that is shot beautifully & visually stunning. But something was 'missing' & as such it didn't blow me away. Plus Captain America is a knob
"Sep 3, 2012",negative,Bored the shit out of me.  But hey I know I am in the minority here.
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,5 stars out of 5 for me. This is as good as a superhero movie can get. It lived up to all the hype and Iron Man is just plain awesome in this one as always!! It's one kickass superhero flick!

"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"Enjoyable throughout with good humor, dialogue, acting, and story telling.  It's one of the best superhero movies ever made."
"Sep 2, 2012",negative,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! I could barely force myself to sit through it. The plot is uninteresting and predictable, the dialogue was cheesy and not important, the villain was not anything memorable, I could go on and on. Long story short, if Chris Hemsworth wasn't in 3D, I would have left about 20 minutes in."
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,I really enjoyed this movie.
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,The Avengers: Dark of the Moon
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"Love it!

Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army. 

It was great fun watching it! Lot's of action (full action package), great few comedy parts, awesome cast and great heroes and villains. I enjoyed very much and I recommend it to everyone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nick Fury: There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Steve Rogers: I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.
Bruce Banner: I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats. You can smell crazy on him.
Thor: Have a care how you speak! Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard and he is my brother!
Natasha Romanoff: He killed eighty people in two days.
Thor: He's adopted. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Steve Rogers: Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?
Tony Stark: Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
World Security Council: Director Fury, the council has made a decision.
Nick Fury: I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tony Stark: [to Loki] Let's do a head count here: your brother the demi-god; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and YOU, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nick Fury: Where's Barton?
Selvig: The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.

"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"Excelente, definitivamente Hollywood aprendeu a fazer filmes de super herois. Marvel e DC devem estar rindo a toa com o aumento da popularidade de seus personagens. 
Muitos acharam que seriam muitos personagens para ser retratado na pelicula em 2 horas. Mas ao contrario se ve uma excelente arquitetura da historia e uma trama que diverte do comeco ao fim. 
Nao sei com relacao ao cinema, mas o 3D na tv ficou muito bom."
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,Maybe one of the best super-hero movies EVER MADE IN HISTORY!!
"Sep 2, 2012",negative,"Loki (Tom Hiddleston) retorna à Terra enviado pelos chitauri, uma raça alienígena que pretende dominar os humanos. Com a promessa de que será o soberano do planeta, ele rouba o cubo mágico dentro de instalações da S.H.I.E.L.D. e, com isso, adquire grandes poderes. Loki os usa para controlar o dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) e Clint Barton/Gavião Arqueiro (Jeremy Renner), que passam a trabalhar para ele. No intuito de contê-los, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) convoca um grupo de pessoas com grandes habilidades, mas que jamais haviam trabalhado juntas: Tony Stark/Homem de Ferro (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Capitão América (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) e Natasha Romanoff/Viúva Negra (Scarlett Johansson). Só que, apesar do grande perigo que a Terra corre, não é tão simples assim conter o ego e os interesses de cada um deles para que possam agir em grupo."
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"Slow out of the gates, but poor first half is forgotten with tremendous ending much of which 3D finally played a positive role. This is the first movie I've seen in the past 5 years worth the value of 3D. The technology has not yet arrived (overall)."
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"[Rated 3.8] Am on the minority here. This movie just didn't work for me. Hardly any character development! At certain point, it just seems like shoot and destroy everything type of movie. Not much crafting with the details either. Feels like scattered piece of puzzles never solved, not reaching its proper potential. It just doesn't click for me. Only thing I enjoyed was the Hulk Smash, now that has entertainment value, rest, am not so sure. Am reviewing this one a little late, was trying hard to understand whats the hype so much. Well, I really don't know!"
"Sep 2, 2012",negative,tecnicamente bem feita e com um roteiro patÃ (C)tico... se tivesse visto dublado ou legendado em chinÃªs daria no mesmo

"Sep 2, 2012",positive,This movie was GREAT.I did not like marvel or dc and i saw this movie and now im a marvel fan!                               Its hard to find movies with the perfect amount of action and comody.Robert downey Jr. Is a AWESOME actress.and is hilarious
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"A fun movie with some snappy dialogue,with some good action scenes but my major crisp some of the CGI effects aren't as good as i hope to be."
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,un peu longuet mais ça se laisse regarder
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,Entirely silly but more fun than the vast majority of these movies.
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"Having seen this, I have no regrets giving the Thor and Captain America movies a miss as they are clearly less interesting than Ironman and the Hulk.
Is it me or does anyone else think Loki has a REtarded costume?"
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,no esta mal aunque pudo ser mejor
"Sep 2, 2012",positive,"After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abyssmal second installement of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.

The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some âdepthâ to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.

Iâ(TM)ve always liked Robert Downey Jrâ(TM)s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since heâ(TM)s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the âpuny godâ scene (if you havenâ(TM)t seen the film yet youâ(TM)ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).

I have to say that I found Thor a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then Iâ(TM)m Scandinavian soâ¦ 

Anyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much."

"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"SO MUCH POTENTIAL...

and an extremely entertaining movie without even breaking a sweat.  The plot was flimsy, 3/4 of the movie are basically spent watching the heroes fighting amongst themselves, and in the end it's really pretty lame to watch Loki, a demigod, beat around like one of my dog's toys.  I must admit the hunkiness factor was definitely delivered by Chris Evans.  The switch from Norton to Ruffalo for The Hulk was a stroke of genius and the casting of Johansson as Romanoff was one of the highlights of the movie for me.  As for the rest, well, they did a good job and they're lucky they got a great director.  Without a steady hand the movie could easily have gone off the track and crashed and burned.  After all of that, still, I felt like there was so much more that they could have done with a superb story served on a silver platter.  Oh well, at least they didn't ruin it"
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,A Classic. Better get a whole lot of Oscar nods.
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,There is nothing better I could say about this movie then what has already been said. Brilliant

"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"I'd give it 3 1/4 stars, would've been higher but I mostly dislike the final battle sequence- it just felt too Transformers-ish for me. Loved the characters interactions, and could've done with more Hawkeye - as Hawkeye, purple suit included. Thought Johansson actually made Widow interesting, and wish they had done more with Stark/Banner interplay. One weird thing is at the movies we saw a scene where Thor confronts illegal fishers and Fury knows of Thor's actions, but that scene was not at the two drive in viewings, and Thor just shows up during the plane sequence. No explaination of how Earth was reached since the events of his movie? Oh well, the THANOS cameo almost made the geek in me forget that. Bring in Masters of Evil, and Kang the Conqueror, in sequels!!!"
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"The BEST Marvel super hero flick I've seen in YEARS! It's witty, funny, action packed striking a rare balance that entertains kids AND adults simultaneously!!!"

"Sep 1, 2012",positive,Silly and predictable. I must say all the hype and it all collapsed on it self. I enjoyed it. The visuals are amazing and the plot and script are good. There is no character development . This could have been an excellent and clever movie but was disappointing
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,It was good but I think it was over rated. The Hulk was the best thing in it.
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,amazing best marvel movie ever!!
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,all my Marcellus marvel characters. :D
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,Seen it and felt that whilst the film was in most cases welcoming to watch a few things felt wrong 1.) the character of Bruce Banner no longer being played by Edward Norton felt wrong but also his replacement was in most cases a side actor not a front like Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. 2.) The Humor in places was a little delayed all to appear in the final fight scene so it felt a little rushed
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"Look At My Watch Meter = Not Till It Was Over

Far more entertaining than any of the individual components (except Iron Man), the movie showed what the sum of all parts can be.  The scene with the Hulk near the end is the heartiest laugh I've had in a movie theater in a long, long time."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,Walt Disney Picture choose the right director. Joss Whendon understand how to make personalty in each character very interesting
"Sep 1, 2012",negative,"After all the $$$ it made, the studio gives a few paultry special features to the fans including extended scenes not even completed ( in front of green screens) . Where is the extended version promised or will it be rereleasing after we have already paid twice??? To add to the migraine we have the same old cgi blow them up epic we have all seen before, but with more characters."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,favorite mobie of the year
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"The buildup to this unprecedented superhero team-up has proven to be well worth it. Avengers actually stands well above the films that led to it, and really should also rank among the best of the crop in the superhero genre. This mostly comes down to Joss Whedon's direction and creative input , his background in fantasy TV providing him with the know-how on how to best create the on-screen chemistry of an ensemble cast. It is immensely entertaining stuff to see our heroes quarrel at first, and then learning to appreciate their differences and come together against their common enemy, unhinged intergalactic megalomaniac Loki, returning from the previous Thor film, and played with perverse gusto by Tom Hiddleston. Visually the film is stunning, making superb use of 3D and all manner of digital effects, just as you'd expect such a big blockbuster to look. Then there's Alan Silvestri's sweeping score ramping up the heroics.  Must see...on the big screen if you can. PS - Most pleasing to see Hulk served so well by this picture, too."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,Solid team ensemble with surprising comedy. Last 30 mins is the coolest!
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"Although there were some parts in it that are different than the previous Marvel films, Avengers Assemble is an excellent and extremely exciting experience that's rolls up to an outstanding NY battle sequence."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"Better clench up, Legolas."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"Obviously been over hyped, this definite blockbuster just didn't end up being as awesome as expected. 
I didnt grow up with the marvel characters neither have i watched every movie featuring these heroes, (which may be a reason why i dont connect with them individually) but what they did manage to do was add some witting, snappy humour to touch base with their adult fans. 

Action scenes were fun and the hulk would've been my favourite but that's really all I can say. Nothing here to wow me as visual effects and storyline were generic, not outstanding enough to have me see it again but instead watch titles like Thor, Captain America, etc to get a bit of history."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,Can't wait for the next one...
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"I am hardly a comic fan- I have never even picked up a comic book and I'm utterly lost in comic shops. I've never been very interested in superheroes, However, I picked up the DVD because it had so many good reviews, thinking that it would be a good enough movie, barely worth my while. I actually ended up loving it. I bought it just yesterday and have already watched it twice, and it's made me quite determined to watch some of the other movies that feature these characters, as well as perhaps a few others. I think my experience proved that anyone can enjoy a film as long as it's a good one, not just someone with specific interests."
"Sep 1, 2012",positive,"Just brilliant, hulk stole the show."
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've seen in my life :D
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,"Much more fun than I had originally thought (which wasn't much). What a surprise! Although it has taken Marvel many years to get all of the background characters and stories developed, there's still some fresh and interesting material here to delight me and the journey, rough at spot, was worth it. As Whedon and others mentioned, this isn't about VFX, but about characters and their stories, which is well balanced here."
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,It's as great as anyone could expect it to be.
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,It was Super good! And long!
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,Awesome! I loved Hulk and Iron Man and everybody. Excellent graphics

"Aug 31, 2012",positive,Best film of 2012. Though you might have to watch all the other films about the characters to understand.  Great action movie.
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,Can't wait for the sequel!!! Marvel is a movie making giant now
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,the action was awesome and i was in awe most the movie but there was a little too much dialouge
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,"Full tilt action masterpiece!  With the marvel slate of films having set the stage; it nearly seemed impossible for this superhero mashup not to fail on some level.  But it didn't and Joss Whedon finally gets his due.  With an intricately woven story that brings all of our favorite hero's together to save the world, Joss and co. nearly ripped our screens to shreds with precisely timed action sequences and succinct barrages of comic relief.  This was truly the perfect summer action film."
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,"The actors fit the roles to perfection, the writing was superb, the witty one liners successfully hilarious (I'm still quoting them), the plot well paced, the action engrossing without overwhelming. Each character's personal development (especially Bruce Banner/Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo) and the ""iron sharpens iron"" effect in their relationships with each other--pun intended--was beautifully portrayed (especially Capt x Iron Man and Thor x Iron Man). 

I normally avoid action movies but this will take a place of honor on my video shelves as the best movie of 2012."
"Aug 31, 2012",negative,All the build up for something average. Disappointing
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,Really enjoyed this full of hot men and a decent storyline works for me x
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,"Oodles of fun. Lots of eye candy for the guys and girls, plus cool FX for movie geeks.  Marvel did a great job setting up this movie with the individual character movies first. A soon to be classic."
"Aug 31, 2012",positive,"Antagligen den film som har spelat in mest pengar i Ã¥r med sina smÃ¥tt fantastiska 1,5 miljarder dollar worldwide, smaka pÃ¥ det. Efter alla Marvels del filmer ""Iron Man filmerna"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Thor"" och ""Captain America"" sÃ¥ har vi Ã¤ntligen kommit till sjÃ¤lva huvudfilmen ""The Avengers"". Mannen som skulle gÃ¶ra denna film till verklighet blev serienÃ¶rden Joss Whedon och man kan vÃ¤l sÃ¤ga att det var rÃ¤tt fÃ¶r jobbet fÃ¶r han har verkligen lyckas fÃ¥ till den rÃ¤tta Avengers kÃ¤nslan.
Med nÃ¤stan alla original skÃ¥despelarna fÃ¶rutom dÃ¥ Mark Ruffalo som Hulken och det anser jag Ã¤r en klar fÃ¶rbÃ¤ttring, han har ett skÃ¶nt lugn som Banner en skÃ¶n kontrast till hans ilskna alter ego Hulken.
Superskurken i denna fÃ¶rsta Avenger film Ã¤r Loki som ju gjorde sitt intrÃ¤de i ""Thor"" och han kÃ¤nns vÃ¤l lite sÃ¥dÃ¤r som en superskurk, men man ska inte klaga det kunde varit mycket vÃ¤rre. Blev Ã¶verraskad av all humor som fanns i filmen nÃ¥got som kÃ¤ndes vÃ¤ldigt befriande, men samtidigt som det hettar till sÃ¥ har Whedon lyckas hÃ¥lla bra nivÃ¥ pÃ¥ just humorn. 
Trenden med superhjÃ¤ltar verkar ju inte avta och ""The Avengers 2"" Ã¤r redan pÃ¥ gÃ¥ng och sÃ¥ gott som alla superhjÃ¤ltar i filmen fÃ¥r fortsatt fÃ¶rtroende i sina egna filmer, nÃ¥got som bÃ¥de Ã¤r pÃ¥ gott och ondo, jag hade gÃ¤rna varit utan en ""Iron Man 3"" men det Ã¤r ju bara jag."

I recommend you see the hero's individual movies before seeing this. I mean you don't have to, it will still be a great movie but it makes it even better"
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,One of the few movies I saw in theater and more than once!
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,Every Avengers fan will admit that the plot was nothing short of lame. But the script specifically those written for Stark & Banner were awesome & that kept the movie going. Ruffalo added a new dimension to the character of Banner. Stark's expressions & dialogues were superbly timed. Tom Hiddleston was great in the role of Loki. The script is a winner.
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,absolute entertainment... loved the hole concept

"Aug 30, 2012",positive,Gonna be even better on blu ray
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,Probably the best superhero movie I've seen in a considerable amount of time. If you haven't seen it yet you're really missing out. It has everything!
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,"The Avenger's reputation - even after just a few months of being on release - is quite impressive, and it has some very vocal fans.  The first thing to say is how impressive it looks - the effects are first rate, though the final thirty minutes begin to resemble a computer game.  The acting is fine, Joss Whedon directs with flourish and his script has some very good one-liners.  It is, however, a very hollow spectacle, full of holes and entitely incomprehensible to the outsider.  

There is a problem with almost all these superhero movies, and it is that they are too enthralled to the surface sheen, the look, that they forget all about the heart.  Sometimes they make token efforts towards depth and true characterisation, but it always sounds like a teenage boy's idea of what emotion is, not an adults.  

Then there are the inconsistencies.  Loki's plan was a bit muddled.  If The Hulk can't control himself on the ship, why can he then control himself on the streets?  If security at Stark Tower is so strict, how can a scientist get on top of the building and set up a device completely unnoticed, especially when the world is looking for him?  Why, if the tesseract is a two-way door, and Loki can come through it without trouble, does it need a power source to open it for everyone else?  To made it wider, you might say, why then are others able to cross between worlds in Thor?  These were just some of the bigger questions the film failed to answer.  And, as with the stunted emotional issues of these films, these are questions raised because such film are enamoured with the way things look.  They quite often don't care for logic, consistency or intelligence.  

The Avengers then, is a loud, brash, good looking film that does everything it can to stop you thinking about its emptiness, shallow self.  Still, this is one of the better films in this mode."
"Aug 30, 2012",positive,This was a great movie and exceeded my expectations.
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,"I'm maybe the only person in the entire world who dont like this, i find pointless, just action e explosions the entire movie, no great acts or a good script."

{Yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes! Wasn't even a Marvel fan. Hadn't watched any of the other movies like Iron Man. Didn't understand a lot of what was going on, but MAN! This was great. It's surprisingly HILARIOUS. You'll be falling off your seat one second and then crying because 'what are these feelings.' It's great.

"Aug 29, 2012",positive,"In my opinion,The Avengers is by far the greatest super hero film of all time."
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,The dysfunctionals together... Genius. They play off each other so well with a couple of in-house bitch fights of epic proportions. Loved Thor & Iron Man's face-off especially! The Hulk had a few comedy tantrum moments & was interesting to see Hawkeye & Black Widow's relationship. Am hoping a few more historic Avengers appear. Joss Whedon can do no wrong & I am a Whedonite through & through... I think we should vote for him to save X-Men too... Most entertaining movie since Cabin In The Woods 2nd half!
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,Simply amazing! Waited a year to see it. Worth the wait
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,"It's surely a novel concept of not having one prequel to a film, but having a whole range of prequels to one film. unfortunately, this concept is likely to be copied over and over again in the future, first of all of course by dc comics.

However, regarding this film, you get what you expect: a mediocre story that is nevertheless strong enough and reasonably coherent to carry the film, and lots of superhero action. and with scarlett johansson as black widow and the recent kate beckinsale as catwoman it can only be a matter of time until we finally get to see a female superhero film that isn't completely screwed up (remember halle berry as catwoman?)"
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,Very entertaining. Like watching a moving graphic novel. It's clear that the creators are fans of the comics and that's the way it ought to be... I just wanted more than one female superhero. Perhaps the sequel(s) will have the Wasp and I really hope they have SpiderWoman!
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,awesome action packed thriller definately a must see if youre into superheros
"Aug 29, 2012",positive,"Arguably the greatest comic book movie since ""The Dark Knight"". All the heroes are magnificently endearing, but the real hero here is Whedon's script and tight direction."
"Aug 29, 2012",negative,piece of overrated crap ...lmaof
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,I liked it do much no I loved it but I am a marvel fan so that makes sense a little can't wait for the second one with a new  super villain  can't wait to buy it!!!!!
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Absolutely Amazing, the perfect movie, my new favorite of all time. Iron Man is always the Best, and awesome, and hilarious. I can't wait for the sequel, and Iron Man 3 WOOOOOOOOOO."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!
"Aug 28, 2012",negative,"Alors au niveau des SFX, on en prend plein les yeux mais niveau scenar, qu'est-ce que c'est nul. Oh mon dieu ! Je m'attendais a quelque chose de beaucoup mieux tout de meme. 
Concernant les super heros, a part The Hulk et mon prefere, Iron Man, les autres sont d'un ridicule (Thor et Captain America sans parler de Loki)
Et heureusement que Iron Man est la pour donner un cote humoristique au film sinon on s'ennuierait sacrement."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"By far, the best superhero movie ever created in my opinion. Joss Whedon is a certifiable genius!"
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Loved it, great cast of actors, perfect for their parts"
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Love iron man Robert Downey jr is awsome
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Humans... They are not the cowering wretches we were promised. They stand. They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled. To challenge them is to court death."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Pretty awesome ... like the effects and action scenes... Havnt seen Iron man 2 or Captain America... But non the less very entertaining
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,best movie i've ever seen!
"Aug 28, 2012",neutral,Boring as hell. Two and a half hours of supposed superheroes doing silly parkour jumps around a flying aircraft carrier and the streets of NYC. Iron Man is cool but he has his own movies to be cool in. This movie is not cool. Believe it.
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Marvellous production, perfect script, humour and action. Downey's performance clearly stands up - without the Iron Man, the team would be just plain boring."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"When you go see a super-hero flick, this is exactly what you want to see. Mark Ruffalo was a bit of a disappointment, but I'm still not sure if that's his fault or the writers'."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"I always fear the hype with comic flicks like this, but I was entertained.  Since a sequel was inevitable, I think it would have been best not go past the 2 hour mark, and I did register at least three big yawns before it was all over, but the amount of juiced action sequences and snarkful, rapid-fire dialog keeps it from ever getting too boring.  It's probable that I would watch it again."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,THE BEST FILM EVER!! Action packed from start to finish.
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"The best super hero movie ever, worthy of 6 stars."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Laughed at this movie alot more than expected
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Nasproti ocekuvanjata i falenjata, filmov e prilicno prosecen ako go sporedam so Batman od Nolan. So eden fenomenalen carski gospodin coek -  Robert Downey Jr!"
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Can't wait for the 3D Blue-ray release...We just bought it in 3D this last Tuesday...
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Joss showed perfect team to protect world.
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Not very original story but makes up for it with Very good Characters, action,messages and a lot of funny and epic moments."
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,Amazing....Iron Man and Hulk Rocks......
"Aug 28, 2012",positive,"Friends, Avengers, Countrymen, lend me your ears. I have come to praise Joss Whedon, not to bury him.

I'll tell you that Mark Ruffaloâ(TM)s Hulk was moving. The actor did in seconds what others needed hours to do. He might have even out-emoted Colin Firthâ(TM)s Mr. Darcy. If there is a heart in The Avengers, it lies within Mark Ruffaloâ(TM)s sometimes green, monstrous chest. Or in Scarlett Johanssonâ(TM)s bosomy chest. The jaded, shattered spy is a trope, and yet she brings it to life with such pathos that I wanted to pay for her counseling. And her interaction with Hawkeye, where in seconds, backstory was spun out with such depth, such richness, I might have been eating a comic book mousse.

And that is the brilliance of Whedon. Quickly, magically, he can create characters we love. Snap your fingers, you are captured, and if you like the characters, everything elseÂ will follow because that is the magic of storytelling.

The Avengers is a completely satisfying comic book movie. The movie has texture. The characters, the action sequences, the whole mother-lovinâ(TM) spectacle of it has texture. And itâ(TM)s funny. I howled laughter and clapped my hands with glee. A child again, witnessing the circus. I needed, though, two things. And I just wonder if Joss Whedon knew I needed them.

I was surprised that much of the tension was due to the Hulk. Here you have larger-than-life superheroes, even a few demigods, and yet, they are afraid of the Hulk.

And the end battle. I needed a dark moment. That whole end battle could have been handled better. More grit and angst. At times, the story was murky. Why would lording over humans please Loki? His character arc wasnâ(TM)t as clear as it needed to be.

But funny, and cool, and moving. Iâ(TM)m telling you, when Bruce Banner walked on stage, I got tears in my eyes just looking at him. And the shawarma at the end. If you wait through the credits, youâ(TM)ll see the shawarma. And itâ(TM)s worth the wait.

Joss Whedon, through decades of storytelling and work, has become an icon. Heâ(TM)s the George Lucas we all wanted. Heâ(TM)s a great man. Arise, Joss Whedon, and bring us more stories. More characters. More! Since The Avengers has become a hulkish hit, maybe you can insist on a John Carter sequel!"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,Best superhero team up ever! I love everything in this movie. What caught my eye was that each hero at least got enough screen time as it should. Love it!
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,Has to be the best movie I've seen all year!!!
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"Another great action packed movie based off Marvel comic books. I mean come on, what guy doesn't love the spectacle of an amazing superhero movie? Nerd and popular kid a like."
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"Brilliant movie, managed to recently watch it and i was wowed, the 3D was great and the movie was even better. even if you have high expectations, it should be better than them. the hulk was perfectly cast and the cgi on him is perfect. MUST WATCH and MUST BUY ON 3D"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"best comic book movie out there, can't wait for two :)"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"Being a comic book geek firstly, it was awesome to finally see a team of heroes on screen (although I wish it was Justice League.. DC Fanboy!). As much as this movie's been talked about, everything from the acting, the action sequences, Mark Ruffalo stealing the spotlight, but I think the thing that should be talked about more is Joss Whedon. The way he wrote the script, giving all of the members equal screen time, making it a real team effort. Also, a blockbuster cash cow"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,Best thing about Avengers...... Chris Hemsworth!!
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"As soon as I heard Joss Whedon was at the helm of this baby, i knew it was in safe hands. How right I was. Whedon manages to give all of the characters a good amount of screen time, so that no matter which hero you prefer, you'll be satisfied. I feel that Whedon really understands comic books, and how their movie versions should play out, as seen clearly in The Avengers. It's epic to the point of exploding, and silly in just the right amount. The scale is suitably grand, and the set pieces likewise a marvel (see what i did there?). The villain's motive may not have a lot behind it, but Loki himself is a lot of fun, and a lot of the back-and forth between he and the Avengers provide some delightfully snappy dialogue. Also, finally, the Hulk done right. Now of the things I enjoyed most about this film was Bruce Banner, so kudos to Mark Ruffalo for a great job. Throw in some funny moments, most notably from Downey Jr, some amazing special effects, and Samuel L Jackson, and you're sitting on one of the most entertaining and most fun movies I've seen in a long while. Oh, and Stan Lee has a cameo, naturally."
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,Avengers is exciting and really funny but tried too hard to make a smash hit and overdoing some parts.
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"excellent film, great story and not over the top"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"pure entertainment!! 
""That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry.'"

"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"simply put, it's 140 minutes of chock full of nerdgasms."
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,perhaps the best superhero movie I've ever seen!
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"Maybe the hype was just too much...I kinda expected the Godfather of Superhero movies...I still probably got the best one of all of them but still it kinda fell a little short for me...Would have given it 4 stars, Hiddleston probably deserved all four of them himself, but Cobie Smulders ruined it for me..."
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"This movie was off the chain! This movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end. The story from bringing everyone together to fighting together is engaging. Loki plays a very deceitful villain that keeps you guys guessing what his motive is. Starting a inter galactic war is one thing, but it goes deeper.  The film is filled with some amazing action scenes! Reminds you of films like Transformers but better! Lots of cool graphics and realism. I am steadily amazed by the work that film makers do to create these films.

Overall you will love this film. Whether you are a follower of the Marvel Comic book characters or not you will enjoy The Avengers! I would highly recommend you see this!"
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,One of the better Superhero movies.  A jolly romp and well worth seeing.
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,Awesome popcorn fun!!!
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"Whedon did a fantastic job, the cast was great. Action Packed, Visual, Great."
"Aug 27, 2012",positive,"OH GOD THIS FILM. Ever since I watched 'The Avengers - The animated series', I fell in love with this team and god are they great. As time past on and as I watched more of the animated series, I thought to myself, MAKE A MOVIE PLEASE!! So, Captain America came out, in the credits there is always usually a miniclip to reveal if there is a second movie they are going to release, but... what I saw was phenomenal, even better than seeing a second to Captain America, what I saw was ofcourse 'The Avengers' miniclip trailer. I got so excited and since then 'till the release of this movie, I was so excited I couldn't sleep. 

Onto my thoughts...

This movie was exceptionally great, equalling in humour, action and adventure, Joss Whedon made you feel like you were apart of this God team. When I nagged my dad to go see this, and he said yeah sure lets go see it. I cried in my head. Although they could've improved just a BIT better on how they form The Avengers, but no hate, it was still tremendous. The humour in this film was huge, when Thor says ' Now listen to me Loki' *or something*, then gets tackled by Iron Man, and Loki responds without Thor next to him ' I'm listening? ', everyone in the theatre just cracked up in laughter, and also when Hulk just pummels loki in Stark Tower and walks away like a king and says ' Puny god '. This was absolutely hilarious. The cast was ofcourse the best and only option, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was the one and only perfect actor to play him, it's like Nick Fury is apart of him, that is why he played that role perfectly. Overall I honestly thought this was a exciting way to form these heroes into one team in one movie, this just made my year."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Awesome fucking awesome
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,A feast for the eyes in terms of CGI effects and the stars. The film flows very smoothly and all the characters fit perfectly (even when they're fighting against each other).
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"And then Captain america says: Hulk......Smash!! 
Hahaha. Awesome and super funny. Specially when Hulk smashed Loki while loki was trying to give a speech. Lmfao!!"
"Aug 26, 2012",neutral,"The movie was good, but I found it to be kind of boring. There were major periods of time with no action, which made the movie move slowly. Also, the whole story line of saving the planet was fine but I just did not think that it was overly entertaining. In the film's defense, I had never seen ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", or the Hulk movie, which might have helped me to enjoy the movie more."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,It keeps getting more awesome everytime I watch it.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"Even if your not a comic-book fan, you will unltimately LOVE this film."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"SEE!! THIS is what a comic book adaptation action movie WITH a plot looks like!!
Are you taking notes Micheal Bay?!!!!"
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,the best action packed movie I have ever seen
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Captain America's ugly costume design. Ugh.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Going to have to watch it again. For my own reasons.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"While not the greatest film of all time, The Avengers delivers all the hype bulit up in 50 years since its first comic. An all star cast, incredible action sequences, good dialogue, and large amounts of humor, Joss Whedon has surpassed all standards that the past films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have made. Overall, the Avengers is the defining example of a true comic-book film made real."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"Great, it is my favorite comic book film. Character interactions, at the same time the action scenes where amazing."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"Los Vengadores funciona muy bien como pelÃ­cula de superhÃ (C)roes,lo Ãºnico que se critica es su falta de originalidad...por lo demÃ¡s,la pelÃ­cula estÃ¡ de sobra!!!!"
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,The best super hero film ever ....... Ace
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Avengers was great. Can't wait for the Hulk to have a new movie.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Kone?n? slepili vecky ty zfilmované marvelovské hrdiny do jednoho filmu. P?kn? se na to kouká. Jen m?j milá?ek Spider-man mi tam chyb?l.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,maybe the best movie in 2012
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"A top flight movie in it's own right, and even better as pure comic book escapism."
"Aug 26, 2012",negative,"Except for some good CGI nothing ground breaking here, just the same old theme that we are used to seeing in super hero movies. In the end the superheroes accomplish everything they had to without sacrificing even one bit, seriously tired of this shit, for Gods sake introduce something new to this genre (like Nolan did)"
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,this movie really whips the llama's ass.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,I own this on DVD and Blu-Ray
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"The culmination of Marvel's phase one does not disappoint. Bringing us exhilarating action, great writing, and unparalleled chemistry between the cast. The bar has been set for every comic book movie to come."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"massive film very well done ,witty humour but the only problem is that avengers 2 will have to top it."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Too much action. Too little plot.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,99% satisfied..tremendous fun
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"After sitting through the morose and plodding Dark Knight Rises the other week, it pleases me to say that Whedon's extravagant and kinetic super hero romp exceeds its hype to produce one of the finest comic book adaptations to date. The script (by Whedon and Zak Penn) utilises the Avengers legacy to give flesh to the characters while adding his own brand of fan boy humour to the proceedings. Eschewing the normal opening action set piece, Whedon instead steadily builds up the tension, keeping the super-heroics at bay while outlining Loki's threat to the planet. In doing away with the normally requisite exposition, the dialogue is allowed to breathe (especially during the many ego clashes) while giving each of the characters space to develop. Playing on each hero's strengths and weaknesses (Banner's anger management issues and Captain America's Dudley Do-Right persona among them), the script fairly crackles with quips and witty repartee to such a degree that I could have listened to them bicker for another hour. On the technical side, the digital mayhem is rendered in comic book style too, the art directors astutely plundering the original comics to pour vivid energy into finely-choreographed set-pieces (especially the jaw-dropping alien invasion finale). Performances are uniformly terrific with special mention going to the pairing of Ruffalo and Downey Jnr. whose scenes together are pure comedic gold. Although there are a couple of dud scenes (usually involving the bland Black Widow and/or Hawkeye), the overall result is a satisfying and briskly-paced piece of entertainment that leaves Bat Man looking like the gloomy emo he is. If further evidence is needed that the dark days of comic movies are over, Avengers more than provides the proof of their demise. Highly recommended."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,It was mediocre. I kept falling asleep.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,nepochopil som preco vsetci glorifikuju avengers a pritom sprdli batmana. batman mal narozdiel od tohoto pribeh a atmosferu
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"Like a superior, state of the art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143 minute team-origin story."
"Aug 26, 2012",neutral,"what a load of nonsense, even Transformers 3 is better than this :P"
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"Very easy to watch, exactly what you expect apart for the useless comedy bits (guy playing 8bit computer game). Would of liked to see more Ruffalo getting mad."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,A movie filled mostly by action sequences is hard to enjoy these days but yes we still sometimes get a rare experience like this.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Wanna make a superheroes movie? Just call Josh! :D
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,In all reality a very average and routine movie made great by CGI eye candy and Downeyâ(TM)s acting.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved it! Impatiently waiting for the next one :)
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,"The ""Avengers"" is a lot like a high class hooker. Both cost a lot to put together and definitely look phenomenal but after the experience you cant help but feel a little empty. It's armed with an abundance of very snappy dialogue from its star-studded cast, however, for each gem there are 3 lame lines, 2 over descriptions of obvious plot points and a lengthy dull speech about every 15mins. Robert Downey Jnr. carries this film, and having talented friends to play with certainly does make him all the funnier. The action sequences themselves are exciting, visually impressive and will make comic book movie fanboys cream themselves faster than the aforementioned lady of the night.

All this put together makes for a solid 2 and a half hours of brain dead fun but little else. This nerd porn gets a solid 3 stars."
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,Probably one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen.
"Aug 26, 2012",positive,if i can give this movie a 10 star rating i would anthony stark aka ironman aka the first amored avenger is the f...in super hero out there stan lee who ever gave you this idea is the worlds greatest much love ------> benito caballero
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,Great fun at the cinema! Absurd? Yes but who gives a shit!
"Aug 25, 2012",neutral,"This movie is so long--I don't have the patience for these sorts of things. A month after seeing it, I don't remember any particular story, theme, or payoff. Outside of Iron Man, I don't have a relationship with most of the characters, either, so we're relying mostly on cinematics to impress. As an audience member, I enjoyed watching the first Transformers in theaters more than I enjoyed this."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,Great movie and I am a huge hulk fan and the hulk looked and played bad ass in the movie with all the other characters
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"One of the greatest comic book movie adaptions of all time, fun, funny and full of awesome action."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,Surprisingly fantastic!! There should never be that many good looking people on one screen!!
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,So Action Packed!!!!
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,As if I didn't expect this movie to spend 40 minutes in that ship with RDJ yapping.... It is hilarious but then at the end.... BAM! YOU GET A TRANSFORMER LENGTH BATTLE TO KILL OFF THE REST OF THE TIME.
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"While not boring, wasn't engrossing at all. More formulaic superhero overrated nonsense with few redeeming values aside from its CGI, grandiose action spectacle."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,Best Movie of Summer '12
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,This is everything a summer film should be. Super Hero films don't get any better than this.
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"It all comes back to Whedon - his clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script.
And ultimately - never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"I actually have to say i expected this to look much better, i think that any of the transformers and captain america or thor look better than this ensemble movie. In particular the big scenes in the city looks kind of cheap. But apart this the movie is amazing, it features a great cast and its fun, Jeremy Renner is an amazing new entry. I can't wait for the sequel to come out. I would probably also add that is better if you watch Thor, Captain America and the two Iron Man (and Hulk) before watching Avengers."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,WATCHIN IT ON DVD GREAT FILM

"Aug 25, 2012",neutral,"""The Avengers"" is rather comical than serious, which I can't say I didn't expect. It's your typical super hero movie, with plenty of action, special effects, predictable plots, good looking super heroes and Scarlett Johansson. My favorite was The Hulk, only when he in his green state, though. There are two incredibly funny sequences: one being The Hulk in his original state arriving on a little scooter in a war zone and the second being when he is challenged by the main villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston). I always enjoy super hero flicks so it was fun, but it needed a better villain and a more dynamic climax to be fully satisfying; below average, at best."

"Aug 25, 2012",positive,Lamest villain among all superhero films... least mindful among all superhero films..  Yet among the most fun of all superhero films...
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"First of all, and obviously it is a greatly talented cast that perform awesomely! It's comedic/drama/action ratio is very tolerable and applause worthy. Very nicely scripted, meaning the way all of the character's story lines crossed over was pretty magnificent, except for some loosen edges, but still pretty entertaining. Expectations bar are officially raised for the Amazing Spiderman-including sequel."
"Aug 25, 2012",positive,"wanted to put this one up ages ago but didnt have the time :S ......... anyways ....... this movie was entirely mehhhh for me ............ didnt have a great plot, which to some extent is forgivable (cause its a suphero/superheros movie afterall, no noe expects dark knight quality here)..... but its just not as great as ppl make it out to seem...... dont get me wrong , i like explosions and good cgi effects as any other guy, but its just over used  till it gets to the point of tedium ....... props to samuel.l.jackson for doing some good work as nick fury, his character was badly written but he played it well ......... the reason why this movie was fun other than the action was because its not too serious and the jokes work very well to make the movie fun instead of another mindless cgi fest( read any transformers movie ) ........ in the end ......3.5 ......... good work by robert downey jr but a stand out performance by mark ruffalo and his character the hulk."

"Aug 24, 2012",positive,I almost pre-ordered this movie! But then I decided that going to a midnight release would be more fun. The Avengers franchise is growing more than ever and this movie is just another rung on the ladder of success!
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,"Summer blockbuster bread and butter, looks great, entertains from start to finish."
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,The best thing about The Avengers is that it is fun. It isn't serious or intellectual but it will give you a smile.
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,Stan Lee is Genius. Marvel should have bought Spider-Man on board :(
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,"Fun film. Very much a predictable super-hero flick, but manages to entertain with good acting and exciting action. I will say I couldn't care less about the archer, Hawkeye. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job reprising his role as Tony Stark (Iron Man), but for the third time in recent cinema they desperately attempt to find an actor for Bruce Banner (Hulk). It doesn't work, as this new guy is completely charisma free. Otherwise, this was an enjoyable summer action film."
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,Words...cannot...suffice!
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,"I like this flick, it has some great actors and actresses, it has some great scenery, it has great CGI and effects. It is a very BIG movie, big in budget, big in roles, big in effects and big in every way actually.
Super heroes are great and super villains to, in almost every form they come and appear, not all Avengers are represented evenly, but they all have they special part and role in this film and it will be wrong to under estimate the entertainment value of Ironman blowing things up or the Hulk smashing stuff.

It is a good story, there are lot of great effects and the action is what it is all about and that is all great, but putting so many heroes in one flick can seem a bit to much and eventhough the film last 2 hours and 22 minutes it seems like there isn't enough time to feature them all and keeping the steam up."
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,5/5. Fantastic superhero film.
"Aug 24, 2012",positive,"Loved It, I felt the first 30 minutes could have been better. Iron man stole the show......"
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"Absolutely loved it. Action flicks don't get much better than this. ""Hulk, Smash!!"""
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,loved it slow at first but good
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"Great action, lots of fun!"
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"family friendly action with fleeting moments of humour, but with only one major villain.. a tad one sided."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS PERFECT! BY FAR MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE YEAR
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"One of the best movie experiences ever and after generations and generations, this will be THE indiana jones, star wars, or back to the future movie classic. This movie is action packed and never boring. It's just one of those movies where you can watch all over again and all over again and you'll never get bored. Action is terrific, script is witty and surprisingly really funny. Check it out! It's my favorite movie of the year so far and in my opinon, it tops The Dark Knight Rises."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,This movie is so frkn good I LOVE IT! :) <3
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"Top notch bit of action, some wild sfx!"
"Aug 23, 2012",negative,Very boring and dragging. One of the worse super hero films. It tries to be funny to make you laugh at times but I just can't!
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,The best comic book movie of all time.   This like the John Lennon of comic book movies.  Legendary!
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"All action, no story"
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"La película cumple con lo que se espera de ella, pero es muy pero muy palomera. He visto mejores."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic-to-movie movies I've seen. It hits all the right beats of a comic book, has good characterization, and surprisingly good acting in it.

The plot is a little weak and a bit simplistic. Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo needed much more time on screen, as they both do a superb job. I would actually have preferred a lot less RDJ. I would have preferred that the plot not use the ""kill the puppeteer and the puppets all stop working"" plot device, and spent more time on the heroes actually saving people and cleaning up afterward.

The other thing that would be nice would to have a stronger female presence, especially as one of the heroes. Hawkeye was fine, but you already had Black Widow, so adding a Ms. Marvel, Wasp, Firestar or even a Tigra would have balanced out the testosterone nicely (my vote would have been for Wasp).

If you like action movies, comic book movies, or sci-fi movies, you'll probably like this one. Enough time is spent allowing each character to shine that you're bound to find a character you like to follow through the movie.

(T)"
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,It's actually pretty good...there's a good balance of action and talking...the humour is good. The music is disappointing however and just follows a lot of other scores that to be honest have also been disappointing.
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,Almost busted a gut at the Hulk scene (you know which one)! Friggin' awesome!
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"If you didn't like this movie then there is something definitely wrong with you!!!
It's all the blockbuster movies wrapped up into one dream team!!"
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"I honestly thought it might be just too much material for a single movie, but somehow it works! Great VFX, acting and it also has a soul."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,my life we complete when i saw this movie!!!!!
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"I'd grown tired of all the build up to this film as it just made all the individual films feel insiginificant to what would come here.  I'm pleased to say I was surprised at how entertaining it was.  The trick is in the fact that the stronger actors, Downey Jnr, Ruffalo, Johansson & Jackson could really paper over the cracks left by the weaker, step forward Hemsworth, Evans & to some degree Renner.  You could say it was playing safe to do this as the pros would always outweigh its cons.
It's a simple enough story hugely similar to Dark of The Moon in both action sequence & plot.  Save Earth from the imminent attack of alien beings led by Loki(Hiddlestone).  It's really that simple.  At first a reluctant team soon become one after some in-house bickering and who's the best competition become the planet's last line of defence.  They do this well.  Sure it's cheesy, but reasonable cheese.
Effectswise it's way above the average even the Hulk seems more convincing & wryly humorous especially one little scene with Thor.
Bright, breezy and it will, of course, go on."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"perfect story, well chosen cast!!
one word to say.""sexy"""
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,Epic! Can't wait for part two.
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,"I'm not one to wax intellectual on comic books, seeing how the only comic books I have ever really read were Archie Comics, and that's only because my Dad would get us Burger King when we were younger, and we'd sit in the parking lot. The only thing we had to do was read Archie. Where's my Archie movie? I bet that would break records!

It's safe to say I enjoyed this movie, it had a solid cast, and hell they did a great job of tying in all the little nuances from each individual movie. It's a hard concept to actually visualize. And it would be very easy to muck up, but in my opinion they did a pretty good job. It didn't seemed too forced, there were some cheesy parts. ""Hulk... smash"" that line made me cringe a little, it just seemed forced... but hey, it's a block buster comic book movie, there has to be some cheese strewn about here and there. It's pretty much inevitable I would say. I usually am a fan of Robert Downey Jr. but for some odd reason he made me dislike him in this movie. And I don't really get why, because in Iron Man I loved his performance. That being said, I think Mark Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was superb. He seemed to portray the man at odds with the beast inside him very well. Overall this movie was great, and it was a perfect blowout of my summer. 

P.S: Scarlett Johanson was extremely sexy in this movie, I was enamored by her suit."
"Aug 23, 2012",positive,Surely the best superhero movie I've ever seen!
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,Brilliantly directed by Joss Whedon.
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,All superheroes in one movie? And the humor... makes me laugh out loud...
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,I want to c that one to
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Average super hero flick with a lot of super hype. Great cast, boring plot, cool visuals. Wonder what could have been if they hadn't relied on the quantity of stars and brought in a quality script...See the Dark Knight Trilogy."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Its good, but too overrated"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie to date. Amazing stuff.
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"all-stars movies usually work, this one makes no exception."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,Style over Substance movie but still it was a good entertainer .
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Loved this one. Hulk was bad ass. ""Puny Gods!"""
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Three stars might seem low, but you might notice, it is an above average score. It's over 2.5. It's a fine movie. The individual Captain America, Iron Man 1, and Thor movies were better, but this was still an alright movie, really."
"Aug 22, 2012",negative,"wayyy wayyy wayyy overrated. Everything is just so unrealistic and overplayed. Unenjoyable movie if  you are over 16, or you are just pure fiction geek"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"And there came a day unlike any other. When Earth's Mightiest Heroes found themselves united against a common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born...on the silver screen.  For 4 years, we have been treated to the works of Marvel Studios. We have seen the likes of the Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor and Captain America all come to the big screen and make names for themselves. Though each film has been able to stand alone, there has always been one thing circling each film: the inevitable team up. Now with director Joss Whedon at the helm, the wait is finally over. With so much riding on this film, did the superhero team up live up to the hype? Wait no longer as it is time to assemble the review of ""Marvel's The Avengers"".

The story of ""The Avengers"" deals with what else: the formation of the Avengers. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk team up to take on Loki who means to bring war to the earth in the hopes to rule over the human race as their king. The film's major theme is of course bringing these heroes together, and it does terrific job at making the idea a reality. The script of the Avengers creates enough depth and conflict in the plot to keep you interested from the beginning to the end.  There is no denying that the movie is action oriented, but thankfully, the writier never forgets the relevance of storytelling.

The Avengers features a grand cast full of reprisals and newcomers. The likes of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson, among others, return to their roles continuing and continue to develop. Then there are newcomers such as Mark Rufallo as Bruce Banner and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. These two prove that they belong in this cast as they play both parts respectively.   This cast is an ensemble personified. Each character gets enough screen time and development in the film giving everyone a purpose for being in this movie. The different combinations of performances made this cast stronger and really made for one the best ensemble I have seen for quite some time. 

The movie is an action oriented film, and trust me, you will receive your money worth in that regard. There is enough action in this film for everyone as it the movie does a terrific job giving a variety of action as well putting detail into sequences. There are also several funny moments in the movie, but they are all in context and blends well with some of the film's more tensed scenes. Yet among everything that makes this movie great, one of the more impressive feats is being able to mix the individual films' traits and combining them to create a united atmosphere. 

""The Avengers"" was four years in the making, and it exceeded expectations. Yes the film has a ton of action, but the movie never forgets the relevance of storytelling and characters.  It mixes everything that each film accomplished and manages to make it work in one feature presentation. This film is for both comic book fans and movie goers alike and it is everything a comic book film should be. It rivals the like of ""The Dark Knight"" as ""The Avengers"" is in fact the perfect comic book film."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Ble først veldig forvirret av alle heltene samlet på en gang, og følte de stod bedre alene. Ble for mye rot. Men siste del av filmen så slo de til med godt samarbeid så da vokste filmen litt også. Heseblesende avsluttning. Og så ble det shawarma på de he he"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Excellent, awesome, impressive, a good example of how to put different superheroes into one movie without being another cliche!!!!!"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Noticeable bloopers, Still a movie I'll enjoy for years to come! Thanks Stan Lee for sharing your world with us!"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Pure undiluted entertainment...Fun to watch...Full action, drama, comedy ,SFX...
Pure MASALA"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"The Avengers presents one of the most ambitious concepts of our time by combining all of Marvel's best comic book superheroes into one huge blockbuster film. While at times the script seems excessively slow compared to Marvel's previous superhero productions and leaves you wondering whether the film will overcome the characters problems with themselves, the last half, much like Christopher Nolan's final Batman installment, doesn't disappoint. Impressive special effects and large scale battle sequences deliver a satisfying result. 
Great acting and well done action makes this Marvel's best superhero production yet. But, in all honesty, Marvel still can't compar to the brilliance of Nolan's Batman trilogy."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"It's the usual super hero movie, well whitout anything really good. The story is flat, but it's the action it's good for a sunday afternoon."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"This is an epic superhero film. Better then I expected. It is over two hours long, but it is so engrossing that it feels shorter. The special effects were top notch as well as the directing. This movie set the bar for furture superhero movies. 5 Stars."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Very funny, but imho the weakest of the franchise."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"All I saw was buildings crushing, car destroying and people screaming! totally overrated movie"
"Aug 22, 2012",neutral,Avengers: Tranformers 3 initiative.
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,It was a good movie. No need for 3d
"Aug 22, 2012",negative,"???????????, ???? ??? 15??????!"
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,Great film from start to finish
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Stocked to the brim with action and a great cast. But the story line was dull and unoriginal, Aliens invade Manhattan, super heroes save the day? Crazy."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Very good. Did't like Scarlett, though.."
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,Possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
"Aug 22, 2012",positive,"Robert Downey as Ironman is as funny and quick thinker as he was in Ironman & Ironman 2 movie. One of the surprising package is Mark ruffalo, his 1st movie as Hulk. Hulk nt only destroys every alien spacecraft into half bt also adds humour to his actions.. Especially when he manhandled LOki. Captain America( chris Evans) does full justice to his character & his acrobatics are just awesome & no nonsense. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is another superhero to watch. Thor is as unpredictable as Hulk bt a demo god fighting for earth is just mindblowing.. It is the biggest blockbuster of summer & I think it will end as the biggest blockbuster of 2012. Waiting for Avengers 2 to hit the theatres.."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Breathtaking ... The best Marvel movie ever
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"Action packed. The execution was a little dry. Some charm from the characters, but not enough. Hawkeye is a waste of screentime. Loki didn't quite measure up for a bad guy."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"It's awesome, but the story is so-so."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"Up there with the best comic book films of all time!!

After all the narrative build-up from previous Marvel flicks, many of the comic book company's greatest superheroes finally meet to defend the earth from Loki (Tom Hiddleston). It's an appropriate climax to an exciting (if minor), long-running, multi-film story arc. Thankfully, what could have been a silly, bloated, overly-contrived mess, is handled quite competently by ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer's"" Joss Whedon. Action, drama, and humor are all balanced wonderfully here, and each character (except perhaps Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner) is given appropriate character development and screen-time. Each action set-piece is fun; and even the talkie, exposition scenes are enjoyable--with witty dialogue and clever winks to the fans. 

There's not much that I can offer as far as negative criticism is concerned. I would, however, admit that the film doesn't quite reach the epic heights that it could have. Despite the shots of city-wide destruction, much of the action feels too contained--too confined to very specific locations. In my opinion, there's rarely a sense that the world as we know it is really in danger. Not even the panicing masses (as few of them as we see) engender any kind of sympathy over their apparent peril. They're just out of sight, collateral damage caught in a war among gods. Our heroes might as well be fighting in an abandoned city like they do in the ""Transformers"" movies.

The alien creatures making up Loki's army aren't very well rendered either. I never feel like these are living, breathing beings actually interacting with our world. It's very poor cgi--especially when compared to what they did with the Hulk.

There's some very cheesy dialogue in ""The Avengers"" as well. One particular example comes from Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as he gives a groan-inducing speech to Loki about how the Avengers are destined to take down the evil god one way or another. ""We have a Hulk."" I'm sure lots of fanboys dig it, but it makes me want to puke. It's unfortunate given other examples of Whedon's signature wit in the film's script, that the writer/director feels the need to stoop to such pandering.

Overall, it's a great comic book film that is quite groundbreaking in its ability to juggle so many moving parts (incorporating plots from other films, melding different, established styles, the merging of such varied characters from their own specific worlds, etc.) into a cohesive film with its own specific style. Here's hoping for many more of these!"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Its just so AWESOME!!!!
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"the movie is excellent and the last scene after the credits was very funny made me laugh,  altogether a really great fun movie lots of action worth seeing"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Loved this movie so much
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,A fascinating film of epic proportions!
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Heureusement qu'Iron Man est lÃ  pour nous faire marrer un peu. La sauce en effets spÃ (C)ciaux
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"Best film all summer, probably all year. Love the director"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"An outstanding film and probably one of my favourite super hero movies of all time to date. Amazing special effects and acting, and yes it may be slow to get going but you know they have to build a story right? It can't just be all out action from minute one. I loved the characters, the interactions between all the characters and I loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing. There were not many of them, this is an action movie after all, but when they did happen it made it all the more hilarious. Joss Whedon completely hit this one out of the park. Entertainment at its best!"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Average at best and far overrated.
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"They went to Stuttgart, Germany... But I didn't see any familiar buildings/streets from it... ð???"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"By far the best action movie ever, I would give it 3 thumbs up if i could :)"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"A little all over the place, saved by the charm of Robert Downey... Other than that, confusing, and messy."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"A spectacular superhero film that takes itself seriously but not to seriously which is exactly what they were going for. Marvel's The Avengers is even more than you expected with it's brilliant plot,touching subplots,great acting,and amazing direction The Avengers is no doubt one of the best if not the best superhero movie ever made."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"I'm not a comic book reader, but I have enjoyed the films based on comic books. For example, i really enjoyed the Christopher Reeves' Superman films, a few of the Batmans, Spider-Man's, and I loved Iron Man. I liked the new Thor and Captain America films. I'm not a big fan of Fantastic Four or Wolverine. With all that said, I have to  rank this film just below the original Superman, the Batman with Jack as the Joker and Batman Begins. This is an excellent, very well done film, not just a comic film, but film. The special fx were awesome as was the plot. Robert Downey Jr is great as Ironman. I love his role. Anyway, I recommend this film as it is fun, smart, and has Scarlett Johansen in a tight leather jumpsuit!"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,Top-notch action. Exceptional!!
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"It's not like The Avengers break whole new ground (or any new ground), but Oh boy, don't the single superhero films look boring now."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"All through the film, the person I sympathized was loki..........hahaha.........
Gr8 movie which shares screen spaces for all the Super Heroes and their characterisation.  Five out of Five"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"seen very hi fighting,small plot. wait till credits finish a little teaser after"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"This is it! I just wanted to see a superhero movie. You know, that is HEROIC. I laughed, I got angry, I enjoyed the actions, love the Hulk and his humanity...Way to go, Marvel. :)"
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,"It is such a treat for a comic book fan to see the characters that they grew up with, successfully make the transition to movies.  All I can hope for now is that they buy away the rights of the Silver Surfer from that pos fantastic 4 franchise.  The actor who played the Hulk did an excellent job of capturing the mannerisms of a scientist.  He reminded me of all of my biology and chemistry teachers from college.  Him and Loki were better in this film than in their previous reincarnations."
"Aug 21, 2012",positive,This was the best of the superhero / comic book hero movies yet.
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Fantastic movie, but now that I've seen The Dark Knight Rises I kinda feel like a lil more depth to this movie would have been nice! Still however, good movie for entertainment value!"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Was great in 3D!!!!!!
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,It's no Dark knight but it is the best marvel film to date.
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Comical. Action packed. Terrific screenplay. The combination of three seperate movies over a few years is simply amazing. This awe struck film is a masterpiece that will not be surpassed by superhero movies in years. Bravo!
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"yup! it lives up to the expectations. and Hulk, you're awesome! :)"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"My, my Mr Whedon.
So we meet again."
"Aug 20, 2012",negative,"Absolute waste of time,"
"Aug 20, 2012",negative,Not as good as everyone says it is but entertaining.
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"""Avengers Assemble"" oh and assemble they did, in this smash hit blockbuster of the century, or perhaps ever that has been in the works since 2008! Our heroes all bask in the glory of their first outing in style, as they each progress and accept that they are a team. What was really impressive was the screenwrite, written with such finece and so well done showing the progression of them all coming to accept they are a team and learning to act as one. The cinematography was incredible, just as everything about this movie but the cinematography really stood out for me, introducing each character so effectively and never, even throughout the entire 2 1/2 hours of footage allowing one or the other to hog the spotlight. The characters were so fleshed out and well portrayed by such an incredible cast. What i really loved was that each character was developed so effectively, not just in this film but all the films in the past 5 years that led up to this, each preparing the characters mentally for this moment. This film draws so well on each characters personalities and their traits from previous films and as each personality clashes while they are becoming a team they all learn to put aside their differences to unite against a greater problem. The transition from bickering heroes to a team was so well done, while each hero would usually anchor all the films direction and hold the story up single handedly no single one had to carry to much weight and each successfully held up the film together, as a team. Full of incredible imagery, cinematography, and direction it makes you believe in them and want to root for them not just because their the good guys but while this is mostly consisted of action the film is so wonderfully peppered with those little emotional ties that attach us to each character and make us want them to succeed. This film packs such a punch, except this time it ain't Hitler whose taking the blow, it's the other films opening this week who will feel its force because it was just so outstandingly done, packed with action, believable emotion and performances, and comedy. Somehow each joke was incredibly effective, grossing an insane amount of laughs and was never a flop, and no matter how dire the situation their never afraid to crack a joke. But it was not just jokes that were drawn from the huge crowds but applause, not just at the end but throughout the whole film, such a great time at the movies, with so many fanboy nods this film is perfect for all out MARVEL fans and non fans alike making it easy for us all to put aside our differences and assemble against a common goal.... the no. 1 spot in the box office! Overall the best experience you could ever possibly have at a theater, for now because this was only the beginning, as we all anxiously await the next few years with MARVEL's schedule consisting of Iron Man 3, Capt. America 2, and Thor 2, which will all hopefully lead up to the Avengers 2, just as the others led up to This film, and we can't ever forget the final shot of the film before the credits, the most memorable and meaningful shot in film history, containing the most memorable letter in film history, as Tony and Pepper are remodeling Stark tower with the broken sign, zooming out to show us just one letter, a letter that withstands the entire force of an alien army, ""A""."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Much better than expected.
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"The best movie that Marvel has ever made. I loved the way each character was completely relevant to the story. You got the Captain giving them all orders which is what his character is made to do because he's a soldier. Thor is using that Hammer to no end, Iron Man is flying around blasting aliens. Even the Hulk was relevant. I was afraid that because the Hulk film franchise hasn't done as well, that they wouldn't use him very much but he is freakin' awesome in this movie. Scarlett is there to look at, which is always her only purpose and she does it well. Hawkeye is like if Legolas and Katniss Everdeen had a baby that combines both of their awesomeness. Joss Whedon is my hero and this movie is definitely the start of something even greater. Grade: A+"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"""A spectacle in the grandest sense of the word ..."" Hulk rulez!"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Absolutely spectacular
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved this film! Marvel has proven you can bring super heroes together successfully into a movie and make it work for everyone! Now let's make a DragonBall series!
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"I know that people may look at me strangely for saying this, but I wasn't a big fan of this. The movies long and the first half isn't all interesting. I HATE the fact that they chose Loki as the bad guy in this film I mean come on there are so many better Marvel vilans out there in the comic book world. And sitting in a theatre listing to Chris Hemsworth's voice for 2 hours just makes this movie less and less interesting. The action is great but the first half was just a big chunk of my time wasted."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,Very well done and delivers on almost all fronts. One of the better superhero movies in the last few years and the cast are very good.
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Marvel Studios pulled this off really well. Great combination of action, laughs, and story. The best Marvel movie by far."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,So good you wanna watch it twice!!
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"The avengers is a perfect superhero movie of the year. Putting heroes altogether. And this film.had great acting scenes, funny scenes that would make you laugh, and the avemgers have a lot of that put into this film. It was 2hrs 15min estimate, but this film was good, if you haven't seen it. I recommend its a must see movie"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Absolutely amazing film, and exciting to watch. Very huge fan of Tom Hiddleston and Robert Downey Jr.."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"It was okay, not as spectacular as what people said. The action was great, the storyline was meh, the characters are.. well, if you've seen Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, you'd know how the actors would act. I gotta say I only enjoyed watching the last 20 minutes of the movie."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Great movie had everything in it, beat mty expectaions by a long run."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Finally saw this much hyped Marvel installment, and I have to say, I was not disappointed.  It's probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen.  Great pace, tight, witty dialogue, incredible special effects and a very satisfying ending.  It was only hours later, as I thought about the film, that I realized how simplistic the storyline was, which I suppose the mark of a well thought out superhero film.  The only thing ""The Avengers"" was missing for me was a tight throat, emotive moment.  Hence the 4 1/2 star rating.  I actually can't wait to see it again, in Blu-ray on a proper, big screen TV."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is everything you would hope it to be. Fun, exciting, epic, and often times hilarious. Not only that, but it's most impressively extremely well balanced. With about 6 major characters, they all are equally involved in the film. It's smart and absolutely thrilling and It's the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"This movie was excellent! It had everything you want from a superhero movie. The action scenes are not old, over-used, but rather interesting and refreshing and powerful. Must-watch!"
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"What a fantastic movie, all me favourite Marvel characters in one movie, brill movie"
"Aug 20, 2012",neutral,"This flick is pure and harmless fun , and of course , the action scenes were great . Nevertheless ""The Avengers"" gives us nothing new about the characters , has a very predictable story and tries to show us a lot more than it could handle."
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,I loved the build up in all the characters movies to get to this one! It rolls in together so well!! :)
"Aug 20, 2012",positive,"Joss is a great, presenting all the characters' part in this movie, nonetheless, he also present a few funny fight scenes between the characters."
"Aug 20, 2012",neutral,"Expected so much more from this average blockbuster. I am just gonna totally bitch about this film cuz I did not like it and didn't understand why people are so hyped about this film. Good stuff: Costumes were excellent, true to the comics and Tom Hiddleston saved the whole show from crumbling. I am not sure if the film was aiming for a set design that pays homage to the 50s or just plain awful. Storyline was basically non-existent or simply too weak to have any significance, acting from everyone else was pretty melodramatic, no character development, but bickering and loads of lame jokes. Camera work was quite crappy in the beginning, but slowly got better with the one continuous shot of everyone fighting then gone back to standard transformer type of work. Iron man close ups killed me deeply, they were awful. and Paltrow the horrible actress killed him completely with her bad acting and dialogue. Joss Whedon should be ashamed for his script, it was so ridiculous and not funny at all. Plot holes were everywhere, a few examples are: Captain America and Human Torch are the same people, X-men were the first super heroes not Hulk, mortals can't fight with Gods, family cliche drama and crappy unemotional lines. More action and less cheese would allow me to give the film a higher rating."
"Aug 19, 2012",negative,I fell asleep the first half of the movie. The action came near the end and the end was not a big thing. A long film that show us the expected.
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"fantastic!!! awesome having everyone together and that makes fights more epic. seems like some characters are stronger (hulk seems way overpowered and hawkeye seems useless). thought the council was kind of cheesy... felt their response was so canned (happened in resident evil 2, alien vs predator: requiem)- let's just nuke everything if we can't win. stupid."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,fun movie with some clever scenes.
"Aug 19, 2012",negative,"Super power party, hehe, is not my thing. One star to the alien dragons."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,one of the best movies ever
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"This was another movie that I could not wait for it to come out in theaters, and was hoping and praying it would be as awesome as it could be.  I was not disappointed in the least.  ""The Avengers"" was amazing and totally entertaining!

As expected, Robert Downey, Jr. was a riot as Tony Stark, and to my great pleasure, the Hulk was hilarious as well.  My only very slight complaint was that the Edward Norton didn't come back as Bruce Banner, because I hate when movies change up actors for the same role (unless it's a reboot, of course).  However, I must say that Mark Ruffalo was a better fit as Banner compared to Norton, and I was pleased with his performance.

This was the probably the best movie I've seen since ""The Dark Knight"", and I absolutely cannot wait for Avengers 2!"
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,SURPRISINGLY FUNNY! I really enjoyed it.
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"Best movie ever. Seriously, new favorite. Likely to stay that way. Except... Maybe until Avengers 2."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,It's no Dark Knight but still great.
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon + Joss Whedon = Amazing!
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,Great Super-hero movie
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,Daft but good fun. Hulk stole the show.
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,Yo yo sick dope real dope#1. of the summer 2012.....
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"nice movie, i really enjoyed it watching everything come into place."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"If one likes this sort of movie, its every bit as good as you've heard."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is THE summer blockbuster this year. Nothing came close to matching it on script, action, and plot. The characters are perfect, the acting tense and spot on, and the action sets (especially the end) is a thing of masterpiece. All hail Josh Whedon."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"Sure it's entertaining. At times it becomes unintentionally hilarious how the movie tries to justify all the crazy things that the superhero team concept implies if you take it too seriously. But no, this movie does not ultimately take itself too seriously. And the revelation in the end is quite rewarding to any marvel fan."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,man those aliens were weak as hell! standard superhero fare
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"Very good, much better than I thought it would be. Everyone plays their apart and except for the boring Captain America, each is amusing or interesting.  Of course the highlight has to be The Hulk, with one stand-out moment making me roll off the sofa laughing and having to replay the scene 3 times."
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"I would be dumb to give it anything less than 5 stars. So much anticipation and Marvel delivered 100%! And the best part? Its only phase one, baby!"
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,Muita ação e diversão garantida!
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,I can only say one word about it...AMAZING!!!!!!
"Aug 19, 2012",positive,"Zowat de antipode van TDKR, hersenloos en oppervlakkig spektakel met gelukkig genoeg zelfrelativerende humor over het magere plot."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,Loved it.. this is how action movies should be made. Can't wait to pick up the Blu Ray and watch it again.
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,Great writing from Joss Whedon and great acting from all of them.  I just don't get Hawkeye...
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,A comic book brought to life. Joss Whedon has a gift for epic movies and an uncanny ability to bring together characters quickly. So far the best movie of 2012.
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"EH.     Not my kinda movie, but sat through the whole 2 hours and 22 minutes of Superhero action.       Not a genre of movies that I care for, but was just OK in my book.   Nothing spectacular, nothing exciting, but if you are a superheroes, marvel or like this type of movie, that you would probably like it."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"Pretty decent super hero film, but I know nothing about the history of the comic books. I only ever knew Iron Man because he looked cool when I was a kid, and the first Iron Man movie turned out to be good. I assume all the love for it is based on the fact that it stays loyal to its comic book roots, but if you are like me and are not a comic book fan, then what you will see is a slightly above average comic book film, still not on par with any of Nolan's Batman films."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"Honestly, I didn't really enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would do. The first hour and a half was just 'check out my sweet directing chops' show-offerey and the story (or complete lack of) was atrocious. If it wasn't for Downey Jnr.'s Iron Man yet again being amazing and THAT fight in Manhattan I'd only be giving this 1-2 stars. Roll on Iron Man 3 I say. Meh."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,best superhero movie ever
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,Now thats Epic and full of epic
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. Just excellent and fun from start to finish
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"this is truely one of the best films of the year bar none action special effects and the acting was,nt bad either so this true hits the mark .... 10/10 .... but then theres The Expenderbles 2 to come yet"
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,A whole lot of fun!  Loved this one!  This is probably one of the best super hero movies out there!
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"Tout en restant beaucoup plus cretin que les X-Men, The Avengers fait le spectacle, emancipe de la genese balisee de ses heros deja narrees precedemment. Whedon demontre des talents de chef d'orchestre hors norme en dirgeant cette bataille surdimensionnee sans trop s'egarrer dans les rebondissements ni deshumaniser son divertissement sous le deluge de numerique..."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"Powerful and destructive, may be the best marvel movie."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,This was a really good movie.
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,I freaking love the HULK!
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"A little drawn out in places, but overall entertaining."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,I wish I could give it more stars. I didn't want it to end
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon truly outdid himself on this latest endeavor of man, partial-man, ""super man,"" god, and the supernatural.  The set pieces are spectacular however those are easily out-shined by the clever script and the interactions between the hero's themselves.  I am looking forward to the second installment and I have faith that Mr. Whedon can surpass the first."
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,The best marvel movie that I have ever seen
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,A spectacular movie!!!!
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
"Aug 18, 2012",positive,"The new Hulk is awesome. The movie has a lot of good superheroes, but they really did a good job with the new Hulk persona. A lot of fun and great visual. ""Always angry"" was my favorite."
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,storyline is all over the place but damn they look good in tights.
"Aug 17, 2012",neutral,"Good attempt to string together all the Marvel characters, but the plot could have been better."
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,Haven't had this much fun watching a movie ever
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,Blockbuster done right. One of the funniest movies this year. Hulk owns.
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,"Marvel Studios has been gearing up for this film. Everything Marvel had been working towards over the past 5 years has led to this. Perhaps the biggest superhero blockbuster ever made. The Dark Knight showed us that you can bring superheroes to life in a realistic way and a dark tone. Dark isn't always better in my book. The Dark Knight was a monument in cinematic breakthrough in the superhero genre but The Avengers in my opinion is what a superhero film should look like and I find it to be a superior superhero film to The Dark Knight in almost every way.

Marvel did the impossible by bringing together four heroes from their respective films together for one awesome team up. Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic performance as ever as the billionaire playboy Tony Stark and his superhero counterpart Iron Man. And with Joss Whedon's witty script it gives RDJ enough humor to satisfy viewers without him taking the entire show. It was always a controversy when talks came in about switching Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo for The Hulk but boy did he deliver. And the Hulk's CGI motion capture is the best Hulk we've seen. Chris Evans delivers solidly as Captain America and a surprising one when compared to other roles. And Hemsworth muscular as always, made Thor once again a fun and interesting addition to the team. Aside from the main stars, Samuel L. Jackson as always was great as Director Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the most surprising breakouts were Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow which showed us she is more than just a pretty face. The other is Hawkeye by Jeremy Renner who was also fantastic.

The great thing about this movie is that it has something for everyone, the humor is great and used appropriately and doesn't take away from the serious moments. And Whedon also finds perfect balance and manages to unite these characters in a believable and smooth way that really proves to the audience that Earth's Mightiest Heroes are truly a force to be reckoned with. And the end fight scene is fit in an inspiring without turning into a giant Transformer movie. I seriously think that everyone should see this film. It is the culmination of what every superhero film should look like. This film should have you leaving with a big stupid grin on your face that will take hours to get off."
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,Love love love this film
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,"Very entertaining indeed although the plot was very predictable..
My favorite character throughout the story is definitely The Hulk.."
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,Big shots come together ...can't say not worth it
"Aug 17, 2012",positive,The park is where the show beings but not where it culminates in all out grilled cheese parties
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,Every bit of the film's budget can be seen on the on the screen; A big movie.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"Awesome, there are a few minor things. But I can over look them."
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,Awesome! Eould have been even better if Marvel had added SPIDERMAN lol
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,Everything a summer action movie should have! Amazing!
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,Don't know about story. But it was fun to watch.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"This movie ROCKED!!! For me, it was everything a comic book movie should be. Bring on the spinoffs and sequels!!!"
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"I'm sure I'll get dragged through the mud by everyone who says this is the greatest film ever made, but I don't care.  It's pretty good, but hardly memorable.  I admit that the special effects are incredible and groundbreaking, and the story is almost (but not quite) successful in balancing the role of each superhero.  Loki is a pretty lame villain, and it sucks that he has to be the main bad guy.  But his otherworldly forces manage to be pretty fearsome.  I am really upset over the absence of Edward Norton, who I thought brought the most depth and humanity to the Marvel series.  Apart from Downey, Jr. and maybe even Samuel L., the characters are as under-developed as they come.  They might as well have had cardboard cut outs stand in while the actors merely dubbed their lines from a studio.  That's the problem with a film that relies on CGI.  It has the tendency to take even the most talented actors out of their zone.  Now that I've stated my qualms, I will still say this is a good movie and entertaining in that turn off your brain kind of way.  It's on par with what I expected."
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"I've never seen any characters past movies, even so I quite enjoyed and learned a lot about American comic superheroes :)"
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,It's hard not to love this movie. It has 4 of the most well known and loved superheroes plus two others.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"And now - a party

While scientists are trying to decide what to do with Tesseract - energy cube, caught from the ocean during the ""First Avenger"" - somewhere in a parallel universe stepbrother Thor Loki (Hiddleston), who is a little earlier expelled from Asgard receives from the evil new chief order to steal the cube to the Earth came the chaos and destruction. The order is executed, tesseract kidnapped population of the planet facing imminent disaster. Save humanity and restore order may only eyed Nick Fury (Jackson) - The head of a secret organization, ""SHIELD"" willpower gathered superheroes fighting force, consisting of Iron Man (Dauni-ml.), Hulk (Ruffalo), Captain America (Evans) and Black Widow (Johansson). On top of that from somewhere in the sky falls down on the heroes Thor (Hemsworth).

If ten years ago, almost no one outside of the U.S., except for geeks, did not know who the Thor, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America, now answer this question any preschooler: Thor - the guy with the hammer, the Hulk - the big green monster , Captain America - Stars and Stripes guy with a shield, and Iron Man - a guy with a hangover. Marvel studio preparing for the ""Avengers"" four years, consistently introducing new characters and elegantly zarifmovyvaya each story line so that the total collection of all these people in one room was not something wild and irrational. Manage the orchestra called Joss Whedon - Marvel's comic series, ""Mission"" Serenity ""and"" Buffy - The Vampire Slayer. "" And as it turned out, for good reason. For the first time got my hands on two hundred millionth budget, he, contrary to expectations, does not convert to the late George Lucas, and behaves like a schoolboy caught in Disneyland - the dream of a lifetime come true, but life is not changed. ""The Avengers"" - kind of a parade of U.S. military power, in part costume party with nice friends, but so smartly done that if it were possible to speak in terms like ""superfilm,"" ""The Avengers"" would have been just that metaphorical ""superfilmom."" Johansson eloquently says, ""My name is Natasha Romanoff, and I - Russian"" and then falls off the chair. At Downey still best in the world is sitting crumpled on Friday evening jacket. Mark Ruffalo, the film goes with clenched teeth and gently picks in the computer, and then suddenly turns into a green King Kong, ""You asked me why I never get angry? Because I'm angry all the time! ""Hiddleston subtle squints, cardboard characters with impermeable faces - Thor and Captain America - gently pushed into the background and are mostly objects to exercise their wits. Fly iron lizard people torn from heaven fall down Scandinavian epic heroes that smashed the roof monster offer to wear pants, superheroes battle is in the kitchen, on the ruins of the celebration quietly bustling Gwyneth Paltrow. The camera flies around Manhattan as if it was tied to a distraught thunder bird, characters recite texts that do not expect to hear in a movie about a meeting of the gods with armored men in flying saucers - mechanism, launched Weedon, never strays the rhythm. It does not change the context, and plays with it, and, as a professional geek, well-versed in superhero discourse, squeezes the best out of it. Never mind that this is a film in which the long run, nothing happens, it's just different, ""The Avengers"" - a big family, and Weedon it definitely his. After all, what is the success costume party? Smart people dressed like a fool and rejoice."
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,love it cant belive my favorite superheros come together
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,I'm not sure why it took so freakin' long for this to play here but it was definitely worth the wait.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,AAAAAAAFASLDKJGAÑLSKDF CUANDO SALE EL BLURAY!!!!
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,I'm still a bigger fan of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,I'd have to say that this is one of the best films this year.
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"Mention 3, pour la débauche d'effets spéciaux réussis, le plaisir de voir réunis les super-héros (certains agréablement surprenants), l'action permanente et les destructions systématiques, l'auto-dérision jubilatoire (mention ++ à R. Downey Jr.) et la qualité photographique/visuelle, mais pas pour le scénario stéréotypé, les combats trop bien réglés, les pseudo leçons de morale ringarde, certains personnages beaufisés et la propension omnipotente américaine à sauver le monde, donc !"
"Aug 16, 2012",positive,"This movie is the best movie of 2012 the cast was incredible they really Kicked Ass. The special effects were amazing in this film it was a fun movie, and also entertaining."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome, action packed!!!"
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"I'm a sucker for super Hero movies and this one definitely lived up to my expectations. My favorite hero through this movie is Agent Barton and i figured since he wasn't one of the big four hero's he wouldn't get a lot of screen time but he definitely does! Super happy with the even show time of all the hero's! 
This is my favorite movie of the year, and definitely in my top all time! I'll be counting down the days till the next one."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"Fantasy stuff, but amazing overall."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"Very action packed, with plenty of light hearted moments too, but having not seen the other films, there were a few plot details I wasn't sure about."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"A perfect storm! Great actors, storyline, not too heavy, action packed and emotional yet had some light and fun moments that really brought you just enough out of the dark sides of the story. Much better representation of Loki's power than in Thor (kind of failed a bit in that film, even though it was amazing) and was a definite hit in tying the Marvel universe together. Cannot wait for the inevitable sequels."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"This was the best The Avengers movie anyone could've hoped for and I'm giving all the credit to Joss Whedon, (and to Marvel for hiring him).  Usually the screenplays for summer blockbusters are jammed out by committee, with producers and writers (and toy designers) all sitting in a room jamming more and more things into it for their own commercial or personal reasons.  By the time we see a summer movie it's been watered and dumbed down until it's hardly a ""movie"" anymore. Full Review: http://bit.ly/R2b0Jn"
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,11/10 best film in ages
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"If your a fan of any of the avengers (as I love Iron Man and Thor) then you will love this movie, all of your favorite characters in one movie with clashing personalities and action packed fights that literally rip the city apart."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,Best Superhero Squad Ever
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"It was all right, I don't think it was that good at all."
"Aug 15, 2012",positive,"Gotta say... I expected more. The plot was predictable, though I suppose this was more of a team development story to pave the way for the sequels. Also probably didn't help that the old oyaji (geezer) sitting next to me wreaked of stale beer, left midway through the movie, only to come back with a new aroma... Eau de Puke."
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"A long time Marvel reader, collector, and fan, it's hard to make a movie from a bunch of other movies that, sadly, were collectively underwhelming after the original Iron Man and Hulk reboots. The casting change from Ed Norton, as well, purturbed me greatly. Not that the movie was terrible, but Thor is a horrendous rendition (no offense to the actor) and Cap is just boring. Stark delivers typical quips, some good, but none as superb as the original movie (the second should have been 2 movies, and the change in Rhodie's casting was a downgrade in my opinion). That being said, the storyline was based off the Ultimates line, not the traditional Avengers arc, so it's forgivable and fun."
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,The best movie of all time
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"Very enjoyable and fun to watch..money well spent. That said, the end battle was drastically over the top; can't these director's tell a story and have a battle that isn't all CGI look-what-i-can-do crap anymore?"
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"Great movie!  The Hulk steals the show!  The only negative was samuel l jackson.  He just doesnt pull it off, everyone else hit a homerun.  Will see it at least two more times."
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,Aewsome movie! Best superhero flick ever made!!!
"Aug 14, 2012",negative,"wow what a pile of rubbish, no story to speak of and trying to rely on flashy special effects to save it's cringy dialog. I can't see a way to give negative stars"
"Aug 14, 2012",negative,The Avengers relies too heavily on action overkill and forgets to add any amount of heart.
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,Yes. Just.....yes. That is all.
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,Fun summer blockbuster unites six superheroes against an evil god from another dimension (I think) who wants to destroy the earth (I think). Good characters and prefect doses of humor make up for poor special effects and tensionless action sequences that more closely resemble a video game than a film.
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"Great film enjoyed it from start to finish, had everything."
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"SO great! I loved this movie. It was hilarious, suspenseful, and action packed. Everything you could possibly want from a blockbuster. It did lack the emotional depth it would require to be the greatest movie of all time, but the rest of the checklist was present."
"Aug 14, 2012",positive,"Full of Joss Whedon's patented blend of one-liners and blue filters, The Avengers is surprisingly well put together and fun to watch, even if it doesn't carry any emotional weight."
"Aug 13, 2012",neutral,I didn't really get it.. But then they started to fight.. It still was weird...
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,Pure entertainment from start to finish. The very definition of what movies can be. Love how the whole thing came together.
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,One of the best marvel movies ever
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,A bunch of awesome superheroes (including Ironman) in one movie? What's not to like??
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,Best movie of 2012 loved it
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,Best movie I have ever seen
"Aug 13, 2012",negative,"Dans le style on aurait prÃ (C)fÃ (C)rÃ (C) ""Transformers"". C'est dire..."
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,"Such a great movie, keeps you wanting more."
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,Thrill ride.  Absolutely loved it and was glued to my seat for the entire movie.  Worth seeing over and over again.
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,"Exceeded my expectations. This is the best super hero movie ever made, and I doubt it'll be topped. The humor is great, the acting is great, the effects are great. This is a perfect film."
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,As a big marvel fan this film was 100% satisfying.
"Aug 13, 2012",positive,"Fantastic movie will clever laughs and excellent character development into the the total story.  Clever dialouge and fun for all fans of the genre.  Best movie of the summer, bar none."
"Aug 13, 2012",neutral,"Yet another big dumb superhero movie that can't be taken seriously on any level, but is mildly entertaining and funny at times.  Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo carry the film, but what a tremendous waste of acting & directing talent."
"Aug 13, 2012",neutral,"Its no where near a bad movie, but there too many people who think this is a flawless movie."
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,Good action stuff.  Great meshing of all of the various Marvel characters involved in the Avengers.
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"The Avengers had a lot of laughs, and I was pleasantly surprised. The Hulk really stole the show and was funny and over-the-top destructive. The Avengers started the summer movie season off with a BIG bang. It doesn't need to be seen in IMAX, but it will definitely improve your viewing pleasure for some extra $$$."
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!!! Watched it twice
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"Super good, must watch !!!"
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,A great movie.  One of the best movies of the year
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"While not as emotionally moving as other super hero blockbusters like spider-man and batman, The Avengers is a movie for people just looking to have a good time watching a band of super heroes beat up aliens and blow stuff up."
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"Really good movie to anyone, even if not an action or a heroic fanatic. Great visuals, cast, and script!"
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER! The Avengers has nonstop action that will keep your eyes burning because you just can't seem to blink!  It also has nonstop humor that the major and minor characters provide!  This is one of major super-nerd Joss Whedon's best works!
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"I had no expectations of it, even though it did have a lot of hype, there were one or two scenes in it that i felt didn't need to be so long, but a film needs that I think especially when it's a character based movie more than an action film.  Everyone in the cast did awesome and everyone from a behind the scenes creative aspect did their jobs really well.  One of the best movie going experiences I've had in a long while."
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,If u could higher than 5 stars I would! I saw this 3 times jn the theater and when came out on DVD I watched it every day for close to a week and looked forward to watching it each and every time.
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,The Avengers Was So Epicllay Awesome
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,best movie ever made by marvel
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"Avengers es el futuro de las peliculas de comics: Grande, impresionante, atractiva al ojo y fiel a las ideas de los comics. Los actores estan bien adaptados a sus personajes, el casting es muy bueno, en general una muy buena pelicula palomera. 
Las peliculas de comics a futuro seguiran la formula de avengers, y tendran las peliculas de Chris Nolan como la barra a la cual rebasar."
"Aug 12, 2012",positive,"Best superhero movie I seen all year. the action was incredible and the plot was good, plus the acting was unbelievable. I'm getting it on blu-ray when it comes out."
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,I watched it in 3D amazing
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,When I walked out I was thinking let's see DC top this.
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,"Marvels the Avengers is the long awaited film that takes some of Marvel's most famous super heroes and merges them together into what can now be safe to say is one of the greatest action movies of all time. Every character gets plenty of screen time and development, and every actor doesn't disappoint in their roles, especially the surprising Mark Ruffalo as the incredible Hulk. This movie has so many memorable scenes on top of that, that its a film that will keep you engaged to it for the full 2 plus hours. No doubt that this film gives Marvel ultimate supremacy over DC."
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,Feels a bit intellectually empty compared to movies like Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy or even the first Iron man. Still the movie was very satisfying and fun to watch.
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,can't find much fault with a movie that good
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,"One of a kind: never before have individual superheros come together in a movie as a team and this doesn't disappoint.  Tons of adventure, character, humor, and action that will get your adrenaline pumping for a week."
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,Deff one of the best over all movies I've seen in a long time.
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,"The only thing fun about the movie was the action other than that there really wasn't anything that great about the film. A huge amount of Plot holes, cheesy jokes and whole 1 hour of boredom."
"Aug 11, 2012",negative,"I don't understand why this movie is said to be so good. It is so critically acclaimed that maybe it was just too high of expectations. I was under the impression that this would be a fun summer blockbuster to behold but got a confusing, boring, and stupid film. I didn't think the characters meshed well, there were too many of them and their stories didn't really connect. I had only seen two of the movies going into this(Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk(2008)) but I don't think that really matters too much. I didn't find it humorous and I almost fell asleep during this 2 1/2 hour waste of time. I don't understand, the only good thing I can say is it looked great. The visuals were spectacular, the rest...ehh."
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,Not much to say except...AWESOME!

"Aug 11, 2012",positive,"Loved it , bought all the characters together nicely , well written and acted"
"Aug 11, 2012",positive,as a four year hype machine it beat all expectations
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"85% = ***1/2 = ""Amazing"""
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,Wish I could give it more stars!
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"First 10 minutes made me wonder if the movie was worth the hype.   After that, all doubts were put away.  Was able to get over the change in actors for Bruce Banner."
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,The best Marvel movie so far
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,I was determined not to follow the crowd by liking this movie as much as everyone else. I LOVED IT!!!
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Great visual effects,wonderful acting,and a nice screenplay.Fast paced and action packed,Avengers is a fun ride and very entertaining."
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies i've ever seen!
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,This was great. Seeing the heroes go from solo movies to an ensemble was a just awesome.  Total nerdgasm.
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"It's an excellent super heroes movie.. Very cool effects and superbly nit together especially waning the characters...it's an action fun movie with no signs of being anything else but a Comic Heroes adaptation..

It is a lot of fun and very entertaining..

Thumbs up"
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a genius.
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Each actor chews up the scenery and blows you away, all the way down to Agent Coulson. Not a single turn is wasted, nor stone left unturned for pure entertainment. Tom Hiddleston steals more scenes as Loki, but in the end, Hulk Smash beats rock, paper, and scissors. Worth seeing twice!"
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Great movie, very exciting, although not alot of dialogue. I feel Marvel did a great job in the idea of making all the super heros individual movies first, then making the final Avengers movie even more exciting. Because you figure anybody who even saw just one of the super heros individual movies would probably want to go see Avengers."
"Aug 10, 2012",neutral,"Wildly overrated uneven mess. The final action set piece stands out, as does Robert Downey Jr."
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.
:D"
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon has created a memorable film which will forever be implanted in the brains of nerds( like me ). The plot was executed perfectly with not one of the many protagonists stealing the glory. The stories from the five previous films are twisted to one. The acting was a little strained for some characters and the antagonist did not strike me as that ""evil"". I rate this film a solid 4 of 5."
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!!! Well, the trailer is. I still haven't seen it though. This movie sounds like an incredible movie. :)"
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,A superhero master class which gives every character enough screen time. But overrated?
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,and I jizzed in my pants O_o
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,Best film of the year so far
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,A fun and shallow superhero movie. I liked this movie but kind of embarrassing for the few critics who rate this higher than The Dark Knight Rises. I think any critic who did loses all credibility.
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,"Excellent!!! I love how during the hero's fight with each other, they KICKED each others butts, yet none of them appeared weak. Well done!!!"
"Aug 10, 2012",positive,I liked the action sequences and the fight scenes but the way the characters acted was kind of childish.
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,A box office miracle. I'm not saying the movie wasn't  fantastic but it earned way more props than what it deserved and the only reason it grossed that much was because it was kid friendly and the had the overpriced thing we call 3D
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,"Noticeable bloopers, Still a movie I'll enjoy for years to come! Thanks Stan Lee for sharing your world with us!"
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Great but the dark knight rises was way better
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,"I love Joss Whedon, but I couldn't bring myself to love this film."
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,"As I settled in for Marvel's The Avengers (to cite its full title) my mind began to drift back a few years, all the way back to another Marvel action team, The X-Men.  I complained then that the problem of having multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control.  How do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers?  The X-Men series never straightened out this problem, but I am happy to report that with Marvel's The Avengers, this is not an issue.

It was a smart plan for Marvel Studios to build the characters one at a time, giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here.  As a lead-in we got Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), and last summer's Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger - next up is Nick Fury.  With that, by the time we get to Marvel's The Avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us.  That frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action, although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one.

The Avengers are more interesting to me than The X-Men because they come from different places.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is Norse God from another galaxy; Captain America (Chris Evans) is a genetically-altered Army strongman from the 1940's; Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is a green muscle mass hiding out in India under the passive alter ego of Bruce Banner; and Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the Chrysler Building in New York.  Plus there's an archer called Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and a token female, Russian-born woman named Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who, I think, is good with martial arts. For whatever reason, these last two didn't get a movie of their own, but stay tuned.

The Avengers, like The X-Men, are also led by a secretive bald-headed authority figure with a handicap.  He is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who runs a shadow organization called S.H.I.E.L.D., whose function is to stop super villains from  . . . well, doing super-villainy I suppose.  The task here is to get back an object called the Tesseract, an object that - if I understood it correctly - acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy.  That's bad news for our planet because it means that the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adopted half-brother, can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful super-army.  It also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain S.H.I.E.L.D personnel.  Loki's first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world: Germany.  Maybe he hasn't heard, but that's probably not a wise place to start.

The Avenger's personalities are known to us, but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another.  In this movie, many are meeting each other for the first time and, for a long time, no one knows who can be trusted.  That's especially true with a tense relationship between Iron Man and Thor.  Since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil Loki, can he be trusted?  Another issue of tension comes with the addition of Bruce Banner.  Everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyone's apprehension that Hulk's destructive nature could be a potential problem.

The most engaging character in the film, for me, is Bruce Banner, played this time by Mark Ruffalo, who manages to pull off - with all due respect to Eric Bana and Edward Norton - the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role.  Ruffalo plays Banner as a mild-mannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check.  He does something interesting; he quiets his voice to a calm, mellow, deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls ""The Other Guy.""  I liked his rendition of Bruce Banner although I think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show Bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check (maybe with the mantra ""Keep calm and carry on."").  That might have been perfect.

I liked the character touches in Marvel's The Avengers.  I liked the dialogue, which is written at a smart, snappy level by writer-director Joss Whedon.  He has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive.  He is the man behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", Toy Story and a brilliant horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods, still in theaters.

I just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act.  He's a smart writer but he allows the movie to go into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that we've seen a million times.  It would have been nice if he could have taken the same inventive brilliance as the last act of The Cabin in the Woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special.  His Avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue.  When you stand back and look at the plot as a whole, you see that it really doesn't add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world.  His movie, as it stands, exists somewhere between the ho-hum of The X-Men and the brilliant extravaganza of The Dark Knight.  It isn't a perfect film, but I enjoyed it probably more than I expected."
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,I loved it need more
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Loved every minute of it!
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,The whole time I was waiting for Samuel L. Jackson to pull out a purple light saber.  So disappointed.
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Possibly one of the best movies of all time. If you are a marvel fan then is the best movie of all time
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Saw it last night it was awesome
"Aug 9, 2012",negative,This movie is not good as what i expected. Some parts look like Power Rangers episode. But it's cool to see those heroes united in one movie.
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,The best Marvel movie from my opinion besides the first Iron Man
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,"At first I was skeptical, I decided last second to see this movie. I ended up seeing it four times. This is without a doubt the greatest superhero film I have ever seen. Major kudos to the team who created this. Everything from action, acting, plot, and soundtrack are amazing. Can't wait to see what Thanos does!"
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen to date! Marvel's The Avengers will keep you at the edge of your seat with it's action packed plot. Joss Whedon's direction of the film made me fall in love with my favorite superheroes all over again. I wish there were more stars to give this movie!
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Loved it! Awesome movie!
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 summer, and rightly so.  All the prior films that spill into The Avengers had solid superhero coming of age stories, but this film does a great job of building the coming of age story of the Avengers finding its identity and purpose.  I particularly liked how the Hulk/Bruce Banner and Hawkeye/Clint Barton had a little more attention in their development considering they didn't have a direct prequel movie.  The pace of the movie is not overwhelming considering there could have been but didn't have a lot of back-story that needed to be introduced for the characters while at the same time successfully keeps movie-goers well entertained throughout the film.  The plot was complex enough to keep viewers entertained and the screenplay is witty and reasonably true to the characters of the Avengers.  There aren't a lot of flaws to the film unless you're not a fan of comic book to film movies and overall, it's a must see for Marvel comic fans or anyone who is looking for a fast, fun and entertaining film."
"Aug 9, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,"Excellent movie, tons of action with a solid story!"
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,One of the best Superhero movies out of all the Marvel Movies but I still prefer The Dark Knight Rises
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,"Absolutely Fantastic... Love it Best Comic Book Movie ever made at least until 
Avengers 2 & BVS"
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,"For about 4 years of preparing since iron man. It didn't please my expectations. The action was great, it was just the story that sucked and the fact that it reminded me of transformers 3."
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,Incredibly fun movie. Definitely recommend it since it's up there with some of the best superhero films.
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,Colossal instantly forgettable fun.
"Aug 8, 2012",positive,"In one word - epic. Humour, huge action set pieces, some of the greatest heroes in the world and did I mention the heartfelt moments? This is the bar against which all superhero films will be measured"
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"Forget any other superhero movie you have ever seen. This one takes the cake, and, after its over, the recipe will get lost, because its rare a film such as this actually lives up to its expectations. Even though there were five solo Avenger films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America, in that order) you don't have to see any of them to understand the plot of this film, although, story wise, it may be a good idea to check out ""Thor"" to learn more about Loki, the main villain of both this and that film. The cast is phenomenal, hands down. If you love superheroes, there are some scenes in this film that will blow you away! Truthfully, I haven't seen a ""sequel"" (if thats what you can call it) that has lived up to its hype since ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" This film does not disappoint, in any way, unless you really are that much of a perfectionist."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,Loved this effing movie!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"Whedon did it! Despite his strong track record I was still nervous that pulling all these big names together could never work but somehow it turned out to be one of the casts best films (possibly Ironman aside). Each character fits together extremely well while all get pretty fleshed out, even the unknowns Hawkeye and Black Widow. What a heart pumping ride. The 3D was quite well done to boot."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"An epic blockbuster action movie that has flaws, but still manages to be big, bold, and something to behold. Pulling off a movie with all of the characters here is an accomplishment in itself."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"A modern day Robin Hood, Hawkeye is also there."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,love it it was  great
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"Honestly one of the best (if not the best) movie I have ever seen.
It was exciting, action packed, nerve racking, emotionally stimulating and funny! 
It was just a huge bonus that most of the lead characters were fantastic actors as well as easy on the eyes!"
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,Disney cashes in on some of Marvel's biggest hero's. Acting at times from Mark Ruffalo seems forced and not genuine. The casting of Nick Fury's character was not hit on the head. Not too many complaints of this film all in all. A wonderful comic book based film.
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"A rare thing- a modern summer event movie that truly satisfies in character and action. The story is simple, but that's the magic of it. Bringing together four very different characters with tonally different films already released with varying degrees of realism and success is a massive gamble, but the established heroes deliver- and Ruffalo is a revelation as a Banner less at odds with his raging alter ego. Hiddleston owns as a villain who is brutal yet somehow still someone who can evoke support from an audience. Whedon's humour shines but doesn't smother, respectfully dulling his fingerprint and accepting that the sheer branding is enough to get an audience but a respectful reverence to it is flexible. The action scenes are outstanding and it never feels slow or bloated. In an age of explosive summer blockbusters and super heroes, Marvel continues to up its game. Excelsior!"
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"100% pure, unadulterated, potent, china-white entertainment."

"Aug 7, 2012",positive,Absolutely amazing!!!
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"Something that has not been done before to have most of our favorite heros in one movie,marvel had the pressure on them.And marvel delivered, a plan 5 movies in the making that started with Iron Man and ended with Captain America,The Avengers is a movie that knows how to balance so many iconic characters.With joss whedon who knows a little bit about comicbooks,who gave each every character there moment in the spotlight directed this movie solidly."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"A true comic book movie, Whedon does not dilute the Marvel brand."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"I would have rated it lower, but I just saw TDKR and this literally is everything that movie is not... Fun, witty, intelligent and resonating."
"Aug 7, 2012",positive,"Brilliant fun! Make no mistake though, the character development was in the preceding films, so as long as you have seen all of them there is a great time to be had with The Avengers. Amazing special effects, but only there to facilitate the story, no dominate it. This is an awesome series!"
"Aug 7, 2012",neutral,oi hoi dishum dhushum big screen tai kharap na
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,WHAAAAAAAT!!!!! what a lame website. HOW HOW HOW did this get a higher rating the dark knight rises? oh come on.
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Awesome that's all I have to say!:) hope there's a second one! Only Jeremy Renner can make a dude with a bow and arrow look cool:)
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Amazing!! And surprisingly funny:)
"Aug 6, 2012",negative,"Overrated. The plot made little to no sense and the movie spent a lot of time explaining the backstories of the various characters -- too much to deliver a story in its own right. There was a small amount of witty dialogue, and Robert Downey Jr. is clearly a gifted actor, but overall, it felt like too many cooks. Trying to mash together so many disparate stories somehow added up to a whole that was less than the sum of its parts. Not sure what all the hype was about."
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Lived up to expectations and is only surpassed by the Dark Knight Rises in superhero films.  Joss Whedon did a heck of a job with this.
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,So far the funniest and the best of the Marvel movies! I left the theater knowing I was going to see it again! The Hulk stole the show!!!
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Hulk Smash! Best superhero movie of all time!
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,"I have been waiting for The Avengers for a long time, like, since Iron Man came out. Probably since I realised there was such a thing as The Avengers. And I saw it on opening night. 

It was, all and all, a good movie. There was lots of humour, and everyone was in character. You got to see Black Widow speak Russian (no accent again, though, like Iron Man 2. L), and got to see the team fight as one. Somehow, I didnâ(TM)t think this was possible, but Loki got sexier. I was quite disappointed that I didnâ(TM)t bring my patented drool bucket. The action/fight scenes were top notch. Howeverâ¦..

SPOILER ALERT FROM THIS POINT ON. 

I donâ(TM)t want to be one of those fans that complain about everything, but there were things I didnâ(TM)t like. I donâ(TM)t want to say a lot, but there were some definite things I didnâ(TM)t like. And yes, spoilers. I didnâ(TM)t like how the movie seemed to focus a lot on Iron Man. I like Iron Man, ish, starting to like him more after certain events *coughcivilwarcough* but I didnâ(TM)t want to see him. I wanted to see Thor, and Hulk, and Cap. And Spiderman. I was so hoping for a cameo from him. But alas, disappointed. I donâ(TM)t get why they canâ(TM)t do that, itâ(TM)s probably some bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. I didnâ(TM)t like the lack of accents on Black Widow, and I didnâ(TM)t like that the Hulk grunted a lot. And there were a couple scenes where I was like, Did I accidently buy tickets to Atlantis, the Lost Empire? 

I hate to admit I forgot where the alien villains were from. And apparently, Prune Face is their boss. (Guess who that is, folks). 

But, I LOVED the characterization of everyone. It was, like, spot on. Black Widow was a great, well-rounded female who was strong and tough. I loved the fight scenes, as said above. There was one scene where everyone was arguing that was amazing. I loved how it was all put together. I love Loki (marry me Tom Hiddleston!) and Hulk andâ¦(shuttering Nerdgasm). 

The actor playing Bruce Banner also kind of reminded me of Hank from Corner Gas. At first I thought he wouldnâ(TM)t be as good as Edward Nortonâ(TM)s performance, but I felt he did pull off a more well-rounded performance. 

There was so much bromance. So. Much. Bromance. 

There is a death, and I didnâ(TM)t cry. I am so proud of me. 

Just and fyi, the after the after the big credits scene is funny, but has no hints at next movies. Watch it anyway."
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,"The best thing Avengers has going for them, is action, humor, fun characters, and overall, just a lot of fun. And that is what Superhero movies are supposed to be. FUN. I can't really do a very good job of explaining the story though, It's somewhat simple, yet somewhat complicated. The Action is so fun, you forget about a lot of the boring parts. Even if you don't follow the Avengers, you will appreciate the humor. My favorite character in this movie was Iron Man. RDJ provided most of the humor with his wit and once again, just owns the role. I also thought Mark Ruffalo was a great Hulk (and Hulk is my 2nd favorite Marvel hero behind only Spider-Man). Although his screen time as the Hulk is somewhat limited, he darn near steals the show in the end, especially with what he does to Loki. Absolutely hilarious. I feel this movie focuses on Thor the most since the villain is Thor's (adopted) brother Loki who is simply trying to take over the world with his army and this team of six simply has to stop him and his army. I know, the villains goal sounds a bit cliche but all of that makes for some great action in the end. sure the battle does take a toll on the city but it could have been a lot worse, plus, the action was just so much fun. Overall, I'd say, definitely a cool movie, one of my favorite comic book movies of all time, and a must see."
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Amazing movie enen if you have not seen an of the other movies

"Aug 6, 2012",positive,"Five years in the making, the Avengers supersedes expectations and portrays Marvel's image perfectly. Bravo Whedon!"
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,Was worried how it would all fit together but it turns out to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Just have to wait and see how they top this off. A HULK SMASHTASTIC movie!
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,"Not a major fan of the DC series but I loved this film. One of those rare cinema experiences where you are totally drawn in to the film and forget about reality. Action, humour and depth of character are standouts."
"Aug 6, 2012",positive,"As a fan, I can only write in the perspective of one, but can I just say, that if you are a fan of Marvel's superheroes and movies, this will be a real treat, and a must-watch. At first glance, you may be put off by what seems like an average action movie, with guns, explosions, and oh no, aliens. But wait, there's more to it than that! What I loved about this movie was how they managed to give each character their time in the spotlight, from their introductions to the fight scenes at the end, and how it managed to put all these characters together to form the glorious team known as The Avengers. But what I think really made this movie enjoyable was the humor. It was expertly woven into the fabric of the story with a variety of jokes that made audiences both young and old fill the theater with laughter. With a well put together plot, fascinating characters, cool effects, comedy, and plenty of awesome one-liners, this movie should be on everyone's ""want to see it"" list."

"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"While a good movie, ""The Avengers"" feels lagged at some points, and the excesive fights, fists and bullets don't help. The story is good a some points, though. ""The Avengers"" is a nice film, but may not be as good in a home, small screen."

"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"We finally made it! the end of Phase one, the culmination of Marvel's entire bluff gamble that a team up of comic book superheroes would actually work hit theaters, and OH MY GOD it tore down the house. What Marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of nerd icon Joss Whedon to write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would fail...even me. I'm glad to say though that it does deliver in every aspect of what a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some.
   In broad strokes the story goes Loki (Tom Hiddleston)the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is made a deal with the space mutants anime guys to take over planet Earth and now Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. must bring together this motley crew of ""freaks and accidents"" as they're called to come together as the Avengers. So yes we get our big epic team up of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (now played flawlessly by Mark Ruffalo),Black Widow(Scarlett Johanssen), and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner). I'm not going to spend too much time on the story because it would just suck up a lot of time and it would just confuse you so just go and see the movie and experience it for yourself.
    I will discuss further the mastery of what Whedon did in being able to skillfully go around and give each of these larger-than-life personalities; that have led their own movies for the most part in the past,share the screen with equal time to be with each of them and to build upon them as characters and have them build arch's as a team.
   This is going to be a short review because over all although it's not a perfect 5 start movie it is a pivotal movie to see if you not only like action movies, but more importantly comic book movies because this changed the game. This was one of those days the world stopped and we knew this wasn't the same old circus anymore. Let me just close by saying that if this is going to be a different kind of circus from now on I'll gladly sign up to be at every show, you sold me Marvel congratulations now keep it up. Although the major congratulations and thanks goes to you Joss Whedon you're the one that made this real."

"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"WOW, now this how a Superhero movie is done. totally loved the interaction of the main characters"
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,This movie qualifies as one of the best action movies ever. In your face non stop action from start to finish with amazing effects and a great flow to the story of all the characters.
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,I came out with a huge grin on my face and that's all I could've asked for. Only small plot elements kept this one from 5 stars.
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,Was really good just had so much packed into it superheroes and aliens.
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"Such a great movie of the summer, action & adventure wise."

"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"iron man is good. overall, it's a lot of shooting and bombing."
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,Loved it loved it loved IT!
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Been waiting for it since the end of Iron Man in 2008 and it did not fail to deliver. Casting was excellent; I was a bit concerned about the change from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo for Bruce Banner, but for the difference in character between the Incredible Hulk and Avenger's the casting change worked fantastically. And Joss Whedon as director was a touch of class. Would have happily walked right back into the cinema to watch it over again and eagerly await it's release onto home media."
"Aug 5, 2012",positive,This movie is freakin awesome!!
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,This movie is good I loved #1
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"Amazing visuals bring together the classic superheros who work together and save the world, humorously of course."
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!
"Aug 4, 2012",negative,"An absolute bore hole. The characters were all stale and jilted, and even Loki (my favorite out of the movie Thor) was reduced to a boring whiny baby. Don't waste your time or your money."
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"The movie started a little slow for me but as the avengers came together, so did the movie. The movie could've been alot better. However, it was the best superhero movie I've seen since ""The Dark Knight""."
"Aug 4, 2012",negative,"The only time it stops being boring is when it decides to be obnoxious instead. Not trolling, just my correct opinion."
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Can't wait for more. No matter how many they make, I hope they all entertain me and allow me to escape into a world of adventure"
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,one of the best movies if the year
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a brilliant action film bringing in the witty yet hardcore action hero of the Iron Man films, the amazingly written fantasy of Thor and the amazing action sequences of Captain America. The Avengers also brought the first sightings of the new Hulk and Hawkeye, and both are satisfying for Marvel fans. The Avengers is Marvel's best film yet and has spawned what could possibly a franchise as big as Star Wars. Absolutely amazing."
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,awesome ... yea baby...
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, cant wait for the next one"
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Awesome movie but the best part is the end..... Very very end after ALL the credits
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Best super hero film in a long time!
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Amazing how they were able to bring all the stories together.
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Good but didn't blow me away.
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Nice blend of actors. Story line reads like a Thor II plot.
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,Who'd have thought they could pull it off? And have it be so freaking awesome.
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,love the movie..lot of action
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"It didn't equate the hype I was expecting from the reviews I read before. But I have to admit, the action scenes were the awesomest! And Hulk is such a comic relief!"
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,its a great movie..its a mixture of awesome comedy and comedy..and i just love the characters...
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,feel good movie of the summer
"Aug 4, 2012",positive,"Awesome and funny especially at the end of the movie were hulk screams at iron man also "" hulk smash "" you will now what that means when you seen it"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"I love this movie, but I admit, it's got some pretty cheesy one liners.  Otherwise, action movie perfection!"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,An amazing movie with a stellar cast. A++ if I've ever seen one.
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,good movie but very overrated
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,LOUD AND FUN WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM A SUPERHEROES MOVIE?!
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, best Super Hero Movie in a long time."
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"It was great having all the heroes together, but it needed more action and less time trying to settle their differences."
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"As a non-Robert Downy Jr fan I can honestly say I walked into Avengers expecting to be more annoyed than anything. I was actually pleasantly surprised to find that this was a far cry from the stereotypical superhero movie. Sure, it had it's been action sequences and fancy costumes and all that but there was a certain amount of realism to all the characters. There was actually a plot (and a good one at that) which is something that is easy to get away from in superhero movies as an audience wants to see explosions and mayhem every few minutes. An excellent way to start out the summer movie season and it definitely won't be the last we see of ""Earth's mightiest heroes""."
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,I'd prefer another league. hehe
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,Years in the making.. And well worth the wait.
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Stand down, true believers: they did it. Joss Whedon and co. made a fantastic superteam movie. Even though the thrill of watching these characters together onscreen wore off within a minute, and even with the fanbuy nitpicks (no ""Avengers Assemble"", no Wasp or Ant-Man, an overlong intro, generic ""hero battle"" themes, Hawkeye getting the least amount of screen time, Scarlett Johansson still stinks as Black Widow), all of those little things are outweighed by all of the good stuff. The character development is great here-especially in how it showed Thor's maturing as a warrior (something that I felt was lacking and should have been addressed in his solo movie). While I didn't really like Mark Ruffalo as much as Eric Bana (and certainly not as much as Ed Norton), and I didn't like this look for the Hulk as much as I did for the one from the last film, I did enjoy that (unlike the previous films) he was able to communicate how bad the pain of transforming into the Hulk is. I thought that it was interesting how they dealt with the issue of WMD's, as well. Surprisingly, it was also the funniest film that I've seen in a while. In summary, it exceeded my high expectations. I feel that this is the best Marvel movie since ""Spider-Man!"""
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,This was an awsome new addition to the marvel movies!
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,There is nothing not to like!
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"A dream come-true for a Marvel lover!!!
Exhilerating, entertaining, action-packed and simply unforgettable!"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Easily a top 5 movie. Mixed action with a great plot and it wasn't clogged by any unnecessary romance. If you don't like superhero movies, this one will get you started."
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,Its a cool movie. Wouldnt be anything without Iron Man. No way does it even come close to The Dark Knight or the Dark Knight Rises
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"love the action, adventure, & comedy makes it the best movie of the year"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Good movie with pretty good acting, a well written plot, and nice special effects. The only proboblem that i had with it is that weve seen it all before in previous super hero movies."
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"http://mckenziesthoughts.blogspot.ca/2012/05/avengers-film-review.html

If you're like me, you became hooked ever since you were blown away by Iron Man, and waited for the final post credits scene when Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury says he wants to talk to Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark about ""the Avengers Initiative"".  

You then waited for The Incredible Hulk, and was not as blown away by that film.  But, you were still along for the ride when Tony Stark says to General Ross in that film's post credits scene that ""We're putting together a team"".

Then, came Iron Man 2 (a bit of a disappointment), Thor (pretty good) and Captain America (also pretty good).  The picture was getting clearer. The Avengers film was incredibly just around the corner!

Now it is here.

The film does not disappoint, because most of us have been along for the ride, and have been eagerly awaiting the unfolding of the larger tapestry that Marvel has now revealed to us.  Director Joss Whedon was a great choice to direct.  He has the requisite skills and experience.  He is skilled at working with team dynamics -- Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity, and his work with the Astonishing X-Men comics, to name a few.  

Whedon slowly assembles the Avengers for us during the first and second acts.  It's a bit of a slow trip to get there, but we don't mind too much.  We are kept going in particular by the characters of Black Widow and Bruce Banner.  Widow did not impress us much in Iron Man 2, and was in fact quite an annoyance.  Here, Whedon finds the key to let Johansen's acting chops out.  We see why she is called the Black Widow, and it is not just because she is deadly.  Whedon also finally unlocks the best rendition on either television or film of Bruce Banner and the Hulk.  Mark Ruffalo nails it.  We are very curious how Banner has managed to go without an ""incident"" in over a year.  

It's fascinating the way Whedon plays each character off of each other.  It's a bit of a chess match going on screen.  In the melee, however, Jeremey Remmer's Hawkeye is quite overshadowed until the third act.  It's part of the plot, but this was the first film where Hawkeye should have had some more backstory.  We missed that.  Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, ""Director of SHIELD"", finally does get some decent screen time, but we don't get to really see him manipulating the action behind the scenes to pull the strings of the Avengers as he should be doing.  There is one scene that indicates that perhaps he has had more of a hand in doing that than we might have thought, but perhaps more insight into that dimension of his character and the story was needed.

Chris Evans' Captain America also gets shunted for most of the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of the influence of his ""old school"" good and bad view of the world at play in helping to shape the Avengers into a team.  After all, he is supposed to be the leader of the Avengers, and there must be a reason why these other powerful heroes would want to follow his lead.  Instead, another plot device is used to trigger this that I won't spoil by revealing here.

Chris Helmsworth's Thor is also a bit overshadowed.  I wanted to see more thunder from the god of thunder in his interactions with the rest of the team.  Downey's Stark is back and as entertaining as usual.  He almost steals the show in his scenes.  Tom Hiddleston's Loki is up to his mischief here, but despite the terrible things he does in the film, I never felt like I wanted to rip his head off, which is how we should feel by the third act.  Don't get me wrong, we do come to hate him, but not to the degree that we should.

Once the Avengers do assemble and get through the initial phases of team dynamics -- forming, storming, and norming -- they are ready to perform.  The third act kicks ass.  We finally get to see some true comic book level action on film here.  The team gels and Captain America starts barking orders.  Again, though, the ""bad guys"" here are menacing enough to look at, but you don't really hate them as you should.  So, when the Avengers start taking names and kick ass, it is not quite as lip smackingly satisfying as it should be. 

Also, where the heck is the US Military when an obvious national level threat is at hand?  How SHIELD fits into the equation with the US Military is unclear, and as a ""geek"" that bugged me.

Banner finally reveals to us his secret for controlling his anger and in turn the Hulk.  I won't tell you, but it is worth the price of admission :)

See the Avengers in ULTRAAVX 3D.  See it twice.  Stay for the two post credits scenes.  We now realize that our ride with the Avengers is only beginning.  The size and scope of the universe that has been opened up to us by Marvel look immense.  Where will this ride go?  I am on it to the end.

***1/2 (out of 4 stars)"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,the ultimate entertainer..:-D
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Spectacular movie. Took a while to get started, with the front part mainly being getting the heroes together, but the second part more than made up for it :D No character development was needed, that was the point of the previous movies. All the actors were cast awesomely. Robert Downey Jr was perfect as Iron Man, with some awesome jokes and puns. Chris Hemsworth is just wow. Mark Ruffalo was even better than Ed Norton as the Hulk. I've never been a great fan of the Incredible Hulk, but omaigosh, he just portrayed Bruce Banner's character SO well. Chris Evans was brilliant as usual. Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow was brilliant, and she was not just someone to stare at. My only concern is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye had too little screentime. Renner's a brilliant actor, in MI4, Bourne Legacy and The Hurt Locker, and yet he had the least screentime out of all The Avengers. Overall though, it was still a brilliant movie, with some epic fight scenes. The actions scenes and special effects were awesome. 9/10"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,action packed funny and waiting to own on dvd
"Aug 3, 2012",negative,Loki was beat in 3 seconds by the hulk. Wow wasted 2 hours of build up for that. What a terrible movie.
"Aug 3, 2012",neutral,"Not saying it was a bad movie, I am just not the biggest superhero movie fan. Too many downright unbelievable scenes"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"Best damn movie, EVER!"
"Aug 3, 2012",positive,"I was petty impressed that the movie came together so well. Thor was god awful as a solo movie (didn't see captain America so I can't say about that one), so I was worried."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Avengers was sick I'll give it that...Except Iron Man fighting Thor was fucking retarded since he studied up on who would be in the avengers so why the fuck is he fighting him like he doesnt know who Thor is?....exactly made u think....and the Character of Mariah Hill and Scarlett Jo, pointless, Scarlett just like Iron Man 2 was Eye candy and i was not dissappointed with that :)  but no Russian accent Downer...makes me think...can she act?...Mariah Hill...Y were u even in the movie?...u did nothing of value...u werent even good as eye candy...FUCKING USELESS!!!"
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Probably the best ""comic book"" comic book movie. All of the lead characters are on the top of their game, Downey Jr. more than the others. Whedon manages to balence the humor and action/serious elements pretty well, whcih is good because this is a very funny movie. And the ending action scene is like if Transformers # was done well. But the whole movie is really held together by the superheroes interactions."
"Aug 2, 2012",neutral,"Well... I didn't understand anything. Partly cause I was on the floor, partly cause I haven't seen any of the other movies :D"
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"After all these years of waiting , The Avengers was definitely worth the wait !"
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Good movie for comic book and Ironman fans. Hulk say ""this action film not for everyone""."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Awesome, Awesome movie! Loved everything about it, the cast, the acting, the plot, production and effects. The Cinemaphotographer did an amazing job, as well. Can not wait for the sequel."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Fun, well written, well directed...what more could you ask for in a super hero movie"
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Great movie, iron man at the end is the best! An overall good plot and description."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,This is great movie I seen for long time.
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,I loved this movie im a big marvel fan . The hulk was my favorit in this movie .
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Can't wait for more marvel action
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Humorous in all the senses of the word. A complete spectacle
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,It's the Avengers... But Hulk stole the movie!
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,This box office smash hit is a marvel blocbuster it smashed the screen i personally enjoyed the movie and why i think it may beat the dark knight rises to stay on the top and finish as the highest grossing film of the year 1 comic book geeks and 2 scrennings showing on 3D it's pretty simple if it's on 3D then you make more money i prefered the dark knight rises though
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie I've seen!! :D
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"The perfect marvel movie. Light, suspenseful and Hilariousness. Great for all family members and a joy to watch."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Spectacular and fun. Kind of losses focus a bit but j.w told the story with skill and humor.  I don't think anybody else could have pulled this flick off.
"Aug 2, 2012",negative,"This review may contain a few spoilers. But at this point, everyone has already seen The Avengers, and if you haven't already, you're probably going to see it anyway. So why even bother with a review? Because there's no way I can say that I dislike The Avengers without explaining myself. 

I'm not big on super heroes. The only film I've seen related to The Avengers is Iron Man 2, which I wasn't impressed with. So maybe I'm not the target audience for this film, but shouldn't a good film be tailored for ALL audiences? 

The Avengers tries to be a smart and complex film, but in the end, the film is just about Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Thor teaming up to stop Loki, who's bent on world domination. 

The Avengers irritates me. A lot. And the reason for that (well, one of the reasons) is because it's all about the money. The Avengers doesn't take any risks. I probably could have told you exactly what was going to happen in the movie before I even saw it. The story held only one surprise, and it wasn't a pleasant one. The surprise was Loki's plan for world domination: Aliens. 

Yup, The Avengers isn't just a cash grab, it's another alien movie. And the aliens aren't the only problem. Far from it. The Avengers is campy to the point of laughter. It's filled with cheap escapes and hammy dialogue. 

I mentioned a moment ago that The Avengers is just a cash grab that doesn't take any risks. Allow me to elaborate on that, if you haven't already disowned me as a critic. 

At the near ending point, Iron Man has to launch a nuclear missile into a portal to stop the alien invasion. After succeeding, it appears Iron Man may be dead. In the end, he lives. Surprise, surprise. If Iron Man dies, there can't be any Iron Man sequels, and one of the primary selling points of The Avengers won't be around for The Avengers 2. 

Marvel has a huge money maker, and they know it. They weren't going to kill off Iron Man, they'll miss out on sequel opportunities to make even MORE money! A plot twist or a super hero dying would've made The Avengers a better film. But in the end, it's a predictable and straightforward film. 

Of course, I knew The Avengers wasn't going to be an intellectual film, but was it too much to ask that The Avengers might be a little more than a trace-the-lines action movie? For crying out loud, audiences have endured 6 films in anticipation of The Avengers. I think at this point, Marvel should've given as a quality product. 

The action is nothing new. There was nothing regarding the action that I haven't already seen. There needed to be a new twist to the action or something. But all we get is basic beat-him-up-and-deliver-one-liners fights. The sheer scale of the action and the speed and manic in which it is delivered was enough to evoke artificial excitement from audience members, but surely SOMEONE had to see how cliche this all is. 

And then there's the humor which consists almost entirely of predictable one-liners. Nearly all the humor in this movie has been presented in the same way in other films. But audiences aren't laughing because it IS funny, audiences are laughing because it's SUPPOSED to be funny. Otherwise, there would be little laughter at all. Sure, some of the dialogue was pretty funny, but I scarcely laughed at all. 

And nothing even really happens for the first hour and a half. Everything that happens in The Avengers feels pointless and uninteresting. 

But I suppose The Avenger's isn't all bad. The acting is decent, but not incredible. There aren't going to be any award nominations for acting, but the acting is serviceable. 

As expected, the special effects are incredible. Even if I didn't enjoy the film much, the special effects were incredible. There's enough eye candy to make The Avengers at least endurable. 

And the score by Alan Silverstri, while often generic, has more than a few bright spots. I was pleasantly surprised by the score, even if it there were a few missed opportunities. 

And speaking of pleasant surprises, I was quite impressed at how well The Avengers managed to juggle all the super heroes, giving each ample screen time, and not letting one take over the rest. I expected Robert Downey Jr. to steal the show, but for the most part, the parts were balanced well. 

The Avengers isn't completely terrible, but I can't excuse The Avenger's laziness. There were no risks taken, everything is very straightforward. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I was hoping The Avengers wouldn't be completely pointless. A villain is bent on world domination, so a bunch of people join together to stop him. Is that the best you can do Marvel? 

Ugh, forget it Marvel, I'm not seeing The Avengers 2. If I ever want to see a quality super hero movie, I'll wait for The Incredibles 2."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"The Avengers fires on all cylinders and is great entertainment for fans and non-fans alike, with mind-blowing action and immensely likable characters."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,oh ya love it going to get some swarma now
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen in a long time
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,Dissapointing in my view
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,"Entertaining enough. Surprisingly very funny, actually. Downey jr. was excellent as Iron Man as he was in his own movies (which I really liked) and the Hulk as very good as well. Well acted and well written.
Other than that, it was a bit shallow for me. I don't know if it's just not my kind of movie or what. I thought it was poorly paced and got bored in parts during the first half and I assume all of the character development was done in each heroes own movie (I know Iron Man's was) because there is jack shit in this movie - which meant that I didn't care at all about any of the other characters. I suppose you are supposed to see all the others first (no, thanks).
There were some very cool parts in the action, but I am more a fan of intense, gritty action, preferably with hand-to-hand combat rather than big shiny CG effects."
"Aug 2, 2012",positive,lots of action with a touch of comedy enjoyable till the end if you haven't seen it u must!
"Aug 2, 2012",negative,"i was expecting more from this movie.. it just somehow fell flat to me.. four superheroes in one movie would have opened to a lot of awesome possibilities especially on fight scenes, stunts, choreography, and much more to graphics and animation. But sadly, this movie did not live up to expectations..  maybe next time.."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"A fantastic superhero movie that gives a decent plot AND gives the audience what they want: a lot of showing off by each superhero. Whedon's direction and writing always create a lot of laughter from me, and this was no exception. The only aspect that kept this film from a fifth star is Norton would have been a much better Hulk and there are also few plot points that don't quite make sense, but you forget about them with all that is going on."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,loved Thor and Hulk!!
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,I loved it! But I didn't like them changing the Hulk.
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,much better then I expected
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Probably the best ""comic book"" comic book movie. All of the lead characters are on the top of their game, Downey Jr. more than the others.

But the whole movie is really held together by the superheroes interactions."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"This movie is....legendary, no movie have I ever seen has ever brought together almost all of my favorite heroes and I was sitting back in my seat the entire film, marvel fans will utterly love this movie, from the duke out of iron and Thor to the hulk smashing of our beloved Hulk:) a epic has been created"
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,Needed more Hulk Smash!
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,pointless fun... like an amusement park
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"The humor was a little dry - and the plot was all too predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,Best movie ever... love it.
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,Loved it...action packed!!
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"There are so many epic moments in this movie. It is perfect superhero team movie. Future X-Men and Justice League movies need to use this as an example. Each hero shined (even Hawkeye) and caught the attention of the viewers. This movie is full of witty banter, great fight scenes, and scenes that just give you goosebumps. This movie totally lived up to the hype."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Combining Marvel's trademark visual dazzles with Whedon's witty writing style, The Avengers seamlessly ties together its already spectacular franchises into a superpowered epic that revolutionizes the realms of comic book movies."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,A absolutely great movie my third favorite to the dark knight movies.
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,what it lacked in story line it made up in action
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Perfect action and seamless dialogue, effective converted 3D and wonderful performances. Marvel's The Avengers is the exact definition of a summer movie. Loki used as the villain was a perfect choice with that perfect amount of crazy, and a standout performance by Robert Downey Jr. keep this afloat. I don't know why it only earns a 4.5 from me. But it seems like something is missing for it to be a full 5 stars. I don't know what yet."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"What a great, solid movie! Having only seen the Iron Man movies before viewing the Avengers, I was worried I wouldn't quite get the allure of an epic superhero movie, but it really doesn't matter when it is a blockbuster done right. It was funny, suspenseful, well written and shot, and the only thing I could fault in was ScarJo's lameness, but all the superfanboys I saw the movie with said that it was to be expected so I let it slide. I can't wait to see this movie again on DVD."
"Aug 1, 2012",neutral,I don't really understand the film actually
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Recomendable, en general estuvo bien, aun con algunas cosas cambiadas del comic, pero igual sigue siendo excelente, buen Hulk xD"
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"My goodness! This movie is amazing!!! Amazing effects, acting, and one good comedy. I'm glad they team up in this movie. It's awesome!!!!!"
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,I thought it was a really good movie. The action was good and the acting was good also.
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Greatly filmed, AWESOME performance from Tom Hiddleston, action packed (and i MEAN action packed), a funny and spectacular script, amazingly filmed, and great acting from every avenger. The highly anticipated Avengers lives up to its hype in the best possible way! Rating: 94%/ Overall: Fantastic"
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"That DAMN good!  Men and women of all ages will love this movie.  It not only lives up to the massive hype but destroys the bar in the process.  It contains almost everything you'd want in an action movie, great special effects, humor, sex appeal for men and women (Thor, Scarlett Johansen).  If you get a chance see it on IMAX 3D.  I usually hate spending extra money for purported 3D effects or ear drum killing sound but this movie is well worth it."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"Despite me pretty much hating or not enjoying most of the previous MCU films, The Avenger's works because it features (gasp) actual interesting things going on! Shaky opening scene aside, it features top notch performances, fantastic action sequences and some honest to God clever writing. See Marvel, see what happens when you care?

Loki is still the worst though."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,Best movie movie ever
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"I'll be the fist to admit that the plot was a little weak BUT! This is a fanboys wet dream. What I've been waiting years to witness! As a proud Marvel comics nerd, I never had any doubt in my mind about this one. Ever since Marvel Studios began it's journey making films in house, which started with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, it has been nothing but great. The room for creative writing and directing is limitless.  Mark Ruffalo delivers the best portrayal of Bruce Banner/ Hulk on film, PERIOD! The balanced screen time each of these crucial characters receives is flawlessly pulled off by Joss Whedon! What Marvel Studios has done with the cinematic universe has forever changed the course of film and has raised the bar pretty dang high.  (Take note, Fox and WB/DC) There are enough laughs, action and emotional moments that will satisfy the casual moviegoers and fanboys alike."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,Filled with action pack and non stop ass kicking is just awesome!
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"A fairly fun movie with some good action. Would have been wayyy more enjoyable if i was a Marvel fan though. Some of the movies that the central heroes cone from felt like rushed, cheap cash-ins (ie Capt. America) for the sole purpose of introducing those characters before this movie was released."
"Aug 1, 2012",negative,"The most over rated film i ever saw, the story is lame and predictable, the script is cheesy and full of cliches and the chracters keep fighting each other for no reason what so ever. Seriously why does this film get a 93% on rottern tomatos, this needs sorting out, this is outragous."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a great mix of everything such as action, humor and drama. Joss Whedon has done quite well in capturing each of the superheroes' ways, as well as presenting some of the most insane stunts ever caught on film."
"Aug 1, 2012",negative,"This was totally overhyped, and not worth the $5 I paid to see it. Don't understand what the big deal is. Too much shit going on at once, and the writing was bad. There was never even a really good climax in the film. It had a constant rate at which is was going. Really slow and boring. It's sad that all of the character origin movies have lead to this one big piece of crap. I was really hoping this would be good."
"Aug 1, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever. Great action and a fast moving plot with good characters. Way better then batman.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"No spider Man? I think even though not all the Avengers are in the movie the movies was pretty good. The movie has it all comedy, action, The two main ingredients for a epic movie."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"It could have been better, sure. However, I don't know of any movie that brings this many story-lines together this well. Extremely entertaining."
"Jul 31, 2012",negative,the effects were cool.
"Jul 31, 2012",neutral,sadly it starts slow witch upset me some good moments other not so much
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Bliss and heaven. Contains everything you could ever hope for in a superhero movie.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Excellent! Want to see more of the Avengers!
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,great great great great great great grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,If you liked this check out firefly (joss whedon's show on Netflix)
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"Sorry for my last review about this movie but after watching the movie for a second time I  realized I was wrong and that The Avengers is bad-ass superhero move with intense action sequences, great acting, Joss Whedon directing and ofcourse the movie's humor."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Pretty epic. Story was weak though.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"5 stars for action and effects, but I need some semblance of drama to stay interested.  Got really bored."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,best super hero movie of the decade
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,definitely the best film of the year so far.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Gi-normus.. fun movie....this is how you do it...mixing all these tales to make a fun movie....wow. some directors can not even compile one superhero vs villain. and then add a few others.....remember daredevil....aghhhh...and Whedon...  Rami....these guys know their comic books and Saturday morning flare....they remember what is was like to wake up Saturday morning at 6am with a bowl of cereal and have fun....not some depressing interpretation
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"I'll be honest, when I saw this film was being made I thought it was going to fail. I am so glad I was wrong, amazing film! Great plot, great dialogue, great everything!"
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Only the part where all the superheroes are together are new. Rest of the storyline is as usual.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Are the Avenger's in it?
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"EEEEPPPPIIIICCCC
Amazing and funny"
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,The best superheroes movie that I ever seen. Robert D. JR was the best nuff said.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"Now this is a Comic-Book film for sure! A fantastic film with a superb cast and flabbergasting special effects, especially the final battle with all of our favourite heroes assembled! ""The Avengers"" has given us a true interpretation of its 'genre'. Go see it!  ""Avengers Assemble!"""
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,best superhero movie ever. only the original X- Men can hold candle.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"Very good film but not the best of storylines... Funny, good acting and overall a very very good film..."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Best action and comedy movie since transformers 3: dark of the moon
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Brilliant! Funny and brilliant!
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"I feel the action in this movie....All the superheroes are in this movie,how cool is that?
And where is Spiderman?"
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,so far the best movie I've seen this year.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,This movie is great. Can't wait till the next one.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"I don't really know how to wrong this film, it was absolutely beautiful. I could not find any major flaws, and they had a wonderful script with wonderful acting. Not to mention those silly parts that made you laugh, and for once they actually made super heros seem realistic.

I was never a fan of super heros, but this movie makes me love them. I can even pick out my favorite characters and have a huge debate on who is better. I usually can't do that with any movies nowadays because in most new movies the acting is shit, the script is shit, and so is the character developement. 

This is truly a new age movie gem."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,Impossible to live up to the hype but still a good movie. Glad that they finally got the Hulk right! But still didn't have the feeling I did while watching the original Iron Man.
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,just one word Awsome
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic book films of all time. 'The Avengers' is one fun, action packed hit."
"Jul 31, 2012",positive,"A blast, through and through. While Nolan has managed to make superhero movies serious, Joss Whedon manages to bring a lot of fun and energy. Like non-stop fun and energry. There was never a dull moment in this thing and it progressively got better and better. This is a true Summer blockbuster in every sense of the word. Hopefully we get more like it in the near future."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Nonstop action and decent effects and CGI. Even the should-be-cheesy one-liners are fantastic! Perhaps the best part is that this film made me want to go back and watch all of the others in the franchise that built up to this one.

If you're a guy, you must see this movie."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,amazing can't wait for the next one.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,This movie is amazing..... great humour great cast great story....  1 15 minute scene away from being the perfect movie
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"wow, one of the best superhero movies ever. great slugfest. most like the comics of any comic book movie"
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,My favourite action Superhero movie ever! I cant wait for part two. The actors playing each Avenger did an outstanding job. Loved It!!!
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,The greatest super hero movie ever made period...
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Though the plot is paper thin, the way the characters interact with each other and the large action sequences more than make up for it. One of the most exciting movies out there!"
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Because The Avengers doesn't take itself too seriously-- it is colorful, fast-paced and fun-- it is probably the best superhero movie I've seen."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie! Marvel has been working for a long time to bring us this. Lets see what its sequel brings to the table, and how it'll do against DC's Justice League that hopefully will be out by then."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"a fun movie. the amount of substance isn't incredible (heh) here, but i feel it's a fun summer action flick"
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,A weekend movie that you can watch with your kid and have fun.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Great! I really enjoyed it!
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,I was honestly SHOCKED at how entertaining and engrossing this film is. a MUST see for this summer.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Perfect summer blockbuster! Lots of fighting.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,i really want to see it
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Pure marvel bliss. Captain America does an amazing job of staying a consistent character and not trying to match up with tony Starks screen presence
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Fun!fun! And morw summer fun at its best!
"Jul 30, 2012",neutral,"With this bloating movie Paramount proved that the superhero movie generally is more style over substance.  With the over-saturation of this genre no where near it's end, I can only assume that we will be up for at least 2 more Avengers films."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"One of the most overrated movies of all time. I'm usually the one that wants more character development in superhero movies but this was too much! They have there own movies for that. The last 30 minutes was amazing and one reason was we finally got to see what the Hulk could do since he was just being a scientest for the whole movie. Robert Downey Jr. delivered another annoying performance as Iron Man, Chris Evans did a great job as usuall as Captain America and Thor barelly said a pep in the movie and why was Loki picked as the villain! This movie was very boring until it got to the finale so I will be generous and give it 3 stars"
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"One for the fans. Me, not so much"
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Very action packed film
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Es LA cinta de super heroes del 2012.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Superb!!! How a superhero flick Should be done!
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,best ever super hero and comic book adaptation.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,This movie was amazing!
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Best Superhero movie of all time.
"Jul 30, 2012",neutral,RDJ & Mark Ruffalo - good. Too long. And the destruction of Manhattan .... can't something else be attacked in better taste?
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Wonderful movie. The hulk was awesome. A must see. this make all other aspiring movies feel puny
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,Great movie! Loaded with action and definitely has its funny moments.
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Enjoyed it, but didn't think it was amazing."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Melding such a disparate collection of characters who have been featured in their own films should be a difficult task. Joss Whedon demonstrates why he's one of the master storytellers working in film and television today, commanding a control over a genre that has only started to have more than a handful of films that could be put in the pretty good column in the last 10 of the 70 years Superhero films have been produced. Whedon's strength has always been his focus on external and internal conflict for his characters, never forgetting what they really want and desire, giving them a humanity that made the first SUPERMAN film the first great superhero flick. With THE AVENGERS, Whedon has used that to create the story of a team that has to form and gel very much in the vein of classic films like WHERE EAGLES DARE and THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, in which group dynamics are just as a danger to completing and surviving the mission as the enemy themselves.As to be expected Downey's Tony Stark/Iron Man shines and the other team members get their own moments to standout and help drive the story. The Hulk is a breakout character that underscores that in comics he can standalone, yet on film he's best integrated in a team setting where his near unstoppable nature can be unleashed.As strong as the film is, one can't peg the it as having any higher ambitions. However, as with the aforementioned films such as EAGLES and NAVARONE, that makes the film all the much stronger and watchable, as well as rewatchable. Captain America telling Hulk to ""Smash"" is as memorable and energizing as the climactic confrontation in EAGLES when Burton and Eastwood confirm who the traitor. Whedon should also be praised for including a brief nod and call back to 9/11 when citizens post pictures of the friends and family they lost on a wall near the end of the film. Over time Summer Blockbusters have glossed over the death toll in their films, BAD BOYS II's shantytown destruction comes instantly to mind, and moments like this, while a blink and you miss it moment, are a reminder that even in a fictional universe there are real stakes and casualties."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"A kind of Greatest Hits package of Marvel characters who have had their own films over the last 5 years. Like most Greatest Hits you only really get the good stuff and this film certainly delivers in terms of action and performances. Downey Jnr is still the most entertaining as Tony Stark and is given the most individually to do but Hiddleston is also excellent as Loki and makes a worthy villain. However the real surprise is Ruffalo as Banner/Hulk who brings a sympathetic edge to the role that Norton and Bana never achieved. We don't see a huge amount of The Hulk but when he finally starts to 'smash' at the end it is certainly the most effective use of his character in any film yet and Whedon throws in some nice comic moments too (see his grin when told he can smash and the sneaky punch he throws at Thor). The confrontation scene between Loki and The Hulk is also the most laugh out loud moment of the Marvel characters series so far.

Johansson and Renner try to do the best with Black Widow and Hawkeye but without their own films to back them up their characters feel a little undeveloped and bland. That's the only real critisism I can level at the film. Ok, we don't get the depth that the individual film in the series can offer but that's not what was expected here. This is full-on comic book action and it's all the better for it."
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,It was totally awesome I loved it soooooo much!!!!
"Jul 30, 2012",positive,"Outstanding movie with a dynamite story, and solid acting.  There was astrength in doing the individual member movies first.  Holywood, take note..."
"Jul 30, 2012",neutral,"I was a big fan of all the other Marvel Universe movies, but this one does not live to the expectation. It had no substance, no decent action scenes. The only plus point was the Hulk. Can be watched only once"
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Great job of bringing the team together and actually having a plot
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Really cool super-hero whizz-bang-awesomesauce held together by hilarious banter between great characters.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Great superhero collection!
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,This is the best movie I've seen in a long while. I love the cast and all of the action. It had a pretty good plot line also. It leaves you feeling like a superhero when it is over.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,A perfect superhero film. Everybody has a role in the movie
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,It was amazing!! It litteraly blew me away best super hero movie yet!!!
"Jul 29, 2012",negative,Although it is impressively produced and there are shots worth watching. This movie remains as a standard super heroes movie that aims at pleasing the fans but fails to deliver any surprise or interesting twist.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"A little over rated in my opinion but not bad to say the least.

6/10"
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is an intelligent movie that actually works way above the level set up by previous comic adaptations. To this movie's credit, they never assumed that the advertising or hype or even the look alone was good enough to put butts in the seats. Without question, the makers of this movie went all the way in making it a satisfying experience for not just the fans but for the uninitiated as well. They obviously respect their own source material but they've accentuated the believable and realistic angles of these wild concepts. This is a story about great characters and remarkable heroes. The action stemming from that is more than amazing. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie and how refreshing it was to see something with a guaranteed payday try and succeed at being great. They assumed nothing and delivered true greatness. KUDOS!"
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,AWESOME MOVIE!!!! Better than I expected and I already had high expectations.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"Ridiculously entertaining. Appeals to the comic geek in everyone. While lacking any depth, it definitely delivers the wow factor."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Loved it all...can't wait for the next one.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"Probably the most overrated movie of the year. Avengers was funny and entertaining, but lacked emotion. By the time the credits roll you would have forgot about this film. It lacks thought provoking themes or stories required to be a meaningful movie."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,AWSOME - Seen it 3 times
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"I was skeptical going into this film, as most people probably were. I just wasn't sure how one could pull it off, even the incredible Joss Whedon, who is well known for his excellent writing of ensemble casts. Thankfully this film did not disappoint in any way. In fact, this is the best film I have seen from Marvel to date. Joss Whedon makes the very wise decision to make the Avengers as a team a singular protagonist rather than making them multiple protagonists constantly clamoring for screen time, which was what I feared it would be. This allows all of the characters to be relevant to the story. There is also a level of wit that allows these characters to come to life to the point where they don't just feel like charicatures. It's plot is simple, but effective. My only major issues were with the Chitauri, who didn't really feel well developed enough to be more than just the threat that the Avengers had to take on, but this doesn't bother me that much because it's Loki that really steals the show here.

This is also the first comic book movie that actually felt like I was reading a comic on screen. It felt like a culmination of the previous plot lines established in the earlier movies, really taking advantage of continuity, like any good comic book story should. This film is a love letter to comic book fans everywhere and deserves to be placed among the best of all comic book movies."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"I am not even a big comic book person overall but I thought that this was very entertaining and I will most likely be excited to see any sequel! I thought that it was a great adaptation of bringing a comic book to film! Large scale but still real (particularly the scenes in the city), over-the-top but not overly ridiculous, and the character's interactions and personality flaws as well as transitions felt a lot more real and I enjoyed them a lot more than in a couple of the character's individual movies."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"Bested perhaps only by The Dark Night Rises. Jam-packed with action, drama, and the perfect amount of comedy. Great watch."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,I seen it and it was a great movie.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"I mean give me more, this was so good!"
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,The most epic movie of all time!!!
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"The only downside to the film is that it finished! Great CG, awesome action scenes, great storyline and superb script. Every actor was perfectly cast. I'll admit, I was a little unsure about Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, but superb. Can't wait for the next installment."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.
All the actors were marvelous and Joss did a fantastic job. One of my top 5 desert island movies"
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"I don't usually worship at the alter of Joss but with The Avengers I come close.  A brilliant ensemble piece with character development, a complex plot and  heart-stopping action sequences."
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Hope they make a second film.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,Good fun. As long as you going wanting to sit back and watch some good action with a few laughs then you'll love this.
"Jul 29, 2012",positive,"Well hey now. Whedon does well with what could be a pretty uneven script and rather naff-looking men in funny costumes, having fun with his material. While it's not the wildly orgasmic thrill-ride most breathless fan reviews would have you believe, its not a crappy product either. Having good actors (although Hemsworth is probably the weakest of the lot) is a great asset to a fantasy film."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Super Awesome Movie.....loved it <3
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,best movie I've seen the hulk was the best !!!!
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Best superhero movie I have ever seen!! iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow are amazing together on the big screen. The humor, action, visual effects, characters, story are all strong."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movie ever made! Marvel did a great job bringing all of the heroes together in one movie!
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Loved it. I got a good laugh out of it.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Best movie of all time, hands down ð???ð???"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Great, Epic & Funny with Heart"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Loved seeing all the characters in one movie. Love the humor and the character interactions...plot is going to be predictable (it's a comic book) but it was an enjoyable night out.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"I watched two time on the movie theater and is a great movie and funny movie in some part, to start the move it same not vary inserting is only when everything getting research about the cube from the lad. then in New York City there someone help to catch person and I really love him, he is funny moments and I bring more happy and funny. Most of this movie is going to catch person and also getting remove a different plant  what why they are some part have funny moments and most part are sires to work together. It a great movie only from funny moments!"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"About what I expected it to be, but it managed to entertain me enough and dazzle with spectacular effects. But the best superhero movie ever it is not"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Really really good. Some funny parts to.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,I absolutely loved this movie.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"For fans of the featured Marvel superheroes, The Avengers is a fun and action-packed experience best served on the big screen in 3D. I've loved the films leading up to this one (dibs on Tony Stark), and was pleasantly surprised by how each of the main characters received equal screen time -- I ended up enjoying The Hulk's role far more than I would have expected, and it was great seeing the introduction of new supporting characters such as Agent Maria Hill (played by my favorite How I Met Your Mother star, Cobie Smulders).

Lots of campy one-liners, bright costumes and completely unfeasible stunts make this the perfect summer blockbuster."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"I have to admit, I've enjoyed all the Marvel Studios productions thus far & this was the culmination of it all. Joss Whedon was THE perfect director for this project. He not only knows & understands the core apects of the characters, he respects them. Coupled with his knack for balancing groups of strong characters, he was expected to hit it out of the park & I feel he did. I was disapointed that Ed Norton wasn't coming back as Banner, but I have to say that I'm totally sold on Mark Ruffalo. He was the dark horse in the mix and he really broke out. All in all this was far from a perfect movie, but it knew what it was & what it was trying to do. An ensemble of Marvel's mightiest delivering high octave  action & summer movie fun."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Best superhero film to date! The Hulk was incredible!!!
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Still love this movie, it holds up well (after a couple years) and the Whedon banter is thoroughly enjoyable! (5-1-2015)"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Easily the best Marvel movie to date. The Hulk steals this one.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,This movie was amazing!! It barely had any corny lines (most superhero movies do) and Tom Hiddleston had me fangirling most of the time. Iron Man had some very funny lines that had me and my friend cracking up the whole time.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"A pretty good movie. I didn't like the ""cheesy"" humor if you know what i mean. I absolutely loved Robert Downey Jr.'s part. The plot didn't make much sense but it would've been better if all the villains from the heroes movie's were against them instead of only Thor's enemy and robots."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"It was OK, but not it exceeded my expectations, now to wait the second part"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,The best!!!!!!!!! Loved the Avengers!!!!!!
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,love iron man as usual. some of movie was not as good as it was hyped up to be.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"si no me la tomo enserio: es una gran pelicula, los personajes son muy buenos y encantadores, los momentos comicos esta muy bien utilizados y tiene un carisma enorme el personaje de hulk.

si me la tomo enserio: la historia es muy obvia pero se justifica con facilidad, muy cargada de efectos pero bien aprovechados, los personajes son el gran poder de esta pelicula y es lo que motiva a verla. me gusto auque no haya visto ninguna pelicula anteriormente de estos personajes y al igual, no me agradan las peliculas de superheroes, pero tiene mi respeto como una pelicula taquillera."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Excellent superhero movie.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie ever...... Must see if you havent seen it yet.....
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"With a promising collection of great action heroes and a plot though meatier, it never messes with the power of great heroes, but to the greatness and magnum opus created this is surely a popcorn action film. Watch out for Hulk smash! B"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"A solid outcome after mostly lackluster introductory movies (save for 'Iron Man'). The script is decent, though it relies more on humorous dialogue than an enticing story. Whedon is smart to make RDJ's Tony Stark the centerpiece and while this reduces some others to stereotyped bit parts, Ruffalo breathes much-needed life into the Hulk character. Action in the final battle is a bit overwhelming, but the visual presentation is sharp and discernible. A frenzied, yet entertaining, theme park ride."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,laugh out loud when I saw the scene of Hulk being angry
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"If you're a fan of comics,  you're gonna salivate all over this one :-)"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Best movie of all time, completelly EPIC!!!"
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is a great movie, that' brings together four separate franchises with four separate leading actors each with an established career and egos could have gone terribly wrong for Marvel if just one of those egos got too big to control. But Joss Whedon managed to unify the ensemble and they bang it out of the park. The movie starts off with a bang and never lets up, the only thing keeping this from a perfect score are a few minor conveniences that  take away from the seriousness of the situation and the lack of a better score. It's a great time to be had and a fun time for all ages as the Avengers assemble in a grandiose way."
"Jul 28, 2012",negative,"I admit, I did have a bit to drink before this movie and then fell sleep during the showing, so I'm not entirely sure this counts. But it has good reviews so my little shitty one shouldn't hinder it. If I didn't have so many glasses of wine I might have stayed awake. The characters looked a bit faggy, but there was some chest hair so it gets points for that."
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,A good super hero movie... and not much more than that.
"Jul 28, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year! Better than the Dark Knight Rises in my opinion
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,As a comic book fan I enjoyed this. I got real excited when they formed on the screen together. This was a fans dream.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!! Seen it 8 times and will see it several more before the dvd can be added to my movie shelf.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,i love this movie. best marvel movie yet :)
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,best movie in the entire world! would deffinatly see it again. Cant wait for it to come out on dvd
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"So amazingly executed! It still amazes me that one director could bring all these characters from all different films, in to one film and still remain very true to the backing stories of these characters from the other films in. Which they starred in. Although a little dull in some places, those dull moments were in deed needed to take place in the actual film, otherwise it would've been another blow out super hero film that's only way to entertain it's audience is to show massive explosions. The actors played their roles amazingly and I very much like the Hulk in this film. As well as Tom Hiddlestons Loki. What an actor he has become! I still want to see this film one last time, even though I saw it in the cinema/theatre 5 times..."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Absolutely amazing. The effects are awesome, the fights are killer, and the characters are so badass! Only thing we're missing: MORE HULK!"
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Late on this review, but WHEN is this going to be out on DVD?!?!?!"
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"What a breathtaking, unstoppable force that throws hero after hero at you in a crafty, entertaining way. Though Joss Whedon's plot seems a bit weak, per usual, it still works, passing by with a stellar script and excellent performances from the superhero cast."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Marvel has made the best movie ever! Action and humor combined so seamlessly and everyone did a great job! Hulk was fantastic! Definately gonna see it in theaters again!
"Jul 27, 2012",negative,"Esto se tendria que llamarse ""Ironman and friends"" o ""Ironman 3"" es mas para un publico infantil. Lindos los efectos pero no está al nivel de The Dark Knight Rises.  TDKR es otra pelicula mayor que no se puede comparar con esta de superamigos."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Movie with lots of breaks that could be contained with more action instead of talking gibberish so that you end up distracted by silly things in their midst! But what makes this film being good is the excellent performance by Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johasson as Bruce / Hulk and Black Widow. The jokes of Tony Stark and the evil Loki. But nothing that is worthy of five stars
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!!! My only problems are hawkeye is hypnotyzed through most of the movie and hulk is barely in the movie.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Best superhero/comic movie ever made. Marvel fans rejoice!
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Really entertaining.  Good for all ages.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Still a bit sour about Whedon doing the Avengers instead of X-Men. But this is still like -- WOW.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Even though it's rushed, cheesy and it lacks one serious bad guy named Thanos, Marvel supersedes all detractors with another good ol' blockbuster."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"GREAT movie. A comic book bigger than life, with humor, morality, and a lesson for us all. A great couple of hours, and money very well spent. Thanks, Marvel. 
A must-see for any one who enjoys seeing heroes overcome the odds and toss evil out on its a**!"
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,One of the top 5 superhero movies of all time carried by Robert Downey Jrs performance and surprisingly not hurt by Mark Rufflos
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Absolutely fantastic movie!!
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Absolutely outstanding film. It didn't take itself too seriously which I think helped move the film along nicely while lending to the complexities of the characters. You'd think hot heads would collide more but the way Joss Whedon blends everything together just runs perfectly. Very funny, fast paced, and all together incredibly entertaining."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,The visual-effects is a masterpiece by itself. But I believe it's the well-constructed build-up to the film that provided that strong delivery throughout it's allotted time. It's colorful characters/stars and strong chemistry erects the film to a height bigger than any superhero or group of superheroes combined. Avengers indeed assembled and it's outstanding. 4.5/5
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,saw it when it first came out of but never rated it.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Excellent! Action from beginning to end. 3D made it even sweeter.
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was an okay movie. I thought the best thing about the movie were the characters the Hulk and Iron man. Everyone else just did not have much to do especially Hawkeye and Captain America. I also thought the fight scenes with the the Avengers and Loki's army was too unrealistic. I was really disappointed in how Loki was easily defeated. Loki started out very strong, but was dismantled in two seconds by the Hulk with no retaliation. I thought the story line was simple."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Someone told me this was the new Avengers movie - No Patrick Macnee, no Gareth Hunt and no Joanna Lumley."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"Fun movie, not great but fun :) Hulk smashing was hilarious"
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"love marvel movies, adding this one to my collection!"
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"One star off for recastings, Hawkeye's lack of costume, and Captain America's mask."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,It was good... a little bit over rated...but good!
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,"It's not perfect by any means, but it captures the essence of my favourite superheroes that I can SO relate - especially the Hulk (I would like to smash something too if I get that angry). Seen it six times and can't wait for the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jul 27, 2012",positive,Too much adventure scenes with our favorite heroes .Also there are some funny scenes which are very succesful.VOTE:9/10
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,AWESOME GO SEE EVERYBODY!!!
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Best movie ever made
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,FINALLY! A movie where the stars/heroes from previous movies come together and don't...well suck!
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Great movie it was awesome.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Action, comedy, drama, suspense, and Hulk smash. What more do you need?"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"loved it, awesome movie"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Fun movie! Liked it a lot more than I thought I would.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,It was amazing. Didnt even notice time pass by. Definetly worth a watch if not more!!!
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Best superhero action film to date
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,excellent film quand on croit que l action est fini elle recommence
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Outside of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, particularly The Dark Knight, I can't think of a single superhero movie that was nearly so engaging, so beautifully continuing what was previously set up, and just so darn awesome as this one. Best movie ticket I ever bought."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Best Marvel movie I've ever seen, but doesn't come close to outshining Batman."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! Robert Downey, Jr.'s Iron Man aka Tony Stark is the heart and soul of this film. But I found myself really liking the other main players as well including Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk. Saw it multiple times and can't wait until it is on home video! I need my daily Tony Stark Snark Fix!"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,I loved this movie. It was perfect from beginning to end.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,I got confused. They messed everything up with a lot of characters from different moviesâ?¦ But it's also so so so funny. The funny guys deserves four stars. Loved the movie.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Klassefilm! Action nonstop, fede oneliners og... Scarlett Johansson"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"The Avengers has a special script included with action and humor, and its director knows distribute masterfully time and the importance of each character"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,This was one of the best movies I have ever seen!!!
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,This is popcorn Entertainment at its highest this movie got it all. Great action scenes very funny script and a fast foward pacing not to mention all the great performences. The hulk rocks
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,the avengers is by far the best marvel movie ever and the dark knight wont be able to beat it
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Well, well, well what a pleasant surprise. Any film that tries to re-introduce the word 'quim' into every-day usage deserves three stars. Any film with Harry Dean Stanton gets a star by default. And I'm giving it an extra half-star because I can't remember the last time I had so much fun in a cinema. Ridiculous, overblown, nonsensical fun that has its tongue firmly in cheek but also slyly subverts the superhero genre - which is not so surprising since Joss Whedon is at the helm. I have never been a fan of his - his characters usually annoy the shit out of me and his tendency to make every single line of dialogue a comedic gem gets on my nerves - but hats off to him here, this is a brilliant film that cracked me up on multiple occasions and ticked all the right boxes. 

It takes a lot to get me to watch a CGI-fest but this did the trick in spades. One of my films of the year so far!"
"Jul 26, 2012",negative,"definitely not my franchise at all, but I guess the effects were good."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Iron Man! Need me to say anything else?
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,without the conic relief it would not have been as good as the hype
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"what can I say, this is an absolute must see movie!!"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"This has to be one of the best full-throttle action movies! 
And the HULK steals the show!"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"An entertaining movie whose job was made considerably easier by a great cast of characters. Admittedly, to balance their screen time while advancing the plot must've been a challenge, and everything was pretty tightly scripted but, at the end of the film, it was all just light entertainment. Good, but I suppose TDK trilogy had me wanting more. Of course, the film was also better because I felt like I was getting four movies for the price of one, but I digress."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"If there was more stars, i would've given it way more. Great movie period."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"The kids and I really enjoyed this one.  It really was concerned about having this much ""star power"" that they just wouldn't gel as a cast but they did very well.  It was worth the wait and looking forward to the next one.

While it's not a complaint on Mark Ruffalo, I would've loved to have seen Ed Norton as the Hulk. Also laughed at the scene with Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno.  While the kids knew who Stan Lee is .. had to explain the humon with Ferrigno and after showing them a picture, they thought it was hilarious."
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Love the actor who played Hulk.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Hands down the best Comic Book movie of all-time, There is no competition. Click below for a full review
http://jandjproductions1809.blogspot.com/2012/05/avengers-review.html"
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Great movie. A great sense of action and personality and a nice twist with the death of ""The Agent."""
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,I enjoyed the movie.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Another grey adventure !!!
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,If you're expecting something like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight franchise I will tell you to look elsewhere. If you are looking to be thoroughly entertained and get some laughs from some of your superhero favorites then you have come to the right place. Second-best super hero flick of the summer. An definitely better than all of the characters respective movies that make up The Avengers.
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,Fabulous fun! They are all heroes :-)
"Jul 26, 2012",positive,"Good Entertainment. I am glad they made the money they spent. Won't deny enjoying the screen presence of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, and gool old Rob Downey Jr. Hemsworth I didn't care for much in this movie and was glad to not have watched Thor. Johansson was an actor I used to like but now her screen presence entertains me only slightly. The costume designers could have done better I feel and what I detested the most- the newfound fascination with India. There is so many of them spread all out. Getting tips shouldn't be difficult even if it is for a few scenes!"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,best movie of the year. saw it twice
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Freaking great... live iron man n hulk thing going on and sexy Thor yummy!!!!!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,The Avengers is one of the best super hero movies of all time the acting the action scenes and some funny parts to the line that Captain America says to the Hulk which is Hulk smash that was a good line and the part where Thor tries to hit Captain America with his hammer and he (Captain America) with stood it with his shield now that was funny and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is what i like to call a bonus
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Marvel's Avengers has something not a lot of movies have, and that is balance. There are some scenes that will having laughing hard followed by some scenes that will blow you away with it's explosions. Each super hero gets their moment to shine. Even Agent Coulson gets his time to shine. But the true scene stealer is the Hulk. The story is the movie's only fault, borrowing the plots of the other movies and feels less interesting than the characters in the film. This is still an exciting and enjoyable super hero expierence."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"funny, yet not as epic as was expected"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,they have done it again! love this movie.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"This film was made very well. Outstanding writing, outstanding directing and acting. I loved every comedic moment and every action sequence. Was villain, Loki was great, and I loved how each Avenger reacted off of each other. 
Some things to nit pick, like how the Hulk conviently ""Learned"" how to control his anger"" at the end, when earlier in the movie he went on a rampage. Yeah. Nice control.

But other than that, great film

9.5/10: Masterpiece"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Action packed from beginning to end
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but it's not in the same class as Xmen First Class."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie there is.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Nothing new, nothing special, same as the ending of Dark of the Moon and the Phantom Menace, The Avengers movie is for dumb people"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Exactly what fans wanted to see, while still leaving an opening for more to come"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"it was an ok movie, was expecting more"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Cool big fan of hulk.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"A wonderful action packed, well cast, well scripted, non-stop ride!  Despite the fact I had yet to watch any of the superhero films (for any of the characters featured in this film) that came before and were referenced within the film, I still didn't feel I had missed too much.  This says a lot for the film's writers and the director.  Often in movie franchises you miss large plot turns and twists along the way when even one film goes unseen, in this case I didn't really feel that at all, and I had missed them all!  I really think this is a film that could be enjoyed by everyone, no matter their gender or age, it has something for everyone.  I recommend this one, superhero fanatic or not."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,proud to be a Marvel fan
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,This rating is based on what the movie is: a blockbuster action super hero movie for all ages. It is exactly that and absolutely amazing at being that!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,N'est MovieTalk of yearling !
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,This one I will buy.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,A complete blast. It's impossible not to sit back and enjoy the ride.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever made.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Oh. My. God. This movie is hilarious, dramatic, scary, action packed.....there are not enough words, or praise, that I can give the avengers. If you had been following all of marvel's heroes (especially Thor ;) then you will not be disappointed. Marvel does a fantastic job of wrapping the heroes all together seamlessly. Every time I think of that movie I still get excited. It's like Christmas every time...you will never get tired of it."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"amazing superheros, good story, action, comedy...what's not to love?"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,awsome movie. just the way they done it was amazing.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Though at first I viewed this movie as another hollywood fad to drive more comic book related films into the limelight. I must admit, Im not an overly huge fan of comic book films ( Iron Man and Chris Nolan directed ones excluded!!) When I watched this I was pleasantly surprised to really quite enjoy this film, its very cleverly done usually when you have this array of characters in one film, it tends to either be a bit long and tedious whilst the director is trying to develop every characters individual emotional backdrop or it tends to do the opposite whereas one character has the main limelight and you're left wondering what is the point of having all the other characters there. This one treads the background story lightly and works rather quite well. Obviously, I check a lot of films out on flixster before I see them (I try not to because its can change my opinion). With this film it feels like it has been a tad bit over-rated on my books, like I said though im not a huge fan of comic book films, but to me this film should be a standard of comic book films rather than treating it as a masterpiece. The main reason why I feel like this is because there is nothing outstanding about it and there is nothing that is overtly different about it, essentially if you have seen all the previous marvel films leading up to this, it is a fairly similar theme and setting. There is little extra to take from this film, the only thing I can think of that kinda separates it apart is the ""free-for-all"" royal rumble element to it, where several superheros are beating the s**t out of each it, though quite a satisfying viewing :)! First things first, is that the acting in this is quite cool. Robert Downey Jr is awesome and smarmy/cocky best, just like in the Iron Man film which I rate highly. Sometimes I feel like the reason why I enjoyed this film so much is because of Downey's demanding presence and he is quite a central character as well, he has a lot of screen time. Samuel Jackson plays his role quite well albeit nothing too different from his usual Samuel role: Theres a great quote in this film which highlights this (no context needed) ""Nick Fury - That's a stupid-ass plan! Give my team time!"" I thought that was very typical Samuel and rather funny. I think though the rest of the avengers were played quite well and it felt seamless, I give a lot credit for Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I enjoyed Edward Norton's portrayal in the Incredible Hulk, I was unsure what angle of which that Mark Ruffalo would approach it, it worked rather nicely I thought as the calm but decidely instant mood-swing manner that he had. The Villian in this ""Loki"" was a very well portrayed by Tom Hiddleston he was a very cool, hell-bent character that seem to start of invincible and the end up laughable. It was a nice villian character to have as most comic book villians tend to be laughable but insane at the very beginning and remain that way, but with Loki it was a nice and charismatic character to have. One other point which I couldn't work out and I'd like people that comment me on this! When I went to the cinema to see altough it was a cardboard cut out poster, I saw that Cobie Smulders was in it and whilst watching the film she had quite a bit of screen time, generally it would be a reaction shot or quick sentence or two speaking to Nick Fury. It struck me a bit odd because her role was not that essential to film and it was not as if she was well known character, I thought that the amount of screen time she had was a bit too much for her importance in the film. It just struck as something that Im not sure if it was just me that noticed or maybe she has got an important role, I don't know :))) At the end of the day though, What Joss Whedon has done with this film is very clever and although prehaps not a ""special"" film it is certainly a great film and shows that with a clever script, direction and actors you can have a lot of characters in one film and not make a meal of it (Just look at ""The Watchmen""!)"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,best movie I ever seen
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Hilarious, intense, heartful, entertaining and never boring. The Avengers is everything a suphero movie should be, and it marks for the best superhero and action movie ever known to man"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"I am writing this about a month after I saw the film.  Having just seen The Dark Knight Rises, I can have to say this takes second place to that movie.  If I could speak about this movie before I saw TDKR I would say it was the best movie of the summer.  I was kind of afraid to see them mash up all these people from some movies that ran the gamut from entertaining to a bust but they really did a great job.  It was an epic film and everything seemed to meld well.  I would recommend going to see this in the theater.  Robert Downey is generally portrayed as an arrogant but loveable jerk.  This quality is amalgamated and made even better by the compliment of the other actors in this film.  It was very entertaining as it was suspenseful, very funny, action packed, with a well developed plot.  
I would say that the avengers is the summer movie, but maybe it was the spring movie.  Really good, go see it and but the dvd when it comes out. 
Also they didn't screw up the hulk which seems to be the default for all hulk movies.  
Capt. Ammurkia was like the least super of the super heros.  Still his presence was noticed and added to the movie.
Hawk eye and ninja girl...well their not so super.  No super suit, No super green stuff going on, no super godness, and no super duper patriotism, but again, their presence was noticed. 
I really should have written this review after I saw the film..."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"This was definitely the hit of the summer.  After a 5+ year, 5 film build-up, The Avengers delivers on all fronts.  Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston had performances that stole the movie.  Joss Whedon, who I seriously had my doubts about, directed this movie with sheer flawlessness.  A must-see, must-own movie."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"So far the best movie of 2012, nuff said."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"It was an okay movie. It was interesting and it kept you entertained. Still, it's not a movie that will be remembered. Maybe that's why you have to see it so many times. To actually keep it in your memory. Seeing as so many people have seen it over and over again, but for me, it's not a movie that I would watch more than once. Although I enjoyed it the first time."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,AWSOME! Loved it- loved loki. Films have got a lot to live up to!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Can't wait for the next one
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Nothing to complain about. Great movie, no holes, and done in a reasonable time (No offense Batman)"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Really really good and I'm not a huge fan of all the super hero flicks, some really funny scenes as well"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Visually stunning, wonderful acting, great plot. The Avengers has everything that makes up a great super hero movie. Joss Whedon is finally getting the recognition that he deserves as this masterpiece is truly a credit to his thus far under appreciated genius."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Great job, Joss Whedon."
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,All your favorite marvel heroes team up for this awesome blockbuster movie.
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,A tad overhyped and not as good as I hoped it would be. Downey steals the show AGAIN!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,Nonstop action and suprisingly funny!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"The traditional summer super hero movie, just a lot of punches,large explosions, and hulk smashing. it was pretty good, but I don't see why it got such a big hype. I mean it was cool to see a lot of your favorite super heroes fighting together but it wasn't that special to me"
"Jul 25, 2012",positive,"Good movie, couldve been better"
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Great movie! Keep them coming :)
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Fun!  There were never really any stakes as to any characters not surviving, but still, fun!"
"Jul 24, 2012",neutral,Fun to see everyone together. But if your going to hype everyone with teasers through 5 other Marvel movies you better try harder to cover up those plot holes....
"Jul 24, 2012",negative,Lame story. Watching re-run of any X-Men movie is infinitely more entertaining.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Would have been the super hero movie of the year had it not been for Dark Knight, none the less this was an awesome movie!!"
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Action packed and star studded movie. Not the best plot but who cares with all the action packed and humor filled scenes.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!! ;)
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,good movie! lots of action
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"A fun action packed smash. If you haven't seen Thor, then watch it on blu ray before watching The Avengers."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,This is my favorite action movie but where's spider man!!!
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Amazing Avengers, that's all I gotta say."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Now that was a great movie!!!!
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Good fun, but thought Scarlett Johansson character little pointless aside from her in that catsuit."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Great flick, gonna get that dvd in blu-ray!For the kid in all of us."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Might just be the greatest Superhero movie ever made.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,A must see movie!!! Funny at times and a lot of action.... Loved it
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Great story, great acting, great action.  and in most other summer's, would be considered the best film. #DarkKnightRises"
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"""TheAvengers"" has everything you want from a comicbook movie, great action, great preformances, and masterfully written. Whedon really did a good job fleshing out not just the main cast but the entire supporting cast as well. Marvel studios proves that if you take your time with each character, get a writer and director who is passionate about the material and knows the material well enough to juggle around a juggernaut of a cast, you end up with one hell of a movie. Take out your note pads people at DC comics."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"A wonderful, witty, superhero movie. Generic at times, but I loved the call-back to an actual 70s comic book style."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Doesn't deserve 5 Stars next to Dark Knight Rises and Amazing Spiderman, but it was good. Entertaining. Good characters."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Absolutely stellar. Years worth of individual movies culminates in a veritable extravaganza of pure geek indulgence. A triumph in its own way.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"Perfectly done. Fun, action packed, and nails the characters like no film has before."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"The best superhero movie ever made. It has it all plus so much more. This movie quite brilliantly ties all the ""prequels"" (Thor, Iron Man 1-2, Hulk and Captain America) together. This is a text book example how to please the movie goers. Looking forward to new ""prequels"" and of course, Avengers 2."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,If ot want for hulk and ironman it would have not made it.....
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"I love love loved it! Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, & (my personal favorite) Ironman all together in one movie - how can you go wrong?"
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"It's big, it's loud, and it's awesome.  The Avengers is certainly an exiting movie.  With plenty of wit and sarcasm to satisfy even the most deprived watcher.  Joss Whedon  has done it again."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"The '12 summer movie season certainly started off with a bang thanks to ""Marvel's The Avengers"" (also given the horrible title ""Avengers Assemble"" in the UK).
Directed by Joss Whedon, ""The Avengers"" is the tale Marvel fans have been dreaming of since ""Iron Man"" hinted at the idea many years ago. Now, that dream has come into fruition, and what we have here is some exceptional popcorn entertainment.
The story is simple: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) needs a team. A team of heroes far greater than the world has ever seen to stop an angry Loki (Tom Hiddleston)  from taking the world into his grasp. So what does Mr. Fury do? He assembles Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), & The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) to bring about justice to the innocent citizens of...well, planet Earth. At first glance, I wasn't too impressed by the story; with Loki being the key villain, I knew going in that this hero team-up would take more from the ""Thor"" movie than any of the previous Marvel movies. But alas, this simplicity is ""The Avengers"" secret weapon. By making the story line so basic, Whedon & co-writer Zak Penn accomplished 2 things, that being they 1.) Made it basic enough for youngsters watching to get the gist of it, and 2.) allowed more time for the characters to ramble amoungst themselves, and grow into the team that they ultimately have to become by the end of the movie in order to save the world.
This 2nd point leads into what I enjoyed most about ""Avengers"". The heart of the movie to some may be the action, yes, but to me what made this movie so effective in it's inherent awesomeness was being able to sit back and watch some of the greatest super heroes ever created argue with one another. Yeah, to me some of the best scenes were not the combat (because to be honest the aliens or whatever they were fighting looked about as good as something on Sci-Fi channel), but the scenes of dialogue. The Avengers had to overcome two obstacles in this movie, annihilation of the planet, and themselves; the latter of the two being what I enjoyed most.
Captain America really shined at the end of the movie; I loved how for majority of the time he was doing his best to work with the team, by way of being humble. Eventually however, he had to put on the mantle of being a true captain and lead his team out into the field.
Iron Man, on the other hand, was probably the most annoying of the entire team. I understand that part of Iron Man's appeal is his lack of empathy and arrogance to anyone who isn't as rich as he is, but there were times when I thought to myself, ""Wow, he really needs to shut up"". That being said, this is my second favorite performance of Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, with my favorite being the original ""Iron Man"".
Black Widow and Hawkeye seemed pointless at first, but surprised me by being thoroughly entertaining. I just wish that they would've had a little more personality; compared to Cap, Thor, Iron Man, & Hulk, they really aren't that charismatic.
Thor was easily my 2nd favorite hero out of the bunch (Cap being 1st for his ""God"" line and sincere desire for justice). You can definitley see that Hemsworth really understands his character now that he has played him in two movies. Thor appealed to me because of his emotional ties to the villain, Loki, who is also his brother.
The Hulk was tremendously fun to watch bounce around and punch bad guys right where it hurts. There is a gag between him and Loki that had the entire theater roaring with laughter. This Hulk is great and is the way Hulk should look, act, and sound. They finally got the giant CGI blob of green rage right on film.
Loki, was to say the least, a villain that acted as if he had great intentions with his plan against the world, but deep down still was unable to get over what happened between him and his family in the first ""Thor"" movie. Loki was a delight on screen; snobby, confident, and a bit more sinister. Loki could potentially be one the great movie villains in later Marvel movies.
Overall, ""The Avengers"" was an absolute blast. I had a few things to nit-pick, but nothing that seriously damaged the integrity of the film.
A lot of people, including myself, were skeptical about a super hero team-up movie being done well. Those fears have been laid to rest thanks to Whedon and Co., ""The Avengers"" was everything it promised to be and more.
Phase 1 of Marvel's motion pictures is complete.
And let me tell you, it has been a joy watching it all come together.

"Jul 24, 2012",positive,It was a pretty awesome movie.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,One of the best movies this year! I liked everyone in it. They pulled everyone together nicely. I'm still lost about Hot Guy and Black Widow..
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Absolutely awesome. Full on bad ass movie! Can't wait for the sequel!
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"A really great movie, Robert Downey Jr., does a really good job of adding a comic roll to this action movie."
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,Definitely met expectations!
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,"It was a great movie, team work was good, action was good. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie."
"Jul 24, 2012",negative,This is a real delight. Fun filled flick. It's so entertaining that you won't even mind if the guy sitting in the front of you farts on your face.
"Jul 24, 2012",neutral,This movie is good but highly overrated. They could have done so much more with it. Just a bunch of one-liners and cgi. It's pretty much iron man 3 featuring a bunch of black widow character development. It is directed great but the plot sucks. I don't see how some people like this better than TDKR.
"Jul 24, 2012",positive,It's just another uninspiring explosion fest. That's it.  No heart. No soul. No Nothing.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,What more can be said? The perfect pop corn comic book flick.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,What more can be said? The perfect pop corn comic book flick.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Best movie ever.I can not wait for the next one
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,I can watch super heroes for the rest of my life. This is the perfect culmination!
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"A very nice movie, full with action packed scenes and all the major super heros share screen time evenly."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,What are you waiting for? Go watch it!
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,I really like this movie. Very well done.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"""Holy Crap on a Cracker!!!"" Best...superhero...movie...ever!!! Joss you rock! Now that I've seen Dark Knight only one movie stands a chance to beat The Avengers for best movie of the year when we go back to the Shire. We will see but Avengers has heart, soul, action - everything. Luuuuuv."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"funny adventurer the cast is wonderful
but I enjoyed the last 45 minutes the most"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever made
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,It was good but it was very predictable.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"It's certainly entertaining, I'm just not sure if I want to see movies on individual characters after this, especially Thor and Captain America..."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Great culmination of the Marvel Universe...Well done and leaving us wanting and expecting much more......Great Marketing
"Jul 23, 2012",negative,"Unfortunately, not for my taste. Too flat and with an emphasis put on special effects it is only another blockbuster made to earn the big bucks. The dialogues are witty and funny at times, but that's all."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,First action packed comedy with a group of hero's!
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,An awesome Marvel team-up bad ass movie
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"This is a fantastic film by marvel. The one thing that slightly disappointed me was that spider man was not included in this film. However, because of the constant action in this film, i dont see how they would have fitted him into it all. It is a very good film and a must see for all marvel fans."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"99% of crossover movies usually suck. Thankfully, Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is in that 1%. In fact, it is Marvel's most successful movie to date. Joss Whedon hasn't had many box-office smashes, until now. Being a comic book nerd himself, Whedon knew what was best for this film. Robert Downey Jr.'s narcissistic Tony Stark plays the perfect leader for the Avengers' Initiative. Chris Evans is the perfect opposite for Robert Downey Jr. Evans plays Steve Rogers AKA Captain America, the old, yet loyal counterpart to Downey's young, and condescending Iron Man. The Hulk has always been a difficult role in cinema. When Ang Lee brought the superhero to the big screen in 2003, it opened to mixed reviews. It was improved back in 2008, when Edward Norton was brought in. Since Norton couldn't sign on for this movie, Ruffalo became the angered Bruce Banner. He was subject to much skepticism, because no one seemed to believe he was up for the part. Contrary to popular belief, he was the most favorable Hulk yet. Not to forget Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, who didn't get as much screen time as the others, but did an excellent job. Also, Hawkeye and Black Widow, played by Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson, respectively, were superb superheroes, along with the clear sexual tension between them. Along with Tom Hiddleston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson, and Cobie Smulders, the ensemble cast was perfect for this epic movie.
All in all, this movie's financial success speaks for itself when it comes to reviewing it."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"really food and fun movie.  Nothing out of the ordinary in terms of storyline, but the filmmakers did a great job of establishing all the characters (even though most of us know them) and their relationships with each other.  A very fun, and at times funny, film. A definite must see!"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Great Movie to begin the Summer season
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie yet.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Everything you want a super hero movie to be. Bravo Joss.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Good but not Amazing...
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Thin on plot, think on action.  Mind-numbing entertainment."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"This movie played it ""safe"", but in doing so successfully set up great movies to come! Well made and I can't wait for the next one!"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"very good, action and ending was spectacular, but for me personally, didn't have enough substance or emotion to make it a fantastic movie. Still is great and my second favorite marvel movie behind the first iron man"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"The best movie to date based on a Marvel property.  Filled with action, suspense and comedy it is everything that a comic book movie should be and is the epitome of a summer blockbuster.  The effects were seamless and as a whole the movie looked fantastic at the IMAX 3D screening I was at.  Joss Whedon and the rest of the creative team did a great job building a both a coherent story and a believable reason for these characters to come together.  Each character was given just the right amount of screen time and with no one of them monopolizing the action or laughs (though again Downey slips perfectly into the skin of Tony Stark).  The future is bright for this franchise and with most of the stars signed to a 3 picture deal there is little doubt The Avengers will assemble again."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Awesome, epic, and funny! One of the best superhero movies ever!"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Simply Awesome, Couldn't be any better"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Marvel's, ""The Avengers"" was exactly what I imagine it was intended to be: a very fun movie.  While the story lacked depth, it pulled off the very difficult task of uniting four of the biggest names in comics without it feeling like one overshadowed the others.  The action scenes were fantastic."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Can easily watch it over and over again!
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"The Avengers 2012
Directed by Joss Whedon.
5 out of 5 Stars *****
Outstanding!
Well Worth the Wait and the Hype!
When Loki threatens the Earth, Sam Jackson assembles the Hulk, Iron Man, and World Weary Living Legend Captain America to save the Day in the Finest Marvel Film since Last Years Captain America ( which in many ways was better even than This ), the Film is Action packed and Filled with Humor.
PROS, The Banter between the Heroes is the star of the Film.
CONS, boring intro and Opening, an Alien Threat that isn't so Threatening?.
VERDICT, the Avengers is a MUST See!
everyone had their doubts, but Marvel has Delivered their answer to DC's The Dark Knight.
and while the Avengers is pure popcorn cheese compared to Christopher Nolans 2008 Masterpiece, it works an an entirely different level, the Avengers doesn't try to make you Think, its just wants you to sit back and have Fun.
well done Marvel, Well Done."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,What more can I say baby!!!
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Surprisingly well balanced with so many heroes, it is exciting, ambitious and has the perfect mix of humor. It is easily apparent that Joss Wheadon knows these characters better than the other Marvel movie directors. Finally, someone was able to hit the nail on the big green head of âThe Hulk"" on the big screen!"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,I am waiting it in bluray
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Amazing Movie suggested to all Marvel fans and even someone who ha seen the other movies. Just pure amazing.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,glad I watched it on the big screen ... never a dull moment.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Huh, al right, but couldn't really see what all the fuss was about"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"The fact that they could that actually exceeded expectations of the build up for the AVENGERS movie is just unbelievable, but they really did. Awesome, awesome movie. Along side the Batman Trilogy, Iron Man Movies, and X-men 2. This is hands down one of the greatest comic movies of all time."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,Probably the best superhero movie of all time.
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,The Best Movie of the year. #1
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"Enjoyable film, and exactly what you expect from a Whedon film. However, this breaks away from how several of the characters were built up in their previous movies, and detracts from the entire film in my view."
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,"was good in some parts,not so in some. but overall,it drags a bit and suffers from the 3D,Acting was the saving grace of this film. The story maybe easy to follow,but is loose and dull in many points.things stretch on without anything happening at times and bores at times. overall,average one for me"
"Jul 23, 2012",positive,It's was a good movie marvel keep true to the comic and the earths mighest Heros formed the team that stopped Loki and the evil planes he had for earth. Everyone was great the hulk could have been just alittle better but his little fight with Loki now that was the funniest thing in the movie. Can't wait from the second avengers to come out in a couple of years after iron man 3 captain America 2 and Thor 2 can't wait summer next years heating up already avengers assemble.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Enjoyed the movie. I've been waiting to see all of them together.  Good comedy spots In there! Over All Good! ;) I WANNA see it Agaaaaaaain! Cool!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Sickest movie ever! Tons of action!!!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This years best movie with a 96% audience like it easily beating out Spiderman and Batman
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,pretty much the best movie ever!!!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This is how you do a superhero action movie.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,It was pretty good but I'm not that into super hero's
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movie ever!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"I wish Joss Whedon would learn how to write female characters. Otherwise, fun movie."
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Loved the humor, Whedon should assist in all the marvel movies from now on!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,I thought that this movie could be bad with so many heroes all having the same amount of time in the movie. With the exception of Iron Man having the spotlight for a little bit more but who would complain with Robert Downey Jr. This movie worked so well together and the action scenes were suburb.
"Jul 22, 2012",negative,"The visuals in The Avengers are impressive, but when ever I go to the Cinema, I look for more than CGI, and CGI was mostly what The Avengers was to me. I dont see what all the fuss is behind this movie, the story is weak, as is the case with all of Marvel's latest films. Theres trouble, then comes the hero, and finally the eye candy! There was no meaning and no emotion, the dialogue was cheesy, unfunny, and just plain bad. In the end its just another mindless money making machine from Marvel. This is probably the most over-hyped, and irritating movie i have ever had the displeasure of seeing. 2/5"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Great movie all around. The producers pulled the plot lines of all of the movies together almost perfectly.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This and TDRK have been the best movies of the year.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Avengers lagged little in drama but it compensated all in action sequences in movie.Though it  lives up its expectation and fulfill fans.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Smashing! Just smashing! (British accent)
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Can't wait for number 2!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Seriously, who doesn't like this film? SERIOUSLY???"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Loved it soooooo much I paid twice to see it in theaters.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Great film that's all I say a must see for any marvel fan
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Excellent. Best of the year
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"This movie had everything. Action, story and humor. Can't wait for bluray!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"great movie with a perfect balance of everything,action,comedy,great story and great acting performances,its anear master piece for me"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Awesome, at last they got hulk right...."
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Best one yet...I want to see it again, but I don't want to pay again. LOL"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Best movie ever made!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Action packed and very good!! Two thumbs WAY up!!!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Espectacular. Lo mejor que ha hecho Marvel hasta nuestros dÃ­as.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"MARVELous <3... this is perfect, great movie, nice fights and special effect... and the greatest thing was the actors; they're the same of the individuals movie adventures!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Absolutely Amazing.. Did not think a movie with so many characters and elite actors would be decent.  Boy, was I wrong.  Avengers is definitely in my top ten!!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Although I saw Marvels Avengers earlier this year; I waited until The Dark Knight Rises to debut in theaters before rating The Avengers. Now for the moment of truth. After seeing what the Dark Knight had to deliver; I still have to give over all power and impact to the Avengers. All the years of waiting this movie to take the world by storm have paid off! The key to the whole movie believe it our not...This is the first movie to get The Hulk right. Yes big green sole the show in all the right places. In fact everyone stole the show. Somehow this movie managed to incorporate every character in this movie without overshadowing anyone.I'm totally sold on this being the biggest summer movie in decades.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie ever!! I loved it!!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Exceeded expectations in ever way imaginable. Some of the best lines I've heard in a movie in a very long time.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,not as good as everyone said it was
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"So you go in thinking oh okay I liked Iron Man, I liked Captain America, Thor was okay, good thing that old hulk is gone! Then you start this movie! It. Is. Bloody. Brilliant! The movie keeps you on the edge of your seats while also keeping you amazed with beautiful eye candy splendor and smart comedic swipes at your face! The movie follows a cliche plot with very cliche characters but the chemistry and interactions pays off. It is so much fun to watch and enjoy! It also makes reference to classic comic books and tv shows and old movies! It is entertainment and good enterta"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Best Movie of the Year!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This movie was sweet
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Best fun I've had watching a movie in a looooong time :)
"Jul 22, 2012",neutral,"Just seemed a little too cheesy and ""Hollywood"" to me :/"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Awesome movie I loved it Burt really long
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This was the best action movie I ever saw!!! I saw it in 3D two times!!!!!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"I'm not into comic books at all (I didn't even know who most of these characters were) but this movie is entertaining.  I thought Robert Downey Jr was really good and I like Capt America too.  I thought they could cast better for the Hulk, but it's a good movie."
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"The movie was top notch- start to finish. Kudos to Joss Whedon.

The story was thrilling- the perfromances were excellent and the characters were perfectly placed inside a movie that was bigger than any one of them. The digital Hulk sets the bar for all future digitized characters. Hulk is the first 'real' digital character in movies.

If you don't want to have fun- don't go to this movie. Because fun can't be helped. Superhero movies have juts been given new life."
"Jul 22, 2012",negative,"Not very good, expected so much more!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Loved this movie. Action plus great story line = greatness!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,saw it twice and still buying Bluray when it comes out. great flick
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,It was great.  Much better then I expected.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,It was everything I hope it would be!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,This move us so funny
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"Good popcorn flick, but I was ultimately not invested in any of the characters or the overall story."
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,The best superhero movie i've seen!
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"The grandeur of Hollywood is rather flamboyant this time with the hexa hilarious superhero team - Iron Man, Captain America, The black Widow, Hawkeye and The Hulk .
Apocalypse now for the Earth and here they come together, after much realization though, BANG !!

Iron Man (Robert Downy) Insane, Incorrigible and Incredible. His cheesy one liners swashbuckle with the screenplay to pour out a hefty humor doze .

The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Alluring and Scintillating as ever Scarlett's mind games are freaky and her stunts sublime

Captain America (Chris Evans) is gallant and lucid with his shield shining brighter

Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Hails adroitly with his bow and arrows

Thor (Chris Hemsworth) torn at the altar of relationships, breaks out with a bang. Thor is terrific !

Hulk (Tom Hiddleston) is colossal, magnanimous and sheer protagonist when it comes to adrenaline gushing action. Stands out majestically !

""THE AVENGERS"" is an adrenaline booster !!! Larger than life special effects, cheesy rib tickling one-liners and august action is only gonna leave you applauding for long . Don't Miss it !!"
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,"There's a lot of great things about this film, but I think that the thing that stands out the most is how well everything came together. You have four main leads, a hell of a supporting cast, and a lot of stuff that has been building up from the previous Marvel solo projects. There was ALOT of room for it to go wrong here, it was not easy to balance everything. But not only does The Avengers deliver, it soars to levels that I don't think anyone expected. While in terms of superhero films, I gotta put TDKR on top, but this film is still head and heels above the rest of the competition."
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,Best marvel film so far.
"Jul 22, 2012",positive,A movie which you want to make the heroes to stop talking and just fight
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,A popcorn flick that does everything right. I loved every minute of it. Even the Michael Bay-esque battle at the end.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Want to feel like a kid again? Then you have to see this movie. Once it gets rolling, it doesn't stop!"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Comic book movie done right.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,good action scenes and love the story but would of liked a little more from it
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Best summer movie ever
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"For me this movie had everything. Love, humor, amazing fight scenes, heroes galore, and the hulk being awesome.  This is a movie I will have to buy.  I cannot wait for the next one to come out.  A must see film!"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Action packed, super epic. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and my personal favorite, The Incredible Hulk, all brilliantly brought together by Nick Fury in this adrenaline pumping, humor filled film."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Best movie ever can't wait for part 2
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Besides the cheesy dialogue, poor character arcs, lack of storyline, and the plethora of one liners that fall flat; strong performances by Ruffalo and Hiddleston and for the most part, spectacular special effects, make ""The Avengers"" a worthwhile summer blockbuster."
"Jul 21, 2012",neutral,"superficial and shallow. Its fun... but there is nothing to take away with you other than a 'good time'. That is, If seeing muscly men do cliche things and make swarmy remarks for 2 hours is a good time for you.  I was very underwhelmed."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"great action packed thrill movie, but it tries to force comedy and be too funny during parts that ruin the adrenaline rush viewers feel while watching."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would watch it again
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"A fan boy's wet dream, these Avengers, perfectly cast and in no need of introduction, bring the comic book to life.  Though fairly lighthearted, the film has its serious moments.  The most fun you'll have in a movie for a long time."
"Jul 21, 2012",negative,it was not as good as i thought it would be it seemed extreamly long and the last 45 minutes wouldnt go by. the story seemed like they ripped of transformers 3 and it was way to over hyped. it was good action but nothing else
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Great movie to bring some of the best comic book heroes together. Great fun summer movie.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Excellent entertainment!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Hands down Marvel's best movie. The movie has lots of jokes to break the tension. The vilians were disappointing especially loki. There are lots of flaws.But overall it was a good movie.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Exceed expectations!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Wow this movie is well put together. Great job Disney.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,it was a good movie i would go see it again
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie ever!!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,the ultimate super hero movie!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Good job getting all these characters onto one screen. Should be cool to see where this franchise goes from here...
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"It's a tall order to bring in multiple super-heroes from the same universe with their own vast back-stories, and have them in one film together for the first time, without cutting some of the characters short. Unfortunately, 'Marvel's The Avengers' doesn't fully accomplish this. The script is lacking at times, largely due to the forced humor from the ensemble cast, as well as having numerous action sequences just for the sake of having them with no real anchor to the overall story, not to mention the overload of CGI implemented giving the film a fake and tacky look. Ultimately, Marvel fanboys will no doubt be impressed, possibly being unable to see behind the facade of what really is a giant merchandising vehicle. See you in the endless line of sequels, Avengers."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SAW!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Holy poop on a stick I loved this movie!
"Jul 21, 2012",negative,"While the audience around me in the sold out theater laughed at what they thought to be hilarious dialogue and amazing special effects, I literally laughed at the fact that I was watching nothing more than an overhyped, poorly created cartoon."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,I keep changing the number of stars cause I'm still confused about this movie. Am I the only one who really though that this movie was REALLY overrated?
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Fun movie. Nothing more.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,The Hulk stole the show.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,I couldn't take it seriously enough for five stars. It wasn't personal enough.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Too Awsome to write about, seen it 4 times now."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,The best super hero move of them all.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Really enjoyed the movie. Worried how they would tie the characters and share the spotlight but they pulled it off well. Action was really good and comedy was funny. Can't wait for another.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"The Avengers.......Wow! This film is action packed with moments leaving you thinking you wish you could do that!! Mark Ruffalo and Chris Evans portray there roles brilliantly as well as Robert Downey Jr who provides us with laughs! Thor was my favourite movie before The Avengers but I don't think he got enough screen time in this, which was a disappointment, but overall I love this film and it lives up too its hype! Thank you Joss Whedon!
Star of the Show: Mark Ruffalo"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,My all time fav for multi Heros!

"Jul 21, 2012",positive,AMAZING!!! Totally awesome!!
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"For a movie that had a 5 movie build up,  it had such a big chance of being a major disapointment. Good thing for us a great director was signed and it could very possibly the best super hero/comic movie out there! Great story, great action, great characters! Finally the Hulk was done right"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Moves well.  Fun effects.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"fantastic, best marvel movie to date."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Great movie want to see it again & again
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,The fact that it didn't turn into a huge cluster**** is a work of miracles. That fact that it was awesome is even more so.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Favorite Marvel Hero Movie & comic book
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Best movie of 2012, hands down!  How Josh Whedon was able to make this work is simply astonishing!  Too much fun!!!"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Looking forward to the next movie
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Great, great, great. Marvel does it again."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"I did really like this film a lot however it could have been a different villain, one we haven't seen before but still it was great all in all"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"best action ,acting ever"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,A late review so I know everyone knows this movie is the best of its kind and of the year
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Pure art true believers... Nuff said.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Excellent movie action from beginning to the end.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Okay, we watched a bunch of comedian not a superheroes, with some joke that make it became a popcorn movie that i can forgot easily but i love the action and CGI so eye-catching."
"Jul 21, 2012",neutral,Probably the most overvalued film in years. Only Hulk's moments can save it.
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"I love the Ironman and Hulk character, and even though it's true to the comic, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye really often nothing to the team.  Lokie is a sad villian that seem to have needed an upgrade from the pages."
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Entertaining from beginning to end. Plenty of laughs, especially from the hulk (my favourite) and all the inside jokes and banter between the characters was awesome. Joss Whedon you've done it again. Bring on the sequel!"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,THis movie is AWESOME!!!!! :D
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,Ok best ever cant wait for more more more marvel.... now the only complaint was they didnt have edward norton as the hulk dont get me wrong mark did a good job but edward should of been the part..
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Man how did i not post a review about the best superhero film of all time 

I love spider-man as a superhero character , but i have to admit that marvel did a outstanding job representing the AVENGERS , the movie felt so real , it was like the superheros were directly taken out of the comics & there souls were injected into human bodies 

Iron-man and hulk for me stole the show , i was lucky enough to watch the movie with a awesome audience , people were laughing at the jokes , wooing on every awesome moment that too in pure sync , i was fortunate for such a audience because i didn't miss any awesome dialog

The story too had a comic like feel to it , the plot was yeah something that you would expect from the awesome marvel line 

This movie was a superhero movie that felt like a superhero movie & not some glorified real world take on superheros , seriously why would you want awesome fantasy creatures like superheros & tame them down of their unearthly potential 

AVENGERS by far & by infinite distance far is the best super hero movie , it blew away my mind & gave me hope live action adaptation of superheros is in safe hands

Marvel & Sony please do join forces , it will be awesome to watch the spidey & avengers combo in live action

10/10 , if i was a fanboy then oo/oo [oo=infinity]"
"Jul 21, 2012",positive,"Great entertaining movie with wit, charm, action, and good old fashioned butt whooping!  Must see in theaters!"
"Jul 21, 2012",negative,"the avengers is the worst super hero movie ever , with no satisfying story line , ending or acting. Truly on of the worst movies in history."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Best time i've had at the movies in a long time.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,This was the bomb lol. Worth seeing
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"I like how they plan well for every heroes there is, they didn't make you feel left out for each of them. Too much unnecessarily jokes, the scenes sometime fast paced. Not much of a story telling, most of the plots are predictable but satisfying blockbuster movie."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Wonderful movie.....
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Freaking awesome, great kick-off to the summer!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Marvel's world needs superheroes. Our World needs great movies.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Apart from some minor dislikes, I thought the movie was totally fun and could have watched several hours more."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Excellent comic book fun!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"I loved it, even without having seen Cpt America & Thor before I went in. Can't wait to see it again."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Absolutely LOVED!!!!

When I first saw trailers for this movie, I thought it looked like it would be nothing more than a chaotic, cluttered, mess of CGI explosions... First impressions aren't always right.

Superhero movies are a tired genre. Nearly every one follows the same story structure; brief and uninspired back story, discovery of superpowers or abilities, unnecessary romantic entanglement, convenient introduction of a villain at the same time as the creation of the hero, etc. Look up just about any superhero movie (especially from the Marvel cannon) and that is what you'll get. But where other superhero movies spend most of their time with these generic set-ups, The Avengers both doesn't want, or have the need of these rules. All of these characters have been introduced in their own films, so what we have here is the culmination of a series of generally lackluster movies, including Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man 1 & 2, and the result is better than I could have possibly hoped for.

Written and directed by Joss Whedon, who also co-wrote The Cabin In The Woods (another of this year's best films so far), Whedon manages to blend humor into the action to great effect. This is probably the funniest conventional superhero movie I've ever seen. Despite the incredible action sequences and top-of-the-line special effects, to me it was the comedic elements that won me over. Instead of taking itself too seriously all the time, this movie knew when it could be funny and when it needed to be serious without making radical tonal shifts.

This movie succeeds on so many levels. Along with perfectly blending action, suspense, comedy, and drama, Whedon also manages to give every central character adequate screen time, all the while understanding that several of these characters have definite limitations in how functional they could conceivably be -- let's be serious here, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America are in no way going to be as useful at the world as Iron Man, Thor, and Hulk. And thanks, yet again, to Whedon's excellent writing, plot convenience rarely enters into the script. This is the case especially with Hawkeye, who for the entire duration of the movie I was fearing the script would find some convenient use for his incredible marksmanship, e.g., a far-off, pin-sized target which needed to be hit with great precision during a brief window of time. Instead of leaving the movie thinking ""well, wasn't THAT convenient"", you might leave the movie saying ""that was AWESOME!"".

Another major difference that set this movie apart was the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Not having seen The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton, I cannot attest to his performance, but I can say that found Ruffalo to be a vast improvement over Eric Bana from the 2003 Ang Lee incarnation. Of course Robert Downey, Jr.'s Tony Stark dominates the cast, reminding us once again why the Iron Man movies are the best of the prequel series. Stark's brash confidence and sense of humor allows for excellent chemistry with the entire cast, serving as the cornerstone of the movie. Tom Hiddleston's performance is also a standout, yet again turning in a great villainous performance as Loki.

With the possible exception of The Dark Knight, I would be inclined to say this is the best superhero movie I've ever seen. But where Nolan went with a dark, moody tone with his film, Whedon went with a brighter, more exciting approach, making The Avengers less brooding, but more entertaining. It may stand as being one of the best movies of the year come December, there's no way of knowing that at this point. But one thing is for sure -- it's the most entertaining so far."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,so good i cried and probably failed my math test the next morning
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,"I didn't like this film and I think a lot of people are giving it good ratings simply because of the fan base much like twilight. The dialouge, acting, and the story line where very poor. It was a waste of time."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Probably The Avengers one of the best adaptations of the Marvel Comics, but his script  has one objective, show explosions on the screen and never force the audience use their brains"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,The scenes with the Hulk doing what Hulk does makes it work the while!  Highly entertaining and non-stop action!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"The perfect comic book movie. This is a real game changer. From now on everyone will have to step their game up. The scale is EPIC, action relentless, and writing sharp. This movie was made for the fans. Everyone handles their arts surprisingly well and the Hulk steals the show. Loki was was great as the baddie."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,One blockbuster which delivers. Simple working chemistry. And well... 'Hulk smash!!!' nuf said. :)
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"One of the best super hero movies of all time!   The over the top action, and good humor, mix  well with the origin of the most powerful super hero team ever assembled, and it has heart to boot."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Awesome! ""Puny god!"" Greatness!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,"Not very creative, standard plot, cool special effects in some parts but overall unimaginative"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,The best movie of the year hands down. Great cast of actors Mark Ruffalo steals the show as Hulk and Robert Downey is at his best while playing the billionaire playboy genius entrepreneur. Stunning graphics incredible action and jokes that keep you laughing
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,A highly enjoyable film that infused action with clever comedy. More of a family film but a very good movie
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Amazing, epic, funny, and whitty. A must see this summer."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Amazing, great storyline and detail to the characters"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"I didn't know what to expect from this Blockbuster, I just knew that I was excited. I find when i'm excited to see something, the movie is never as good as I imagined. So maybe it was just me when I say they could have done more. It was interesting and the action was really cool, but it just wasn't enough for me. Still fresh however!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Loved it...stuck to the story line very well...
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"It was good, but I don't think it deserves a 92% on RT."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Lively, fun, and imaginative, The Avengers is a great close to Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"One for the Bluray list, an amazing film and the series is shaping up nicely."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"As of right now, The Avengers is the best Marvel film to date!!!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,one of the best popcorn movies every made
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"A great film for one coming out of the Marvel Universe, but there is only a fine line that separates it from from being a loud summer popcorn flick and quality entertainment."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,A fantastic conclusion to the marvel comics series. All the characters are well drawn and played by various very good actors. Having never seen a good portrayal of the hulk I was delighted with his portrayal on this film.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,It was soooo awesome and funny
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,like amazing spiderman this is one of my personal favorites accept i new this was going to be good
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"This is the new ""Big Summer Movie"" measuring stick."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Could gave cut about twenty minutes of explosions and still been just as good. Thor and Iron Man steal the show.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Very good movie. Lots of action..
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"With out a doubt, the best super hero movie I have ever seen."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Go to see this for what it is - a fun superhero movie. Its just that - fun. Lot's of fun. Don't expect any of the character development or dark, gritty realism found in Nolan's Batman trilogy, but you will absolutely find a lot of action, humor, and great effects. A surprisingly fun first (let's face it, there will be more) coming together of the Marvel supers."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,A fun movie to watch. Though the characters get a little bit lost but still very funny scenes!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Hulk Smash! that toothy green smile made my day
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Great movie.  Good job at incorporating all the heroes.  A little more action would be cool.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie since the Dark Knight. It's not that the film is a masterpiece -- it very clearly isn't -- it's that it has the best working knowledge of what a comic book character is and why we love watching them. Everyone is at their best in this. Huge feat to make a movie like this work so well.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Good movie. The ending was just way to convient for the heros to me go see The Dark Knight Rises better movie overall.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"When all these super heroes reunite, it creates a great action movie with great action scenes. But this movie fails to deliver any heart or soul to the characters, and the first half of this 2 and a half hour movie is useless towards the plot. Overall a typical superhero movie"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Marvel's best team up! For all the sci-fi geeks, this was a great treat!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,One of the best all time movies
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,"Long, boring, cheesy, lame. Did I say long?"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Pretty much the perfect comic book adaptation ever made. With all sorts of its own contributions to the genre - it manages to be even greater than the sum of its roots/parts.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Seen this opening weekend, I absolutely LOVED it! It did not disappoint, if you are a Marvel fan or have loved any of the movies previous (Iron Man, THOR, Cap. America, Hulk, etc) You will love this movie!"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Best action movie in a long time.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Not a wasted moment.   Often a film can get bogged down with pointless moments.  Not so with this film.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon hit the nail on the head with this. I don't think you could have chosen a more perfect director. Each character has equal screen time and it really gives you the chance to enjoy the film without feeling rushed from all the competing story lines.
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,"An incoherent mess.  A parade of required characters put in obligatory appearences without any realistic dialogue or motivation.  Does not stand up as a movie on its own merits; only for rabid fans of the Marvel menagerie.  Interesting only as an illustration of how bad a movie can be.  Was Wheadon even there?  This seems assembled by a committee, inserting comic book characters by the numbers as required for marketing purposes."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"Good, fun, summer blockbuster. Lots of action once the story picks up, nearly 45 minutes into the movie after the opening sequence. Just don't expect this movie to get you deeply involved with the characters or story like our beloved Batman does. It does what it is meant to do, and that is entertain you for nearly 2 1/2 hours."
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Fun- exciting- casting was great! The comic book world came alive! Robert Downy Jr radiated superhero in the most vain arrogant love able way possible!!! While family loved this movie !!!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Loved it! The characters were portrayed awesomely and the plot was great!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,This movie was so good. Never left my seat. Plus the actors weren't bad to look at either :)
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,With out a doubt the best superhero movie made to date.
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,2008's The Dark Knight Is My Second Favorite Film Of All Time.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Love love love. Absolutely great action movie. Can't wait for a sequil
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Greatest film i'v ever watched
"Jul 20, 2012",negative,"Just fanservice, no story and poor one-liners"
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. Must see
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,BEST ACTION MOVIE THIS SUMMER. READY FOR THE NEXT AND THE WAY IT WENT OFF EXCELLENT !!!!!!!! ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,Greatest. Superhero. Film. Ever.  Nuff Said.
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,BEST comic movie sooo farr!
"Jul 20, 2012",positive,"I'm absolutely dying to give it a 5, because it's just so damn good. I just have slight beef with the sequences involved in Loki's coming to power. But god damn the script is amazing, the action is great, and the characters chemistry is phenomenal."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Great comic book movie. Not as good as Batman Returns IMO
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,What and awesome movie for the Super Hero fans!!! Just spectacular!!!!
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Just about as close to a perfect summer movie as I've seen. Well executed fluff with lots of great one-liners, menacing glares and special effects. Not deep in the least.  Just fun."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Exajera exajera exajera !!!
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"A super soldier. A God from other planet. A huge green monster. A genius billionaire. A femme fatal. A super marksman. in this movie these different charanters gets teamed up only to face Loki and his army. It's quite surprising and somewhat dissapointing that this movie didn't have a super villain. However we still get to see Tony stark and his new stark building and many other ""blow your mind"" action scenes. I must say that robert downey jr and mark ruffallo performance is the best thing in this movie like a live wire. I'm not a marvel fan. I'm not a josh whedon fan but robert downey is one of my favorite actor therefore i give this movie 5 stars and I enjoyed watching it in 3d cinema and I will buy the bluray."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,I seen this movie 5 times in the theatres
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"good story, great action, great visuals. excellent fun popcorn, summer movie"
"Jul 19, 2012",negative,"Honestly, it just couldn't capture my attention. I wasn't draw in. The action sequences lagged and the saving graces were the quips from Tony Stark."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,LOVED IT! Can't wait for the next..
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Best Superhero movie ever!!!!!
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"One of the, no, the BEST superhero movie I have ever seen!"
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Good movie, good action. Slow starting plot, climax dragged on too long. But once again Robert Downey Jr STOLE the show as the comic relief. Entertaining, go see it!"
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Best movie ever in my opinion
"Jul 19, 2012",negative,joss whedon safe control over the movie can not save the movie  that has no story
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Wow!  I did not see this one coming!  I have liked but not loved pretty much all the previous movies in the Marvel universe (Thor being my favorite) so I did not anticipate loving this one as much as I did.  I should have known it was going to be great because Joss Whedon is a genius.  I just did not expect all the amazing action sequences.  The character banter is great here too.  As most everyone has stated, Hulk completely steals the show and has a ton of great scenes.  Overall a great movie and probably my 2nd favorite superhero movie (behind Dark Knight which is hard to even call a superhero movie)."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,100% nothing to comment on other than see this movie and stay for the credits Thanos! Perfect director who knows how to handle 7 larger than life heroes and make them coincide as a Team the Avengers to be specific. Saw this on it's premiere and 4 times after and it never missed a beat keep them going marvel.
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Tons of action, excitement, and a good bit of comedy thrown in. A really great movie."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,One of the coolest movies and ideas for a movie I think I have ever seen
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Very well done and entertaining. A collage of Marvel superheroes that will leave you satisfied. While I normally don't like superheroes, I prefer the Avengers because I actually enjoyed it."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Good fun!!! Love Hulk
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Just what you expect,  but next to the superstars,  some of the characters were vastly out of place."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Best movie so far this summer saw it 3 times at the movies
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,An achievement and near perfect marvel universe film worthy of multiple viewings.  Everyone shines.
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Before you decide to watch this movie please watch all the other Marvel movies, The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. That's the only way you can fully appreciate its brilliance. Best movie of 2012 so far!"
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Great movie!!! Very interesting and funny
"Jul 19, 2012",negative,Película estúpida...
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Great film with an awesome cast and story.
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Avengers was a great Movie and it had a lot of great lead Characters playing the roles. It is cool how they got them to look just like they did in the Comic Books. Can't wait for the 2nd one to come out.
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,it was an amazing experience. totally worth the wait
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Osm. Way better than I thought it would b
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Everything you would expect from a superhero movie.  Lighthearted, action packed, and a great theater experience."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,"Not entirely flawless, but an ambitious superhero epic that lives up to all expectations. The first continuity heavy superhero team-up film set within its own cinematic universe, a movie that is sure to influence Hollywood's superhero future. This is the best MARVEL movie since Iron Man and Spiderman 2."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,One of the films of the year! Almost the superhero version of the expendables! Non stop action and thrills. However to basic a storyline halts its potential to be an all time epic. However still an amazing film!
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,amazing! this was an epic super hero story filled with action and excitement.  I can watch this film over and over.
"Jul 19, 2012",neutral,"The good: a lot of action heroes 
The bad: everything else 

The story line wasn't plotted very well, also the evil side was more like the goofy side."
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Hulk Smash!  The hulk steals the show in arguably the greatest Super Hero made to date.
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,One of my favourite movies of all time. Best comic book movie yet!
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,If you haven't seen it you definitely have to go see it
"Jul 19, 2012",positive,Great action packed film. SFX very cool!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,I loved it. It met all of my expectations.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,This movie provides an even balance of action sequences... Humor... And sentiment!! It makes you remember why superhero movies even exist!! Definitely one of the best films of 2012! A must-see!!
"Jul 18, 2012",negative,It was meh... Am i the only person who didnt like it???
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,I thought this movie was great
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Whedon and crew have accomplished the impossible, but the stakes could have been higher. The answer to this? The Avengers: Phase Two, beginning 2013. The Avengers is a completely entertaining film from beginning to end, by bringing together the Earth's mightiest heroes and saving the world. All this while still quenching any action fan's appetite, honoring the characters and making some good jokes!"
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"little too silly at times, not a memorable scene for me, still awesome though"
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Amazing film, maybe the best of 2012, Whedon has yet another hit on his hands"
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Great Story/Screenplay! The Hulk owns the screen though- prepare to be Ruffalized and to enjoy it!
"Jul 18, 2012",neutral,Don't remember half of it. Because I fell asleep. Because I was drunk as hell. Maybe it's as good as they say. I'm not movitivated to go back.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Beyond fantastic. Actors did an amazing job.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome!!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"A masterpiece in many ways. The dialogue is well written, the action sequences are very entertaining, the comedy that they include as a bonus, while not classy, is definitely better than most of the content you find in many comedy movies."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"A very great action movie, and still maintaining a good plot. Every character is well thought out. I recommend seeing it. Kept me on the edge of my seat for more."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Unexpectingley exciting. Even though an action movie, still has a great plot. Great character development, and I belive it followers the old marvel comics, which makes everyone happy, including me."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"A good superhero action movie with a lot of spectacle, but not the excellent movie thay everyone is talking about. It has great character development but the story lacks sense of danger, in particular by its weak villain loki."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Great bit of fun and a BR buy for me.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Joss how did you do this movie justice when Buffy was a total mistake.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,That'll do Joss. That'll do.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,I'd give it more if it was possible.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,All i need to say is... WOW!  The script was amazing. The action was breathtaking. A+
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Live's up to everything it promises. At least in my book.
"Jul 18, 2012",negative,"mediocre movie,some good action scenes but not a strong and consistent storyline.good for kids"
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Fun and entertaining, just like it should be. Not the ""best movie ever!!!!"" though...no way. Dark Knight franchise kicks this in the ass anyday"
"Jul 18, 2012",negative,this is one of the worst movies ever made.  It is a ode to where the movie industry is headed.
"Jul 18, 2012",neutral,"Finally, a movie that wants to take my money."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"This is (in my opinion, as a comics aficionado) the best movie ever made. There is comic book action on a scale never seen before. So many characters, so beautifully balanced. Great visuals, good score. Sure, the plot was a bit lacking, but with all the characters and their dynamics together, there was no room for more plot. A great movie, my favorite.  Great performances. 
You will believe in heroes."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,My favorite movie based on marvel comics!! Can't wait to see what happens on the next one!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a genius!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Okay - maybe it would have helped if I had seen ALL of the prior movies.  I did see Iron Man.  It just didn't hold my attention.  Even in the action scenes, it wasn't ""edge of my seat"" action - which is what I like in an action movie."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,AMAZING!! I want to own so I can add it to my collection of movies I watch over and over again.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Great movie the acting is amazing and it isn't just action it is also very funny too.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"With Comedy and Relief by Robert Downey Jr as well as the perfectly cast heroes  ""Marvel's: The Avengers succeeds in not only bringing the action and the comedy but being the great movie it deserves to be."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,One of the best films ever! Such great action!  The control of all the characters was perfect! Overall a film that can be re-watched anytime!!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"I honestly think that people are really over-hyping this movie. I mean, yes, the special effects are good and there are some really good comedic moments in the film. I liked the performances by Robert Downey, Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. However, it's way too long, almost being two and a half hours. I have seen the movie twice, but I only saw it because the people I was with wanted to see it again. If it had been my choice, I would have seen something else.My rating: 2.5 stars out of 4."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"I have always been a fan of Marvel and D.C comics.I saw,""The Avengers"",twice in theatres and this movie was better than I thought.The action,special effects,plot,and the cast did a great job.This is the best Marvel movie ever made.This is my #2 favorite superhero movie,so far.This is also a perfect movie to put in your collection,when it comes out on DVD."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Without Iorn Man and Hulk this movie would not have been half as good. Comic book fans should be pleased, and the general audience will enjoy the big budget special effects."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"In my opinion, So far the greatest superhero movie ever made. And if you don't at least like this movie, seek medical attention immediately."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is simply a god and everything he touches turns to gold.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Packed with action, good acting, and comedy throughout, this film presents all that is expected from a great superhero movie."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Fun. Great character development considering the frantic pace of the film. RDJ is excellent as always but does not overshadow the other actors. Each character gets their own individual moments to shine.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Superb Comic Book Film. 10/10. AWESOME.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"A good cast, interesting plot and well staged action scenes. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was commendable."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie I have ever seen! :)
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,took my 5year old son to movies to see it 6 times. he dressed up as different avenger few times we went to see it.  my son loved it and so did I.  it will be good memories I had with my son I will always cherish. awesome movie. hulk was great
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,My son and i went to see it 4times. Thats all i need to say.
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,Fantastic movie that wears it genre on its sleeve and is proud of it. Laugh out loud funny too. Thank you Joss Whedon!!!!
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, Love the ending scene, how they really blow up the cars using explosive . Nice scene when all the heros start to quarrel as the camera shots and editing did a good job on it. Overall I believe it is a must to watch but the only I don't really get it was the HULK in this storyline. Well just watch it and you will get what i meant."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is without question, one of the most enjoyable comic-book themed films in years. While it doesn't match the character depth, tension and thematic gravitas of The Dark Knight, it excels as a pure crowd-pleaser.

After some lackluster outings for Captain America, The Hulk, and some admirable attempts with Iron Man and Thor, Marvel has finally found the right note again. Since Marvel's X-Men 2 & Spiderman 2, I got the sense that later Marvel movies were being graded on a curve, simply based on brand-name alone. As successful as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America were, they were forgettable films. The Avengers however, takes what could easily have become hokey subject matter and turned it into an action-packed ensemble that manages to give adequate screen time to all the major players.

The plot is is simple: Thor's brother Loki attempts to rule the universe. It's your typical megalomaniac story line and of course Earth's greatest heroes are assemble to fight back. It's about a simple as that...there's no reason to pretend there's anymore depth than that. But that's not a bad thing in this film because the simplicity of the plot allows its heroes to shine.

The Avengers assumes you've seen some of the previous films and moves right into battle. Perhaps the most cinematically destroyed character on film--The Incredible Hulk--fittingly becomes the most beloved by the time this movie is over. The rest of the cast is splendid as well; Robert Downey Jr shines as Tony Stark and Chris Evan's second outing as Captain America is appreciated over his solo effort.

Despite the heavy dose of special effects, the director manages to find the right mix of action, humor and character development to keep this from being another special effects dependent film we see every summer.  At it's heart, The Avenger's is about heroism, the kind of heroism we imagined as kids from our superheroes. While The Avenger's won't win any Oscars outside of the special effects category, it has earned a much higher honor by moviegoers as it is guaranteed to be a remembered as one of the best comic book movies of all time."
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Great movie, can't wait for the next one"
"Jul 18, 2012",positive,"Pact with fun and many memorable moments. Great Quotes, Great Characters and everything you want if you have nothing to do in 2 hours. Take the plot out. It barely had one."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"the story is simplistic for a movie like this. its predictable at times. and its treated like the citizen kane of superhero movies when it isnt that great. but it is a fun movie with enjoyable characters, a fun movie. a popcorn film. theres not much to say about a movie like this because there isnt tht much to it. its safe and marketable. i do however like how they went into the minds of superheroes and how they feel about certain things"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Hands down, the most complex, the most put together, and the most fun out of all the Marvel films as of late; Avengers succeeds where most films would have disastrously fallen. It's a fun summer movie with heart and tons and tons of action (with some very funny bits by a scene stealing Hulk). Walk in proudly, you are about to witness something extraordinary!"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Slow build up but worth the wait as The Hulk steals the movie.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Nonstop action with a step up for the adults that still love the characters they grew-up reading and idolizing. A complete sexy cast that had your heart pumping and your rear at the edge of your seat!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,love it could watch it over an over again. all my childhood favs all in one
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"I don't know how Joss pulled off a group superhero movie, but he did it.  Man, did he do it."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,You have to see all the movies to understand it!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Great storyline (of course), great action, great comedic parts and great ending. Can't wait to see sequels ð???"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,I saw this movie already and it was perfect and good!!!!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Personally, I liked it a lot. But something strange happened in that theater that I've never seen before. I looked around the auditorium to see what looked like 200 people all rejoicing in enjoyment of the film. They were cheering, laughing, and smiling wide like jolly Totoros. For any other movie, this would be the nightmare audience, but with The Avengers, I began enjoying the movie more as I saw how much happiness and escapism it was providing to everyone there. 

This isn't a cash-grabbing blockbuster drenched in stupidity, but a genuinely good-intentioned super-hero movie that fans had been waiting for. Joss Whedon and all the others involved did their upmost to make the film worth everyone's while, and from what I saw it succeeded gloriously. 

Walking out, I saw children tugging at their parent's pant legs about how awesome the Hulk was, how funny Iron Man was (there was so much quoting!), and how much they wanted to walk right back in and watch it again. I saw the same from adults, as regularly dressed people who just got off from work looked at one another with a delighted shock on their faces, like they were surprised at how much fun it turned out to be. And the Comic-Book fans had to mask their shame as they rushed to the restrooms to clean themselves off. 

In short, The Avengers is the gift that keeps on giving. My thoughts and complaints mean nothing compared to the 140 minute action-packed bliss it spread worldwide."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Marvel fans unite together for a perfect movie for Marvel fans! But has one plot the whole movie defeat the villain. Very good but not the best i think the Dark Knight Rises will be better
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,the avengers is nothing more than a great action movie. the film is original with the whole team of superheros thing. but in other terms i feel it can be as generic as any other of the solo superhero movies. to start off aside from the team of superheros thing the plot is that loki is bringing aliens from another planet to conquer earth and the avengers have to stop them. the whole thing is cliche and pretty predictable. i also thought that the reason why the heroes decided to band together was pretty stupid. they all hate each other until a character who is pretty much good for nothing but cracking jokes dies. that was pretty weak. aside from a stale plot we have some of the best cgi work in recent time. the effects look amazing and best in imax. there are sometimes i felt the cgi looked too much like a video game but its nothing to really gripe about. now once your down to about to the last 40 minutes of the movie thats when everything starts to get very very good. the action was awesome each character played a big part and the hulk kicked ass and stole the show. marvel's the avengers is one of the best action movies around but in terms of the best superhero movie i still think that belongs to the dark knight. marvels the avengers is a good time that everybody can sit back and enjoy. marvels best movie? sure. the best superhero movie ever? nah. a good action flick? you bet cha. 3.5/5
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,This movie was Awesome
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Only negative is they weren't consistent with the hulk
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Excelente pelicula. ?
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"In 2005, Marvel Studios began paving the way for Hollywood to dazzle the world's movie going public for what they anticipated to be the apex of big block buster cinema. Since 2008, they have worked diligently to transform iconic comic book super heroes into live action archetypes. These past four years have brought us 5 major motion pictures, building characters and storylines, with the hopes that on May 4th all their hard work would pay off.

""The Avengers,"" starring Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsgård and Tom Hiddleston and written and directed by Joss Whedon, has made over $700 million just in it's opening weekend making it the highest grossing film to date. I, along with 96% of the world's movie theater patrons, agree it's time for Marvel Studios to finally stand up and take a bow.

If you've followed the previous films, which include ""Iron Man"" 1 & 2, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Captain American"" and ""Thor,"" then you'll have no problem jumping right into ""The Avengers"" as Whedon meticulously wrote this screenplay perfectly as the latest installment. Not only has he united all 5 stories together in a brilliantly coherent fashion but he's also created something wholly new and fantastically marvelous in the process. To be able to direct such a large cast is no easy task either, but Whedon had little issues, comparing himself to Jackson's character Nick Furry stating that he ""didn't have as many problems because my actors actually wanted to be together. They enjoy each other.""

There was some concern before the film was released that having so many big name actors in a single film, and with equally essential roles, would clash on screen. However, it turns out that everyone, no matter the size of their characters' physical appearance or egos, got just as much attention and face time. The film itself is about team work and that's exactly what we see here.

For those of you who haven't jumped on the comic book genre bandwagon yet or simply aren't a fan of them - but secretly always wanted to be, ""The Avengers"" would be a great introduction to them. The 143 minutes of quick witted humor, action packed sci-fi fight sequences, and spectacular acting and direction is pure cinematic gold that is sure to satisfy even the most skeptical of movie goers."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"So much could have gone wrong, so much was done right."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Effin loved it. Action from beginning to end
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Really amazing effects perhaps it can have take more advantages to 3D effects in some scenes. A must see movie
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Three things make this movie amazing: action, humor, and more action."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Great movie. Can't wait for it to arrive ob DVD.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,This is the best heroe movie ever non stop action great cast  is movie every body gots to love!!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Wow !! The best Super Hero movie so far!!!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"While slightly overrated, a good film nonetheless."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Best film I've seen this year. Fast, exciting and top quality special effects."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers is a solid, fun, and entertaining superhero movie. Stilish direction from director Joss Whedon."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,everything i expected it to be and more...
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,I absolutely LOVED The Avengers! It was definitely action packed and always kept me guessing the entire movie. The actors were chosen perfectly to fit the characters.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,I absolutely LOVED The Avengers! It was definitely action packed and always kept me guessing the entire movie. The actors were chosen perfectly to fit the characters.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Good but missing something
"Jul 17, 2012",negative,Overuse of special effects that didn't even look real. Should have been a comedy with the constant jokes.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Extremely entertaining, with great action, but most importantly, funny and interesting dialogue to hold your attention throughout the whole film."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"For me, ties The Dark Knight Returns as best superhero movie ever made."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,One of the best super hero movie
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Hands down the most exciting superhero film to date! However I still prefer the realism and maturity of Nolan's batman movies the dark knight still holds number one for me however this is in a very very close 2nd place
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,I wish i would seen this in 3D it prolly would have been that much better
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Great movie!  I was skeptical at first on how they'd coordinate the story with all of the heroes, and they did a very good job.  Loki is one of the best villains I've seen in a while.  They added just the right amount of humor.  It's one of the few DVD's I'll purchase."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon knows how to direct an ensemble cast.  Best comic book movie right behind Kick-Ass & Scott Pilgrim.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,Love it  watch it 3 times
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"The Avengers: The best superheroe movie of the year!! Epic! 

I'm glad that Marvel is taking this opportunity and not like  DC Comics (because they are late with the JLA movie.)"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,This is the ultimate summer movie. It is fun and exciting with great actors playing great parts. Recommended by me and Larry Tinklefish
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"The Avenger is an exhilarating, funny, awesome, epic film that takes you on a 140 minute roller coaster that you wont forget. A wonderful extravaganza of performances, laughs, and action sequences that will blow you away"
"Jul 17, 2012",neutral,less then I expected BUT loved the incredible Hulk!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,great comic movie...cant wait to see sequel
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"This isn't a review. Just some logic. When ""The Avengers"" does good and gets great reviews, according to all the Batman fans trolling around the comments, it's because everyone is just kissing Joss Whedon's ass despite the fact that it's an awesome movie. But when ""The Dark Knight"" does good, they disagree with every single negative review and insist that it's art created by a God that the underdeveloped masses couldn't hope to understand (followed by a giant swallow of Mountain Dew and a ""GIT ER DONE!!!""). No wonder you guys love Batman so much. He's kind of got two distinct personalities. Unfortunately, you guys don't. You have what's called double standards. Hypocrisy. Or just mental deficiencies. Take your pick. To be so blindly devoted to something like that is admirable. Makes me want to get my Thetan levels tested."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Love it, great humor and enjoyable. Great visuals and design, enough story depth. Thanks to each character's individual 'prologue' movies, this movie does not waste time explaining backgrounds of characters, but still provide enough info."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,No words can explain the epicness...
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Comic book adaptations always have their kinks & quirks, but Marvel did this one well. Save-the-world level action with enough humor and drama to keep things interesting. Fans from the comics might have a deeper experience when presented with certain character interactions, but everyone can enjoy this one without needing a comics background."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"The Second Great Superhero film, in my opinion. Watching The Avengers was like a dream come true for a Marvelite like me!"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,one word - THOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,One of the Best Marvel movies...
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"An absolute blast.
Sharp, fun, loud, bright, shiny, bombastic and enthralling, The Avengers is thankfully an example of a movie that could have easily been ruined by a number of factors, but instead paid-off in absolute spades.
One of the biggest super-hero ensembles ever attempted for a feature-length movie, The Avengers is what the already great Marvel movies of the past 5 years have been leading up to, and it's a Hell of a party.
Very rarely missing an opportunity for action and only slowing down in a few parts for necessary exposition, the money is on the screen with The Avengers and there are no chances to get bored.
While a somewhat basic not a particularly puzzling structure for a movie in and of itself (and it doesn't need to be), the plot really only serves as a solid skeleton that the film-makers wrote the fireworks around. Yes, it is a ""bad guy shows up, good guys assemble, bad guy gets army and good guys and bad guys fight"" plot, but for a comic-book movie that works when it's done right, and it's done right here. Every action-scene is a sight to behold, but the climax in particular will have your eyes popping out of your head and your brain doing cartwheels. It's a mind-blowing finale that's a visual feast.
The true entertainment value is not only in the action set-pieces and the great special-effects, but also in the moments of dialogue shared between characters. The Avengers never forgets the human strengths and weaknesses of the characters, and watching these fun, well-written individuals interact with one-another is a spectacle as much as any super-powered fight-scene.
All characters are perfectly cast. It is questionable (to some baffling) why Marvel replaced the part of Bruce Banner with Mark Ruffalo after establishing well-respected actor Edward Norton in relevant Marvel movie prior to this, but Ruffalo plays the part and plays it well.
Marvel made the right decision in selecting a long-time fan of the Avengers comics as the writer. Joss Whedon does a better job with the material than anyone I can imagine. Take note, Hollywood: it pays when the people involved have a passion for what they're making.
Again, The Avengers could have easily been a disaster if not handled right, and we've seen the C to F grade results mismanagement can get with things like the Star Wars prequels or the fourth Indiana Jones movie. This may be a crowning achievement for Joss Whedon's already successful career in entertainment, and I'm excited to see what the proven-competent write will bring us in the future.
The Avengers deserves every dollar it receives at the box-office. Clever, funny, tense, dramatic and explosively fun, The Avengers is one of the best super-hero movies ever made. The only qualm is how (or if) Marvel will manage to top this."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,The Avengers was a big step in the right direction for comic movies. I was very impressed with the Avengers and I was never a Avengers fan growing up. They needed one more powerful villain to balance out the fight. Overall great movie and I'm so hyped for Avengers 2.
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"A whole lot of superhero FUN!  Hulk vs. Thor, hulklarious!  Saw it in 4D, which was a little distracting though."
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Wow! A terrific action/comic book movie with fleshed out characters, stunning visuals, and crisp, witty dialogue. Joss you done good!"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"Well hell, can't believe a team of superheroes finally assembled on the big screen in one of Marvel's best comic book adaptations of the world's most loved heroes (in the Marvel universe). 
          For some reason i still can't get used to 3D, it messes with my eyes, and the lights feel darkish. Call me old fashioned, but this is the last 3D i'll watch, ever!. Anyway....proper review:

         WOW, Outstanding, explosion, double son poweeer, this film blocks off the sun:)). A little exited finally getting the chance to see a film of such magnitude on screen. Absolutely amazing, each scene with every super hero of every moment, every second of it. Brilliant and an outstanding performance all the way. 
          The kid in me simply burst out thru the entire film and felt like i've never felt in years, like Santa is coming. The Avengers is finally complete, over a decade of awesome Marvel films the team eventually gets together and puts out a helluva performance. One of a kind even, a true spectacle in every way possibly imaginable . 
           GO watch it now, stop reading reviews...it's truly an experience. Enjoy!

Peace!"
"Jul 17, 2012",positive,"good stuff. could've done with a lil less Captain America, and a lil more Thor though. and a few more gratuitous keester shots of Scarlett Johansson, but still a good flick."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Good action and a fun ride. Great one-liners and a few surprises. Interesting themes about the moral fight we all engage in and the power of coming together for the greater good.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Great fun and superbly made.  It sets the bar high for the genre, as it should."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,saw this movie multiple times. love it!!!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Worth the trip to the theater 10 fold. Loved it!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Good Film. But Doesn't Top The Dark Knight Rises
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,not the best plot ever but nice anyways.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie, worth the wait and the build up only made it better."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,This movie ended perfectly.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"A great movie for everyone. An ensemble of a nicely portrayal comical superheros. An apparent and interesting story plot enough to captivate the audience of all ages. A few cheesy liners, with a touch of a Micheal Bay-sort-of-action. Which really didn't    amaze me like everyone else. There is nothing in this movie that I haven't already seen in Transformers as far as the action goes(Still a much more sophisticated movie than that awful trilogy). Jeremy Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye is probably my favorite character, besides the Hulk. He seems the only actor in this movie that does leave me impressed. Overall a very entertaining movie."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Amazing.....best movie ever
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,AMAZING MOVIE A MUST SEE!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Robert Downey always does his thang. What a amazing actor..
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"It was amazing in everyway! There was so much action and humor, it was great!"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Most fun I've had in a theater in a long time!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Slightly overrated, but still a fantastic superhero movie with great writing and action"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Super-fun comic-book action movie with great performances.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Awesome movie enough said! A must see and must own on blueray
"Jul 16, 2012",neutral,"Most people will disagree with me on this, but this movie disapointed me in many ways. The villian was a poor and lazy choice, the one-liners werent funny, and the Climax of the film came in the last 20 minutes. I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting, then finally. The last 20 minutes were great, but not great enough to carry the rest of the films weight. Without RDJ, this movie would be a huge bust with all the other characters being shallow and boring. There's just something about X-men, X-2, Spiderman, Iron man, Nolan's Batman movies, the original Superman. They intertwine fantasy and reality. This movie fails to do that. A hero is someone you look up to, someone you strive to be, and can relate too. I cannot relate to any of these characters, seeing as how they are fighting giant worms. In 10 years, when the special effects are out of date, no one will remember The Avengers and all of their Box-Office Heroics."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Great movie!! Loved ever second of it.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,I thought it was nicely executed.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Great movie! But was a little disappointment about who they choose for the  first vilan.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Marvel ingeniously lines up its heroes from past respective films. Takes the best pieces of lore and kicks things up a notch. Energetic, witty and action-packed, it's Marvel at its finest."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"i really thought this movie was gonna do bad, but it was great i loved the fight scenes. and the villian was not stupid"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"While it may, in my opinion, not be up to snuff with Nolan's Batman series, this is definitely the best film we have gotten from the Marvel Universe. Great performances from all lead actors and a story that brings just enough heart to the heroes make this one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,The wait for this was definitely worth it. It was just so EPIC!!!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Back in 2008, the movie Iron Man hit theatres. After the ending credits, there was a small clip that promised the audience an upcomming Avengers movie. Three years later, the first official teaser was attached to the after-credits of Captain America, thus begining the excitement and anticipation for movie goers and comic book fanatics alike. The movie finally came out on May 4th, 2012; the day that made us all think was a four-year-long wait worth it?

Iâ(TM)m gonna cut strait to the chase, because the answer is yes. This movie is indescribably good! When I first heard of it comming out, I knew it was gonna be a pretty good movie, but it gave the audience what it wanted and more! The film couldnâ(TM)t have been made better. The director did an exceptional job helping the actors and actresses collaborate with eachother and there wasnâ(TM)t a single person who broke character. The sound and visual effects were stunning as well with the Michael Bay-ish type of CGI animation. Another thing that I totally liked about this movie was that the plot was realistic in a sense. The members of The Avengers didnâ(TM)t always get along, they had to work out the kinks of switching from working solo to working as a team. Something else I found interesting was that they didnâ(TM)t just show âThe Avengersâ? throughout the entire movie. The film focused on the separate characters at the beginning of the movie and showed how everything tied together, which the director did a phenomenal job doing.

Bottom line, this movie can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone! If you donâ(TM)t like this movie, then Iâ(TM)m sorry. I have no clue what could possibly be wrong with you. The Avengers seriously set the bar for cinematic entertainment this year and will be insanely hard to top."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"If you like action and suspense, this is for you. They did a great job bringing together all the different characters to make one epic superhero movie."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Best movie EVER
Just don't watch it in subtitles like i did by accident lol"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Greatest movie by Marvel so far
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Finally got to see this and it was too much fun!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"It was a great film at first, but watching it a second time, we see that it is less of a superhero movie and more of a comedy film with superheroes in it. There is not a minute that goes by that doesn't have comedy. Sadly, the emotional parts faulter due to too many jokes. However, Robert Downey Jr. pulls off a great Tony Stark yet again, and all the cast is in it to win it."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Take your inner child to see this amazing movie! The whole movie I felt with interest, not a boring point whatsoever. Also, as usual, stay after the credits."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"I saw this movie in 3D and there is no other way to see it. The writers did such an excellent job with the comedy. Robert Downey jr. does a great job along with all the others but he stands out. He is so funny! When hulk throws the villain (I'm not gonna say who the is) around like a rag doll was just to funny! I would see that movie over and over again. My rating, beyond five stars."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Brilliant film with stunning special effects and great action and surprisingly funny at the same time. Robert Downey Jr. Stands out for me. The one flaw that stops ""Avengers Assemble"" is the 
character Thor. Not Chris Hemsworth as an actor but the character just annoyed me. Joss Weddon's screenplay is outstanding."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is so good because of its strong cast that plays lovable characters like Thor, Cap, and Iron Man, but its greatest ""hero"" was a very strong writer/director in Joss Whedon. Avengers Assemble!"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Dear Jared Young, Age 12, Future Reviewer of THE AVENGERS,

Tell me, Jared: how am I supposed to compose a fair review of a movie that seems - from start to finish, in tone and content, in the quiet beats between loud explosions and the loud beatings between quiet expositions - plucked directly from your twelve year-old brain? And, more than that, treats your Slurpee-induced reveries with such respect, such veneration? 

I can't... (CONT'D)

"Jul 16, 2012",positive,great movie but a tad overrated compared to spider man and some other good comic book movies even so great fun due to good fight scenes and good laughs
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,100 times better than the Marvel crap that came before
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Exactly the way I think Marvel intended it; Inspiring, but not too childlike, Mature enough for adults without being too dark for the whole family and a dozen or two one liners that really keep you laughing without the movie being a joke. They pulled it off brilliantly and everyone in my family decided then and there it was a must have!"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Lovedit.com
My movie of the year so far!"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"More than likely the most entertaining movie I've seen to date, a fantastic mix of great action, comedy, and of course some wonderful actors. Robert Downey Jr, steals the show as Tony Stark, Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki... Though he never really seemed to be a big threat as a villain Chris Hemsworth plays the Mighty Thor and has a few great lines as well as great action scenes, and Mark Ruffalo was a far superior Bruce Banner and Hulk than all the previous adaptations. Throw in Johansson for a strong female performance and naturally a bit of eye candy and it makes a brilliant film."
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,"Loki is a weak villian, there are quite a few plot holes, but dam what an awesome film. Joss Whedon was a very wise choice, here's hoping the 2nd one is even better"
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Definitely worth watching.
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Oh yea this movie kicked ass!
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,i love every part of it :)
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,Went with my honey and not seeing prior movies and was impressed by it...would watch again...
"Jul 16, 2012",positive,I am amazed that the women superheroes are only equipped with spandex and a fan blowing their hair!  Surprises me all the time!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"New favorite..... not as much of a breakthrough as the Matrix or ID4 but nonetheless it was a monumental movie.  Unfortunately im sure others will try it too but remember this movie is not tbe first movie to enter the combination format of several blockbuster's joining into one, even though many forget that freddy vs jason and alien vs predator have already done it.  So keeping that in mind...the avengers movie wasnt even the first comic adaption movie to do it.  I really expected a few things and was releaved to see it didnt happen.
1 Iron man's ego didnt force the film to over show him. Robert Downey did not push it too much but he is used to caring about the finished product over his film time. (Tropic thunder)
2. They kept all of the characters from their own films without any holdouts. (Like the cheadle -stamp problem that still pisses me off)
3 hulk was actually like the bruce banner i remember from comics and tv.  Not sure how red hulk will play out but we will visit that later.
4 It was quality unlike some of what i call hold up movies that blow their load in the trailer to build it up then rob you when you get to the theatre. It was a quality film throughout.  Unlike just about every adam sandler movie.  Dont get me wrong its not his fault he makes oneliner movies...the studios spoil the joke by showing all the punchlines.

Great movie....great time.... money well spent."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Really awesome movie!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Awesome movie ready for the 2 movie
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Exceptional, the Best of the Year."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie! One of the best superheroes movies I've seen! Joss Whedon doesn't disappoint, bringing to the table good dialogues, cliche-smashing scenes (yeah, Hulk was smashing one of their best ones), good timing and an affordable plot for everybody. For anyone who liked this movie, I recommend his series. No, I haven't watched Buffy, though... =P"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,This movie was very funny and action packed  and I can't wait til the next one comes out!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,fav scene= hulk secret and puny god
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,not really impressed
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Quite possibly the greatest comic book superheros movie ever made. It also may have replaced my all time favorite movie which was Gladiator. Simply put, the Avengers is an epic piece of modern day film making."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,I saw this on opening night....there were many losers in the theatre
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,MY MOST FAVORITE MOVIE EVER :)
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, great action scenes"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"I don't like giving 3 stars - I see it as a bit of a cop out.  But The Avengers earned it; too entertaining to be bad, too unnecessarily shallow to be good."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE OF 2012 :)
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,overall a great movie
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"I have waited for two years for this movie and it's finally here.  It's the biggest action movie of the year so far, and certainly the most anticipated.  It's THE AVENGERS!!!!!!!
     The Tesseract, a newly discovered power source, has been stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D., led by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).  The perpetrator is none other than Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) brother.  So now it's up to Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and a few others to retrieve the Tesseract before anybody gets hurt.  Some assembly may be required to build this team known only as the Avengers.
     As the release of the movie came closer, my expectations for the film went down.  Fortunately, I was wrong.  Let me begin by simply stating that this film is as awesome as you imagined it would be when you first heard about it. 
     Joss Whedon creates a somewhat normal superhero story that lacks some originality.  It's the kind of story that normally, only one hero is needed to be a part of.  And it clearly shows.  Some characters are much more central to the story and have much more screen time than others.  If you're a fan of Iron Man, you won't be disappointed.  Sorry Captain America fans. 
     The special effects are.... as usual.... incredible!  It's almost like you're watching a Michael Bay movie, only with a better story and without giant fighting robots.  The film has fewer explosions and pyrotechnic effects than I thought it would, but I think it makes the film better because they didn't go overboard with the effects. 
     This film is not about the actual team of the Avengers, but instead its formation.  We see that some of the characters don't exactly get along with each other in the beginning, yet have the same common goal; to ensure the safety of Earth and the return of the Tesseract. 
     So, if there are actually those of you reading this who haven't seen the film yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Best movie in a long time
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Great, Spectacular, incredible, astounding!  Saw it when it first came out so this review is late but still such a great movie!!  And the Hulk...BADASS!!!"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,saw it. loved it. and can't wait for the next. did such a good job promoting it to. with the build up from the previous movie releases.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Not as good as it could have been.:):):)
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Top movie ( iron man was the best ) :-)
"Jul 15, 2012",negative,"Got bored halfway through and binned it off.
Emperor's new clothes."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"It is a good action movie,but it is kinda slow and cliched. ""Aliens try to take over the world blah blah blah..."" The whole story feels recycled."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,This movie takes the place as the best movie Ive seen this year!! Without getting into details...this is HOW YOU MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER!! The Hulk steals the stage! Thats it. Bottomline. Great movie!!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,IronMan and Hulk did they thing.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"movie that you have to see,lot of action and comedy :)))"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Just awesome! If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for?"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Its one of the best if u love super heroes movie. Where can u find all the super heroes in one movie.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,It will be hard to beat this comic book interpretation. Sets the bar.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"Best summer movie!! Action, comedy and great special effects. Saw it twice!! Everybody needs to see this movie even if you don't like super heroes or comics."
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,I loved this movie great action comedy frame mix
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,This is the most action packed super hero yet!  I can't wait to buy it in 3D!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Classic!! Saw it 3 times!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,One of the best action movies of the summer.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,I expected this film to fail in a 100 different ways. But it was successful in every way!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Might have been awesome the first time but it isn't that rewatchable
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Why is spider man not in there!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,"put your suit on, this is one wild ride"
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,i absolutely loved it
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,This was a really fun movie and I was expecting less but got more. What else can you ask for in a summer entertainment these days? I really liked the hint at things to come during and at the end of the film. I could watch this movie several times.
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,worth the wait funny and action packed iron man stole the show
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Favorite superheroes movie by far!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,the film of 2012 so far was actually impressed with every part of this film even the over crowding of big actors was handled brilliant!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Can't give it anymore stars!
"Jul 15, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie ever. I hope the WB movie for the Justice League is even half as good.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"I loved loved loved this movie!!!! Totally a awesome movie, it was also pretty clean and didn't have barely any language at all! Wonderful superhero movie, if you don't like superhero movies you won't like this movie. (no duh lol :-))"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Action packed! Not a dull moment! and HELLO THOR!! :P
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Great summer blockbuster
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,The best movie I have seen this summer.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Honestly i was worried about the film because i didn't enjoy most of the comic book transition films. Batman/Michael Keaton. The First 2 Spiderman Films. Christoper Nolans Dark Night. Xmen First Class. Joss is obviously a fan of the genre of Narvel comics. Especially for the mere fact of introducing Thanos. Keep it up and looking forward to future projects
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,So why didn't I see this yet? Well when I get a chance I am going to.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,epic block buster for this summer. hulk was actually decent and comedic. just watch it... do it! and enjoy the hero fantasy in the marvel universe
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,great movie the new haulk maid the movie
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Best Marvel movie yet!!!!!
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,The most fun I've had seeing a movie in a very long time. 9.5/10
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Whedon not only made a great movie, and raised the bar for superhero movies. He made a movie, any director could take a note from."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"An absolute summer crowd pleaser; full of wit, humor, and excitement. While it may have an overuse of almost fully CGI action sequences, you can't avoid walking out feeling entertained"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"It was entertaining. I didn't love it because I expected it to blow my mind, but that was my fault. I shouldn't have expected so much.  As a movie though it was pretty well made that is the reason I still gave it five stars."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,this can very well be the best attempt at an avengers movie we're ever going to get
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"awesome,loved every minute of it. Iron man made this movie!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,I thought some parts were cheesy and slow but there were a lot of hilarious parts that made up for them. :)
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"It was both hilarious and serious, well balanced between both... highly recommend this movie!!!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Basically everything anyone has ever wanted in a superhero movie.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,best movie of all time for being the first avenger movie is bad ass cool pure action and funny 2
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,A pretty cool movie overall with all of marvels favorite superheroes
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Brilliant movie well done.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,This movie encompasses everything I love about the Avengers.  Each character is larger than life and really carries this one.  Oh yeah Digital Domain/HyDraulx- keep wowing me with the destructible environments and animation.  This is by far a stunner.  My only question- how did I miss Stan Lee?  I might have to go see it again just to catch him like Where's Waldo!
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie!! The story, the action, the characters, the comedy. They were all perfect! And the way they incorporated all of their different stories in one movie was brilliant! I though I would have to watch Thor and Captain America before watching Avengers because that's how series movies are. But for this one you didn't. Because they explain all of their stories so well in this movie. And I just have to say I LOVE Robert Downey Jr.!!!! One of the best actors in Hollywood!! I definitely recommended this movie for all ages!!!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Great acting and action packed!
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"There is something that kept me from giving this movie 5 stars but I'm not quite sure what it was. Anyways this is perhaps the best superhero movie that I have ever seen. It has everything you want in a superhero film; action, humor, great special effects. This film raises the bar from any other superhero movie that I have seen. What's not to like about a movie with all of your favorite heroes  in one movie!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Great movie action packed completely funnn at points predictable with sweet surprises:-)
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Absolutely the best super hero movie to date.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"It was nice to see how all the superheros would interact together. They shared the spotlight well and the integrated humour made me really chuckle. It was thought out well and had a good plot, script and cast. A really fun family movie. I look forward to the next one."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"If you're a person that really likes the superhero movies then this is a must see. I am a big fan of the Batman movies. A couple were a tad goofy. But, they all were fun. Each of the characters in this movie we've all seen in their own original movies. It was nice to see the same actors in the same rolls all come together in this movie. I thought you didn't excellent job. I like a lot of different movies. My taste very eclectic. But I think if you like these action figure movies. You got to see this."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Great movie. Showed up had a good time watching and munching popcorn. Before I knew it the final battle came and was great. 3-d was nice added feature.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Not my normal movie, but it was good and kept my attention and smile."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Once you get past the fact that Thor's world has opened a portal to ours, and that a God wants to get a cube thingie there and that flying fortresses hang out over the sky protecting us secretly, this movie was a lot of fun, full of laughs and great fight scenes. But it was farfetched for me personally as an adult enjoyment style film.  My son loved it, and that seems to be all the realism that was required for him.  I give it a 3.5 and put it in the style and genre of Spiderman 3, and any Bruckheimer film. Hey, I liked Con Air too!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Not many movies can keep you glued to the screen for over 2 hours, but the Avengers does just that. A brilliant mix of comedy, action and characters that all have their shining moments (particularly Iron Man and Hulk). The only small problem I had with this movie is the fact that Loki did not seem as much of a threat as I thought he would and you don't take him as serious of a villain as maybe the Red Skull or Iron Monger, but he does his job in the movie and Tom Hiddleston managed to pull off one of the funniest moments of the movie and had a very impressive entrance in the film. This is one of the few movies that I actually watched more than once in the same week because it was that good and I look forward to its blu-ray release."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Loved it. Go see it. There are a couple issues, but most have to do with the fact that it was a huge ensemble movie with characters that I'm used to having way more screen time with. As a result, the characters became caricatures of themselves. Cap is nothing but noble and serious, Tony is nothing but sarcastic, Thor is nothing but ""thees and thous."" The one shining star is Ruffalo's Banner. He was a lot more nuanced and interesting. Action was amazing. I cheered for Hulk's great moments near the end."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Loved it i thought it was a perfect idea to put all of them together
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"The Avengers manages to accomplish something incredible that is  epic in scale, while at the same reminding you that these heroes are all humans at heart. Through excellent direction, tremendous acting, and a script that is as light hearted with its humor as it is intense with its action. The Avengers is a must see for anyone. Additionally the PG-13 rating is very weak, and doesn't contain any sex dialogue or intercourse. The violence is fantasy based, with very little blood and gore."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,This movie was fantastic!
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"best line: Cap. America to Hulk...""Hulk...SMASH!!!"""
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,I loved it plus I got to be with my youngest daughter & my 3 of my grandkids always a blessing when that happens
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,And You Hulk... Smash
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"The movie was awsome!!!!!! I loved it, very entertaing movie!!!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Amazing best movie this year
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"I was seriously impressed, this exceeded my high expectations It's as good as you are going to get in the super hero genre, with high class actors, effects and an honest to god great script that was both dramatic, hilarious and very much true to the tone of the original stories."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Totally worth seeing again.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Sett den 2 ggr pÃ¥ bio och gillar den, roliga inslag av humor och mycket action samtidigt.
Hulken Ã¤r fan roligast i filmen.
Om du inte sett den mÃ¥ste du se den!"
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Great movie, fun to watch, movie was even good enough for my girlfriend :D I would recommend this movie to everyone, but the storie line was pretty weak."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Without a doubt one of the best films Marvel has dished out, and writer/director Joss Whedon does a fantastic job of bringing together some of our favorite movie super heroes and making a smart, witty and action packed adventure with them."
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,The best movie of the year period.
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,Awesome superhero movie
"Jul 14, 2012",positive,"Decent fun, but did not keep me engaged all the time. Perhaps it had one super hero too many (to handle)..."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"As a film, it carries limitations on its potential by virtue of being a comic book story alone - particularly when it comes to character development.  Still, it's a great story, a good step further than your typical high-budget summer blockbuster.  Most importantly, it's exemplary for other films of the genre.  4 1/2 stars for being just plain entertaining to watch."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Combine 4 great Marvel movies and good things are bound to happen.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Can't say more, one of my favourite movie so far in 2012 :)"
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"An action packed film as promised and the essence of the characters not being perfect and getting in arguements is superb.  However watching half the film in an invisible aircraft carrier gets irritating after a while.  While its big climax in New York is an intense and visual thrill, the setup could not have been more bland"
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Loved it and cant wait to own it.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,This movie was badass
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,It was worth every penny that I spent!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,far to much overated and alot doesnt even make sence in it
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Kick ass! Non-stop awesomeness!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Loved it had humor and great action!!!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,the hulk stole the show
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,It's a great movie. It was awesome it's worth going to see.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Loved it overall. A few things I didn't like mainly concerning the Hulk. Director did a great job putting all these heavy hitter Marvel character in one movie and making it work well.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,loved the movie!! it was better than i thought!! will buy it on dvd for sure!!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Surprisingly good. It's always hard to hard to direct a movie with so many super Heroes, but this was good. Kinda long though"
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,One of the best comic based movies I've seen! Highly recommended!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Great and hilarious movie
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"One of the great adaptations of the comic movie era. 
Good characters, humor, story and great action."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Have now seen this film twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. This is a film that knows almost exactly what its core audience wants and gives it to them in buckets. Call it a guilty pleasure, but if you have any interest in Marvel films or the heroes featured you will most likely love this film. Many have complained that the individual films that came out before this were just to introduce them for this film, but I find it hard to believe that Hollywood could be that forward thinking  - normally the plan is produce a movie, see how much it makes, then if it does well, make a sequel or spin off. Some of the original films were hit and miss (I didn't like any of the hulk films, but here he's a superb supporting character), but overall they must have know they were onto a winner. In summary, if you're an action film fan, don't miss this on the big screen in full surround sound and 3D if you can."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"It was pretty cool and very well put together. Overall, I thought it was awesome and hilarious, one of the best movies of all time!"
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Um dos melhores filmes de ficção cientifica.... realmente vale a pena conferir.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen this summer so far!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,awesome movie!  exceeded expectations!!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is fantastic!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,One the greatest movies of all time the acting was amazing the hulk was spit on and it was hilarious this a great movie and I strongly recommend it to any one who's interested ð???
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Failed to reach my expectations, but it was enough for me to want to see the next 'Avengers' chapter."
"Jul 13, 2012",negative,Uh every superhero movie is not good you just can't put people in tights and think that everybody is gonna come out and watch the movie
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,I can know die happily...
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,This movie was beyond amazing and the comedic timing was dead on.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Totally amazing! Had me laughing the whole time and was freaking epic!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,OMG! Best Superhero Movie Ever!!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Amazing. Great action scenes and surprisingly funny at times
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Love Iron Man, Love the Hulk and Love Thor, Captain America was a bit dry and the Black Widow was needed to add some feminism I guess. Laughed, loved the action. Great watch."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Better than expected. Had good humor as well as action, but not even close to the level of Dark Knight as far as story/emotional attachment/acting."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Creative and hilarious.
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,One of the greatest Super Hero movies of all time!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"the story was build nicely, the jokes are fun, but what really turned it down for me is how weak the bad guy is, loki was beaten easily by hulk and the army is quite boring, just lots of them with low intelligent."
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,i wanna give it 6 stars definitly a great movie....i just love the hulk...and thor and iron man
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,Can't wait for the sequel.  Action packed!
"Jul 13, 2012",positive,"Hands down the best film ever made. Just look at the facts, it became the third highest grossing film in a month. The two that beat it, Titanic and Avatar. Two films that had multiple releases and were in theaters so long you could rent it while it was still playing. 
Not to mention the fact that pulling off five successful releases to build up to one should have been impossible. I know not everyone liked all the lead up films, but they all were a success finically."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Absolutely loved the writing, acting, special effects, and fun!  Loved it so much I saw it twice!"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,This movie is so awesome I could watch it over and over again.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Awesome best movie of there's ever!!! Favorite person Captain America!
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Amazing film to bad they made my favorite superhero captain (A)Mercia look like a pansy and cut his story and is part in the film so short he seemed close to worthless
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"130729: Some good humour, a ton of action and wild characters all battling to either destroy earth or protect it. What a great premise. Seriously, Marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years they are all starting to seem the same to me. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie but it's just a battle fest combining all the single characters into a group...but I guess that's what the Avengers has always been about. So, Marvel is giving us just what they've been doing in comics for decades. Good idea. I have to admit; there are some really neat fight scenes here, the most spectacular being when the Hulk takes on a God (Loki). I won't say what happens but it's awesomely nasty."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Awesome. Can't wait til the next one
"Jul 12, 2012",negative,Terrible movie unless you all you are looking for is high tech explosion scenes. I left bored to death after one hour.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Fantastic movie! Every time you get bored with a scene, director Joss Whedon moves you to another scene so the movie doesn't seem slow and stale. Absolutely incredible action sequences and with considerable amount of depth within the characters, this movie really is a top contender against 'The Dark Knight Rises' for movie of the year. Highly recommendable for the entire family and also recommendable for a blu-ray purchase."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"The mixed entertainment of Iron Man's suit, Captain's shield, Thor's hammer, Hulk's smash, Hawkeye's bow as well as Black Widow's well...sexiness. Indeed, Joss Whedon did an excellent job in this Marvel team up."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,i like it ode lmao !!!
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Was ok, effects outstanding, dialogue suspect throughout.  Had its moments."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Very good movie for many reasons. It is funny with it's sarcasm and Iron Man's (A.k.a. Tony Stark) satire and wittyness. But, it has the feeling and setting of a hero movie. Good for kids because they can see and familarize themselfs with superhero's they know, but it also had the feeling of a kick butt movie."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,entertaining movie but overrated at the end of the day
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Compilation of supers intertwined. Great job but id just like to say that just because scarlett johansens character looks good, doesnt make her a super"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"I likes the individual characters-and seeing how their personalities collided when together was interesting! Never seen one of these before, but I loved the action and the plot elements. Very talented actors."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Damn close to perfect in every way!
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,It lived up to the hype and more
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Brilliant in everyway....a must see!
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,not as interesting as Iron Man
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Just like every Marvel movie, its not accurate to the comics. But the story line was pretty good for non comic book readers. Great action and special effects and even laughs. Must see."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Joss should write all the super hero movies from now on.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie so far this year.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,oh yeah!! la necesito!!
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Brilliant movie. A must watch, thoroughly entertaining flick."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Ni bien empiza la pelicula ya es buena. Todos los actores dieron increibles actuaciones inclusive si Robert Downey Jr se roba el show. El guion es excelente, teniendo partes de comedia pero al mismo tiempo respetando a los heroes, Joss Whedon aparte de dirigirla increiblemente la escribio de maravilla. Toda la pelicula es espectacular asi que quien no la vio realmente la cago!"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Rather impossible to not love this one. Charismatic lead performances, a fine pace, a bombastic soundtrack and some unique action in a genre that's lacked it manage to form Marvel Studio's strongest installment to date. Really worth the five-year wait."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Joss is a movie genius I'll watch anything with his name attached but this is Joss and a lot of my favorite superheroes what could be missing?
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,I don't like the comic books but I really did like this movie and it made me want to see the other individual movies about them.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,The end of movie was the best part..
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Good film with a great mix of action, comedy and drama but a little dull at times."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Has to be one of the best Marvel Films made so far
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Tremendously well made, one of the best of the year"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"I think what the Avengers is an interesting film, dares to tell their characters and has a very good development in the script. Whedon brings the history of our childhood and that is important."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,I loved this movie and how they brought most of the Marvel characters together.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"movie wuz dpe dawg, not nuf blakk hoes doe"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Joss Wheadon did a spectacular job in this movie, could not stop smiling. Really good paced story keeps the eye moving, not to mention the great chemistry between characters, and how well the respective actors did with their roles.	Having Wheadon as a director sure have The Avengers movie the edge in special effects as well as giving America's favorite superhero alliance the overhaul that it needed. There were no small roles, no small parts, and no small actors in this year's Avengers initiative."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,A must see for all ages. Fans of comic or just fans of really well done summer blockbusters. Comedy and star studded cast. You will not regret watching this. Bring friends and family along for a fun conversation after the movie. :)
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"The movie presents all the characters well, and it is very entertaining to watch!"
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Best movie Marvel has made thus far I'm anticipating the sequel. This movie had action and comedy loved it
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Hulk was indeed incredible. And it's not just Hulk but everyone.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Great action and special effects punctuated by occasional wit that is surprisingly funny given the genre
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Probably the absolute best action/superhero film I've seen. Awesome movie.
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,"Blockbuster of the Year. It delivers what it promises to deliver; exci(teen) scenes, familiar faces, purposeless story and a ton of cheesy humor for the hipster era. A lethal mix for art but an undoubtedly profitable undertaking."
"Jul 12, 2012",positive,Great Epic Movie Awsome.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Awesome!!!!!!! Best ever, very good movie go watch it."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,This was a great movie!!
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Good Movie' Great Movie' But Not Very Good And very Great As ""Watchmen"".
""Watchmen"" is World Most beautiful and insightful Comic Superheroes Movie."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Great cap to years of following marvel movies leading to this point.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,I love DC but Marvel put their ankles in it with this movie! Gotta give it up!
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,I seen this movie at the drive in an it's so awesome  it keeps u on ur feet an there's never a dull moment I think it's the best movie ever made I would rate it 6 stars if they had that many
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Pretty good, but I thought it would be even better cause of the high ratings... the 1st half of the movie was kinda boring."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,best superhero movie ever the only thing is there is to much talking but the action is great
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"This movie is great, it really is, it's fun, the action is spectacular and the chemistry between the actors is great. I have one problem that prevents the film from being a true classic for me and that is the villain. Tom Hiddleston gives it his all for sure, but his character is easily the least interesting in the film. I also can't help but feel that Samuel L Jackson is sleep walking his way through his role. Besides that the movie is outstanding. 
9/10"
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Aside from The Dark Knight, this may be the best super hero movie to date"
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,That was the first movie I have sat down and watched since surgery. It has a great cast and awesone special effects!!
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Not perfect, but very good. Would love to see DC give this same treatment to a JLA movie."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,It is awesome and so funny
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Saw this in 3d and 2d, have been waiting for this film for so long and it didn't disappoint at all, can't wait for the DVD!!"
"Jul 11, 2012",negative,"A very simple story line, how about a subplot."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Hands down the best movie I've seen in a couple of years. I wish there we're six stars so I could rate it higher.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! Must see thumps up!
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,This movie was the best super hero film I've seen. Not to mention The Dark Knight
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Great movie for all ages.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"Really enjoyed this.  Hulk stole the show...well, Stark was entertaining, just in a different way.  Overall, a nice addition to the comic series."
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Perfection of the superhero genre.  That which all others shall be measured.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Couldn't be better. Not perfect. Just damn good.
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"better than the average comicstrip movie, but i didnt enjoy it much. everything felt  a bit small scale for a blockbuster movie. also scarlett must have a great agent because shes a horrible actress, absolutely no talent at all!"
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,"It was definitely entertaining and good but I just didn't feel that it was as Amazing as a lot people seem to think it is, After seeing it, I felt a bit too mentally exhausted  to be excited afterwards unlike Thor which left me feeling alot more excited"
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Definitely amazing movie!
"Jul 11, 2012",negative,Didn't really get going till the end
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,Mark Ruffalo makes the perfect hulk!! Definitely a must-see!!
"Jul 11, 2012",positive,This is an awesome movie.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Was a little worried that they might kill the story or fail to capture each character equally but they pulled it off with stand out performances from Ruffalo and Downey Jnr. The special effects were pretty huge and the film was entertaining from start to finish.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Avengers couldn't have been done any better. Comic book fan or not, the movie will please all viewers. Its wildly entertaining, well acted, funny...but not too cheesy, and sets the bar for superhero movies and how they should be made. Only the Dark Knight surpasses it for the best comic movie of all time, and barely."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Feels like an ensemble movie, as it should but could have been alot more interesting with even more bickering between characters... but it was a great year start of comic boook movies"
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"The movie is a success by not  crumbling under the weight of putting 7 heroes(4 super) from 5 other films and telling a story that puts the final stamp on the phase one films from Marvel, keeping  everything before The Avengers in tact hinting to an even more epic future. But  a lot of the dialogue  was goofy, and it didnâ(TM)t take as many risks as I felt a great movie in general should. Bringing all the these superheroes together also felt pointless because there didnâ(TM)t seem to be a major threat."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Awesome! Just so friggin good!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon, my hats off to you sir!  This is every action and comic book fan boyâ(TM)s dream!  It has everything in it and delivers nothing but thrill after thrill.  It beautifully wraps up all the other Marvel movies together in an action packed joyride that is this spectacle. And come on, Hulk killed it!  And leaving it open for another installment is exciting, but only if Joss takes the helm once again."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie, absolutely zero disappointment."
"Jul 10, 2012",neutral,This movie is not worth it to go see in 3 D in my opinion. Normally I like to go see a got action fick this just did not cut it for me.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,most amazing movie. movie of the YEAR!!!!!!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Not really my kind of movie but others interested in this stuff really enjoyed it.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Thoroughly entertaining - and they managed to give most of the characters enough screen time & story line to satisfy.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Very good I would go back and see it again just like every other movie I've seen this year
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Excellent Super Hero movie.  I admit, this genre is really starting to wear thin on me, but Avengers was pretty cool.  Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Awesome. that is all.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,it all goes to the larger than life action sequences the movie had. the down sides for it was that it took too long for the movie to really kick start. not to mention the movie didn't have much of a story to begin with nor did it end well with it's cliche ending.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Good family action movie.
"Jul 10, 2012",neutral,just ok..another spin off
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Great movie. I love the dc comics and the movies just keep getting better.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,They didn't really stay true to the Comics!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Very good fan movie.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Great adventure.... with owning.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,maybe one of the best movies of all time.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon has set a whole new standard for superhero films! This original and wildly entertaining superhero flick doesn't entertain with depth or development but with it's eye-popping action and charming humor. It's not the best comic movie ever, nor is it the best movie of the summer but it's definitely up there."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Brilliant. Simple yet effective. Bravo.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Really cool movie. Gotta love the Hulk and Iron man
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"The perfect mix of fun, funny, and saving the world makes this superhero movie a top notch film and the action and special effects are just amazing!  If you have not seen this yet you are robbing yourself of a great film!  So go see it now!"
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"It was really good, but a bit corny imo."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Finally Joss Whedon is relevant again!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Fabulous.  Joss Whedon knocks it out of the park.  Best superhero movie ever!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Each character was developed at the same pace as everyone else leading to a jam-packed mouth-watering ending of flying and fighting superhumans.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,fucened. awesome movie and funny as hell
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"almost a perfect movie, great story and even better acting."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"The long awaited group effort of the Marvel universe has finally arrived. Pretty much the ultimate summer movie for easy viewing pleasure. Whedon definitely has the right instincts and makes sure the story and the human elements don't get crushed under the heavy CGI effect bombardment. Downwy Jr as expected is the real star with lots of great lines (some likely ad-libbed) but all the others all also given their moments to shine and we even get a true emotional moments from the two ""non-superhuman"" Avengers from Johansson and Renner. Ruffalo is also the best Hulk so far. Too bad then that the bad guys are mostly faceless cannon fodder and even though Loki has his moments he doesn't really rise to the level where we would (at least little) doubt the success of our heroes."
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,greatest movie this year.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Great combination of the  superhero genre characters. Well done.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER! Newcomer Mark Ruffalo joins the hero genre as the new Hulk, alongside Robert Downey Jr, Samuel L Jackson, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, all of them reprising their Marvel hero roles brilliantly! Tom Middlesworth also did a great job as the villain Loki, whos latest evil plot forces Nick Fury (Jackson) to assemble a team of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man (Downey Jr), Captain America (Evans), the Hulk (Ruffalo), Thor (Hemsworth), Hawkeye and Black Widow! Tons of Marvel-ized action make this a must see superhero movie! My favorite superhero movie EVER!"
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,An amazing mix of action comedy and drama. Marvel has really out done itself. The actors were spot on in how the characters think and act in certain situations. And each superhero gets a fair amount of screen time each so don't be afraid that you won't see enough of your favorite character.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"This film was absolutely amazing! I was really worried about the amount of screen time for all of the actors and their respective roles, but they did a great job getting everyone in there. I absolutely loved the combined powers thing that Cap and Iron Man did. I didn't like that they made the hulk ape-ish but Ruffalo was perfect for Banner. The quarrel between him and Thor was epic. Can't wait to see Thanos as the baddie for the next film!"
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,the only superhero movie with similar Tomatometer and audience ratings. It's unbelievable to think that Whedon has found the golden mean between CGI and SFX and a good script.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Awesome! But It's good if you see all the movies about the characters before seeing this so your not confused.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,This movie is basically all action. I mean with a total of 6 heroes and a villain army there is nothin much more u can have and if u r the movie person even if u don't love action movies this is the kind of movie that u need to see.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Loved it! true marvel movie!
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Stylishly directed superhero flick with a tinge of comedy. One of the best films of 2012.
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Loved it. Was really funny. Totally recommend it
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie ever love it
"Jul 10, 2012",negative,It was one of the worst marvel movies ive ever saw most of it was boring expect some action parts. i would not see it agian
"Jul 10, 2012",neutral,Couldn't wait for it to end. I wish I could enjoy such movies like everyone else seems to be able to?
"Jul 10, 2012",positive,"If you've enjoyed Joss Whedon's past work, you're familiar with his knack for writing snappy dialogue and strong female characters. You'll find it in his latest, ""The Avengers"". The pace of the movie never slows down, and the cast rises up to the challenge of Whedon's script. 

Great action, great dialog, excellent inter-character chemistry, and just fun to watch. Performances of note include Robert Downey, Jr. as the snarky Tony Stark/Iron Man, as well as Tom Hiddleston as a deliciously deranged Loki. If you liked the preceding movies (ironman, Thor, Capn America), you will love this."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,best super hero movie EVER... last 30 min is non stop action.
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie that I've seen in a long time!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"A brilliant masterpiece, in short. Every moment was captivating, nothing really fell short of amazing. It lived up to all the hype, and truly met my expectations."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Best. Superhero. Movie. Ever.
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,One of my five best superhero movies ever.1.the dark knight 2.the avengers 3.batman begins 4.spider-man 2 5.x-men 2
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Seen it it was Tigh But Dam How Many Time;s do they Gotta change the Caracter Of The Hulk The Guy From Part One Was The Best, Then In part two outa no were they changed to a different guy.,, oh and suprise in The Advengers Hole Different Person Hate when Movie's Do That...  But the movie was good got to see all them join force's.."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"I would give this more stars if it were possible! Kick ass! Excellent job at giving our heroes equal screen and story time so that it didn't feel like hero ""xxxxx"" and the Avengers. Joss gave us gold! I saw it five times already and will probably see it once more before it leaves theaters and will definitely buy it on BluRay!"
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"The fast paced, action packed Avengers consist of some funny and exciting heroes. The Hulk steals the show with his humour while green whilst Thor adds some comical medieval remarks. Tony Stark is well, Tony Stark and the two new ones: Black Widow and Hawkeye are young characters with plenty of movie life left in them."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Overall great movie.  Could have done a bit more.
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,The Boy's Love It. GO SUPER!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,had a great combo of action and humor
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,This film was a very well done film. One of Robert Downey's best.
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! I LOVE it
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Overlong, drags in the middle, but boasts an epic final sequence for the ages."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Loved It! I can't wait to watching it again when the DVD comes out!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"The dialogue and script are extremely corny, but ""The Avengers"" is a summer blockbuster at its finest. You get what you paid for: great special effects, action and humor."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie so far. Hands down
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"This is how a team superhero film should be, ahem X-men, Fantastic Four."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Fantabulous Comic to Life Movie!!!!!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"A film I have long awaited for, The Avengers shows many lovable Marvel characters together, gives them all time on the screen, and keeps the audience occupied with action, humor, and character depth. Thank you Joss Whedon and Mark Ruffalo. This film is not overrated."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Great movie, reminds me of Watchmen, get the feeling the Watchmen comics were a spoof of the avengers/justice league."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"An amazing action movie and one of the best superhero movies ever made. This was an extremely fun film to watch every step of the way, and each character was done justice to. The action sequences were flawless and the C.G.I. was a spectacle in its self. The story was surprisingly well written, and was fun to see all these big superheroes interact with each other on camera. With the perfect mix of fun comedy, a well done story and flawless action sequences, The Avengers is a great movie to watch."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Saw it twice!  Love Thor'
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"For those who like the Marvel movies, this is by far the best!"
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Being a casual comic book person, I was very impressed with this movie because I did NOT need to know about any of the backgrounds of the characters. I did NOT see Thor or Captain America, but I could pick up the gist of each character. I believe the movie was well-paced, had great timing on humor, and had very likeable characters. I cannot wait to see this movie again when it comes out on Blu-Ray!"
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Believe the hype! I went to see it because of the hulk and iron man. Captain America was awesome! Loved this film!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic book movies ever made. Hands down. Great action, storyline, acting, and humor."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Hands down one of the two best movies I've seen all year. The cast, the story, the humor, the action, the eye candy, the cinematography... All if it seemed perfect to me."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"This was a movie some 5-6 years in the making.  How they managed to get all these fantastic actors to commit to these characters for that duration is impressive and ideal.  Some would argue that this movie is devoid of plot and that it is all action.  I would disagree based on the fact that this movie is a culmination of five other movies that preceded it.  The two Iron Man movies, the Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America all lead up to The Avengers.  This film was meant to be the climax of the storyline.  The characters were perfect.  The battles were perfect.  I left the theatre feeling proud of the job that Marvel and Joss Whedon, and everyone involved did.  They did justice to the Avengers.  Quite possibly, the best Marvel superhero movie ever."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,This is the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. EVER.
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon does it again another amazing film! I hope the studios allow him to continue to make great movies!
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Great can't wait for the second part
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"...and finally Marvel revealed its baby. With years in the making, with so much background added to it and with such a hype created around it, anything short of amazing would've let it down. And it didn't....
4 superheroes, 2 super agents and 1 mastermind of all this against a top-notch cool looking Loki. This movie had exactly the right amount of action, humor and drama. The script was water tight and the screenplay so smooth that people unaware of this Marvel universe didn't have much of a problem in understanding what the hell is happening. Characters and their individual spaces were clearly and neatly drawn giving each one to grow equally and come together in the end as a TEAM against the villian. There were a lot of places where this movie could've gone wrong with so many super-duper heroes in a single frame but director Joss Whedon made sure of covering his tracks tactfully.
The special effects were top-notch, story was good, screenplay simple and crisp and Joss Whedon literally knew how and what to get out of his actors. All were great but a little-toned-down-on-anger Hulk and Iron Man come at the top.
An amazing movie. A must watch."
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,"Phenomenal, one of the best movies of the year, and arguably the best comic book movie ever!"
"Jul 9, 2012",positive,Entertaining for Comic Book fans or Action Film fans not familiar with Comics.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Fantastic Movie, A rollercoaster ride from start to finish. I really enjoyed this film. Very funny in some parts and jaw dropping action in others. With a awesome cast who play their parts very well. If you haven't seen this film yet then you are really missing out. A five star experience."
"Jul 8, 2012",negative,"This film is mediocre at best. ""The Avengers,"" came out in May at the tail end of the Superhero fad that has struck Hollywood over the past few years.

I enjoyed it, so don't misunderstand what I'm saying. It just needed to step up it's game in order to compete with some of the other movies that are circulating out there. A lot of people loved it, but I'm not a lot of people. It had it's moments of well done special effects, humor, and dialogue. I was hoping for better, but it didn't meet my expectations.

This movie was crowded, and, truth be told, there was no solid story line or structure in this. We just saw a bunch of super heroes get together and fight the bad guy.

I probably will not be seeing this film again in the near future."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"It's a fun summer superhero blockbuster. Joss Whedon has a tight script, but he leaves his characters unexplored. And that's exasperating."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Amazingly acted, directed, and sporting an incredible Joss Whedon script, i have not a single qualm with this movie. I would pay to see it again. And that's saying something!!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"A group of unique superheroes, after they finish cracking jokes and fighting amongst themselves, come together and take down a foe with an unlimited power source and an army equal in size."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Very solid... sadly, I only ever watched ""Iron Man"" before this one, so I didn't get to benefit from 4 years of build-up.  Still, it was a good film on its own merits, with a good mix of action, laughs, and tension.  Of course, who would expect less from Joss Whedon?"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie ever made!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Great action, special effects, humor, and story. Mixes the previous films perfectly. Well acted and action packed. Felt much shorter than what it was.  One of the best movies of the year and one of the best comic book movies ever. Can't wait to see it again!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"While I believe too much was revealed in the trailers and television spots to not have its audience surprised, the film had enough character development, humor, and action to keep it interesting. Also, the nerd in me would switch out Black Widow and Hawkeye for the Wasp and Giant Man in a heartbeat. Either way, four years was worth the hype and the wait!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Great superheroes, great cast, entertaining and action packed movie."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"This film exceeded my expectations and satisfied my inner geek. It has everything I look for in a movie: humor, drama, action, suspense and more. The characters and their interactions with each other were surprisingly entertaining and well executed. It brings us the fun, creativity and spark back into movies that we've all been missing. This is a movie worth seeing and it has definitely raised the bar for action and superhero movies."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,that was so awsome i would see it a thousand times
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"A perfect superhero movie! There has been no other film that creates the perfect blend of superhero action, laughs and drama. Fantastic, must see!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,well im more of an xmen girl but this is still a great super hero movie
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Loved this movie especially wen hulk grabs lokie by his ankels and slams him!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Touted as one of the best superhero movies ever, this movie did not disappoint. While many complained about its lack of character development, that's what the other Marvel movies were for. It does well to bring all these characters together and show how all their idiosyncrasies can fit together. Kudos to Marvel/Disney on getting this one right."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie to date and I'm a big fan of the genre. Well balanced with all the heroes.  Hulk was my personal favourite.  There was a scene between Hulk and Loki that still has me rofl'ing.  Bottom line: must see and definitely worth the $$$.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,it is the best film iv sen this yer
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Awesome flick the whole family will like!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"The film was absolutely awesome! I definitely recommend seeing Thor, Capt America, The Hulk and Iron Man 1 & 2 prior to the movie. If nothing else, especially Thor. This was definitely a movie appropriate for all ages, and the acting was very great. I hope they make a 2nd"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I'm not sure what to say here. It's ""The Avengers!"" The culmination of the last several years of Marvel movies, bringing the Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captian America franchises together in one awesome movie. And it's a really fun ride. Great visuals, a good script, etc. A summer popcorn movie. Don't expect high art, but it's definitely worth the time, especially if you've seen the other Marvel movies. Then again, if you see this movie, you probably already know what you're getting into already."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Simply put, this is what super hero movies are supposed to be like. Joss Whedon takes an entire team of a-listers and somehow makes a movie that meshes them all into a cohesive unit while still showing their differences. A+"
"Jul 8, 2012",negative,Tony stark is still the best character. Movie felt a lot like transformers. Only two stars.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Pure amazing eye candy, loved it and so did the kids."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Loved this movie, a great ensemble film. Kept me interested and had great moments of comic relief. Joss Whedon really can't seem to do wrong."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,its a great movie I loved it so much action and comedy also best actors
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Greatest superhero movie ever made. No arguments.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Best Comic movie so far can't wait to see the next one!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever. Laughed the whole time. The theater audience stood and applauded when it was over.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"They could have done this wrong in so many ways. That fact alone earns this movie the five stars. But they didn't just avoid doing it wrong. They did it very, very right. The bad guy's motives are nothing to write home about, and there are a few parts that suffer from Fridge Logic (How did Thor get back to Earth? Wasn't it convenient that the doctor added a loophole in his device? How about the part where (as HISHE.com points out) the minions all die Phantom-Menace style?) but the movie has wit, humanity, and it really does every character justice. The next movie can only get even better, since they won't have to establish all of these relationships and antagonisms. I'm looking forward to the result."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,What a great modern action movie
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Great! It was one of the greatest comic book movies ever.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,We were told by many to see it.  Glad we took the time to watch the individual stories beforehand to add even more to the enjoyment.  We even watched Thor and while it will not be in my top movies of all times  it was a good primer.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I was entertained the entire near two and a half hours. There was action, super heroes, aliens, Gods and lots of freaking explosions. Was I the only one who laughed when Loki called Black Widow a mewling quim? No, just me? Okay."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Good... but I probably would have loved it seeing it in theaters. A little overrated from everyone else by the time I finally saw it
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Exceeded my expectations.  Seriously - how easy would this have been to completely mess up?  And far worse movies have performed just as well.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Can't wait for part two!!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Simply amazing! Undoubtedly the best super hero movie yet!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,best superhero movie of all time
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,This is a great marvel movie!:D
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I love this movie- while there isnt much for character development, but they did great for being a crossover film. I love Loki and Black Widow, and Captain America is a fitting team captain."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"God knows Luci Daniell ain't paid money to see this movie, but John gives it three and a half, and I trust his evaluation completely."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Way to much to say! awesome on so many levels!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I felt lost, like there wasnâ(TM)t really a beginning, like I shouldâ(TM)ve watched ALL the movies to appreciate it more."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Robert Downy Goodness and company fill the action packed film full of entertaining moments for comic and non-comic fans alike.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Wah!!! Its superb!!!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Excellent action adventure superheroes extravaganza.
Great cast including Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Stellan Skarsgård, Samuel L Jackson and the always wonderful Scarlett Johansson. 
Great score by Alan Silvestri."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Great movie.. They found enough important screen time for each character and for me that vital.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Yeah...it really wasn't that big of a deal.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Just all around amazing. No complaints.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Great, great superhero movie."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,A solid comic book film. Sets the path for Disney to make a shit-load of money here in the next 5-10 years.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,The Best Marvel movie yet. I can't wait for another one to come out. Ready for Iron Man 3
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Not bad... for a superhero movie with a bunch of guys in funny suits.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is charming, hilarious, action-packed, sad at times and filled with complex and 'marvelous' characters. It raises the bar for the genre and hopefully blazes the trail for other fantastically written action-movies whose action scenes don't drown out character development. Thank you, Joss Whedon!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,who said comics are not fun
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a fantastic superhero film that utilizes the abilities of their fantastic list of actors and isn't ever trumped by the music or the usual loud, obscene sounds that dominate most superhero movies."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,They knocked this movie out of the park. It just doesn't get any better than this movie.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"One of the greatest movies of the year, basically 7 Marvel movies in ONE."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever made.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Oww yeah!! All the ingredients of a good summer blockbuster flick!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I would give this movie 6 stars or more if that was an option.  Joss Whedon knows how to make a comic book movie. The characters were true to character without being stupid or sappy, the action great and THE HULK!!!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Only thing wrong with this film is, its not long enough."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,A summer blockbuster that well lives up to the hype.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,A summer blockbuster that well lives up to the hype.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,This is a Awesome movie!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,great movie for the whole Family!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is.......really good, smash-up, superhero summer fun........

Some of the world's greatest superheroes are assembled (including Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Hawkeye, Thor, and Black Widow) to protect it against destruction......Everyone is cast perfectly here (especially newcomer Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk - he's awesome!).......All of the characters work well together and by themselves.......Hollywood finally got the comic-book superhero movie right. This is the perfect mix of action, humor, story, and style - everything you'd want in a superhero summer action movie, and then some.......In a way, this movie outshines the current ""dark"" Batman franchise (the new ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is going to have a high standard to match)...... The fight scenes in Midtown New York, around Grand Central Station, are down right amazing .......A great way to start of the summer movie season!

Personal experience used to write this review: 143 minutes, of watching comic book excitement assemble and come to life on the big screen.

"Jul 8, 2012",positive,jouissif rien que pour voir Hulk se déchainé....
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Just what you would expect...a whole lotta action interspersed with smart-ass banter amongst the superheroes.  I <3 Ironman
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,The best so far this yr
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"The Avengers, A great movie it had it all it had some comedy and it was loaded with action just in all out great movie so nicely written just a flat out great movie."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Great movie, action packed, and funny."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Really good, but could've used spiderman haha."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Wow! This film may the only comic book adaptation to give Dark Knight a run for its money. Instant classic.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Awesome movie can not wait for part 2
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. You have to see for yourself how awesome this movie is.
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,this movie was a great movie my brother didnt want to watch it but when the hulk came in he loved it
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Scarlett is not the best option for action movies...but well, the rest is just amazing"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Awesome..even if ur not a fan u will still get the quick wit n gr8 action from AVENGERS!
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Wonderful movie. They did a great job!! I do wish they included thor's love interest though
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Great blend of action and drama. Food for thought: If Hulk can't pick up Thor's hammer, can he pick up Thor when he has the hammer in his hand?"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"fits perfectly with the multiple films leading up to its release. A job well done by Joss Whedon, especially considering the other films were done by other poeple with different styles."
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year. Can Batman knock it off the pedestal??
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"I loved it.  Simple as.  No, it isn't perfect but damn, what were we all expecting?  Nothing near a film this funny, engaging, exciting and balanced.  I have a lot invested in this from the comics and as a fan it delivered everything I wanted and far more.  The set up has been fantastic but really, full praise to the Whedon for making it more than the parts.  Hulk for the Oscar!"
"Jul 8, 2012",positive,"Frankly, it was the best film in the history of ever."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a fun, fast faced, extremely well done action film. Joss Whedon creates some great set pieces, and the movie never feels like it has run down. The scenes of characters talking out there problems between the fighting are great too, filled with drama and one liners. A great payoff to all the movies leading up to it."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Great move watched it 4 times. It's one not to miss.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"All the  characters get equal screen time and nothing is too overbearing. The plot is really, really simple but you can still tell there was a lot of care put into the story."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Pretty much the perfect super-hero movie, at least in terms of the breadth and scope that it covers. Reeling in that many characters, giving them ample screen time and weight within the story, and still having it all come together as a dynamic and satisfying experience... Damn impressive. Joss Whedon may have just cemented his station in the realm of blockbuster directors with this ensemble piece. Now if it could only help resurrect Firefly.... ;)"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,the best superhero movie ever
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Fantastic! Very funny, just want it needed!"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of 2012! Well thought out; solid acting and just simple great action!! Worth the money to see in theaters if you haven't already!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Amazing...it helps if you know the back story of the characters but all in all a Top notch movie.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Excellent action & storyline!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Best movie of the year so far.  Robert Downey Jr. never disappoints as his role in Iron Man.  The action scenes are out of this world and it was just a really fun movie to watch.  There is a lot of playful banter between the characters, and I couldn't help but feel like this was a later movie in a series because of how well the characters played off each other.  I can't wait for the sequels."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Unbelievable! All ready waiting for the sequel!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Absolutely excellent for anyone of any age. Plenty of unexpected humor, story, and great characters!"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"It had all the action I was looking for and more. It would be better if they added some more superheroes like spiderman though, but I'm not here to complain, it was very fun and a great movie!"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,pretty good. And interesting to see the super heroes altogether. Iron man still funny. The funny part is bigger than the action.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Was not expecting to like this movie half as much as I did.  Freaking awesome.  Go watch it.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Absolutely brilliant. The first director to understand the hulk and the first actor to play him to perfection. Joss Whedon does an amazing job of giving each star their time in the limelight. The movie is filled with Joss Whedon's one liners that are so perfectly timed. My only criticism is that the bad guys aren't unique. Not enough time is spent understanding their motives. They are faceless. That is a minor nitpick with an absolute fantastic move. Thanks Joss!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,It was good I liked it
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Awesome! Love the action & humor
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,This was a movie with a lot of action
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Gives new meaning to the phrase ""battle of epic proportions"""
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"The movie lived up to its hype, and perhaps even reached the level of other recent superhero masterpieces like Iron Man 1 and the Dark Knight."

"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Awesome popcorn movie. No substance but lots of laughs and great effects.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Best action movie ever, hands down!"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Great overall flick.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"While lacking the deeper story line of Nolan's Batman, Avengers is adept at bringing together the various films leading to its release,with a perfect blend of action, comedy and fan service and the film all future superhero films will be judged against."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Best movie of the summer!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"The Avengers: 
****1/2 

I was looking forward to this film since 2008, but I'll admit I had my worries. While I enjoyed all of the other Marvel Universe films, I could not help but fear that this would be one giant mess. Those fears were put to rest thanks to talent of Joss Wheton who took all these charcters, put them in one film and gave them all equal time and impotance to the story, while still giving great action, clever dialog, and even some hetwarming moments. The biggest suprise in the film is Mark Rufflo's Hulk, who is THE best onscreen hulk i've seen yet, and he really deserves praise for making Bruce Banner and the Hulk a great 3 dimensional charcter. 
The Avengers is one of the best superhero films of all time. A true success in terms or writting, acting, and directing."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,So much fun. Seen it twice. Might see it again.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,This is te best movie ever!!! A must see! Btw Loki ROCKS!!!!!!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,loved this movie this is the Marvel universe
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"After watching The Avengers again my opinion of it has somewhat soured. Thinking about it more than I did at the time, it feels more and more like a Michael Bay film. You've got the quips, you've got the boom boom blow everything up every five minutes and so much happens in the space of two hours that it makes all the other Marvel films feel pathetic by comparison. Even the visual effects feel somewhat used. Ultimately this is a film that tries to go places but ends up right back where it started."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Why was I annoyed by ScarJo though? I'm probably just jealous.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Pure blockbuster fantastic! Just hope they can keep up the story and not lose it in special effects.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"While not on the caliber of something like The Dark Knight or Iron Man in terms of story telling or character development, The Avengers is funny,action packed and is a more than satisfying conclusion to a build up that has spanned 4 years."
"Jul 7, 2012",negative,"This isn't what most of us die hard comic book fans were hoping for, all there is to this silly movie is hammy dialogue, unnecessary scenes which contain useless and annoying overacting."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"""I am just a playboy millionaire philanthropist""!! :)"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Amazing Movie! The Acotrs/Actresses Have The Perfect Portrayal Of Each Avengers Characters Every Second Was A Must Watch, Without Blinking."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"as much of a fan of marvel comics as i am, Im only giving this movie 3 out of 5 stars. its your typical action movie. Neat graphics and animation. Not much story or depth of character, causing parts of the film to seem corney and rushed. overall, I'd call this summer blockbuster overrated."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,My favorite superhero movie so far!!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,It was the best marvel  movie EVER. Now im waiting for spiter man
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,one of the best movies I've seen . this is definitely on my current top 5 best .
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Hectic roller coaster of a movie... awesome special effects though...
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Pretty damn entertaining
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Come on. It's Marvel. It's many of my favorite characters from some of my favorite films rolled into one movie. It's a Geek-gasm! And finally, a Hulk I can truly appreciate!"
"Jul 7, 2012",neutral,think I am the only one on the planet disappointed by this movie
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,YEA YES YES! THIS WAS AWESOME!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Can't wait to own it
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,good in bits and pieces..
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"If you really liked any of the individual movies of The Avengers, you'll like this one. Just buy your copy. :)"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"We liked it, kids liked it, now we own it :)"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Great popcorn movie and a great taste of the Marvel movies to come. Hopefully they can fit in one more Avengers movie before they have to reboot the characters.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,This a great movie and would defenitly recommend it
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"A little long, BUT, A fiery blast - peppered w/Downey Jr's wise cracking and wit made this fun. One usually wonders whose super powers can best the others and that fantasy came alive as one super hero was pitted against another. Thor was much cooler in his own flick though. Yet, his ""brother"" was perfectly cast as the villain you love to hate. Can anyone say sequel - 'cause its coming..."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Marvel movies have always been of interest to me but after captain America and Thor I began to loose that interest but after this movie it completely made up for that lost interest. I absolutely loved this movie for the stunning story and all around entertaining action and the wonderful performances by the cast
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Boy Howdy talk about throwing in the Kitchen Sink, what didn't Marvel throw into this flick.  One of the best things about The Avengers?  All those Marvel films leading up to it.  Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain American.  Now tell me what other Franchise in Hollywood History had trailers like those!!!

Leading up to the slam bang The Avengers.  is it perfect? No.  In some ways its almost impossible to make a 'Perfect' Superhero film.  (Yes I know Dark Knight reaches for it and just about makes it but I have one major issue with DK that keeps it from being Dang Near Perfect.)

The Avengers sports one of the better Villains in Loki and everyone else delivers as well.  For me one of the actual best moments was the final Easter Egg at the very end.  That was GRRREAT (To quote Tony the Tiger)!  It made me wish that Marvel would, on a lark make a movie based on a three part mini-series comic from the early '90's called Damage Control.  It could be a Cable movie even.  Great idea never ever explored before on film but you almost get a taste of it during this greatest-so-far Coda's to a Superhero movie ever."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,it was really good and kinda funny
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Brilliant moves, really enjoyed, took my fourteen year old son with me, not sure who enjoyed it more.
If you like Marvel characters you will love this."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,1st movie watched in a 3D cinema..
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Easily the greatest comic book movie ever!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,The best movie I've seen in theaters this year! I've seen it three times already and plan to see it again!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Watching this film makes me want to buy all the comics x loved it
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Amazing stunts, amazing actors, amazing effects, and an amazing film. The Avengers is one of my most anticipated movies of 2012, and after I walked out of that movie house, it was 5x better than I expected. By far, this is the Best movie of 2012, yet. This movie made it into my top 20 films of 2012.

Note: Mark Ruffalo did a wonderful performance, and he deserves an Oscar for his role as Bruce Banner/ Incredible Hulk."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"To be honest, I didn't enjoyed this movie as much i expected it. Maybe my expectations were huge unlike the movie."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"It would seem as though too many superheroes played by too many movie stars would dilute the plot and hinder the film, in fact it does the exact opposite. Well done."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"5 Diamonds! This is by far the best Action, Sci-Fi, etc. movie of all time."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Another superhero(s) film with a mixture of action, humour and credit goes to iron man n hulk for salvaging an otherwise masala mix"
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Awesome Awesome movie!!!!  I would pay to watch it again!!!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Great action as expected and love the dialogue banter. Nice Job again and again.
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"An awesome bundle of all our fav superheroes. With Downey's humor, Ruffalo's spot on performance, and other key assets this film gets it done right."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Will watch it many times more!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,How can you not just love it ? :)
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Very strong superhero flick. Humour, acting, intelligence, story and, of course, action are all very much present - and nicely done, too."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Best Comic Book Movie Ever
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"The Avengers definitely delivers and stays faithful to the comics. Robert Downey Jr. Samuel Jackson, and Tom Hiddleston carry the movie."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon rocks!  The cast performed perfectly and I would see this movie again in a heartbeat!
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,"Hey this is the assemble cast 
Woh.."
"Jul 7, 2012",positive,better than I thought!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Great beginning to end i was worried the movie would focus on one hero more then the other they did a great job
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) 
make The Avengers. This film is pretty sweet. 
 The Avengers assemble to face off against the god of mischief himself, Loki (portrayed by Tom Hiddleston). 
 What does The Avengers have? Awesome visual effects; great characters; great direction; not the best plot. I can't think of any other villains that they could have fought against, well villains of these superheroes. Magneto or a Batman villain could have worked, but of course that goes out of their section of villains. I just wasn't feeling the alien invasion thing. 
 Though, the action was incredible - and it prevented the viewer from becoming bored. The gags were really funny, 
Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk added charisma to the film. The film casts a big box office shadow for upcoming super hero films like The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises, so hopefully those don't disappoint.
 My expectations were high, from hearing all of the awesome things about it, so I didn't enjoy it AS much as I wanted to. And I also viewed the film in 2D and not 3D, in which it was made for, so that may have taken away from my enjoyment.  Granted, the film is still better than one's average super hero film and was still extremely enjoyable."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Great adventure! We all loved it
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,All these raving reviews are really making me want to see this one!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon rises from the ashes like a phoenix! Fun Flick. Don't over analyze it.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,I enjoyed the banter and all of the superheroes much more than I thought I would.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Best movie lots of action I like the Hulk and Ironman
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen!! It's modern mythology at it's absolute best.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,i loved the movie and i have seen it on it's first week in austraila that came out in april and i was worry about the film but it's awesome!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Loved all the super heros action packed
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Best movie this year...
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Greatest collaboration I've seen since Freddy VS. Jason.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,WOW! I'm without words!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Lots of fun. Hint: sit through the credits.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen in a very long time. Excellent writing and directing.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,I've never seen a movie 4 times in theaters... until now. I fell in love with the characters all over again and absolutely adored the way they interacted. This is definitely a must-see.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've ever see!

"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Freaken awesome movie
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"A five movie build-up, a high budget for special effects and a decent plot, still too long and drawn out at some points. Visit www.50footguerrillareviews.com for my full review!"
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,awesome movie cant wait for it to come out on blue ray!!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Avengers, made me feel like a kid routing for the good guys and all that.. The humor was nicely mixed through out... it's a win.."

"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!! If you like action you'll love this one.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,AWESOME!! watched it 2 times
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"The Avengers was awesome.  So far, it's definitely the best movie that I've seen of 2012, and I've seen more than a few.  The action was stellar, the special effects great, the comedy subtly genius.  The basic idea of this film was nicely set up in the previous Marvel movies (the Iron Mans, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulks), with the introduction of both many of the characters and the elements that were at play.  My one problem with this movie was that there were still a lot of names that I didn't really pick up on, because they weren't really said often enough.  Without doing an internet search I would be unable to tell you the superhero alter ego of Renner's character.

The premise of the movie is a bit complicated.  Asgardian Loki (Hiddleston) has made a deal with an alien race; in exchange for retrieving the Tesseract he will receive an army that he can use to conquer Earth.  Using his scepter Loki manages to enslave Dr. Erik Slevig (Skarsgård), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Renner), and several other S.H.E.I.L.D. agents, while also stealing the Tesseract and blowing up S.H.E.I.L.D.'s remote research facility.  S.H.E.I.L.D. director Nick Fury (Jackson) reactivates the ""Avengers Initiative"" and calls in Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans), Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Ruffalo), and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Johansson).  In the pursuit of Loki they are also joined by Thor (Hemsworth), Loki's brother and the god of thunder.  The group don't exactly work well together and are as likely to fight each other as Loki and with the exception of Romanoff none entirely trusts Fury, suspecting him of withholding the entire story.  It is up to the group of them to come together for the greater good, stop Loki, and save the planet.

The best part of a movie like this is the action, and The Avengers doesn't fail to meet expectations.  It's an action packed movie, and despite the league of some of the characters none of the fights are one sided.  There's no moment when the bad guys line up and wait to be slaughtered one-by-one by the good guys, nor does the fact that Thor and Loki are gods make the outcome of a fight rather obvious.  Even the very human Phil Coulson (Gregg) gets a few good shots in.  The space bits were a bit over the top and I have to admit that the alien invasion kind of reminded me of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  

The second best part of this movie was the cast.  Downey, as always, is stellar as Tony Stark.  I don't think he was as funny as he was in the Iron Man films, and I would have enjoyed a little more between him and Pepper Potts, although his interactions with Jarvis did make up for it a bit.  Seeing him squaring off with Captain America, Loki, and Thor really gave us an idea of just how powerful Iron Man is, and for the first time he seemed to really be up against an opponent who is his match.  I liked Captain America more in this film than I did in Captain America, although I do hope that by the next movie he's gotten an upgrade on his uniform.  I think I liked Thor more in Thor, although part of that is because he's quieter and more stoic than the other Avengers and thus fades a bit when in a larger group.  Hiddleston makes an amazing villain; I spent part of the movie hoping for his sake that he doesn't look as creepy in real life as he does when he's playing Loki.  His timing was amazing, I just wish that he hadn't been wearing that horrible horned helmet for so much of the film.  I enjoyed both Johansson and Renner's characters, and I liked that the Black Widow was utilized more - I'd like to see standalone films for them in the future.  I'd also love to see a standalone film for Nick Fury.  Smulders character left me wanting more - it was nicely acted, I just found myself questioning who she was every time she appeared on screen (did they even mention her by name?).  I didn't really care for Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, although he's not my least favourite Bruce Banner.  When Stark asks Banner if he smokes pot I was waiting for him to say yes.  Ruffalo, however, had the distinction of playing two very different characters, and while his Banner was lacking his Hulk was amazing - easily the best part of this movie.  It says a lot about an actor when he manages to make the Hulk funny.

"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Awesome and funny movie!!!!!!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Favorite part? Where Hulk grabs Loki's leg and smashes him into the concrete five or six times in a row. I laughed SO hard. This movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I would definitely watch it again, and I'd love to own it."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Best of the summer, although it is in a tie with Ted.  So far.  Savages tonight may top them both."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,amazing you must watch this!!!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Can't wait till Part 2, excellent movie with original characters"
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Loved it, action and story were enthralling! I can't wait to see it again..."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,I loved it so much I seen it twice.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Almost complete perfection...
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Amazing Super Hero flick but almost too many to share the screen. The individual films for each seem better balanced.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Great and fun movie.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,THIS WAS A BADASS MOVIE.... MAN I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT WON TO COME OUT
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"Rarely does a comic movie meet, beat and absolutely exceed expectations.  Established a new ceiling for comic movies!! The build up from the other movies built incredible anticpation and the movie did not disappoint ... it actually was better.  Rare in movies, but rarer in an increasignly saturated genere. Congrats!"
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie of all time.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,kicked all sorts of ass!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,The ultimate summer film...
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"I don't typically like blockbusters and my inner nerd makes me overly critical of comic book movies. That said, this was the first time I have ever felt a $15 ticket was a steal. How fluid the plot is kept given the break-neck pace, comedy, large cast and epic scope of action is nothing short of masterful."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,The best superhero movie so far.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Very entertaining and action-packed movie but the plot lacked consistency and fight scenes were slightly lackluster. Still an overall great movie to watch especially for Marvel fans and superhero fanatics.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,Instant re-classic!!! They really Hulk-Smashed it!!!
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"One of the most heroic, epic, amazing movies! Ever made!:) this movie was just simply the best I was speechless at the end wanted more but we will see what's next great movie!:)"
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,"One of the most overrated pieces of shit of all time. Is it still a good movie yes? Is it great? HELL NO! Terrible villian, incoherent storytelling, CGI porn all over the end. I hope the second one is better."
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,awesome movie. a must if you like super hero movies. i cant wait till thedvd is out so i can watch it again.
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,sickest film ever can't wait for more avengers films
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,i liked it very much and it was a great way to bring everything together. The end left an opening for yet another sequel when this story was already enough. how much crazier will this get?
"Jul 6, 2012",positive,nice action sequence!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Great movie! Good mix of comedy and action.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a fun, action packed (maybe a little too action packed), effects ridden blockbuster with a great ensemble cast. Fans of other films in the franchise (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, etc.) won't be disappointed."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Very entertaining, great visuals, and action packed. The Avengers is the amazing payoff of 5 movies that was somehow able to make room for everyone."
"Jul 5, 2012",negative,"'the avengers' articulates why the genre is so popular. the action is larger than life, the whole premise is wacky and the characters clash with their egos as often as their enemies. the film is a cinematic innovation and a vastly irrepressible fun time."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Good job. Over all, this is light stuff and that's why it works. It could easily have been an epic fail but it's funny, and wild enough."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Very awesome kept me off the edge of my seat. Lots of action and some funny parts. Very enjoyable
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,The movie was awesome its inspiring!!!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Best movie I have seen this year. Funny, thrilling, action filled, and great cast!"
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,GREAT! U dont have to know about the superheroes to know the movie!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,This is a really good movie and funny.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie ever superman and batman can't Beat this neither can any marvel movie except avengers 2 this was absolutely amazing but they can do even better
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Nothing's perfect, but this movie is very close to being a perfection itself."
"Jul 5, 2012",neutral,a much less well-known rounded film than its superhero-conglomerate predecessor x:men first class
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Amazing i loved it awesome beggining and happy ending i sure hope there is a second one coming
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Soooooo Awesome! I loved this movie!
"Jul 5, 2012",neutral,Not the best movie but satisfying
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,The best comic super heroes ever put together in a super hero movie.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is, so-far, the best film of the year. It is the perfect way to combine some of my favorite super heroes."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Excellent, excellent superhero flick!"
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Les fans de la sÃ (C)rie Marvel ne seront pas dÃ (C)Ã§us de cette rÃ (C)union de super-hÃ (C)ros. MalgrÃ (C) ces 150 minutes, cette production rÃ (C)ussi Ã  tenir ces cinÃ (C)philes captivÃ (C)s -et avouons-le, la durÃ (C)e de ce blockbuster passe drÃ´lement vite.- Le charismatique Robert Downey JR vole la vedette Ã  ses covedettes, ainsi que Chris Evans en Captain America qui semble avoir pris de l'assurance dans son personnage."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO MOVIES EVER!!!!!!!!! BEST IN 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Lots of fun. Go see it
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Awesome movie with a lot of good graphic and action scene. The plot was predictable and character set up was outstanding. Can't wait for number 2 to come out.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Every nerd's wet dream that has raised bar to elephant heights. Fantastic in every single way.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,This movie was unbelievable! 5 stars without a doubt!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Wow. thats all i can say. wow. i have not been wowed like that since the reboot of star trek. The Avengers truley worked. one of the hardest movies ever to make, was truley a succsess. This movie is for sure to be a classic. with a great plot awsome action, fine acting, With great humor. A long reveiw is not needed you get where im comming from the avengers is sure to be a classic for years to come."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"There's not a lot of dramatic tension (half of the cast seems incapable of getting a scratch, let alone dying) and it's pretty corny. That said, it's still a lot of fun."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"This movie was a lot of fun but it takes some time before things get interesting, probably since it's the first movie about The Avengers. I like this movie and it's awesome to see everyone work together, but compared to Marvel's other team of heroes (X-Men) this lacks the luster and strong story behind it. I still recommend it to anyone who likes any of the heroes in the movie. I think they picked a good villain."
"Jul 5, 2012",negative,"Michael Bay-ish and overrated, The Avengers deserve much less recognition then it got."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Hulk's humor makes my day.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Zero complaints.  Every fanboy itch satisfied.  Every character had just the right amount of screen time.  3D was the way to see it, no other way.  I already paid for this on Amazon.  Done."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,This is the perfect super hero movie.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,A great time at the movies and a childhood dream fulfilled.  Just wished they would have fought an actual villain at the end instead of a stream of faceless storm trooper types.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie so far ð???
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Saw it twice, going for a third time, and have the 3D blu-ray on pre-order, what is left to say..."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"I understand what Joss Whedon was trying to do and appreciate it, but The Avengers could have been so much more than mindless action and non-stop one liners. It had the potential to delve deep into their characters and the plot but there was so much comic effect in the movie that when it was time to be serious, you can't help but laugh, and then you realize how silly you feel."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Full of action, humour and a great cast. It's impossible not to enjoy this film. The one criticism i have is that it is perhaps slightly too long."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Arabic breeze effect=)
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,I'll say..by far the best superhero movie ever!! :)
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Fun movie! I think you need to see Thor, Captain America, and Hulk in order to appreciate some of the story & humor."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Amazing. Just simply amazing and now they're coming out with a sequel even better
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,It was good ol fun hulk stole the spotlight and every character had lots of complexity to them.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Thor, Iron Man, Hulk and the S.H.I.E.L.D. cracking alien skulls. not bad at all."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Hulk was awesome! Entire movie was great!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Exactly what a movie about a band of super heroes should be!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Couldn't ask for a better combination of actors and super heros in one movie.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"I simply loved this movie! I am not a big comic book person but I watched the other films with my roommates and boyfriend who are and could explain things to me. It had the right amount of funny, action and suspense to make it worth wild."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,I took my kids out of school early on opening day to see this! It was and is a great movie! I will go back to see it again before it leaves the theater!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome. You've got to see this.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,""" I still believe in heroes. """
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"When you find yourself at the cinema for a second time to see a movie to fill in what you may have missed blinking or tinkling, it lends to the cinematic piece of awesomeness that is, The Avengers....bring on the Age of Apocalypse!!!"
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"I've had a change of heart about this film. The thing is, the producers, directors and such of this film took no chances when making it. This is a very conservative film, giving the people what they want so that they don't screw anything up. Great movie, but not anything special."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,One of the top five superhero movies ever made absolutely spectacular.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"This movie was really good! I enjoyed every second of it. Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans played their roles well, the others did too."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Great concept that really came together and, in my opinion, didn't try to cram too much down your throat for 2 1/2 hours.  Everyone got screen time and a sense that this movie serves as a sequel to their own ventures - certainly Captain America was better here than previously.  In particular, I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and would have like to have seen him explored more.  Tom Hiddleston also did a good job carrying the weight of being the lone villain.  Looking forward to the next one.  p.s.  I'm no fan of Natalie Portman, but she was too busy for an appearance here?  Where's Don Cheadle, for that matter?"
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Amazing action movie. Just felt like there was something missing, not sure what it is, but I hope to find it in the sequel."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movie .....worth watching in theatre .......
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"A good, but overhyped film. Its not something I'm going to revisit over and over again. Some painful saturday morning cartoon / comic book physics dialogue about cosmic cubes & tesseracts that slows down the first hour, followed up by some Micahel bay style explosions at the end. Marvel fans are always going on about the human element to their superheroes, yet the film they geek spasm over is an overly CGI'd action spectacular with punchy dialogue, but thin ploting. Its decent (but not great), disposable entertainment, but certainly not the paragon of brilliance that some make it to be."
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,just a kick ass movie all the way around the Avenger just all came together and had a kick ass time with in joining the movies together with the whole picture Stan Lee just a few words is awesome
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Not a bad film. But people have blinders on if they think this is a well written movie. One-liners and a handful of clever moments don't cover up a poorly structured script with little logic and disposable villains.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,*?????? ??? ???????*
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Amazing movie! Thor is a personal favorie.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"Thee most epic comic movie ever!!! The  storyline, the cinematography, the comedic lines... Amazing awesome movie!!! With really hot men!!!"
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Really cool! Not much into superheroes but this makes you wanna get involved with superheroes!
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,It was a little long (50-50) but was well worth the admission. If your into comics & know about the characters some you'll be amped to see more.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,What can I say about the Avengers that already hasn't been said.  An absolutely amazing movie that delivers on all superhero levels and leaves nothing to be desired.  Bravo Joss Whedon.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Be sure to stay though the full end credits.
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,Great movie can't wait till the sequel
"Jul 5, 2012",positive,"you shouldn't need me to tell you to see this movie. Rent it, buy it, own it."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"The comic snob in me wants to dock the rating 1/2 star for omitting Thor's helmet and Hawkeye's mask, and for switching races on a character (still the stupidest thing to me, no matter how they try to spin it with bullshit alternate universe explanations); but this movie was so damned surprisingly good, that when it was done, I didn't care that The Dark Knight Rises, formerly my only hope for a good superhero movie in 2012, was still months away. Joss Whedon finds the balance between action and comedy, and showcases every single character in a masterful way, something just about all other Marvel films (namely the original X-Men trilogy and Spider-Man 3) fail to do."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Pretty gorg. But ive seen better
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Anybody can watch this movie and be blown away because it is so awesome
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"I am a die-hard comic fan. I am also something of a movie buff. I had EXTREMELY high expectations for this movie, and I can happily report that this completely blew me away. I have nothing negative to say about this movie. Nothing AT ALL! Brilliant and skillfully executed on every front!! Keep it up Marvel!!"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,All about Iron Man and Hulk...the others would not be missed.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Fantastic Superhero movie, so funny and the hulk was finally done some justice. Iron man is great as always. Not happy with chris evans but hey he does alright."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen. Much thought was put into this.
"Jul 4, 2012",negative,The action part of it was cool and the actors were fine. But the underlining story was boring and I was falling asleep throughout this movie.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"amazing in every aspect probably best movie i have ever seen the action, effects, humor, characters, and plot are simply amazing."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"The Avengerâ(TM)s is everything you could ever want in an action movie. This is probably the best action movie of all time.  Two and a half hours of pure enjoyment. Captain America is very charming, strong, and displays his natural leadership abilities. Iron Man is quick witted, sarcastic, and awesome. Bruce Banner is nervous, fidgety, and bursting of intelligence. The Hulk is strong, unpredictable, and my personal favorite. I was really worried about Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Edward Norton and Eric Bana both did an excellent job as Bruce Banner. Ruffalo has joined that list and did a great job. He played the role perfect. Iâ(TM)m not a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson. I was surprised at how well she did at being Black Widow. Black Widow is acrobatic, quick, and clever. Hawkeye had a perfect shot every time. Thor is his normal Godly self with a hammer of awesomeness and Loki is as pale and evil as ever. There is a very awesome fight scene between Iron Man and Thor. There is another awesome fight scene with The Hulk and Thor. You can catch extra clips at the start of the credits and at the very end of the credits. Stay for both! Great to see in the theatre and to see multiple times! Seriously one of the best movies ever."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Hulk stole the show!!!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"All I can say is, EPIC! :D"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Awesome.  Can't wait fit the sequel.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"One of my favorite movies!
Spider man would have made it my favorite"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers was the perfect superhero movie. It was action packed, funny, intense, and has you glued to your seat for the whole 2 and a half hours running time. I expected this film to be more focused on Iron Man and Captain America but i can happily say that i enjoyed how marvel spilt the screen action between all of the Avengers ! This film truly lives up to the hype and will be remembered as a classic."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Such great entertainment! I was afraid it wouldn't be able to meet the crazy high superhero standard but The movie didn't disappoint in any way! Go see it if you can!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Not bad!  I would have liked to see a little bit more relationship building among the characters, but I can't complain too much.  With all of its captivating combat choreography, sharp one-liners, and ridiculously cool visual effects, The Avengers might just be the movie of the year."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"This movie is the true definition of a summer blockbuster!! It has everything we need action, kick ass heroes and villains and not to mention awesome fighting sequences!"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but the preceding films provide us with a rich back story that makes this one a lot better. It was a long wait but well worth it, and hopefully the sequel will be even better!"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Not A bad movie..Just needed more of The HULK...!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Great action. Just the right amount of fantastical spectacular over-the-topness.  Hulk scenes had me pumped up like an over-excited little boy hopped up on candy.  I'm not sure what was missing, but it wasn't perfect - just REALLY great."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,It has everything an action movie needs.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,this years most over rated film
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,The perfect superhero movie. Each character has there moment to shine and no one gets pushed to the background. Every manages to come across as a real person. The action is insane and the ending alone is worth price of admission and then some. The forming device for the story is pretty basic bad guy wants to take over the world but they handle it well. The movie shines by the strength and personality of its characters and the action sequences.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Of all the superhero movies lately, I liked Thor the best for its story line. The fight scene at the end of the movie was too long, felt like a transformers movie. The story was good. The movie was a B for me."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Greatest superhero movie ever!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,The perfect movie. It's a great time for us old Marvel comics fans seeing the characters we loved to read as kids come to life
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,This movie was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,We went and seen this last night and it was pretty awesome. The effects were very good. I would recommend it for others to see!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,A must see especially if your a marvel fan. If your not a fan it's still good enough to go see.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,awesome action packed
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Solid action, best hulk movie yet"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Best movie of the last several years... Just about every other movie seems to pale in comparison
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"As far as movies with 7 main characters and a villain who can't really die go, this is really really good."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,A little super hero action on the 4th of July with the boys.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,The best movie this year!!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Has to be the greatest superhero movie made. I sarcastically call it IRONMAN 3 because Robert Downy Jr. Steals the show. Joss Whedon was the perfect director and the music by Alan Silvestri was epic!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,This was an amazing movie! And Robert Downy Jr. Is sexy as always :)
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,awesome action packed movie with great writing and story+ending
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Great movie batman is better
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon did an awesome job with the characters in this movie! My only complaint is that I can't give this movie more than 5 stars, lol."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,An awesome movie with a good mix of action and humor.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Very fun, well made and entertaining movie"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Loved it, buying it when its out!"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"It was funny at times, not at bad as I thought it was going to be."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"A little bit disappointed in comparison to the individual movies, with Iron Man, Thor and Captain America being so good"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,thrilling near the end
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"This movie was excellent, and had beautiful SFX. It was so good even without 3D that I might go see it again!"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon is the right man to take several complicated superheroes and weave them into a well-balanced mix of enticing action, brief drama, a handful of character development, with a thick topping of great humor that comic books nerds and average joes can enjoy equally."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Such an awesome movie!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"I don't like superhero action movies all that much, and some of the ""origin"" films from this whole series left something to be desired (I wanted to watch them before seeing this in theaters, so I'd know what was going on - I missed ""Thor,"" but it didn't matter, because that happens to be one of the origin movies that just sucked), but holy hell, this movie was just...awesome.  I love Joss Whedon, and you can see his influence, but he doesn't ""take over"" the movie,and it's so great to get those little ""easter eggs"" of dialogue and whatnot that may not have been there, otherwise.  If movie theatre prices weren't so prohibitively high, I'd have already seen it a couple of times."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Excellent Summer Fare. Enjoyable for nerds and their girlfriends.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,The dialog was better than the fighting...
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Hells yes .   That is all
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,It is so difficult to make a super hero movie that combines great action and character development.  Even more difficult when you combine so many superheros. This movie was so much fun to watch and up there with the best superhero movies ever made.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,So So So!!!! F-inf good I like the two endings
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved it. In my top 5 favorite movies.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,I watched this without having seen any of the superhero movies before and it still stood out.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"I'm a bit of a comic geek so I was prepared to be let down.  This flik was phenomenal!  Action from the first min all the way to the last.  As always with Marvel, stay seated until the end credits have completely finished."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Great mesh of cast/characters
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"Way better then I expected!   I think this is one franchise that Marvel has done right, and all other comic based movies should take note.   The way that they built up to the movie with the small clips at the end of each movie, the fact that all of the main characters had their own movie so that there was no need for time killing back story it really is what made the film possible."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,what else can I say... this movie was awesome!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Nothing I can write that noone else has already written. Awesome movie.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie yet. Great script and action. Loved it
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,love it but i sooo want to see this shit again
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"this is a well done comic book come to life, and finally somebody that did the Hulk justice ."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Awesome ....just awesome
"Jul 4, 2012",negative,"The first 3/4 part of this movie is a really boring ""drama"".But the ending is awesome"
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"IMO, one of, or perhaps, the best superhero movie I've seen. Well written (by the ever excellent Joss Whedon) story for the large ensemble of heroes. The story carries individual characters from solitary heroes into The Avengers. Great cast of actors, too - I'm particularly fond of Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  I saw the standard 2d format, which I thought satisfactory and didn't regret missing out on any 3d gimmicks."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,This movie was petty pack full of funnies and actin!!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,I have to watch it again in english because the voices in spanish are awful (specially Thor's who sounds like a teen boy)
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Outstanding flick whether or not you are a comic book fan. High amounts of action and a few laughs mixed in. The characters play their roles perfectly and the Hulk will leave you with goose bumps.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"I only watched this cuz I had given my brother a movie date of choice for his b-day. However, it turned out to be really funny at times and a lot of fast pacing action. I didn't get most of the references having only watched the Ironman movies but it was good to watch it with someone who knew a bit more. Definitely worht seeing despite not knowing a hell of a lot of it. 
I was a bit surprised by the mythology connection since that wasn't something that people had discussed."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Simply mind-blowing. Definetly worth the wait <3
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,good but highly overrated
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Unbelievable action!!!
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Great culmination to the Marvel Movies we've come to love.
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,"The perfect superhero film. Period. Marvel brings together six superheroes and one epic villain to create a cinematic landmine filled with high-packed action, hilarious comedy, and plenty of emotion. Marvel's The Avengers is a must-see for any movie fan, period."
"Jul 4, 2012",positive,Good movie! Made me want to watch each single super hero movie.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Marvel's answer to DC's The Dark Knight; although no comparison whatsoever can be made. This movie is an absolute opposite of TDK's deep and dark theme and I suppose that is a good thing. Seriously, Marvel superheroes are rather shallow in character development compared to DC's and Joss Whedon realizes this. So instead, he focuses on what Marvel superheroes does best; kicking ass. An excellent writer himself, Whedon provides excellent one-liners throughout the entire film and he saves the best lines for Mark Ruffalo's Banner/Hulk who is by far gives the best interpretation of the Hulk on the silverscreen yet. If you're a tween or just someone who likes action films without wanting to burden your brain with storyline, Marvel's Avengers is it."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Perfect Super Hero movie in every way, shape, & form."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,What's not to love. Hot men/women fighting evil and kicking ass
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This s my favorite movie!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Hands down, favorite superhero flick."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,the best movie out there now
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Pretty much perfect.  Best comic book movie ever.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Excellent entertainment
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Movie of the year. Flawless!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"A competent summer blockbuster; nothing more, nothing less."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,it was great my kids luagh and the movie had me on my toes
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"I'm a big fan of comic book movies, but I'm always weary of them taking over the box office for not being original, but no matter what, I enjoyed this film. It was entertaining and done very well, I mean the whole part of the film when the Avengers are in the city was real (other than the aliens and Hulk of course). The explosions and stunts! I think it deserves the rating it has and being the #1 Highest Grossing film in the world (as of right now). I'm very anxious to see more from what Marvel has to bring to the theaters and I'm sure they will please. However, I'm still weary of these films over-shining original films."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"This was a good movie but I have to say that it's slightly overrated. The story just seems a little slow to me, but still it's a really fun movie and I will definitely be buying it on blue ray."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,A box office Smash that was highly entertaining. Believe the hype and enjoy the awesome action!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Unexpectedly very good, maybe the best of the summer biggies."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,It wants the hype it was set out to be but it was ok it was to rushed and to umm childish i like serious story telling
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Very enjoyable movie, with many great action scenes, but slightly cliche."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Loved it! Can't wait for part two
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This movie is one of the best action movies I've ever seen! You HAVE to watch it! :D
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Liked the film but you have it for what it is just a Hollywood blockbuster jumping on the cash wagon, didn't think it was true to comics but I did think it was definitely a fun watch would recommend anyone to watch it"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"I'm not usually a fan of superhero movies, but The Avengers was an amazing surprise for me. It was just plain awesome. The characters, the soundtrack, the plot, everything about it was epic. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Fantastic film. Go see it now."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,It was fun to watch. If only it were more original and less predictable.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Let us sit here and sum up this movie for a second. Directed by Joss Whedon, has Robert Downing Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Helmsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Cobie Smulders, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Samuel L Jackson. Who play the characters of, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, the hottie from ""How I Met Your Mother"", and Nick Fury. All of which come together to mess up some aliens, whilst having a good solid plot, having great humor, sit on the edge of your seat action, and some intense drama, practically makes the perfect movie. So if you're reading this because you're unsure than you're crazy because it doesn't get to much better than this."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Can't wait for part two. Great cast and a director who actually likes comic books.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"One fun ride to next, very entertaining chemistry between characters"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"The movie seemed to take too long to get all of the superheroes together.  The ending felt rushed.  On the other hand, Captain America has a new found respect from me.  Mark Ruffalo was great as Bruce Banner/The Hulk."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"It's not as perfect as some people might suggest - mostly due to the slower pace that the movie jogs at for the first half. But the dialog crackles with life, and the battles, especially the final one, is absolutely awesome (there's just no other way to say it)."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"The film is first rate, with a great cast and excellent visuals. The previous films established the characters, so time didn't need to be wasted reintroducing the characters. Much like James Bond, we start with action and stop only to plan for the next event. The scope is epic enough to warrant a team of people, rather than an episode any single member could handle (a common fault in many Justice League stories, where Superman dominated all). Joss Whedon, a fan with strong credentials in the comic world, hits the notes right. He introduces the threat, then begins assembling the team. However, teams in the Marvel world rarely work harmoniously at the beginning. They test each other, argue, trade barbs; but, when it counts they get down to business. This truly felt like the comic brought to life, much as Richard Donner's Superman had before, and Christopher Nolan's Batman had more recently.
It's not a perfect film, though. There are a few to many convenient moments, like the scientist unconsciously building a failsafe into the dimensional gateway. Hawkeye and Black Widow are still underdeveloped, as they had little more than cameos in the previous films. Dialogue suggests a history, but they are still mostly cyphers to non-fans. Many character moments ended up on the cutting room floor, due to time constraints, so we don't really get to experience Captain America struggling with an unfamiliar world. In a related note, Cap never really sounds like someone from the 40s. Hopefully, sequels will be able to explore these things more and the film series can mature beyond just an action spectacle, as the comics did. Whedon and the cast & crew certainly gave a foundation on which to build.There are many moments to enjoy, from Whedon's trademark wisecracking dialogue, to Tom Hiddleston's layered villain, to the revelation of SHIELD as more than just a glorified Marvel FBI. There are some excellent quiet moments in all of the thunder and we see the human costs of the battle, which is too often missing from these things. In the end, the film earns its success. Here's hoping that Marvel won't rest on that success and try to venture into some of their other books, especially those that don't revolve around superheroes. The company produced some fine western and sci-fi characters, not to mention someone needs to do a Howard the Duck film that is as good as the comic was."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,great movie enjoyed very much and it had some very funny moments between the super hero's.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"I did not know about this movie until I saw the trailer, after viewing the trailer I was not interested. I simply saw this movie based on the ratings that it received. I was not obsessed with this movie like millions of others. It was a great action film with a decent plot. The hulk is unstoppable he could have been the only hero in this movie. I will probably buy this movie, batman dark knight rises comes out later this month.. It will blow this movie away."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Best Movie of 2012 so far. There are amazingly hilarious jokes and it is very cool.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,I walked into the theater without any knowledge of the characters or prior story lines and loved the movie!!  :)
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Best action movie ever
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Entertaining and action filled!!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,If you did not grow up with these superheroes; this is an OK watch otherwise you'll likely love it.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,not bad. all characters done well. except captain america. Goofy outfit and that actor is not good fit to play super soldier WWII vet
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Iron Man makes the best jokes! Marvel could've done better though
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,My favorite superhero movie of all time. Perfect in every way.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"This was a great movie when it comes to entertainment, one thing that dragged the movie down for me was that their were some cheesy lines, but besides that, this movie is a  ton of fun to watch with your friends"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"You don't have to care about any of these characters to enjoy this movie. Better than I expected, and I expected a lot. Sad that movies like ""Madea's WP"" have a higher Box Office revenue. It shows how shallow and clueless most of America is."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever....so far.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This movie was greeat!!! So good I saw it twice ......
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Great film. Funny to boot.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"This movie did not disapoint, it was everything i hoped for"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Very well done and definitely lived up to the hype. The Hulk was hilarious and probably my favorite character in the movie. Looking forward to the next one!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,I it is a great movie
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Awesome completly 100% fantastic
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This is the best comic book movie of 2012.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,the best fucken movie ever
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Best Superhero movie ever. Even The Dark Knight can't compare to the nonstop fantasy action in this amazing thriller
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon expertly meshes four movie franchises together to make a film that spends ample time on each of its characters even as it delivers huge amounts of action. The Avengers is humorously scripted and immensely entertaining.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Though it may not be as deep or philosophical as The Dark Knight, this movie is quite possibly the greatest superhero flick ever made."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,d movie. Well its Marvelous!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Awesome storyline(s), action, and acting."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome it has everything you need in it and alot of good actors. Its the perfect combination!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"I loved it,the story was good and the effects were fabulous"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,best comic book movie so far
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,What a glorious load of fun.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"This movie was good, but I think it has more hype then it really deserves.  I can't wait for the Dark Knight to just crush on this movie."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Great thrill ride. Good script.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"That man is playing Galaga! he didn't think we'd notice, but we did."
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"Robert Downey Jr. can save many movies. He's hilarious and his characters are seemingly always witty in one form or another. It was nice to see the other actors pull their weight as well. As far as a superhero movie is concerned, this fit the bill. In an age where the superhero genre has rapidly expanded, it is good to see a film that is able to take many superheros and still manage to find time for all of them. Some of the special effects were a bit over the top and there were a few acting mishaps, but all in all this was a fun movie to watch."
"Jul 3, 2012",negative,first one and half hour boring as hell.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,A blast! True Hollywood Summer Flick.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"wonderful, want to see more"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,It was a wonderful movie I would love to see it again. Best superhero movie ever. Definitely worth the price of admission. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome!!!
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Simple as this. Joss Whedon has to do ever Marvel movie from now on. It was damn near perfect
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,this movie was awsome im definitely getting it.
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,"This movie lived up to the unprecedented build up Marvel in the previous individual superhero movies! It had action, seamless story-telling, great lines and a credible cast of actors!!! And the Hulk was the breakout star of the movie!!!"
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,Seen it twice and wouldn't mind watching it hundreds of more times
"Jul 3, 2012",positive,best super hero movie ever
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Awesome! Three-dimensionally so in IMAX 3D.  LOVE the new Hulk (Mr. Ruffalo).
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"I'm not a big ""Superhero"" action movie fan, that being said, this one was up there with Wolverine, but not quite ""Dark Knight""."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,best marvel movie ive ever seen. seriously it was quite fantastic. i really cannot wait till phase 2. =D (i left one star off because i cannot stand mark Ruffalo... please for the love of god bring back edward norton. or at least a good actor!!! for that matter)
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,5 star's what else is there to say... the action and all the one liners made this movie one of the best films this year
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!!!!!!:):):)
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Great there are no words to explain how much I loved it.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Boom!  Bang!  Crash!  Smash!  Boomity-boom, crash, bang-bang!  Oh, and three hot men: Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and Robert Downey, Jr."
"Jul 2, 2012",neutral,"Popcorn movie. The villains? Some random aliens. What the hell? The avengers have a few good villains and they pick bullshit like that? Loki? Okay, he had to be there. Then they reveal the big bad after the credits? A big bad that the general populous has no idea who he is? Lame."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Great movie! A must see
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic book movies, I've ever watched."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,One of the best superhero movies ever made!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"There's reasons why most directors don't want to attempt something like this, but Josh Weddon took the idea and transformed it into an amazing experience."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Great movie for all ages awesome
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"What a great movie. Suspenseful and funny, it had my attention the whole way through."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Overrated.  Does not deserve RT's 93% rating.  Time to get different reviewers to rely upon!  (And yes, I did see it on the big screen, quite a deluxe theatre in fact).  The script is superior to most superhero movies, I grant.  But that isn't really saying all that much, is it.  Lots of stars appear here but barely get used.  Why for example is Gweneth Paltrow stooping to this material?  Oh, because of the million dollar paycheck, excuse me.  The main players are mainly lame.  The whole story is overblown and uninteresting.  The high-priced special effects aren't even especially good.  The Hulk special effects are particularly bad.  The Black Widow fight scenes are so bad the editor just offers up a blur of quick cuts.  Apparently Scarlett Jahansson couldn't or wouldn't learn how to even put up a semblance of fight moves.  I don't know why I'm so generous as to give this 3 stars out of 5.  I guess because the other superhero movies are even worse..."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"One of the most overrated movies ever and by the standards set by joss whedon in his previous films this sucks, the low budget Internet film Dr. Horrible was better. As a fan of the comic I was disappointed with it's pure lack of originality and near nonexistent and lazy story. This film is also the subject of poor editing by having the most mistakes in a film this year (15) and a poor 3d conversion. The 30 second ending reveal of thanos was more exciting then the rest of the film. Overall a huge dissapointment"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Marvel's ""The Avengers""  continues the long-living hype of superhero films, but was too long. The film left me defiantly hyped for the next film, ""The Avengers 2,"" but there is no way I'm going to be able to sit through it again as it was one of those fantastic movies that you love, but can not sit through again. It also lagged in a few spots, but  was overall filled with enough action, comedy, and a fantastic cast/crew to diffuse the small sizzles of it being too long and a bit laggish."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Simply great. Funny, dramatic, beautiful, and thrilling. I left this movie with great satisfaction. You will feel like the movie touched on each genre needed to make an amazing movie. Well done."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Loud, and funny! Fun for all."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"It will be hard to top this action-packed epic. It is definitely the best summer blockbuster so far. Great performances, story lines, special effects, action sequences, and a sense of humor to go along with that. Mix all those ingredients together, and you have yourself the recipe for an exceptional motion picture achievement that is sure to win the approval of both audiences and movie critics alike. My only complaint is that the pacing is a little slow at times, but once the action takes off, it soars to extraordinary heights. Easily the most fun you will have at the movies this summer!"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Still don't get what all the fuss is about, BUT it was a decent superhero movie"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,ive seen it its awesome
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"I am unsure if I am just getting old for these movies or they all look the same...or something.  However, this movie is well put together and features outstanding performances by Downey Jr. and the Hulk (entirely CGI - but spectacular).  Could have been better, could have been worse."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,most action packed marvel movie to date cant wait for the sequel
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,loved loved this movie...
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Loved this movie! Ed Especially in 3D
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,They should have called it The Hulk/Iron Man Show.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Da bomb.   Very good
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Totally loved it!! all out barnstormer , it was great to watch action , comedic and beautiful to look at (SJ... u know the bit) and has a big green mother fucker smashing up everything in sight!!! Roll on blu ray ! Another great comic book production. Jamesboz23"
"Jul 2, 2012",negative,"One of the worst films I've seen this year. It's annoying one-liner setups are cringe-worthy to say the least. And though Whedon tries his very best to provide Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye with brand new and emotional backstories, these moments are so fleeting and uninvolved in the plot that you will find yourself laughing out loud at them. That said, the only developed character in the entire film is Tony Stark, but that's only because he's the only hero of the bunch that had an even slightly good solo movie (though I try my very best to forget the horrendous second effort that is Iron Man 2)."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,The Hulk.is the best! Don't talk with him or might have a really bad day. Don't take my word for it just ask Loki? hahaha...
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Thoroughly entertaining.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"I am a comic book fan this movie was great, only down side for me was the antagonist of the film and the lack of information on them"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Very well done. I was thoroughly entertained and very impressed with Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Bruce Banner/Hulk. Stole the show in a hand full of scenes. Good story line with huge potentials for the future. I hope they can keep it up.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR THE SUMMER OF 2012!!!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,The definition of the sum is greater than any 1 of it's parts.  There is no better individual character marvel movie. This is the reason why adults still read comics wanting the next epic story!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,This is a really well made superhero movie. It was well written and had an amazing cast with great chemistry.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"I have seen this movie more time in the theatre than any other movie ever, and it still get better with each and every viewing. Highest Recommendation."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"It's Marvel's answer to the Dark Knight. It's as though Joss Whedon is asking Christopher Nolan, ""Why so serious?""

1+1 = 2"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Loved it! Deserves every bit of praise it's recieved!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year hands down.... Hulk smashed in too many ways.... He basicly made the action & humor. But everyone one of the Avengers shined....Waiting on the Black Panther-_- Comeon Marvel!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,This is easily and with out a doubt my most favorite movie EVER! It's got everything and is for EVERYBODY!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"In contrast to the film focused on one or two characters, the film-choir gives several players about the same screen time and importance dramatic. This format is more common on television, as it ensures the writers time to work alone each character per episode.

Although it has very little experience in film as a director, Joss Whedon knows very well how to work multiple players on the small screen. In the series he created, like Buffy - The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly, Whedon fantastic universes explored from the point of view of different guides, but always keeping the focus on one main story line. His choice for the first major merger series in theaters in The Avengers - The Avengers (2012), therefore, could not have been more inspired.

With the TV experience, even under the short time of the commercial Hollywood productions, the director - who also worked on the screenplay for the film - he knew how to manage the holdings of each of its superprotagonistas, giving them specific functions within the plot The Avengers. Joins this ability the fact that Whedon is a huge nerd, knows each of his players and travels with ease through the universe of superheroes. It are, for example, the first arc of a series of the most exciting comic mutant Marvel Surprising The X-Men.

Reading the comic, it is easy to understand how he landed the coveted job in the overproduction of Marvel Studios. Everything was there: the balance between the time of each hero, the wild action and imaginative, the central story that mixes human relations and a deadly challenge, and moments of pure passion nerd. Obviously there was doubt that Whedon could take his experience in TV and comics to film, since the only film that had driven so far was Serenity (2005), a big screen adaptation of the series Firefly.

Fortunately, the writer experienced proved to the challenge. Although it is somewhat aesthetically pasteurized (not differing from any other big-budget blockbuster of the last decade), The Avengers is perfeitinho within their pretensions. It is, after all, a filmÃ£o Marvel - and as such, follows five decades (!) Tradition of the ""House of Ideas."" It is still, well, a modernized version of the first adventure of the Avengers, 1963: her, lone heroes come together - after a misunderstanding generated by the inevitable conflict of egos that came great beings - to face a common threat engendered by the handler , greedy and unscrupulous villain Loki.

In spirit, the film is identical to the comic book created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby with passionate fans and Whedon as president of Marvel, Kevin Feige, in command, there could even be different. It is curious as Agent Coulson - a character created specifically for the film, played by Clark Gregg - is a way for these executives / directors / fans put there in the middle of the action. Coulson, who reveals himself a nerd, is fundamental in the union of the Avengers, as were Whedon and Feige.

For those, like me, grew up reading these stories and follows the Marvel Universe as a marriage of decades (the good, bad and bad times), so see the meeting of the franchise Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk is a will performed. And see it done WELL, a delight. Specific scenes appeal to emotion memory and help to reveal, without any effort, small problems, as the first act, which is rather dragged in comparison to the explosive climax and superelaborado (Michael Bay could learn a lesson here on how to concatenate characters and action focuses separate into a cohesive whole).

But even in the long sequences in which little happens plot and lump together a bit (also a tradition of Stan Lee, the most verbose of all comic), there is nothing to enjoy, like Robert Downey Jr., the glue that binds the group, on the scene in better interactions with the cast, especially newcomer Mark Ruffalo in the series. Discussions between the two men (Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) and between him and Tom Hiddleston (as Loki fantastic and much more at ease than in Thor) are as fun as the invasion of alien armada that afflicts New York at the end.

A well-structured action film, which explores the strengths of all the cast and gives the fan - or novice reader, who knew that universe in the cinema - just expected, The Avengers - The Avengers now comes as another milestone in the celebrated history of Marvel."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,I wasn't really into superheroes but I saw this movie and I loved it. :)
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Oh my gosh I love this movie! It's amazing! The only thing I hated about it is that the scenes had lots of flashing and my eyes started hurting a bit....
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Amazing movie one of the best movies I have ever seen. I seriously recommend it!!!!!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Saw it twice and still loved it. Best superhero movie since The Dark Night (Probably tied with it)
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,I'm just glad that this a super hero movie with an actual plot.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Amazing film truly amazing!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,One of my top three movies of ALL TIME!!!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Good movie... Great action, some jokes here and there. But there were some dry part where my brain fell asleep or I started to think about getting a refill on my soda/pop corn. But it picks back up over all good movie"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Awesome, fun, exciting, great movie."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Go to see it now if you want to get blown away.
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Not only was it action packed but it had some comedy i loved it!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,â(TM)¥â(TM)¥â(TM)¥ IT!!! I watch all movies like this & am never disappointed cuz Comic Book character's in a movie!!! What more could you ask for?!!! Hands down â(TM)¥â(TM)¥â(TM)¥ IT!!!  ;)
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Slow start but grabbed my attention. And I loved it
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"Single, greatest, superhero movie of all time.  Although I had been counting down to this movie since the after-credits scene of the First Avenger, I admit I was worried about whether or not it could be done.  The idea of taking together 4 separate movie franchises, several exceptionally different characters, and an ensemble cast of superstars, and bringing it all together under one giant superhero blockbuster was certainly a bold one.  However, Marvel made the brilliant choice of making Joss Whedon the director, and thus succeeded in this endeavor. 

Although Iron Man was probably the main appeal for most people who went to see the movie, Joss did a good job making sure Avengers didn't become Iron Man 3.  Each hero had his or her own bad-ass moments and chances to shine.  Robert Downey, Jr. yet again disappointed no one with his portrayal of the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" Tony Stark.  His wittiness and arrogant personality blend to create a charm that Americans can't seem to get enough of.  This can be seen off-screen as well, because Robert Downey IS Tony Stark.  No one else could have done it.  Chris Evans was great as the patriotic soldier lost in time.  He was very believable as the principled and brave leader of the super hero squad.  Chris Hemsworth, both through his physical stature and through his acting brought Thor to life yet again.  Hemsworth is one of my favorite actors these days, and a rising star.  

Out of all the brilliant actors, however, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and Tom Hiddleston as Loki really stole the show.  Even though I was a huge fan of Ed Norton, Ruffalo took the character of the Hulk to the next level.  Out of all the actors who played the character, Ruffalo matched the character perfectly.  Whereas I thought Erica Bana in the first Hulk movie was too manly to play Bruce Banner, and Ed Norton was a bit wimpy, Ruffalo was a combination of both.  Tom Hiddleston did a great job as Loki, because despite his terrible actions, you couldn't help but feel bad for how he wound up.  

Despite already having built and developed each main character in their respective, preceding films, the Avengers still made sure viewers could understand what drove each character, and made them relatable to viewers.  If done incorrectly, the Avengers could easily have been just 2 hours and 20 mins of comic book characters smashing each other and blowing stuff up.  However, Joss brought his vision to life with great depth.  

The special effects and action scenes were simply amazing.  The Avengers fully exceeded my expectations of the action sequences.  Each hero shared a fight scene with another, which was very cool.  3D wasn't much different from the 2D version though, at least in my opinion.  

The dialogue of the Avengers was hilarious.  This was by far the funniest superhero or action movie that I've ever seen.  Leave it to Joss to insert comedy into life-or-death situations in a fight to save humanity.  The banter between the heroes was priceless.

No part of the movie was cheesy either, which was a very important aspect.  On comic books its one thing, but on film its another.  The fact that they were able to have four superheroes, each in different colorful costumes, to stand together in a frame without taking away from the believably, was a great feat.

Best movie of the year thus far.  I don't see how Dark Knight Rises will be able to top this."
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Best movie of the early summer!!!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,"This movie lived up to the unprecedented build up Marvel in the previous individual superhero movies! It had action, seamless story-telling, great lines and a credible cast of actors!!! And the Hulk was the breakout star of the movie!!!"
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,One of the few superhero films that balances both script and cinematic effects with breathtaking equity. A must see for any sci-fi fan!
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Wish their would not of been so many jokes through the course of this film! I could not take it serious
"Jul 2, 2012",positive,Great movie...loved it in 3D.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. Every character was well developed.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,the best all around movie of the year!!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Did not disappoint. Great fan service. Plot was Duplo brick simple and limited character involvement.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"OMG new top box office record right here! This movie brought what a movie is truly about back into our lives! I applaud the makers and everyone who worked on the perfect movie for me and anyone! Just FANTASTIC!! The only thing that could have made it better would be the addition of spiderman!! That's it other than that I was overly impressed I expected it to be great but not over the top good! Actors amazing! Script amazing! On the edge of my seat the entire time! Breath taking movie! A must see for everyone even superhero haterZ
Theaters again=im on my way!!!
DVD= too far away!!!!"
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,A well made movie that lived up to the hype. Enjoyable with humor and seriousness.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"I've unfortunately never saw it, but I will soon. This will probably be the best superhero film I'll ever see."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Excellent movie ! Love Robert Downey Jr.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,best movie so far this year
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Top notch. Perfect blend of so many characters.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"I thought they stopped making power rangers shows. Jk it was decent, and I was kind of in a bad mood when I watched it, but seriously they should have made things less predictable. Although the final final scene made the movie waaay better."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"The first movie I have seen in 3D that worked really well, shame the screen less smaller!!!!!"
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,LOVED this movie.  Can't wait for the next one!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,good from start to finish
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Do I really need to say anything?
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"I loved this movie! It had great action scenes that looked as realistic as possible. Also the script writing by Joss Whedon is phenomenal. He knew how to keep the characters heroic and yet full of faults. It was interesting to see the characters from different movies interacting with each other. I also loved the villain, Loki!"
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,This was not as good as it could have been but better than expected.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year no arguments yet...
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie. Every character does great at adding to this movie. Not a fan of Scarlett Johannson, but she did a great job as well. Recommended a thousand times over."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Great! Saw it twice!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Finally a Marvel superhero movie that's as good as X-Men 2.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Loved it! It was definitely worth watching all the prequel-esque individual movies so I understood who everyone was. Would definitely watch again. 3d was incredible!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"should have a ten star rating but it only goes to 5.  one of the greatest movies ever made, rates up there with the harry potter saga and star wars saga."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,THIS MOVIE FRIKIN ROCKS!!!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Absolutely amazing, as close to perfect as a movie can get.  Joss Whedon is a complete genius."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Couldn't of asked for more, Superheroes, comedy and the like of Scarlett Johanson all combine for a action packed well told superhero style action blockbuster with plenty of laughs!"
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"The best movie of the summer, and possible the greatest superhero movie of all time."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Great fun to watch .................... the 3 times I went , Lol ."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Nonstop action. Comedy. And one tiny little secret.  Joss Whedon doesn't disappoint.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Favorite movie of the year so far. Or ever.....
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"While it's certainly not the best film of the year, or even the best superhero film for that matter, Marvel's ""The Avengers"" proves to be a fun, campy movie where fun, engaging action makes up for the mediocre plot-line."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Chris Hemsworth is so dreamy. Dem muscles
"Jul 1, 2012",negative,"Too much over the top action and ""special"" effects. The story was predictable and followed almost the same plot line of the first Transformers (a special item the that everyone wants, and a huge fight scene at the end blah blah boring). The scenes with the Hulk made the movie bearable."
"Jul 1, 2012",neutral,Could have been so much better. When I think of the first Superman movie I saw as a kid back in the 70's with Christopher Reeve in it - it didn't matter the special effects were pants - it had a good story and made you care what happened. The avengers doesn't !
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Great movie! Because of this, marvel studios has about 4 years of sequels, prequels and endings. I mean they got Iron man 3, Captain America 2 & 3, Thor 2 & 3, The Incredible Hulk 2 & 3! They can make a movie based on halkeye, but not on black widow. So yeah, good movie."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Great awesome movie. Love it!
"Jul 1, 2012",negative,"More over hyped CGI rubbish from Hollywood's fascination of comic book adaptations. On a serious note, hasn't this whole idea been milked to the death? Put a 12A on it and attract the kids with the big explosions, sadly it works. The plot is crap and way too predictable, but hey America saves the day. Just for a change."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Its very exciting and funny
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Seen it 3 times in theaters. Best Super Hero movie to date. Do not miss out in theaters. It is the best.
"Jul 1, 2012",negative,Could this have been any longer???????
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Great comic-book fun and what a build-up!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Really cool. Having all the heroes together was great, the effects were bitchin and the story was interesting. this will be one for the home library."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,It was 2 funny n good
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Possibly the most fun time I have had at the movies so far this year, but that could also be the fact that I sat next to huge Hulk fans and everytime he apeared on screen they squealed in delight . Marvel's The Avengers surprised me and I enjoyed it enough to see it twice."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is an amazing movie.  From start to finish I was entertained.  The cg effects looked as real as anything I have seen.  It is a movie that you can walk into with out seeing a single one of the others and still follow along.  Though seeing the others will help you out a great deal.  I did have 1 thing I was wondering throughtout the movie, how did Thor get back to earth?  Also, not casting Edward Norton to reprise his role was imo the only mistake with this movie.  I would love to only give it 4 stars out of 5 but, the over all move experiance was so good I have to give it 5 out of 5.  Make sure and sit through the entire set of credits as there is not 1 but 2 Stingers at the end."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"They did such a good job all around. Perfect cast, perfect director, perfect script, perfect soundtrack, just perfect."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2012. Exciting, entertaining and a whole lotta eye candy. Can't complain, good mix for an awesome Marvel movie. :)"
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"I loved it cause I'm a fan of these superheros and having them all together..  I wouldn't call it spectacular, but very good.  How can I not love seeing these guys in action. The Hulk rocks.  The actors bring life to the characters.  For people who are not fans of this genre, they may find it long and mediocre/average.  Special effects, yes, very good."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,awesome.   hope there's a second one.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Best film I've seen all year!!!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Best summer action movie ever
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Visual effects extravaganza! One thing I was expecting going into the avengers was a lack of character development. You often run into this when you have so many lead characters (The Expendables) I was wrong it balanced out really well and for any fanboy this was a great marvel film.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Super hero movies don't get any better than this!!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,very funny and packed full of action. i really enjoyed the movie and will deff go see it again..
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Gewoon, super awesome."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,I got to see this in 3D n it was freakin awesome!!!! My heart was beating hard n fast through out the whole movie!! I dont know which one my fav Avenger is yet cuz I love them all...I cant wait to see it again n again n again!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Lots of action and fighting
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Entertaining, but overrated. Slow start. Could have used a better villain. Prefer Xmen."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Faultless. Other than it wasn't long enough.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"An ordinary superhero movie, nothing really special."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"Being an amazing film as the final product resulted in the idea of this being a movie sounds like a train wreck at first but due to a lot of talented writing and up beat comedy in between the serious dialogue and well choreographed action sequences that make you shout out to Michael Bay ""This is how you do it you stupid f***"" Avengers is a great movie, a bit rushed near the end and a lot of convenient plot devices in between but you could say the same for Batman and his belt or Superman and his ability to go back in time. So great movie, if you haven't seen it go out ASAP or rent it when the DVD comes out."
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,perfect superhero movie!
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Great family movie. We all wanted to go again and again and again...................again.
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,Saw this in 3D at serria vista  mall on tuesday this is a must see. If not then a must buy on your list
"Jul 1, 2012",positive,"A perfect movie. Great characters, great action sequences, and even a sense of humor. Hard to ask for more. I just recommend you stay through the - all of the - credits at least once to see a very funny scene."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,I love this movie from beginning to end. Just Briliant.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Possibly One Of The Best Movies Of All Times!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Absolutely Fantastic!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,probably the best superhero movie I've seen. don't miss it!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"It was longer than it needed to be.  ""That's what she said."""
"Jun 30, 2012",neutral,Not worth the hype. As a comic book movie it was entertaining... but as a movie... it was actually pretty boring. And without plot.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Best overal movie I've seen in a long time three thumbs up
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Yes! This is how you do a comic book movie.  Joss Wedon is king!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Great movie a lot of action
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The only thing wrong with this movie is that it had to end.  Bring on iron man 3 and the rest of them!
"Jun 30, 2012",negative,"Fair at best kitschy at worst, the Avengers is overhyped and silly."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Best movie of the year, by far better than all the individual movies of all the separate characters, and that's a bold statement!"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"It wasn't very interesting in the beginning, but the last half was pretty cool."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"This shows great movies can be like if you take your time to make them. With such a big cast this movie gives each character his/her own chance to shine. great action, great humor, and an overall great movie."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"The only thing I can say is, ""what took me so darn long to go see the movie in the first place!!!!  And I must say it was a delight to see the ""man of green"" there to make his appearance....I love the way he shakes things up a bit!  :)"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,it was a good movie all leads in reall well cant wait for the second thor and captian america and the third iron man :)
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Very good...The hulk was the best by far...
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,It is what it is..an epic superhero movie
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"I really loved this movie. Plenty of action, an thrill a minute. I live the cast and characters featured in this movie. I can't wait to own it as part of my collection."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Love Marvel and love The Avengers. Can't wait for more! Best portrayal of the Hulk to date.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"DAMN Fine Film, DAMN FINE [feel free to quote me on this one] DAMN FINE INDEED"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Truly breathtaking, a great blend of action, humor and sci-fi. The final action sequence is dazzling, the special effects are flawless and hook you to the screen. I just thought the script had a bit too much science and sci-fi talk, for the people who don't understand it so much, but well, it makes the movie more credible."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"hulk is fantastic - both green and human.  good choice with the actor.  they're all great really.
really liked this film a lot."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Agent dies sad but great!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"This movie has all of the positive things people look for in movies (or at least what I look for). Action, witty dialogue, amazing acting, and characters that you become attached to. Personally, I think this movie is one of the best released this year."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Great action... Witty remarks throughout.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,WONDERFUL!!!!! Hulk SMASH !!!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The absolute epitome of what a superhero movie should be.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Amazing, simply amazing"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,awsome movie ... hoped a certain person hadn't been killed though
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Awesome awesome awesome!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"obviously the best film of the year. ill have to see how the dark Knight rises fares, but right now the Avengers all the way. the hulk was my favorite :)"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,I love this movie!! Lots and lots of action!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Awesome! A great movie, We all loved it!"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Best superhero movie out...no question. Action, story, twists, villains...what more do you need?"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,My expectations were high going into it... So this one met expectations. Go action flick. Make certain to watch it where you can enjoy the vivid scenes.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The bar has been set for what a superhero movie can and should be.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Very very good movie!! Had all the important stuff: comedy, drama, action, and a little romance to spice things up (gotta love pepper)! My only reservation is the use of Thor. For the god of thunder he was pretty downplayed where captain America could have been toned down several notches if you ask me:/"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,One of my now all time favourites. That is all i need to say!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"The perfect director. 
Balanced movie with perfect delivery for such a big time movie. 
Eagerly anticipate thanos"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"this grabed my attention right away, kept me glued to the kindle screen I was intrigued on so many different levels by the graphics wow!"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Excellent movie, the sequel should be just as good, looking forward to it"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Wanna know something bout me? I'm a HUGE comic book fanboy. Ever since I was atleast 5 years old, I was immersed into comic book culture. For god sakes, when little kids were watching Big Comfy Couch, I was watching Batman or Spawn or Spider-man. This film is what happens when you build up your characters in seperate dimensions, combine them together, and face a common threat. You get a billion dollar grossing film and one of the best comic book films ever made! Marvel has it's Magnum Opus, DC, your move."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Awesome!!! Looking forward to the sequel!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The best Superhero movie yet!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,they pullde this together perfectly....flawless!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Awesome. Really, just awesome."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The best movie of the summer.  wheden has perfected the idea that we as fans thought could not be accomplished.
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,great movie! im utterly impressed
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Best action movie of 2012....so far
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"The Avengers so far is the best of the Marvel Superhero movies.  Director Joss Whedon has done a masterful job in corralling a stellar cast lead by Robert Downey Jr, (Tony Stark/Iron Man) Chris Evans, (Captain America) Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Scarlett Johansson, (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow).  However the additions of Mark Ruffalo, (Bruce Banner/Hulk) and Jeremy Renner, (Clint Barton/Hawkeye) bring together The Avengers as a complete unit, although be it a dysfunctional one at first, but when they come together they are an unstoppable force.  Tom Hiddleston as Loki brings a wonderful performance as the main villain and he sucks you into the movie you donâ(TM)t know if heâ(TM)s going have a change of heart or if heâ(TM)s going to cut it out.  To use a quote from the film: âHis mind's like a bag of cats. You can smell crazy on himâ?.  
The script penned by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn was so entertaining that non comic book fans would enjoy it.  There are so many memorable lines that youâ(TM)ll find yourself quoting them a lot.
To wrap this up The Avengers by far is a very good film....NO!  Itâ(TM)s a GREAT film itâ(TM)s a good time at the movies, so our recommendation is see it full price and if you missed it in IMAX 3D thatâ(TM)s the best way to see it in the 3D format otherwise see it in 2D digital and see it more than once."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,The crown jewel of super-hero movies.  Nuff said!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Great sound effects, amazing cinematography, awesome explosions, good story plot, and quite funny at times. What else do you need in a superhero movie?"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Nice effects, good story, great cast."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"If there were more stars available, I'd give it more than 5! Totally worth seeing again and again."
"Jun 30, 2012",negative,"When invading Earth from outer space, accountants in office buildings are the top priority targets, closely followed by parked cars."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"I love it!!!!! Saw it in 3d, great action and great fighting scenes!"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Another Movie that can't be argued against!

93% doesn't do it justice either RT! Amazing, Would love someone to die in the Second though :P"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,awesome. would see it again
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Great fantastic movie! Will go see it again and buy it when it comes to blue ray!!!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Th action sequences are at the max in Marvel's The Avengers, and Joss Whedon has put together a script that is as surprisingly smart and clever as it is entertaining and occasionally hilarious. The Avengers takes the successes of each of its lead ins and expands on each storyline just enough to make the best entry in a long line of Marvel films."
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,the best movie in the world no movie can ever top this. this movie was really amazing!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,saw this now i want it in my collection!
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Witty, Full of Action, Emotional level present, Perfect Movie to See With the Boys"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Great, not The Avengers I was expecting. Great Marvel comic not taking itself too seriously. Thoroughly enjoyable"
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,Clean action packed very enjoyable
"Jun 30, 2012",positive,"Great dialogue and characters, story not sharp or exciting enough. Final action scene felt a little bit contrived at times."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,The best super hero movie ever!
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!!! Way better than I expected! The only movie that will stand up to it is The Dark Knight Rises!
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,A is for Awesomesauce! I really enjoyed this movie. Iron Man's one-liners alone were worth the price of admission.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Perfect. I couldnt ask for more.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,This movie was a blast. I really like how all the characters had pretty equal screen time. No one overshadowed the other.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Very good movie, set the bar for all following comic hero movies."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Great movie! Solid story. Tons of action that actually moved the story forward and subtle humor that is perfectly placed and surprising.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,With a perfect alinement of heroes and a perfect script for each character. This is one of the best movie of this year.
"Jun 29, 2012",neutral,"I think I already saw this movie...when it was called ""Transformers"" and it starred robots.
Only redeeming qualities...Thor's biceps, Captain America's ass and IronMan's one-liners!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"This movie is nothing like Nolan's superhero films. This movie is a fun, wacky ride through the world of heroics backed up by solid acting performances by RDJ, both Chris Evans and Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston.
Now Mark Ruffalo was good, but he's no Ed Norton and Norton portrays him much, much better.
Still an enjoyable film truly a great film."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Excellent fun, great action."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this; but then again, I really enjoy anything with Robert Downey JR!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"A masterful movie worth every bit of the hype leading up to it since the release of Iron Man.  All of the witty humor from each movie is combined perfectly into this single movie as well.  Not only extremely well written and performed, but the funniest movie I have ever seen that was not classified primarily under the comedy genre.  Probably the most entertaining movie I have ever seen."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Worth watching just for the 3D effects, but forget about the story line."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,was good it didn't quite blow me away but it was good
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,predictable. but good
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"This is one of those movies I would watch many times. Great cast, action packed, awesome effects, fun, I loved it. And my favorite, Iron Man, he does such a good job, and brings some fun and laughter to the movie, he is great. Highly recommend it."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,I took my kids to see it. I loved it even more when I found out it was directed by Joss Whedon!
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"This is hands-down the best superhero movie ever made. The combination of thrilling action, hilariously epic dialogue, a well-written story, and excellent effects makes this film near perfect."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Can I give it more than 5 stars?!?
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,this movie fires on all cylinders. Marvel fans will rejoice in one of the greatest superheroes ensemble  ever committed to film. This movie is great fun highly recommended.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Loved it, amazing twist of super heroes together! I loved the interactions between each hero and even believed them! Can't wait until the next one! Atleast I hope there will be a next one."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a genius. What a delight.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Really a nice movie.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,HOLY SHIT! The movie that has been in the making for years delivered perfectly! Every superhero except Hawkeye and Black Widow already had their own movie going into this (and even they had cameos) so in the end it felt like an epic collaboration of everyone from these big movies coming together in one. I'll go ahead and call this one of the best superhero movies of all time!
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"I was so worried about this film.  There were 100 ways for this film to fail but it worked out perfectly for one reason... Joss Whedon.  Leave it to a sci/fi fanboy to make sure the greatest team of superheroes had a great movie.  The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is because it took alittle long to get going.  The openning scene took way too long and (understandably) they had to introduce each hero.  Other then that, it's a great script, the acting is awesome and the overall film was a fun experiance.  It's nothing groundbreaking but it's everything I wanted Transformers to be.  Why not reboot that and let Joss Whedon write and direct it.  In fact, if studios want to reboot ANYTHING then just give it to Joss Whedon.  This has been a PSA for everyone in Hollywood.
Favorite Avenger: HULK!"
"Jun 29, 2012",negative,"Yes the visuals are great, and yes it has a lot of cool superheroes, but the story is weak, and the dialogue is cheesy, unfunny, and just plain bad. The movie has no emotion and no meaning. It was one of the most over hyped and irratating movies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Totally worth every penny!!!
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Me and my,family love it"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Robert Downey Jr saved it...
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,This movie was the bomb diggity.  It made me feel 15 years old again.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"I like superheroes and action, delivers on both fronts."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Despite teary-eyed performances by the majority of the cast, in the vein of Tobey Maguire, The Avengers is a solid super-hero mash-up that isn't bogged down with origin stories (for once!)."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've watched since Avatar. Was a phenomenal adventure. Highly recommend to those who want to watch a great story with awesome graphic effects and action
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Grandiose and ambitious, Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers' raises the stakes for this season's blockbuster showdown for supremacy. It's lighthearted feel and strategically placed humor mingles well amongst the urgent, dire undertones, while a spectacle of CGI delights promise for one behemoth of a climax. Still, for all of its pleasures, the over commitment to hollow character interactions and heavily uneven acting stay this from reaching the astronomic heights that it no doubt set out for.   
 
Humanity is threatened when an alien named Loki begins to execute his plan of dominance over the Earth. When this threat is discovered, the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, attempts to bring together a team of heroes to oppose the hostile take over. With time running out, the team of 'Avengers' must learn to cooperate and stand together as one if there is any hope of repelling the forces that aim to dominate the world they love. 

The practically unprecedented attempt to include such a vast amount of principle heroes into one movie warrants kudos alone, especially given that most had previously boasted their own feature films. Whedon did a good job spreading out camera time evenly between the oversized cache, affording them the opportunity to shine amongst their peers. Unfortunately, this time wasn't used nearly as efficiently as it should have been, as most scenes gave in to lapses of corny exchanges and yawnful attempts by characters to boast their superiority over one another. If used sparsely it may have been a welcome relief from the severity of the story line, but instead the act became tiresome during pivotal points that should have instead been building intensity into the climax.

Each Avenger had their moments, but there is a notable disparity amongst them as the movie progressed.  Downy's Iron Man and Ruffalo's Hulk for example enjoyed the best chemistry as a duo by far due to their complicated personas and skilled actors. Their wit and sarcasm dimmed the crowd pleasing attributes of the remainder of the cast to the point where they felt muted at times. Because of this, the struggle of piecing together such a robust character field together in an equally beneficial way became apparent, as some simply were not as effective in a group as they were when flying solo. 

For size and scale alone one could argue that the 'The Avengers' boasts one of the best climaxes in comic book movie history. The sense of urgency and special effects bombard you at every turn, as the resolution remains cloaked long enough to keep you anticipating how the day will be saved. Given the extended run time, the script intertwines a clever mixture of intensity and humor that keep the film neither from becoming kooky or taking itself too seriously. Every player, hero and villain alike, fit into their niche just in time to deliver an ending fitting of a blockbuster movie. And in true fashion of its genre, the credits give a glimpse to where the inevitable sequel will be taking us next.  

Given the uncharted territory in which this film explores and the pitfalls of such an endeavor, I applaud it for succeeding more than it failed. I trust that now with a canvas to look back upon and touch up that the next installment will be a marked improvement. There was a lot to introduce here, and being able to reach out to audiences who have seen the previous films in which these characters spawned and those who haven't is a difficult task indeed.

Rating: 7/10"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Best movie of the year. Do I dare say even the best movie of the decade? 
Avengers will keep you on the edge of your seats, craving for more."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,i still think they should have given hawkeye his original costum
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Awesome!!! I saw it three times(:
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Absobloodylutely fantastic lol
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Saw the movie several times just never did a review on this site. The film was a blast but I think some people do over hype it. After the third time seeing I felt a bit bored. I will probably watch it a few more times when it is released but.. not a movie I will keep returning to.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"I loved it, loved it, loved it!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"My favorite parts were almost all about Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo.  His Hulk (the character played before by Eric Bana and Edward Norton) was different because itâ(TM)s seriously comedic. I laughed when he punched Thor when they landed side by side, when he woke up Ironman by his loud growl, when he smashed the giant fish like space ship, when Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulkâ(TM)s human alterego) arrived in the battle area by his rusty scooter, and when he alternately tosses Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  For the first time heâ(TM)s not the lost and helpless hero, heâ(TM)s funny and in control.

"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Too many characters fighting against millions of aliens. Boring.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,greatest movie of the year!!!!!! love the marvel brand and this topped the charts.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"By far, the best if all the marvel movies to date!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,It's about a bunch of dudes who can't play nicely and then they do at the end.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Brilliant.  Best bit:  what Hulk does to interrupt Loki's ""You are all beneath me"" rant.

Hilarious, and spot on - that's exactly how the hulk WOULD react."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Definatly one of the best movies of all time.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Absolutely awesome! I love the interrelationships that they introduce between the characters, and the hulk just steals the show!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Awesome and very funny!!! Favorite parts: Hulk, smash. And the gaming worker, galactica!!!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,couldn't ask for a better combination of comedic relief and drama and action just an overall great movie
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Disgustingly good. Practically perfect. Go see it. Joss Whedon is brilliant and everyone better finally start seeing him for the genius that he is.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Just an in general great movie, the action was great  The play with each of the characters was good, it kept you thoroughly entertained."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Avengers is the best Hulk movie.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,this was great  the fights good to  an Hulk dame good
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Not real crazy with the horned helmet of our arch villain, but a thoroughly entertaining story. Glad to see the Hulk become a real hero and an important member in the team."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Joss fu*king Whedon! That's all I have to say.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Great fun! Hulk has great lines.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,The Best Comic Book Movie of All Times

"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie!!!! You'll be on the edge of your seat thr whole movie!!!! I wanted to see Prometheus, but this was better!!!!"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Jam packed action, special effects and some good humor makes this movie worth seeing. Robert Downey Jr. held it together for me."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,I want the hot toys....T T
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Muy lograda esta pelÃ­cula en su nada fÃ¡cil tarea de reunir a un grupo de superhÃ (C)roes, interpretados en su mayorÃ­a por estrellas de Hollywood. Un experimento riesgoso pero que les resulta en una pelÃ­cula con ritmo, buenas interpretaciones, el lucimiento de Robert Downey Jr. sin quitar espacio a los demÃ¡s, un final apotÃ (C)osico con llogrados efectos visuales (el mejor Hulk que he visto) y escenas de acciÃ³n que no dejan mareado al espectador. RecomendadÃ­sima."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"The best superhero movie of all time. Was fun, action packed, visually stunning and had many hilarious moments. All the characters got their limelight and the interaction between them was fantastic. This film topped off the last 5 years of great film making by Marvel and I look forward to 'phase two' in the coming years."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Exactly what you would expect from a star casted super hero movie. Awesome, action packed, the whole caboodle"
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Loved it although i prefer the previous  Hulk then the new one.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"I liked it. A well-made movie partially undone by its shallow dialogue, cheesy alien invasion premise, and inexplicably resolved problems."
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,Already I can say that this movie will have no rival for the throne of Summer Blockbuster.
"Jun 29, 2012",positive,"Words cannot describe just how perfect and spectacular an adaption this is. Joss Whedon and his fantastic ensemble cast have crafted my favorite superhero movie- nay, movie ever. Funny, chilling, emotional and with plenty of spectacular action and CGI. With all the hype they had dared not mess up, but they went above and beyond my expectations."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Not bad just not really good.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"In the purest sense, an extremely fun and rewarding comic book movie. Bravo Marvel, Bravo Joss Whedon, Overall one of the best super hero movies in recent history."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,A massive spectacle and heaps of fun!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,well i thought it was great
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie yet Your turn Batman
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,This movie is awesome
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,It's hilarious and is action packed
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"A great film for comic heads and Marvel fans. The action scenes do not disappoint and the humor is spot on. A great movie to watch with family, friends, or alone. This should definitely become part of your DVD collection. 5 Ã°???"
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,If you don't like this you don't have a soul.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Fun movie. Had some good effects and I always like comic movies.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I've seen in three times (once in 3D)! Still good...
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Great, amazing movie all the way through. non-stop, didn't want it to end, absolutely great. I don't know how they will top it."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"love the non stop action movie, usually I don't like marvel movies except for Spiderman but this one my friend dragged me too, but at the end I enjoyed it a lot great movie and the Acura at the end was super sexy"
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"This movie is amazing,though unfortunately spiderman wasn't in the movie."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Great Movie! Well-written, kudos to Whedon, and threaded together so well that it's hard to distinguish who the true icon is. Bit of advice for a potential sequel though, avoid the repetitve alien invasion on Earth, which was kind of implied when all was said and done, and concieve an idea that will bring these heroes, along with some expected newcomers, back to the forefront in stride."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is big.  Big heroes, big set pieces...all as designed.  It's clearly the most fun of the Marvel films, with enough comedic moments between the characters to keep the atmosphere light most of the  time.  Of the main actors-and there are about eight of them, plus a slew of supporting characters-Chris Evans as Captain America is the most bland.  He's never quite sure about how to bring off the character like he did in his standalone film last year.  Robert Downey Jr. is hands down the best actor in the film, getting more than his share of one liners and moments.  Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson almost get the short end of the stick because they aren't A list characters.  The film itself packs in a lot of information into a relatively short amount of time, but tries to reintroduce each of these characters on their own early on.  The earlier films in the canon aren't required viewing, but it sure helps to know the in's and out's of the universe.  The story?  It's standard heroes saving the world type stuff.  The Avengers, though, is fun, just like it should be.  And when Captain America's orders to Hulk are ""Hulk smash,"" well, you know the shit is about to hit the fan.  In a good way.  When does Avengers 2 come out?"
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"I had a boyish smile through the whole film, even if I did see it 4 times"
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,3D was epic loved this movie 100%
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Loved the Hulk in this ...and of course Ironmam
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Bar none, it's the best of the superhero genre."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I LOVED this film. Not only was it full of action it was pretty funny as well. Cannot wait to purchase this film on DVD.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Number one movie on my list I can't even describe it awesome
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!!!!!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Loved it...far exceeded my expectations!
"Jun 28, 2012",neutral,It reminded me of the Never Ending Story...cause it never ended.  Way too long.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I saw this a few times and enjoyed it every time.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I actually wanna watch it again!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"As a big Joss Whedon fan and a fan of super hero movies i knew this would be  a winner.

It's a match made in heaven, Downey Jr's delivery coupled with Whedons writing prowess. Well all know the basis of a great super hero movie (Ironman and Spiderman 2 taught us that) and the avengers is in the same ball park, but with crisper dialogue and a rather interesting narrative. There's rarely a dull moment with only the middle act sagging in parts. Downey is brilliant as always as is new boy Mark Ruffalo. 

The last hour or so are everything i expected from this film, the use of character team work and expertly choreographed action scenes. It didn't knock Ironman of my No.1 super-hero movie but this came damn close."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,really good action. just thought it was long
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Awesome, action packed adventure. A must see for anyone who likes comics."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Pretty good action movie...worth the price of admission.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Alright film. Awesome battle sequences, especially at the end. I still don't really like Loki, and the plot line is there, but unclear as far as motifs go, so I am in there for Avengers 2. Great CG and acting, except I don't like the new Hulk. Ed Norton was great,  and old Hulk model was great. Here, ehh..."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Good, but not great.  See it if you haven't, but don't go running to the theatre.  It's an OK movie script with a lot of budget behind it."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Probably the best SyFi movie of all time (sorry Star Wars).
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,So good I saw it twice.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Loved it!!  Saw it twice.  Would see it again.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Movie of the decade!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! No one hero was the 'star' of the movie it included everyone very effectively
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,This is one of the best comic book movies I have seen in a while! Captain america is my man and Chris evans did that part justice!!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Action packed from start to finish with superb acting and visuals throughout. The humour adds to the thrill of the movie and is not overdone. It's the Avengers, what more do you want!? (Whedon did an excellent jod, can't wait to see what he does next!)."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Good action and story was good. Young kids under 10 may need a parent for some scenes
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Perfection, through and through."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,i thought it was really kick ass.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,One of the best films! EVER!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Best movie of all time. Love how they mixed comedy and action!!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Was worth the purchase but not as good as some claim.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Loved it!! It was a little cheesy in some parts but I still really enjoyed it!
"Jun 28, 2012",negative,"this blockbuster did not live up to it's hype! yes, there are amazing visual effects and really shows the human side of the heroes. But it really doesn't do more than introduce the heroes. Bringing them all to a predictable and boring battle with aliens much too easily defeated to be ""feared by the whole galaxy""."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Greatest Super hero movie thus far.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"this film is full of action from all the classic marvel films, crammed into one place. 
never got bored and the story line story-line is quite easy to follow, unlike some action films that loose track."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,great movie I grew up watching these heroes awesome fight scenes
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,It was brilliant :-)
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Very funny! Great effects!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Best movie ive seen in a long time
"Jun 28, 2012",negative,Not what I expected.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Really enjoyed it. Great mix of action and comedy with everyone getting close to equal screen time.  My favorite movie this summer so far.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Amazing movie!! One of my favorites!! Must see for superhero fans :) yay Iron Man!!
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,Very funny and exciting movie! Hope they come out with a second
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I saw it and it was AWESOME. It's got all of your favorite heroes fighting as Loki tries to rule the world with a legion of aliens. The only small thing I don't like is that it was mainly just all-out fighting.
"Jun 28, 2012",neutral,criminally overrated
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"The movie was pretty awesome, it was action packed and didn't give you a chance to look away. The plot was clear and continuous and didn't leave any holes for questioning. I have never been a big comic book guy, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Now, I wait for dark knight."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Masterful , The Avengers is something nobody will forget. its a brilliantly put together movie in every way. it manged to balance every character and give them all memerable moments. the visuals are perfect (the hulk just may be the most visualy perfect character to EVER be brought on to the big screen after seeing this). Ive Been reading Marvel comics for over 10 years now and Im Relieved to say that watching The Avengers was like waking up on Christmas morning and seeing ten trees with eleven presents under each one. A Must See in every way for everyone."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,I thought It was awesome.. the first few minutes where slow for me then BOOM... Rockets you into excitement.
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Now THIS movie was just totally epic.  I liked everything about it, and that's not something I say very often.  I hope my boy Joss Whedon gets some long-deserved recognition out of this for a change.  His other film this year, Cabin in the Woods was pretty damned good, too."
"Jun 28, 2012",positive,"Best comic book movie after Watchmen, and the best Hulk movie by far.  Although it reinforces my hate of Hawkeye, it continues the trend of making me like comic characters I don't really like in actual comics (Cpt. America and Thor) which is pretty crazy."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,great movie marvel has done it again..  lots of action and great special effects
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Just an amazing movie. Both action and humor. On the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Depicted the relationship between the team very well.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"""The Avengers"" is as close to a perfect movie as you can get-- incredible on all levels!"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,This Movie Was The Bomb!!!!!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,A fun and energetic summer blockbuster that's actually pretty smart and witty.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Just awsome enough said.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Has to be the best movie i've seen in last 10 years  awesome job. Can't wait for next one
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,great movie to fit six stories into a film.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,amazing! a must see!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"This movie was excellent. I think it had almost everything I expected it to have. But i did get confused with some scenes, like when Iron Man and Thor fought. I thought that was foreshadowing as they might of used Thor's Hammer on Captain America's Shield as some kind of weapon at the end. But it turned out to be a useless scene. I remember the movie having a couple of them, but hey, they were still pretty epic!"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,THE BEST AND MOST AWESOME MOVIE IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"La mejor en lo que va del aÃ±o. Buenas secuencias de pelea, actuaciones, visuales, le faltÃ³ un poco en la trama para ser perfecta."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Exciting from the beginning till the end. Wasn't bored at all
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Awesome! Need i say more?
"Jun 27, 2012",neutral,Idk. I guess I just figured loki would be more badass. Especially after how it started
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"May or may not be the best superhero movie ever made. But who cares, it is the most fun I have ever ha at a superhero movie."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"It was entertaining, 


              P.S. i saw it when came out"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"GREAT, Funny, I really enjoyed it!! Good message too!!"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Lots of action, like most of the actors, just all flash with little story"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,First great blockbuster of the summer.
"Jun 27, 2012",negative,Took too long for the actual heroes to enter the action.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,The best marvel movie ever!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Saw It Before But I Wanna Download It >.<
"Jun 27, 2012",negative,Totally over hyped. Lacks an interesting story and it's way too long.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Great Movie, Cant wait to buy it."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Awesome. Some of the best Marvel heroes all in one movie, and they all get their fair share of screen time and are all equally focused on."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"I'm not sure if I was tired or if the action hero scenario is tired.  To me, it was just a mash-up of all the other movies that came before.  Nothing truly original.  Good action, though.  I say, give this movie a chance.  You might like it for the pure action and the heroes that you've come to know and love."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,What a wonderful superhero romp- an incredibly fun piece of cinema with lots of laughs and a great story to engage throughout!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Comedy, action/adventure, Marvel. Three awesome qualities this movie has."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Best marvel movie to date
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,What's not to like? I wanted to see MORE...
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Those of you who ""marvel"" ( get it? ) at this stuff will really enjoy.  While I am not a true follower of the Super Hero peeps, I found this movie a lot of fun.  Robert Downey Jr. is always fun to watch on screen ( I recommend ""Chaplin"" as well) and Mark Ruffalo is AWESOME as Bruce Banner/The Hulk.  It's long but entertaining."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Great effects and comedy.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Hahah funny, awesome, go watch it."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,The BEST movie of all time!!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"This is a good movie, and also what you call an action comedy..."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Though at first I viewed this movie as another hollywood fad to drive more comic book related films into the limelight. I must admit, Im not an overly huge fan of comic book films ( Iron Man and Chris Nolan directed ones excluded!!)
When I watched this I was pleasantly surprised to really quite enjoy this film, its very cleverly done usually when you have this array of characters in one film, it tends to either be a bit long and tedious whilst the director is trying to develop every characters individual emotional backdrop or it tends to do the opposite whereas one character has the main limelight and you're left wondering what is the point of having all the other characters there. This one treads the background story lightly and works rather quite well.
Obviously, I check a lot of films out on flixster before I see them (I try not to because its can change my opinion). With this film it feels like it has been a tad bit over-rated on my books, like I said though im not a huge fan of comic book films, but to me this film should be a standard of comic book films rather than treating it as a masterpiece. The main reason why I feel like this is because there is nothing outstanding about it and there is nothing that is overtly different about it, essentially if you have seen all the previous marvel films leading up to this, it is a fairly similar theme and setting. There is little extra to take from this film, the only thing I can think of that kinda separates it apart is the ""free-for-all"" royal rumble element to it, where several superheros are beating the s**t out of each it, though quite a satisfying viewing :)!
First things first, is that the acting in this is quite cool. Robert Downey Jr is awesome and smarmy/cocky best, just like in the Iron Man film which I rate highly. Sometimes I feel like the reason why I enjoyed this film so much is because of Downey's demanding presence and he is quite a central character as well, he has a lot of screen time. Samuel Jackson plays his role quite well albeit nothing too different from his usual Samuel role: Theres a great quote in this film which highlights this (no context needed) ""Nick Fury - That's a stupid-ass plan! Give my team time!"" I thought that was very typical Samuel and rather funny. I think though the rest of the avengers were played quite well and it felt seamless, I give a lot credit for Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I enjoyed Edward Norton's portrayal in the Incredible Hulk, I was unsure what angle of which that Mark Ruffalo would approach it, it worked rather nicely I thought as the calm but decidely instant mood-swing manner that he had. The Villian in this ""Loki"" was a very well portrayed by Tom Hiddleston he was a very cool, hell-bent character that seem to start of invincible and the end up laughable. It was a nice villian character to have as most comic book villians tend to be laughable but insane at the very beginning and remain that way, but with Loki it was a nice and charismatic character to have.
One other point which I couldn't work out and I'd like people that comment me on this! When I went to the cinema to see altough it was a cardboard cut out poster, I saw that Cobie Smulders was in it and whilst watching the film she had quite a bit of screen time, generally it would be a reaction shot or quick sentence or two speaking to Nick Fury. It struck me a bit odd because her role was not that essential to film and it was not as if she was well known character, I thought that the amount of screen time she had was a bit too much for her importance in the film. It just struck as something that Im not sure if it was just me that noticed or maybe she has got an important role, I don't know :)))
At the end of the day though, What Joss Whedon has done with this film is very clever and although prehaps not a ""special"" film it is certainly a great film and shows that with a clever script, direction and actors you can have a lot of characters in one film and not make a meal of it (Just look at ""The Watchmen""!)"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,This movie sews into the others like the Armani suit of superhero movies.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"HULK SMASH!! Pretty awesome, and lots of laughs intertwined with the action."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Great comedy movie disguised as an action movie.  Overall very well done.  Joss Whedon is amazing.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,This is a freaking kickass movie and I can't wait for the avengers 2
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"An entertaining movie with good effects. In terms of plot, not very original, but a decent film."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it, as the fast paced, enjoyable action was buoyed by the fantastic and funny script and really excellent casting choice for the characters of the Avengers themselves. However, the second time around, I was rather dissapointed, as I realized how stupid the alien angle of the story was, and really went from being apathetic towards Loci to feeling like he was a pretty uninteresting villain. That being said, the truth lies somewhere in between, and with these actors signed up for another Avengers movie, all that is required is a better villain and a more believable/relatable premise to make the second Avengers movie a pantheon superhero movie"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Outstanding in action scenes and it has a lot of funny parts too. It started the summer movies on a good note.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"A bit slow in the beginning (after initial call to action). There were a few bright moments, and the ending was action-packed, but too many super-heroes and no character development. The whole thing reminded mo of one of those episodes of your favorite TV show where they spend the hour recapping the highlights of the past season. You'll watch it if there's nothing else on, and it's not a total waste of an hour, but if you miss it, no biggie."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Great culmination of the Marvel universe movies. Not as good as the standalones (sans Iron Man 2); however, makes up for its shortcomings in terms of sheer scale and fanboy points."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,It's a great movie but as far as comic book movies I still prefer Dark Knight. I guess my expectations were a little too high for this one.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,It was cool and funny at the same time:)
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,EPIC.    that's all I have to say
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,A masterpiece.  I have nothing more to say about this movie.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I have seen in 2012. And also the best superhero movie I have ever seen!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Great cast, director, and filmography. You really can't go wrong with this one."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Perfect. The best comic-made-movie yet.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Best Super Hero Movie Ever!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,never seen this but i know it's absolutely good movie..
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Phenomenal movie. Keeps you interested from minute one and has a solid plot. Watching all those solid actors/super heroes in a joint fight together was well choreographed and filmed perfectly. Tons of fun and worth every penny. No over the top stunts and actually for a colabo picture it actually put time into the plot which was a pleasant surprise. Well done Joss. Now give us a sequel.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"General story had a few hiccups but the utter fact that Whedon managed to infuse each Avenger perfectly, give them each their deserved screen time along with its amazing set pieces and the fact that the Hulk was finally given justice. The best Marvel film since Spider-Man 2. 4.5/5"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"Love movies that have continuity which looks hard. this one  is incredibly masterful, juggling all those characters something only joss wedon could do cant wait for his next marvel effort"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Just raised the bar.
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,What can I say?....The Best Movie Of The Year!!!!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"One hell of a ride, really enjoyed when HULK is in action and when he smashes the lead villain simply astonishing..........Very good entertainer, more than expected with all the characters especially with Iron man and HULK"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Freaking best movie of all time hp is close but this is so good
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Very surprising just how good this movie was! I want to see it again and I'm definitely buying the blu ray!
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"""The Avengers"" was everything I expected and then some. The visual effects were nothing short of spectacular and the action sequences were phenomenal. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I recommend anybody go catch this film."
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,"You know it! I give this one my ""both thumb's up"". I do love my comic book movies. One thing I don't like though is the Loki character. Didn't like him in Thor either. What did do this movie for me is HULK! Was disappointed in the earlier Hulk movie leads, but this guy is it! Can't wait to see more Hulk and Avenger adventures!"
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,Full of action and fun and thoroughly entertaining ~ a great flick to sit down and have fun with
"Jun 27, 2012",positive,It the best movies ever
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Best Marvel movie yet. Looking forward to the next one.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen in a very long time. Whedon did an amazing job!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Even if you don't like super hero movies, you'll love this!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Was better than I thought. The guy playing Thor made it less boring thats for sure. :) Good movie.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"As long as you have seen the prior movies, it's a great superhero movie."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Sooo good but some things they fell short on.PS:LOKI WAS HOT!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"This is a good movie. Everybody will enjoy seeing this one. Almost all of the scenes are entertaining. It will never fails you to get bored. One funny thing is that Robert Downey, Jr  is the most paid actor and yet when he is wearing his iron man suit, his face is only seen."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,OMG!!!! Incredible. I saw it 3 times. Can't wait to get it on DVD. I will be glued to my tv watching it over and over and over.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Satisfaction from beginning to ending!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Everything about The Avengers was FUN!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,the ultimate blast for Marvel movies fans
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"like most of these movies they can't include all of the serious plot lines from the comics but still a great job and well put together.
Favorite part was Hulk smashing Loki in the building when he starts to pout about being a ""God""  lol great!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Every ounce of entertainment value has been squeezed out of the latest Marvel film, and it's probably the companies best. There's a story somewhere in there, but going to the Avengers and expecting top notch story telling is like going to McDonalds and expecting exceptional cuisine. It's an action movie down to its roots, layered with slice and slice of awesomeness. While some superheroes *cough* Iron Man *cough* outshine others in screen time, they all seem to mesh pretty well ith each other. The performances are all quirky and fun, even though Captain America acts like a jerk. they all effectively play off each other. What it all adds up to is a flabbergastingly large fight scene with amazing CG and fantastic fight choreography. Obviously everyone knows that the avengers will win at the end, defeating the gargtuan enemy, but you can't help but to have a child-like grin plastered on your face. I believe that the main goal of a movie is to entertain, that's what they're made for right? So on that manner, The Avengers succeeds in almost every sense of the word. Except some of the costumes. Those were just silly."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,If you like comic book type movies you will like this.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"The movie has holes in it like wasn't the Biforst Bridge destroyed and why did they still bring Loki to the Helicarrier despite him having an opportunity to escape while they were fighting in the woods but for some strange reason people loved it. 30 minutes of action and a couple in between, Marvel's Avengers is an average movie and its success is based on brilliant marketing. Hopefully the 2nd installment will have a more effective heroes unlike Hawkeye and Black Widow. and last but not least, the audience only enjoyed the scenes with the Hulk, which was portrayed accurately despite him looking a bit overweight."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Whedon,I give you all my love for making such a great film! The effects were great, the super heroes stuck true to their nature, the acting was superb and how can you go wrong with the Hulk Smashing?"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Captain America makes it all worth it. <3 <3 <3 #nuffsaid
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Great movie - I was skeptical and not a superhero movie buff - but it was a fun and entertaining view - loved it
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Terrific movie, incredible special effects, outstanding acting performances by the whole cast!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Two words......FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Excellent flick. Would see it over and over again.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Loved it! Will buy it for sure!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,WONDERFUL action/superhero movie. The combination of multiple hero's into one story makes for a wonderful film. The relationships between them is evident and provides for good entertainment.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,I am very much so a DC Comic guy... This movie almost made made switch sides... Well Done Mr. Whedon. Well Done!
"Jun 26, 2012",neutral,Turns out I'm not a huge fan of super hero moviesâ?¦ Love Batman tho :)
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"I love superhero comics but somehow the craziness of the mutant superhero world doesn't seem to translate well from drawings or cartoons to live action + cgi.  Joss Whedon's version was actually one of the better attempts.  I very much liked the buildup and the way the different characters are brought together.  If the whole thing was like that i'd've given it 4 or 5 stars.  But once the battle started it all became so anti-climactic.  Why are extraterrestrial invaders always portrayed so menacingly up until the time they try to invade Earth, and then when they do invade they are shown as a bunch of whimps.  

*** SPOILERS ***

A single nuke took about the alien mothership. Um, don't they have missile defence, or anything?  And where was the regular army and airforce when the avengers were fighting the aliens, hell, Shield had a whole aircraft carrier full of planes to play with."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Such an amazing movie! If you're interested with super hereos, friendship, teamwork then this is the movie for you! :)"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I have ever seen.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,One of the best adventurer heroes adrenaline-ride action-packed movies I have seen in a long time.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Great summer action movie. Could possibly be the biggest one of 2012! The movie had me from the start until the end. Whedon does a great job keeping the movie rolling like a freak train! It never lets up from the beginning. R.D. JR (IronMan) and Ruffalo (Hulk) personally stole the show from the others. Great special effects, acting, and story made this movie a blockbuster!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Easily the best movie I've ever seen. A nice blend of action and humor, with a compelling story line."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"A comic book story in every way, and a movie that survives and reels in big fish even with its simple and easy plot."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,one of the best movies ive seen this year.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Epic movie.

The ending is a little bit bad, but it is still a very good movie."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Avengers is the perfect summer blockbuster - funny, exciting, spectacular, over blown, clever ... And a whole bucket load of fun."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"this was an awesome, must see!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,We laughed all the way through it. plenty of little side comments
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,I Love Captain America!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen in a long time.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"I'm not much of a super hero lover, but this movie was pretty cool."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Awesome and hilarious
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,It has a great story with it and the only super hero movie I like
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Joss whedon did a great job at making characters who have mostly all starred in their own extended prologue film and make them a team in the ways that Marvel comics are so good at doing. The graphics are of course top notch, but that was granted. I have some issues with the mildly sexist portrayal of Black Widow, but considering most modern action flicks this is a minor problem.

Overall, if you want a big dumb action movie, this is the best you can get."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Brilliant. A superhero movie that will last the ages for its ability to bring joy to its audience, fanbase, and still live up to the hype. Truly the penultimate action superhero movie. The only question is how The Avengers 2 can possibly hope to match it."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Very good movie. Its long but worth it!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,very well done!!  can't wait for the sequel!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Epic the best movie ever never will lose.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Absolutely one of the best superhero movies!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Great movie, superhero frenzy!!!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"If you are Marvel Comic fan don't see this, because is a alternative form to see the mainstream modern of this era...MTV, pink popcorn and Lady Gaga..."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,AMAZING :) One of the best films ever made
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"It was lil less good then i expected, but still loved it!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Loved it.  Action packed!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Beautifully done!  I love everything about it and plan on adding it to my library.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Will be watching over and over again until there is another one.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Pleasantly surprised by the amount of humor in the movie - felt like I was watching a comedy at times with all of the laugh-out-loud moments by the audience in the theater.  Special effects, acting, action, comedy were all fantastic!  My only criticism is that it did move a little slow at times...perhaps it was dragged out a little longer than necessary."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,I didn't realize the Hulk was so mental!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Near perfect Super Hero film with tons of humor and charm.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Pure summer blockbuster fun with plenty of explosive mayhem, action and gags, nothing more and nothing less than what you were expecting.
Don't bother with the 3D though."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,The Hulk makes this film great.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Finally, someone consulted people who actually write comics, read comics ,or can name 10 characters they haven't seen in another movie. Steve Rodgers wasn't unfortunately underwhelming in comparison to his comic book persona, but that's nitpicking. Why are directors not named Joss Whedon so pretentious to think that they don't have to utilize the wealth of knowledge available to them to make Marvel movies at this caliber. It's so frustrating."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Puro espectáculo. Tras ver las precuelas, está muy por encima de lo esperado"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,very good storyline.action was great.Wil download this one for sure!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,This movie is AMAZING!!!!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,The best possible Avengers movie that could have been made. Near flawless. Can't wait to own this bad boy on blu-ray!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"3 simple words: GO SEE IT!

2 adjectives: AMBITIOUS , COMPLEX

1 name: WHEDON

0: The excuses you should have for not seeing this movie on the big screen."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Fantastic movie....comedy, action, great acting.  I couldn't find one flaw with it.  It sets up a sequel very well too."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"All that a superhero movie should be, and more"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,THAT MOVIE WAS INCREDIBLE!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Awesome action, graphics, comedy, all around AWESOME!!"
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Best superhero film so far!
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Better than it has any right to be.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Halfway between decent and good.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Great story, cheeky characters, and interesting twist to the Marvel Series."
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Awesome sound fx were phenomenal action pact intense from start to Finnish and another ending
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,Excellent job by Marvel Studios and all Marvel characters. This movie was perfectly balanced with exciting action and hilariously aweing humour. Can't wait to bring the 3D bluray home when it comes out.
"Jun 26, 2012",positive,SICK! KILLER STORY/EFFECTS/CAST. CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER. OH AND ITS A GOOD MOVIE AS WELL.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"better than expectations, so 3 1/2 stars..."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"A brilliant personification of all that is Hollywood cinema: lots of CGI, witty American dialogue, a story that follows a template from start to finish, and enough action to keep you from focussing on any form of character development.  It's definitely not terrible - it's entertaining enough - and the direction and performances are greater than many other blockbuster's.  Maybe Christopher Nolan's spoiled me for every other comic-to-screen flick?"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"What's not to like. Bring together some of the better comic movies and even a thin plot becomes entertaining. Combines the wisecracking Robert Downey Junior's Iron Man with the serious and upright Captain America. Good cast of characters who put up a decent entertaining performance, thought I could not figure out why Scarlett Johansson was needed."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"pretty good entertainment, but all comic fans will alway think they could have done better"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"A great script, a stellar cast, and a good sense of humor. You can't ask for much more from a feel-good superhero romp."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,The best super hero movie since Superman ll.
"Jun 25, 2012",negative,"Not that great. The special effects were average and silly for the world or timeline they portray in the film. I expect more from a film made today. RDJ was the best character though his script was flat. Gwyneth Paltrow, not doubt she's talented, but under leveraged in this film, hmm why was she in the film? She doesn't add anything to the overall storyline. Wait until it is out of the theaters. Not worth the $$."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Amazing a must see in theaters
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Originally Posted at Otherwhere.Co

It is no secret that I think Joss Whedon is pretty much the master when it comes to writing the best characters, stories and dialogue. Hands down, I don't think anybody can do an ensemble better than he. Since I can say with complete honesty that I have followed his work since 1997 and watched everything he has ever made (multiple times in a continuous loop), I can also say with just a smidge of authority that The Avengers is his best work yet.

The Avengers has absolutely everything a summer blockbuster movie needs. Crazy action, sick fight scenes, bigger than life characters, aliens, gods, superheroes, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett in a cat suit. Michael Bay could have done all that and I'm sure plenty of people would still have seen it. Joss took all this and did the one thing that makes great movies phenomenal. He made it human.

Every character is perfectly developed. Nobody takes themselves too seriously, humor abounds and in the end they are just people (or alien gods), forced to put aside their collective baggage and fight for the fate of the world. Sound familiar?? Hmmmm, I'll give you two guesses but you'll only need one.

Joss' signature style is all over the place! You'll hear it in the dialogue, see it in the fight scenes and glimpse it in the camera work. The smartest thing Hollywood ever did was hire this man to make this movie. His huge respect for the characters, the source material and the essence of what it's all about is beyond evident. I cannot wait to see all the behind the scenes and extras on the super-duper-edition-blu-ray that I will totally be pre-ordering in like two seconds.
This is it folks. The one we have all been waiting for. It's the best thing that's happened since Buffy and it's beautiful."
"Jun 25, 2012",neutral,Mayb i shoulda watched thor before i saw this
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"As this high budget film was made for pure entertainment, I guess it worked. There were a couple of funny lines by Ironman. However, the continuous one on one fight scenes were way overkill, reminding me of the fight scene in the movie ""They Live"". A few of these should have hit the editor's floor cutting the length of the film to be more desirable. (Spoiler)...One scene in particular was between Thor, Ironman, and Captain America in the forest as Loki looked on."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Incredibly, there are 6 superheroes and never did I think the challenges called for anything less. That would be noteworthy enough in screenplay writing, but it was still a phenomenal movie in all other respects."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Enjoyed it thoroughly. Would watch it again just to see Thor hammer Captain America's shield.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"It's no Iron Man, but some well-placed humor and strong writing keep it in the ball-park.  Pure Hollywood escapism..."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Great addition to the Marvel line up.  It felt like Iron Man 2.5, which I liked.  Solid balance between characters and a nice lead in for Iron Man 3, now filming in Wilmington, NC!"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Good without being great.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,A must watch for every die hard comic fan!!!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Avengers!!!!! Amazing is more like it!  Was fantastic with both crappy Hulk movies , the subpar Thor and captain america movies they left no doubts that with the correct writers on board this is a power house!!!!"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"I don't normally like these types of super-hero movies, but it was entertaining all around."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Changed my brown life. Just incredible.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,This was a great movie!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Awesomeness. That's all I need to say about this.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Absolutely incredible. Forget the nay-Sayers. This movie had everything.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"I've seen at least most of the characters that are from this film in their respective movies, but combine all of them, and you get the best film yet! This mash-up of superheroes from different worlds(Thor, you're awesome) in a fight against many evil forces makes for a definitely awesome superhero film."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,meh...the comic book geeks and the action nerds won't be disappointed...I just don't get the fascination with converting comic books to movies - I haven't seen one of the latter surpass the former
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon didn't let me down. Also, Mark Ruffalo was great as the Hulk."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,hero(s) saves the day!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,A great movie! I've seen it 3 times in theater and im going to buy it.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Yep....Everyone pegged this one right.  Great comic book movie.  And it should have been since moviemaker took the unique approach of developing most of the principle characters in their own movies before putting them all together.  Never the less it was a good high energy, action packed with a hint of comedy movie!"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"As close to perfect as you can get for a Superhero movie. In the individual Marvel movies, the feeling may have been some characters failed to connect with the audience as well as others but the dynamic of having all characters involved in this movie will only strengthen the net Marvel movies in the series.

Entertaining with some fantastic humour, this film could easily be watched multiple times."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,As good as a team superhero movie could be.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,I loved this movie it was a little cheesy but it was full of adventure.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,It was amazing to see all of the heros again but as a group. great movie
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! Nuff said
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Great use of The Hulk.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Fun and exciting!  A touch long on the action.

"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Summer movie perfection, ""The Avengers"" makes history

	For those of you unfamiliar with the comic book world, you should know that crossovers are a pretty common occurrence. In fact it's standard operating procedure for the two big comic companies, Marvel and DC, to state that all of the currently running comics actually take place in the same universe. 
So, Superman is saving Metropolis while Batman investigates in Gotham. These two know each other and sometimes work together. For Marvel, Iron Man and Spiderman might both end up trying to save New York at the same time.
	With all of the crossovers that happened both companies eventually devised a series about the best of the best of these heroes joining up in a team to fight the strongest enemies. For DC there was the ""Justice League,"" and for Marvel there was ""The Avengers."" 
Those of you following Marvel's comic book movies of late have probably been very aware of the plans for an Avengers film for some time. The seeds were planted with two ""Iron Man"" films, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America."" To a lesser extent, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" though the 2008 film is mostly ignored (as the actor has changed), unlike the other characters.
	The plot of ""The Avengers"" is not all that complicated. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain from ""Thor,"" returns to Earth with the intention of opening a portal to enable an alien armada through to conquer Earth for him. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) finally puts his plan to bring The Avengers together. 
This team consists of Captain America-Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Iron Man-Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow- Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye- Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and The Incredible Hulk- Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo).
	The team will overcome obstacles, both physical and emotional, in order to save the very world. But first, they have to learn to work together.
	""The Avengers"" is basically a summer movie blockbuster refined into its purest, most concentrated form, and it encapsulates everything an audience would want out of an action movie and especially a Super Hero story. This movie knew exactly what it was, what it wanted to be, and what everyone else wanted it be, and it succeeded in every category.
	This film succeeds for a multitude of reasons. First, of course, we have the anticipation and build up to this movie itself, which was first teased all the way back in 2007. Ever since then, each film Marvel has released included a piece leading up to this movie. There was a lot of worry coming in to this film for a lot of people. People were worried the film would be bloated. That it would try to do too much and simply collapse under its own weight. But thanks to a masterful screenplay written by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly,) who also directed the film, everything works out just as it should.
	Of course, even with a great script you need a good cast to pull it off, and Marvel has definitely managed a triumph here. Robert Downey Jr. is obviously a crowd favorite and steals many of the scenes he's in. He is also given a bit more prominence than the other characters, though not to a degree that he overshadows them. 
Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth return to their roles well, keeping things nice and consistent from ""Captain America"" and ""Thor."" Jeremy Renner is given the least development in the plot, and that's unfortunate as he's a fantastic actor. Scarlett Johansson got some very surprising character development and probably the best scene involving the film's villain. 
The real surprise, though, is Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Marvel has struggled to find a face for the role for a while, but it seems they've finally found a good match. Ruffalo plays Banner in a much more mild-mannered fashion (when he's not Hulking out, at least). He, thankfully, also turns the angst way down, a trait, which has bogged down the Banner role for a long time.
	This film is also the perfect case study for how to make your action movie right. Compare this film to the ""Transformers"" series. A very common defense for those movies is that they are action films, and thus can be forgiven for being dumb. 
Here is your proof right here that you can have your big, dumb action movie with all the explosions and everything you crave, and you can also make it good. Not only are the characters actually likeable in this film, but also you can actually tell what's going on in every action scene. Imagine that. No whirling chaotic mess of cogs and CG; just clear,well-shot action with no shaky cam. It's stunning what a difference that makes.
	""The Avengers"" is everything you could possibly want in a super hero film. It's really that simple, and it's not secret either, since this film shattered opening weekend box office records with an unprecedented $200 million dollars in just one weekend. 
If you haven't seen this movie you should. Not only is everyone else seeing it, but also you'll have a blast. The summer movie season has just started, and we may have already seen the biggest film. Despite that, though, I'm still looking forward to what comes next. And I'm also looking forward to seeing what Marvel's has up its sleeve, because if this film is any indication they aren't done yet.

"Jun 25, 2012",positive,What a Great Superhero film should be.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"For what this movie is, and was always meant to be, and that being porn for teenage boys and geeks everywhere, it hits the mark perfectly.  

Its hard to argue with success, while some of the films that developed the characters in the avengers were better or worse than others, its really impossible to say the money shot film with all of them combined that they have been leading up to, doesn't deliver exactly what would be expected.

For a super hero, action film you really can't expect or ask for anything more."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"It has everything a comic book fan and an action movie fan would want plus some extra smashing. Let's be honest, we all love smashing. You should enjoy yourself unless you no longer have a soul."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,It's got ironman in it so it rocks
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,The perfect superhero movie.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,A movie that redefines how superhero genre films should look and feel.  Pure Fun
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Its rare for me to give a 5 star review. I dont know if its my love for everything marvel or the plain fact that this movie was excellent but it deserves each star. This is a culmination of serveral great movies put together. Ironman and Thor and Captain America and so many others with an award winning cast with amazing special effects derserves a perfect score.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Best movie of the summer
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Will admit I was afraid at first of how this would turn out. But like about 90% of people I absolutely loved it. The hulk will always be my first love so I was a little sad to see a different actor than portrayed him in The Incredible Hulk, but I had to concede to the fact that even in the face of a last minute cast change the right man was picked for the job. What was most impressive to me is how so many comic book fans  were pleased by the final product. Hats off to the cinematographer that still cares about the fans."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Brilliant!!! Chris Evans is beautiful!!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Wow. Captain America done right and little to no polluting political correctness. This is a great movie and makes you want to see all the rest of the Avenger Movies before it. This movies is definitely BluRay worthy...
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,At one point Iron Man and Captain America have a political/philosophical argument which amounted to the free marketeer vs. the ultra nationalist.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"Epic move, A MUST SEE!!!!"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Could of been better!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Great movie. Got to see it if you haven't yet.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Great Movie Loved the Cast and Great plot.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"I didn't think it could be done, a film throwing together 7 unique characters, 4 of them having already done their own individual movie. But goddamn, Joss Whedon sure knocked it out of the park. Not only did he create the movie that no one thought possible, but he kept the characters in line with their previously set up attitudes, nuances and motivations and crafted some of the most straight up badass action moments in recent history. All the while, he throws jokes back and forth between characters so fast that you may miss some of them because you're still busy laughing from the last one. It's popcorn cinema at its most clever and fun. Don't miss this. I've already seen it three times and I still want to watch it again. I'm hyped as hell for The Dark Knight Rises, but it's going to be VERY difficult to follow up The Avengers. I wish you luck, Bruce."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,great movie saw it at the drive in... it was funny but action packed
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Great action with a nice story but it is the typical hero movie with only some creativity. Liked it all around but if a sequel is to come out then it will need something else.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"everything that it should be for an avengers movie, plenty of action and not much more"
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,no doubt-the best superheroes movie ever!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"After a somewhat slow start, Whedon ups the pace and creates a well written, well directed film. It could have very easily lost its way with such a large cast but manages to bring them together well. Particularly impressed with Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, although much of the cast are very well suited to their roles."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,I liked it. I didn't love it. I believe if you are willing to invest a lot of time into watching the other ones then it might have turned out better than it did for me. My only complaint with the movie itself is that the Hulk's storyline has some major logic issues. Though the cast is having so much fun it is impossible to not just sit back and enjoy the ride.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,See what happens when you get a geek to write a geek movie... And don't have a studio interrupting (Spider-man 3).
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Oh man did it live up to the hype.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Awesome!!!!!!! I've seen this movie 4 times.... IN 3D
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen yet!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"A full-throttle ride of total badassery and sparklingly clever dialogue. Big-name actors taking on stand-out roles and doing so well that you can see who they're playing, but you don't remember it's them. Glorious."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,Awesome Action movie!
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"This movie was really enjoyable, my only complaint is that the beginning is too slow and isn't as witty as the second part."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,as long it grossed higher than harry potter.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,I love it has a good story and me and my hole family love i saw it 6 time with all of them if your not sure about watching i am telling you have a good time and if your there sort of people that dont like superhero you like
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,"OMG I JUST LOVE MARVEL. The sexy(sensible) Captain America and the sexy(sarcastic) Iron Man in one film? What more could I ask for than to see my two favorite superheroes battle alongside one another? Perfect. Makes me think about how badly I want to go to comic-con. (it's on my bucket list!) Question: Why is the Hulk so invincible? Doesn't matter, super film! Any comic book fan will enjoy."
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,I have never left a cinema so disappointed.
"Jun 25, 2012",positive,A brilliant and amazing cinematic adventure that has captivated 13-yr-old me and 30-yr-old me all twelve times this summer!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"The first act drags on for a bit, but when it gets going the action set pieces and group dynamics Whedon is known for make an amazing film."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"If you're a real Avenger fan, this will be a friggin' dream come true :) Even if not, you're still gonna have an awesome time, guaranteed :) The ass-kicking level in this flick is legendary :) Awesome, awesome movie.."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Que no se ha dicho de esta pelÃ­cula......... para mi los vengadores sin lugar a duda va servir como referencia para hacer cine de superheroes. Entretenimiento de calidad
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Great movie, probably the best movie I have ever seen"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,This was a very good movie!!! It was funny at some parts too!!!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Could have had a smarter storyline. But had laughs in all the right places.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,3 times I've seen this movie and it's awesome.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,amazing and outstanding
"Jun 24, 2012",neutral,The lineup of stars certainly did not gel.  The girl from How I met your mother was awful.    There is a whole lot of dramatic talking.  There are quite a few funny one liners but all in all I though it was quite awful.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,my husband n i love this movies its awesome!!!(:
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Purchase worthy and will re-watch as soon as possible.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"When demigod Loki (Hiddleston) decides to steal a powerful weapon from S.H.I.EL.D, his evil plans to take over the world must be stopped-- and it's up to the company head, Nick Fury (Jackson) to do the job. He decides to assemble ""The Avengers"": millionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey), Captain America (Evans), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Johansson), and by surprise Loki's half-brother Thor (Hemsworth). Loki has already taken over the minds of the scientist (SkarsgÃ¥rd) and Hawkeye (Renner), so in the meantime the team has to come up with a way to foil Loki's plans-- if they can handle each other at least ... ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is probably the best superhero movie ever. Is it an exaggeration? Nope. So many films of the same genre always have the same problem-- they either take themselves way to seriously or its the other way around. But what makes ""Marvel's The Avengers"" so great is that director/screenwriter Whedon not only serves up a plateful of welcome laughs, but he creates very human characters, and every battle scene or even just a conversation feels so real that it's almost ridiculous. And the fact that we've all grown to love all of the characters takes this two-and-a-half hour long movie in a road that all too entertaining. It basically serves up the whole enchilada. But let's face it-- while this movie does have a narrative structure most filmmakers should be jealous of, of course the star of the show is the terrific special effects. Every explosion, every nasty kill, and every smash is so well done that the film's hefty $250 million budget is put to good use. The twenty minute climax to the film is so spectacular that you always wonder-- if this had been filmed just a few years ago, would it be the same? ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is so perfect in every move it makes. Joss Whedon seems to be the best guy to handle it so far. This gets an ""A"" for entertainment. Recommended."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Tooooo many ""main characters"" for one movie. My husband and brother loved it. I thought it was kind of boring and whiplashy."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,very cool. Hulk Smash!!!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Yeah, it's a comic book movie.  Let's skip the part where we talk about comic book movies being a legit genre.  Who cares?

The story, was average but pretty entertaining.  I'm sure nerds everywhere have been freaking out about having so many of their heroes on the screen simultaneously.  Cool.  Whatever.

If you want to know what really makes the Avengers awesome it's that it was almost flawlessly executed.  It knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything it's not.  Forget the subject matter for a moment and just 'marvel' at how well constructed this film was.  Before the Avengers I thought it was impossible to share screen time with that many characters, keeping them all balanced and equally interesting/important.  Seriously, hats off to the team that pulled this one off."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,I cannot envision a more impressive and well-rounded superhero movie.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,best superhero movie ive seen. great plot and acting all around
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Meant to do this a long, long time ago..."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon does it again. Amazing movie! Best yet this year! :)
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Hulk Smash and Loky.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,I am still wondering how Disney let this one out with a PG-13. rating.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. I can't wait for the 2 nd one and the continuation of the marvel universe. AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Full of action, sexy men and a big green angry monster, what more could a girl want? A spectacular film that kept me interested most of the time, as with all superhero films it was far fetched, but that what you'd expect. If you want reality then this isn't it."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"This movie really did live up to the hype, I thoroughly enjoyed and it look forward to the sequel.  Marvel has been coming on strong lately with the likes of Captain America, Thor and now the Avengers, keep em coming!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Its a good kids movie the movie is very overrated.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"""Avengers Assemble"" oh and assemble they did, in this smash hit blockbuster of the century, or perhaps ever that has been in the works since 2008! Our heroes all bask in the glory of their first outing in style, as they each progress and accept that they are a team. What was really impressive was the screenwrite, written with such finece and so well done showing the progression of them all coming to accept they are a team and learning to act as one. The cinematography was incredible, just as everything about this movie but the cinematography really stood out for me, introducing each character so effectively and never, even throughout the entire 2 1/2 hours of footage allowing one or the other to hog the spotlight. The characters were so fleshed out and well portrayed by such an incredible cast. What i really loved was that each character was developed so effectively, not just in this film but all the films in the past 5 years that led up to this, each preparing the characters mentally for this moment. This film draws so well on each characters personalities and their traits from previous films and as each personality clashes while they are becoming a team they all learn to put aside their differences to unite against a greater problem. The transition from bickering heroes to a team was so well done, while each hero would usually anchor all the films direction and hold the story up single handedly no single one had to carry to much weight and each successfully held up the film together, as a team. Full of incredible imagery, cinematography, and direction it makes you believe in them and want to root for them not just because their the good guys but while this is mostly consisted of action the film is so wonderfully peppered with those little emotional ties that attach us to each character and make us want them to succeed. This film packs such a punch, except this time it ain't Hitler whose taking the blow, it's the other films opening this week who will feel its force because it was just so outstandingly done, packed with action, believable emotion and performances, and comedy. Somehow each joke was incredibly effective, grossing an insane amount of laughs and was never a flop, and no matter how dire the situation their never afraid to crack a joke. But it was not just jokes that were drawn from the huge crowds but applause, not just at the end but throughout the whole film, such a great time at the movies, with so many fanboy nods this film is perfect for all out MARVEL fans and non fans alike making it easy for us all to put aside our differences and assemble against a common goal.... the no. 1 spot in the box office! Overall the best experience you could ever possibly have at a theater, for now because this was only the beginning, as we all anxiously await the next few years with MARVEL's schedule consisting of Iron Man 3, Capt. America 2, and Thor 2, which will all hopefully lead up to the Avengers 2, just as the others led up to This film, and we can't ever forget the final shot of the film before the credits, the most memorable and meaningful shot in film history, containing the most memorable letter in film history, as Tony and Pepper are remodeling Stark tower with the broken sign, zooming out to show us just one letter, a letter that withstands the entire force of an alien army, ""A""."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"It had great effects, acting, story Etc.. Yet it felt like any other Marvel super hero movie."
"Jun 24, 2012",neutral,"Great visuals, epic battles & funny writing. But it's still a Marvel movie & since Christopher Nolan reintroduced Batman to the world and gave DC a new lease on cinematic life, my bar is set pretty high."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,It shouldnt work but it does. All characters and plot elements balanced perfectly. I wont know a more perfect action superhero film until I see it. A great film that is truly for everyone.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,One f my favorite super hero movies of all time. This is when they get it right.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Wow. Wasn't expecting much on this one. I feel they have pulled out too many comic book heroes at this point. The storyline was great. The action sequences well done. CG was impeccable.  The 3D version was the best 3D I have seen yet. Can't wait for the sequel!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,My children simply loved this movie.  My five yr old loves Iron Man and Captain America.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,My whole family enjoyed this film. It had the right amount of action and humor and a great cast.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Excellent and action packed
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,it was a great movie and funny too
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"To quote a famous song ""I like it, I love it, I want some more of it!"""
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Hugely entertaining and nicely humorous. The brisk pace and on-the-go characterization are much appreciated. The action scenes are well choreographed. A great way to do a fun summer box-office popcorn movie. There's a sense of fun and humanity that most soulless  ""franchise"" movies can never seem to muster. This might not seem like such a special revelation if more big budget movies weren't so soulless and drab these days."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,II love captain america and thor!!!!!!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A great movie to introduce the Avengers as a unit.  All of the actors did their job and it was a ""Smash"" success!!!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,The best marvel movie yet!!!!!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"For the most part, this movie provides a ton of action and entertainment with all the superheroes coming together. Does live up to the hype as one of the top movies in 2012, but the storyline drags it out a bit."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Very well done!!  Pulled all the other films together in this first one with the whole team.  Did make Captain America seem a little less then in his film but the over all story line was very well done.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"""I'm loyal to nothing...except the Dream."" - Captain America"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Very well acted, very well written and splendidly well directed by uniting all that has been done, it comes to heroes, with action scenes as a smart script and all around a good mood. There was not so much depth as it could have been asked, however, it's was almost a new universe created for the heroes to showing the human side of them, even with all its invincibility, they have feelings like any ordinary person. The end result is a sharp movie heroes, showing the fun side of comics and putting aside all the nonsense that has been seen in the genre!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A fun movie. No message, just action and yucks."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Excellent movie, the way it was done tied into history perfectly"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,I expected more from Joss Whedon. Was there an actual script or did they make it up as they went along? Plot holes you could run the Hulk through. Scarlett does look good in tights though.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"I am such a die-hard Marvel fan that I waited until the 2nd to last day it was showing in my theater to see it. All-right I am no Marvel or comic book worshiper but I do like seeing some super hero films from time to time. First I'd like to talk about the previous ""Avenger"" films before I continue my review on The Avengers. In order from least to greatest this is how these five films would rank; Captain America (Bored, didn't like story or characters), Thor (Better then America), Iron Man 2 (About Iron man!, Fun dialogue, non memorable story , The Incredible Hulk (Sadly under the radar, Edward Norton, fun and entertaining), and Iron Man (Great Origin Story!, Great acting, memorable action and story). So I only really liked two out of the five films and wasn't overly excited forThe Avengersbut I did want to see it and I am glad I did.The Avengers takes place most recently after Captain America (Chris Evans, Human Torch? How can he be two  Marvel super heroes?)has been found frozen in ice. Loki, Thor's evil adopted brother has decided to come and rule Earth. A team of super heroes must put their differences aside and save the human race!This is definitely ranking as one of the best super-hero films ever made. Not only did it have great action, characters and story but it had a sense of humor that is often missed in such film that try to be 'oh, so serious'. This film made me like each and everyone of these super heroes, regardless of how I thought about their own stand alone films. But as usually Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark remain the most complex, interesting and funny character. He outshines the rest of his cast and not only because he has the shiniest suit but because he is probably the most talented actor in this film. The only one who stood close to Downey's leading charm was Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/ Hulk). I was initially sad to see that Edward Norton wouldn't be returning but Ruffalo did great playing the low key, easy voiced Dr.The Avengersis one of the most entertaining films of the year that isn't just full of action and laughs but it has heart as well. I highly recommend this film even if you aren't a comic book to movie lover.The Avengers will keep you entertained, laughing and engrossed throughout."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is one of the best movies of 2012 and definitly Marvel's best. it has the perfect balance of a super hero movie including action, story, and lots of comedy."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Didn't think all these characters could be on the screen at the same time...I was wrong. Awesome!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,It was good.  Funny adult lines.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A very-difficult-to-fit characters combination yet precisely blended movie.  Marvel Avengers 2012 justified all the iconic super heroes without disturbing the plot.  Too many cooks spoil the broth , may not be a wise saying at Marvel's The Avengers 2012.  'Hulk Smash', 'We have a Hulk', 'MjÃ¶lnir 'TOO HEAVY' for HULK'  and many more show stealers keep your eyes glued to the screen.  Best of 2012 MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS 2012.  5 stars from me."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,This will go down as the greatest Superhero movie of all time!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A solid special effects event film. The story is nicely paced although the plot isn't terribly strong. The heros are all likable each with their own interesting quirks. The inherent conflict between them makes sense given their personalities. The action scenes were all very well done, not just because the visual effects were so strong but because they were careful to avoid letting the fights devolve into grinding identical mooks. I have to say that final battle dragged a little bit too long. 

All in all I'd say this is my second favorite of the Marvel Studios superhero films. Right behind Ironman. 

spoiler alert:

My one big complaint is the way the destruction of the mother ship completely shut down all of the alien forces. First of all that's incredibly cliche. Second it leaves you thinking ""Why didn't they try that to begin with?"" What's more it doesn't just stop the ships or weapons from working, it makes the aliens all drop dead! At that point in the story the national guard was already there. I think it would be easy for us to assume that they were able to finish off the remaining invaders while the Avengers took out Loki."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,This might as well be an Oscar winner for all I care. It's the best film produced by Marvel ever!. Somebody get me a time machine so I can go into the future to September 2012 so I can buy this movie on DVD!!!.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,seen it yesterday wiy my son....it was a great movie:) best part was watchn it wit my bby boy.....
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"This movie was frickin awesome! A lot of times these types of movies fail to keep my attention or my interest for the whole time. However, this one surely did! One of the best movies, I'd ever seen"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Great action. Funny super heroes.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,For me it's a perfect end to the first round of Marvel Studio flicks. This is what I have been waiting so many years for and I think the payoff was exactly what it needed to be. It not only satisfied my need to see all these heroes together but it created an excitement to see more solo missions for these characters in the very near future.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Best movie of summer 2012. Can Stark be to cool , can Black Widow be to sexy, can Hulk be to mashie?  NOway!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Sorry, forgot to think about the plot amidst all the visuals. Probably so did the makers."
"Jun 24, 2012",negative,Crap didn't even leave on to see the end
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Super action packed, losts of characters and great actors. Was awesome!!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Excellent movie.  The story and characters were well-developed, though not perfect, and the action sequences were well done."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Enjoyed watching Hulk SMASH things around.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Supera las expectativas sean cuales sean. Joss Whedon en estado puro.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"I didn't expect too much from this superhero film scripted and directed by Joss Whedon even with  an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. Somehow I thought it would be way over the top with so many different characters from the Marvel Comics that it was impossible to incorporate them all into one story. And the first hour of the movie almost prove me right. From six people watching it, we lost two in that first hour. The story of The Avengers starts with Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruiting Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from subjugating the Earth... and that story was developing way to slow for people who are not into comics, that the result could not be other than ""walk away"" after the first sixty minutes. That was, probably, the reason why this film was initially promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast... It is a film for fans!

But, if you're not a fan, and you managed to survive 60 minutes without walking away, there is a reward for you in the second part, where the movie picks up the tempo and starts with action (isn't that why those actions hero are called ""action"" - that's what they do best!?) delivering more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies! Money well spent! It became the highest-grossing film based on comics, the highest grossing superhero film and the highest-grossing film released by Walt Disney Studios...

This movie provides its fans with exactly what they desire but for others there will be too many things to be desired and left unfulfilled - ""grinding, hectic emptiness"" as The New York Times critic wrote."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"GO SEE IT! You don't need to be a comic book fan or to have seen any of the other Marvel movies to appreciate this one. Action, comedy, suspense all wrapped with amazing special effects!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Brilliant...absolutely brilliant
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Great movie I'd see it again
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A very fun film, it was great seeing the Hulk back in action. With everyone else though I kept getting the ""another one already"" feel. The film was very well done as Joss Whedon continues to deliver the goods. This man can make any fanboy film and deliver."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"Full on good times. Over done, over the top and funny. Well done!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,You'd have thought that such a cast would inevitably suffer from one stealing the scene. But they've managed to pull it off.. A great film and great characters
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"amazing, I love it. I want more"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,A comic-lovers wet dream.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"This movie was EPIC!! I definitely recommend it, especially if you're a big fan of marvel."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"One of the few bright spots of the cinematic year so far.  Funny, action-packed, and, true to Whedon form, slightly tragic in all the right, unexpected places.  Would we expect anything less from our beloved Whedon?  I believe he just raised the stakes once again.  I can't wait to watch it again, and again, and again."
"Jun 24, 2012",negative,loud and hard to follow.  too long and boring.  a waste of time for me
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,I was shocked. This movie was great (could be my bias for comics).
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Great show. It had my attention from the very beginning!  The only thing that could have made the movie better...was to see more of THOR!  He was so gorgeous!
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,the movie followed the comics really well and all the actors acted well
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"A fun, well scripted film with awesome special effects. In my opinion it wasn't supposed to be taken too seriously (after all it does fall into the common cliches of CBM's). Perhaps not as intellegent as the dark night, or as stylish as Xmen first class, it is still a prominent addition in this ever growing genre."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"That movie is so awesome and it's like a super-hero movie! My favourite part is when Hulk smashes Loki, it makes me surprising!"
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Greatest superhero movie of all time
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,It was amazing I love this movie
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,vvvvvvveeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyy gggggggggggggooooooooooooooooddddddddddddd
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Brilliant in visual....That's it :) The only real bad part is a lame jokes by Iron-man. I like him more in original IM films.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,"To be fair, I haven't seen any of the other Marvel flixs other than Iron Man and the Hulk so I felt a bit put of the loop with the back story of some of the other characters.  However on that note, the director of this film did a nice job at filling in the gaps of knowledge for an audience that had no previous experience with Marvel movies.  However this is not one of my favorite movies, I did still enjoy it."
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Must See x3 ..Well Thats how many times we watched it
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,Awesome. Finally got to see.
"Jun 24, 2012",positive,I thought ironman would be the star but the hulk took the cake.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"It was a great film, but was a little longer than it needed to be."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"A flawless toss up of all the heroes in Marvel's movieverse, electing to make the team the focus instead of dividing its attention among each of the characters. The Avengers is everything you could ever want from a comic book movie."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"In my mind, The Avengers is quite possibly one of the most breathtaking cinematic & technical masterpieces ever. Whatever flaws you may find will quickly be forgiven by the last 45 minutes, which could be one of the most amazing spectacles ever imagined."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Hands down my all time favorite movie - EVER. And that is saying a lot. Very VERY well done. Great characters, great lines, excellent cinematography - Can't say enough about it. Loved it!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Awesome adventure. Worth seeing again and again.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Loved it can't wait for the Dvd!!!!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,OMG! Joss Whedon you were put on earth to make this movie plus Firefly.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Second only to the Dark Knight in the superhero genre.  I saw it twice in one week, haven't done that since Major League."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. However, it fails to really give you a chance to do the characters justice. Furthermore, the 45 minute actiongasm gets tiring after awhile. Loved the melding of comedy and action, but could have used a little more down to earth character movies. I give a B-. Additionally, Loki was a very boring villain haha. Marvel needs to work on doing their villains some justice. Take heed from the Dark Knight Joss Whedon!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"loved it. action packed, funny and overall very entertaining!!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Remember how much fun going to the movies used to be? If not, The Avengers will bring you back to when expectations were lower and movies just seemed better.  It's surprisingly ""that"" good, and effectively sets a new standard for the comic book movie genre. Joss Whedon really did Marvel proud on this one, creating a movie appropriately better than any of the standalone character films. The whole production was a total success, not because of the talented cast, tight script, and clean plot, but also because it never pretends to be something that it's not, nor does it ever attempt to take itself too seriously. There is no false advertising here, as what you see is what you get;that being the perfect summer action movie."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Saw it in 3D....Amazing!!! I loved it... Nuff said
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Fantastic visual effects. Great comedy from RDJ.   Great character stories. Mark Ruffalo was great as Banner.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Ate all my popcorn!!! All my favorite superheros playing well together!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"awesome. true genius, pure and simple."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"A very good looking, action, CGI effects laden movie.  This is another end-of-the-world, apocalypse movie.  There is virtually no dramatic tension in this adapted, cartoon-based, flic.  The story is fully predictable.  The dialogue, however, is very sharp.  It is liberally spiced w/ comedic elements.

The story and action do  unfold in an interesting and logical manner.  Some of the extra-terrestrial space ships are peculiar.  The smaller ones are open and chariot-like.  The larger ones looked like metallic, skeletal, dinosaur-inspired, undulating, living creatures ,,, very odd.  They could have been imagined better.

It was an OK, sci-fi flic.  Fun to watch, but no dramatic or comedic substance to sink your teeth into."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Best Superhero movie of all time
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"""That's my secret captain, I'm always angry""-the Hulk"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"This is one of my favorite movies. Absolutely spectacular. Great special effects, awesome acting, and it's pretty long."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,This movie was great. It was fun and good action sequences and came together well. This movie had potential to flop but came together.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Could not have done a better job combining all the heroes & stories. The storyline is solid (keeping in mind it's a comic book movie). The special effects are incredible! The best for me was the comedic moments throughout the movie.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,This movie was awesome....
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,What a great movie. I hope to get the chance to see it a few more times.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"LATE REVIEW:  This movie definitely goes on my all-time favorite list.  It will be very tough for Marvel/Disney to top this with a sequel.  Nothing much else needs to be said other then see it in 3D!  The depth of the scenes in 3D really make the characters pop off the screen.  Of course the Incredible Hulk steals the show and his scenes were extremely powerful.  If you havenâ(TM)t all ready, run to go see this movie in 3D!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,I love this movie!!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Best movie I have been to this year. Must see.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Awesome! Hilarious! Action Packed!! Instant Block Buster! Nuf' Said!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"AWESOME VISUAL AND STORYLINE, DIGITALLY THE HULK STEALS THE SHOW"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Good fun.  Not as gritty as I like my comic book heroes, but a fun and enjoyable romp through superdom."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Freaking awesome show, can't wait for the DVD"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"I am generally not interested in action movies, but if it's done perfect for the genre, it is done perfect!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Fun - needs a big screen.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Wickedly entertaining!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Great movie! Tons of action. Pulls so many characters together.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Probably the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Great acting, great action, great CGI, GREAT MOVIE. Especially the incredible action scene in the end. I just love this movie soooo much."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"I've since changed my stance on this one. It's the best marvel adaptation to date, the first iron man is now in 2nd place."

Ha az ember szereti az akciÃ³filmeket, Ã (C)s az elmÃºlt Ã (C)vtizedben a vÃ¡sznakon eluralkodÃ³ szuperhÅ's-zsÃ¡nert sem Ã (C)rtetlenkedÅ' szemÃ¶ldÃ¶kfelvonÃ¡sokkal kÃ­sÃ (C)rte, akkor a BosszÃºÃ¡llÃ³k (hazai kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)nyes fordÃ­tÃ¡sban eredetileg a BosszÃº Angyalai) lehet majd az egyik legkellemesebb mozis Ã (C)lmÃ (C)nye.

Van akit nehezebben, Ã (C)s van akit rÃ¶gtÃ¶n be fog szippantani, de garantÃ¡ltan sokakat varÃ¡zsol majd vissza azzÃ¡ a kisgyerekkÃ (C), aki a film utÃ¡n a pohÃ¡rfedÅ'-figurÃ¡kkal akarja ÃºjrajÃ¡tszani a legcoolabb jeleneteket.


A 90-es Ã (C)vek kÃ¶zepÃ (C)n az amerikai kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)ny-piac, Ã (C)lÃ (C)n a csili-villi szuperhÅ'sÃ¶kkel, az Ã¶sszeomlÃ¡s szÃ (C)lÃ (C)n Ã¡llt. A megannyi Ãºj szabadidÅ's elfoglaltsÃ¡g (azon belÃ 1/4l is leginkÃ¡bb a szÃ¡mÃ­tÃ³gÃ (C)pes jÃ¡tÃ (C)kok) rengeteg olvasÃ³t szippantottak el a mÅ±fajtÃ³l, a Marvel Comics pedig csÅ'dkÃ¶zelbe kerÃ 1/4lt. A kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)ny-kiadÃ³ Ã³riÃ¡s a filmjogok eladÃ¡sÃ¡val mÃ¡szott ki a gÃ¶dÃ¶rbÅ'l, majd teljesen Ãºjra rendezte sorait, Ãºj Ã­rÃ³kra Ã (C)s rajzolÃ³kra bÃ­zta sajÃ¡t sorozatait.Â 

A felÃ (C)pÃ 1/4lÃ (C)s olyan jÃ³l sikerÃ 1/4lt, hogy a 2000-es Ã (C)vektÅ'l mÃ¡r egyÃ (C)rtelmÅ± Marvel-dominancia uralkodik mind a kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)ny-eladÃ¡sok, mind a filmek tekintetÃ (C)ben. 2008-tÃ³l a kiadÃ³ mÃ¡r sajÃ¡t stÃºdiÃ³val rendelkezik, Ã (C)s kedve szerint kÃ (C)szÃ­t filmet sajÃ¡t szuperhÅ'seibÅ'l - hacsak azoknak a jogai nincsenek mÃ (C)g Ã (C)pp mÃ¡snÃ¡l, mint aÂ PÃ³kemberÂ a SonynÃ¡l, vagy azÂ X-MenÂ a Fox-nÃ¡l.

2008-ban a Marvel olyan dologba kezdett, ami a kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)ny-fÃ 1/4zetek lapjain megszokott, a filmvÃ¡sznon azonban azaddig elkÃ (C)pzelhetetlen volt. EgysÃ (C)ges univerzumot akart kreÃ¡lni, amiben a szuperhÅ'sÃ¶k nem egyedÃ 1/4li hÃ (C)roszai sajÃ¡t vilÃ¡guknak, hanem mindnyÃ¡jan ugyanannak a kozmosznak a rÃ (C)szei. A kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)nyekben mÃ (C)g a hÅ'sÃ¶k Ã¶nÃ¡llÃ³ sorozataiban sem ritka, hogy mÃ¡s szuperekkel vÃ¡llvetve oldjÃ¡k meg az Ã (C)pp aktuÃ¡lis konfliktust, Ã­gy fÃ (C)r meg egymÃ¡s mellett a mitolÃ³gia eszkÃ¶ztÃ¡rÃ¡bÃ³l dolgozÃ³ Ã (C)s isteni hatalommal rendelkezÅ', univerzumok kÃ¶zÃ¶tt cikÃ¡zÃ³ Thor a mindennapi problÃ (C)mÃ¡kkal Ã (C)s leggyakrabban csak piti-bÅ±nÃ¶zÅ'kkel bajlÃ³dÃ³ PÃ³kemberrel. De amÃ­g a crossover-formula mÅ±kÃ¶dik a kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)nyben (nÃ (C)ha azÃ (C)rt ott sem, szerkesztÅ' legyen a talpÃ¡n aki a tÃ¶bb tucat sorozatot ellentmondÃ¡s-mentesen Ã¶ssze tudja hangolni), a vÃ¡sznon mÃ¡r sokkal ritkÃ¡bb vendÃ (C)g - mÃ¡r csak a magas kÃ¶ltsÃ (C)gek miatt is.Â 

AÂ BosszÃºÃ¡llÃ³kban nincsenek nagy fordulatok vagy eredetinek hatÃ³ elemek, a film egyetlen ÃºjdonsÃ¡ga, hogy az eddig megismert 4 vilÃ¡got (aÂ Vasember,Â Hulk,Â ThorÂ Ã (C)sÂ Amerika KapitÃ¡nyÂ filmek vilÃ¡gÃ¡t) hiba nÃ (C)lkÃ 1/4l mossa egybe. Ezt viszont olyan tÃ¶kÃ (C)letesen teszi, hogy a jÃ¡tÃ (C)kidÅ' elejÃ (C)tÅ'l a vÃ (C)gÃ (C)ig a szÃ (C)kbe szÃ¶gezi nÃ (C)zÅ'it - pop-corn mozinak csÃºfolt film ilyenre egyre ritkÃ¡bban kÃ (C)pes, mert minden mÅ±anyagot azÃ (C)rt nem lehet lenyelni.

NyilvÃ¡n vannak dramaturgiai hiÃ¡nyossÃ¡gai aÂ BosszÃºÃ¡llÃ³knak is, de mi sem bizonyÃ­tja jobban a film zsenialitÃ¡sÃ¡t, mint hogy ezek egyÃ¡ltalÃ¡n nem tudnak Ã (C)rdekelni, mivel az effekthalmazokban nem csak papÃ­rmasÃ (C) alibi figurÃ¡kat rÃ¡ngatnak a minÃ (C)l nagyobb robbanÃ¡sok Ã 1/4rÃ 1/4gyÃ (C)n, hanem hÃºs-vÃ (C)r szereplÅ'ket. Joss Whedon nem a CGI-effektek kÃ¶rÃ (C) Ã­rt tÃ¶rtÃ (C)netet, hanem a meglevÅ' figurÃ¡k kÃ¶rÃ (C) Ã (C)pÃ­tett egy olyat, amiben alkalomadtÃ¡n robbantani is lehet - nem is keveset. A film nem kicsit Ã (C)pÃ­t az elÅ'zmÃ (C)nyfilmekre (ez is ritka, a spin-off elÅ'bb lÃ (C)tezik, mint amibÅ'l kivÃ¡lhatna), de megÃ¡ll a sajÃ¡t lÃ¡bÃ¡n is, nem feltÃ (C)tlenÃ 1/4l szÃ 1/4ksÃ (C)ges hozzÃ¡ a korÃ¡bbi 5 film ismerete -Â nem Ãºgy, mint gyakran a kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)nyeknÃ (C)lÂ - , persze nyilvÃ¡n sokat ad az Ã (C)lmÃ (C)nyhez a rÃ¡ismerÃ (C)s Ã¶rÃ¶me:Â ""JÃ (C)"" de hÃ¡t a kockÃ¡t mÃ¡r lÃ¡ttam az Amerika KapitÃ¡nyban, "" WÃ¡Ã¡h"", a Vasember filmvÃ (C)gi Ã¶nfelÃ¡ldozÃ¡sa is egybecseng a zÃ¡szlÃ³ba Ã¶ltÃ¶zÃ¶tt csÃ¡vÃ³ mÃ¡rtÃ­r-halÃ¡lÃ¡val, a Loki meg ""Aztaa"" milyen gonosz, mert a Thorban vÃ¡lt gonosszÃ¡, Ã (C)s ""Igeeeen"", a Fekete Ã-zvegy is tudom miÃ (C)rt nincs jÃ³ban a Vasemberrel, Ã (C)s a SÃ³lyomszemet is lÃ¡ttam mÃ¡r a Thorban, ""Jeee"", Ã (C)s akkor a...""

AÂ BosszÃºÃ¡llÃ³kÂ a legfrissebb pÃ (C)lda rÃ¡, hogy az intelligencia nem a rÃ (C)tegfilm kivÃ¡ltsÃ¡ga, a maga szintjÃ (C)n egy blockbuster is lehet okos, lÃ¡sd a drÃ¡mÃ¡val operÃ¡lÃ³Â X-MenÂ franchise jobb rÃ (C)szeit, az Ã¶nirÃ³niÃ¡t kÃ (C)t ellentÃ (C)tes vÃ (C)glet felÅ'l megkÃ¶zelÃ­tÅ'Â Watchment Ã (C)sÂ Kick-Asst, vagy a realizmust elÅ'tÃ (C)rbe tolÃ³Â A sÃ¶tÃ (C)t lovagot, esetleg a sablonokat jÃ³ Ã­zlÃ (C)ssel ÃºjrahasznosÃ­tÃ³Â PÃ³kemberÂ kÃ¶zÃ (C)psÅ' darabjÃ¡t - csak hogy kÃ (C)pregÃ (C)ny-filmeknÃ (C)l maradjunk.

"Jun 23, 2012",positive,There are very few things that I would change about this movie and those few things I can't put my finger on. This movie is wonderful for fans of the marvel superheros and those who aren't.  There was actually quite a bit of comedic parts.  I enjoyed myself as you can tell.  ;)

"Jun 23, 2012",positive,LOVED IT. BEST MOVIE EVER ! <33
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"As a new person to the marvel universe this movie is excellent, humor and action is mixed perfectly, and the heroes linked together through a series of preleaded movies. However a disappointment to the longstanding marvel fans due to lack of  the original story and characters... to say of that is why it is a hit because most people love the new marvel and its characters. hopefully a sequel to this will put in some missed characters."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Best film I've seen this year.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,AMAZING MOVIE!!! Must see it regardless age or gender.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,best action thrill ever
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Joss has done it again.... Manhatten has never been so superbly thrashed nor saved, and each of the superheroes gets their time in the spotlight.. I can find no fault with this movie, other than that there was not enough of it!! :P"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,The combination of the group made this a great action film with a fantastic story and great character interaction.
"Jun 23, 2012",negative,Absolute rubbish. Horrible dialogue with jokes as if written for a 10 year old (hulk scene comes to mind).
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Taking a bunch of superheroes and putting them into one movie would've been a disaster. However; in this case, ""The Avengers"" is an action packed extravaganza with a script that manages to treat the story and its characters with care."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Okay action adventure comic based movies are always on the line with me.  I LOVE the Iron Man movies and the last Batman movie.  On the other hand, I hated the 1980's Batman movies and the 'Hulk' movies have just been a disappointment.  Then, again, loved the Spiderman movies.  As you can see on the line.  I am alright with this movie.  There is some good eye candy with the Thor and Captain America characters ... that is worth admission price itself.  The action at the end goes on a little long for me.  Also the Hawk character (Jeremy Renner) was briefly in the Thor movie but I feel he never was really developed like the other characters.   On the other hand, Black Widow (Scarlett Jo Hanson) steals every seen she is in.  Action hero fans and marvel comic fans will not be disappointed. There is great acting and a good storyline which make the movie enjoyable.  It's worth admission price and the up charge for 3D based on the action.  I would have to get a really good price to buy on DVD and really have no desire to see it again."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"This movie was fantastic! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, hands down! I would pay to go watch it again!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Very well done, I often felt it should have been titled iron man 3, maybe the other super heroes deserve bigger supporting roles"
"Jun 23, 2012",negative,"In the theatre, people were laughing at the jokes, and sounded like they really liked it. I found the acting dreadful, the story silly, and the jokes were dreadful. An ode to ""We got to save the world for country and king"" sort of nonsense to me.

Of all the comic book movies I have seen, this was almost as bad as the fantastic four, which was so dreadful as to put me to sleep.  Another one this bad, and may swear off the genre completely"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Succeeds on all levels: Action, Story, Effects, Comedy and best of all the characters. Only thing left to say, ""Hulk, smash!"""
"Jun 23, 2012",neutral,"Hmmm, Captain America 1.5? Iron Man 2.5? Thor 1.5? Hulk, er, 1 (again?). Look, its super hero guff and nonsense: an excuse for CGI ejaculations. For the most part, that can carry the movie, so long as the in jokes are flowing (and they occasionally do so) but it feels like a movie that's started 30 minutes too late. It's not often I feel this disoriented trying to work out the back story despite having seen all the requisite Marvel movies prior to this one. Meh! Some things really irked me too (Hulk becomes a good guy? Hawk bangs his head and returns to normal, Black Widow's woeful lines about a red ledger, Nick Fury's annoying second-in-command, everything Loki, etc)"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Best. Movie. Ever. Can't wait for the sequel!!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Very well Dow movie. The language was clean, there is no sex, and the dialogue was witty. A crisp fresh taste of good quality movie in this long famine of quality film."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Was happy to see how all the characters came together for this one. Robert Downey Jr still outshone the rest as iron man. <3'ed it.
"Jun 23, 2012",negative,"I understand why some enjoy this movie.  Joss Whedon always breathes life into characters to make the audience identify with or feel as the characters do, but even he couldn't save this 200 minute long action sequence."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,I. Have seen it two times and I would see it a third time
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Love this movie. Special effects were awesome and the cast works perfectly together. A greatly executed movie.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie in years. Joss Whedon can do no wrong.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"watch it, buy it, and love it"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,What can I say except: it's pure AMAZINGNESS!! 'Nuff said.
"Jun 23, 2012",negative,Predictable and idiotic
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,very enjoyable even with the action starts to look like every other movie out there
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Definitely one of the greatest action movie I have ever seen.  It will retire from theaters with a life long reputation that matches that of Die Hard.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Out of this world good. Amazing action, presented beautifully (especially in 3D)! Funny. Even sad in some points. This movie has the perfect pace, perfect cast, and perfect script. One of the best comic book movies ever."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"(*** 1/2): [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/icons/icon14.gif[/img]

Very fun and entertaining.  Well-worth seeing on the big screen. One of the better films of 2012."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Yet another amazing Marvel Film, cannot wait for the next one!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Wow. Just wow. Definitely worth the wait. The characters were entertaining. There's a character for everyone. I like Hawkeye for some reason. I honestly have just 1 problem. For a movie 2 hours and 22 minutes, it feels a bit empty. Otherwise I recommend this to anyone."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Super buenisima d principio a fin me gusto y hulk estubo increible y Downey jr. Es muy comico AAAA++++++
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,I have been waiting for this movie forever and when I finally saw it it did not dissapoint. It was like a dream come true.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Pure satisfaction from beginning to ending!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,I could happily watch this film every day and not get bored!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Best superhero movie ever made...action packed, funny, and plenty of eye-candy for everyone!!!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon aces this!

A bit long, but extremely entertaining throughout, none the less."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,not as great as everyone else seems to think. good not great
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"I walked into the theater expecting a pretty mediocre movie. I never watched any of the other Marvel Universe movies (Iron Man 1&2, Thor, Hulk, etc.) and wasn't really interested in ever watching them in the future. But The Avenger's struck a chord with me. Great dialogue, great CGI, and intensely satisfying teamwork moments. I had no trouble following the story. This movie surpassed all of my expectations, and kept my full attention from beginning to end. I have now started watching the other movies, however at the moment, The Avenger's is definitely the best."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Great movie.. Action pack and funny 
Seen movie twice"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Typical comic book plot points hold it back from 5 outa 5
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,fun movie.  lots of action
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,I hope they make  a  2nd one!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,This is a really great action movie! I thought it was action packed from beginning to end.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Excellent! Just as expected
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"It's been said 1,000 times, The Avengers is the perfect comic book movie. It has action, comedy, and the characters are ripped directly from the pages."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,A movie I've been waiting for as long as I can remember that still somehow doesn't disappoint.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Loved it. Fun movie to watch!!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"I enjoyed this film in almost every way. 
I didn't see the point of having the black widow in it though"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Aside from the whole Thor/Loki story, this movie was very good; effects (in 3D), action, and acting.  Only other nit was that it would have been nice to see Ed Norton reprise his Hulk role, but Mark Ruffalo did a very good job (and it was nice to see Hulk still look somewhat like Dr. Banner)."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,thoroughly enjoyed this film! love the hulk!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Top 5 movie for entertainment - ever!
"Jun 23, 2012",neutral,Not what I expected! Thought it was cheesy and like the actors didn't know what to do!!!!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,One of the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! Amazing! :)
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Wow! Just so much fun. The effects are super! Worth a watch!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Slow beginning, but really picks up in the last half of the movie."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,The best Marvel's movie so far. Combining all the superheroes together with their own characteristic always exciting. The action is very top notch but the villain is kinda weak not is power but in personality. I grown to love every superheroes from this movie. Can't wait for the sequel
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"SHORT VERSION: 

Everything a super-hero movie should be!  

An incredible movie both in terms of writing and effects.  Equal parts emotion and action meshed together perfectly.  My only (extremely small) complaint is that certain elements the ending is a tiny bit contrived but it's not enough to be anything close to a deal breaker.  Enjoyable for both huge comic book fans and people who will never pick up a comic. 

THE LONG VERSION: 

I am a huge comic nerd (particularly Marvel comics) but I know that many people aren't.  This movie makes Marvel comics/The Avengers seemingly endless mythos accesible to anyone (The Avengers comic book series has been running since 1963).  It evens out some of the more insane elements of it (comic book nerds know the kind of thing I'm talking about and I'm too embarrassed for the industry to highlight some of the more baffling arcs of the 49 years of issues).  

The casting is perfect (it's hard to pick who is the best among them, if I actually lavished praise the way they deserve I wouldn't be able to fit this review in the allotted number of words allowed).  The characters are believable and human even with their superpowers/suits/special agent training.  Each character is unique and given time to shine, testament to this is the fact that upon leaving the theatre my four friends and I all had different favorite characters and enough material from the movie to back-up our choices.  

Plot wise, the stakes are high but conceivable (I'm not generally a fan of the Marvel-verses aliens, but in this they work).  My only complaint is that some elements of the ending seem a bit contrived.  Although the movie's running-time passes the two hour mark it neither feels too long or too rushed.  The Avengers never drags, the pacing is pretty much perfect.  Emotional scenes are given the time they need to progress and grow organically, the high tension scenes are allowed to get downright anxiety-producing, and the action scenes get the adrenaline going like no other movie in recent memory.

(There's one thing that I really appreciated as someone who lives in New York City (for most of the year at least).  The City in which the Avengers end up fighting *is* actually New York rather than just an anonymous city with the Empire State Building chucked in.  Movies and TV frequently use establishing shots to show famous landmarks to set the scene (the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, the Met Life Building, and, of course, The Empire State Building) but on street level the sets are obvious replicas built elsewhere, anonymous cities without the unique *feel* of New York (I know every city has its own vibe, and they generally suffer similarly).  But in the Avengers our heroes fight near/in the actual architecture (and not just the most famous landmarks).  The filmmakers (and the Avengers themselves) even think use Manhattan's grid in their tactics.  It's brilliant. Although street-view/architectural accuracy may seem incredibly minor it really made a big difference to me.  It made everything more real.)"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Exceeded expectations and also a riot...  Story, well what would you expect from it in this movie?"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,The BEST Superhero action in any movie ever made.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,This is a busy movie in the best way possible. Whedon manages to give us a visual spectacle without sacrificing character developement. Made by a fan for the fans.
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Good movie and want to see again but to be honest a tiny bit predictable in some parts and slightly.... Cheesy?
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Beautiful.... Just beautiful
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,They went in depth and also loaded this movie with tons of action!
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"It's the epic superhero crossover movie of all time, especially with all the iconic Marvel Super Heroes comes together like Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Black Widow.

The story is amazing, the cast played their roles well, and not to mention - everything else it has was cool too.

8/10"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"One of a handful of comic book inspired movies that I actually liked. Almost as good as Spiderman & Batman & Iron Man. First one I liked that didn't have the word man in it! Well cast & hard to predict. It was best when Tony Stark & Pepper Potts were on screen because those two actors are awesome. Missed total perfection because I could never figure out who/what that female super hero was doing there. What was her power? What was her relationship to the rest of the gang? Other than that, I loved just about everything about The Avengers."
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,"Awesome.. if you haven't seen it, your missing out people!!"
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,aaaaaamazing movie! (:
"Jun 23, 2012",positive,Off the chain fabulous !!! Nothing else can be said
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Cant wait for the next one.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,It was the best movie ever!!!:)
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Even better than I thought it'd be. The introduction of Loki in the beginning was fast-paced and exciting. Then it slowed down quite a bit into a well-acted drama. More good action and then slow drama again. Finally, the last quarter was action-packed! The movie gives all heros involved good time to shine and neglects none of them. I was totally sold at Loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie Thor."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Finally, im suprised how good it is even with having many heroes at ones a great marvel flick this should be an example for xmen"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"One of (if not) the best superhero movie(s) ever made; funny, entertaining, mentally stimulating yet easy to follow"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Excellent film for everyone...
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,no era lo que esperaba!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Great plot, great acting and excellent directing. You never get the sense that any of the actors are attempting to out perform each other. Like many I believe the hulk stole the show. Highly recommend seeing it once, twice or even three times."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Great movie! Everyone looks fantastic!!!!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Enjoyable fun popcorn movie.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Awesome action movie!!!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"IMHO, it's not one of Joss Whedon's best writings (e.g., lacked some of his clever dialogue), but overall the movie's entertaining.  Scarlett Johansson's character was cool; I liked watching her kick ass.  Tom Hiddleston (Loki) was as much of a standout as he was in Thor."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Super cool movie!!!!!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Usual good guys vs really bad guy,  plenty of action and cool effects."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,great movie. a few times where i was like ehhh but all in all great summer flick. i felt iron man was better.
"Jun 22, 2012",neutral,its always nice to see all of the heroes got together
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,The best superhero movie ever made period.
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,Good. Overrated though which kills it but it's very entertaining.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,So amazing brilliant funny just amazing movie
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this one.  Great action, and great integration of the different characters into the plot line."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this one.  Great action, and great integration of the different characters into the plot line."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,this we was one of the most cinematic movies of the year
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon was given a hard task: take different characters, from different movies, all consisting of different tones, writers, directors and producers, AND MAKE THEM MESH. He did that, and some. This was easily the best Iron Man movie, the best Captain America movie, the best Hulk movie, and the best Thor movie. Why? Because Joss Whedon was a comic book writer, he knows what these movies need, and did it. So epic. In my eyes, top 5 movies of all time, if not the best movie of all time."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Wonderful and action packed
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Excellent Superhero film - but don't expect the story line or seriousness you get with the Dark Knight series - very different type of movie.  If you like superhero films, go see it."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Way more comedy than i suspected, a nice surprise."
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,Not at all important or amazing. Done for the bill.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Before seeing this film I insisted that I didn't like superhero movies. The Avengers seriously changed my mind. Awesome.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Lots of fun.  Great action and effects.  Love the one liners.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"I loved this film, it hit all the marks for me action packed a decent storyline, Iron Man & Thor, I'm just hoping when they make the next one its not a let down like some sequels can be, this film has made my top 20 and will be spending extra money to have it on blu ray"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie, loved every second, it was like they took every good fighting scene out of each movie and brought them together, loved it! and it even brought some comedy into the mix. Mark ruffalo did a great job as the new hulk, i was skeptical at first to see if he could pull it offf, but he did a great job. great movie!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Loved, Loved, Loved it!!!!! Oh did I say I Loved it.... A must see, not just a one time view."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"simply put, AMAZING."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE EVER !!! That's all I have to say
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,i like it i had some though on it but that's it
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Very good summer action movie.  Good mix of action/effects, comedy, character development (as far as super-heros go).  Again, though i would like to be more critical of films, in the sense of holding films and filmmakers to higher standards and making each star worth more (?), I would actually have preferred to give it 3 star.  However, due to the excessive amount cinematic crap that is in theaters these days, another star was warranted."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"superb, absolutely amazing! A must watch for every marvel comics fan :)"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? Its a near perfect movie for this genre. They built up each of these characters in their own respective movies or tied in at least as secondary characters and then brought them together in a believable and awesome way. You could only hope they could put together something this good and I hope DC is taking notes. This is the way you make a comic book come to my life. The stand out is easily The Hulk. Wow is Mark Ruffalo good as this character. His wit and dry humor stands toe to toe with Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and that's no easy task. I thought Ed Norton had hit the nail on the head with his Hulk but this was way better than that and that's saying something. Keep up the good work Marvel!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Would have been hard to screw this movie up.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,SECOND BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"The best super hero movie!  It has humor, wit, action, adrenaline.. every character gets their time to shine. It's a very fun movie and a definite must see in imax 3-d!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Best comic film EVER!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Awesome Movie, absolutely loved it!!!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,The best Marvel Comic movie so far.  Each hero/villain didn't take away too much screen time from each other.  Waiting for Avengers 2!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Thank you, Joss Whedon. You and your crew have done something that was near impossible, make an ensemble superhero movie, with a perfect mix of action and clever storytelling (well, clever in a silly sort of way). The film does rely on the individual films before to flesh out the characters, but it's worth it. A rock concert of memorable moments from the whole team."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Just wow! Well worth it. Not just one the best comic book movies ever, but one the best action movies ever."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Action packed movie, and had humor as well!! Keeps you at the edge of your seat, fun movie to watch!!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Great movie 3d awesome. Can't wait to see the sequel
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,this movie is Amazing i loved it so much i saw it 2 times!i recomend this movie for any MARVEL/super hero fans
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Loved it!!! extremely entertaining !!!!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Exactly what a superhero movie should be! With stunning visual effects and jokes thrown in exactly when needed, The Avengers is a movie lover's dream."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Seen it 3 times within the first two weeks when it came out!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Really good and respectful of the franchise.  Loved it when Loki and the Hulk went at it.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"The only way you wouldn't like this movie, is if you didn't like to have fun."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"One of the best superhero movies ever made.  Even with the very large cast, Whedon magnificently builds all the characters and actually builds an emotional connection to them.  It is a fantastic action movie and can still be enjoyed even by non-comic book readers."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,super movie with super heroes best movie ive seen in years
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,this movie is so awsome

"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! Definitely would go see it again
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"I didn't think it could be done.  The culmination of multiple origin movies actually works.  Well written dialogue and amazing action sequences. Oh, and the Hulk was hilarious."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,The most fun I had in Sci-fi movies since Transformers: Dark Of The Moon.
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,"The last 30 minutes saved this movie, but the first half bored me to tears."
"Jun 22, 2012",neutral,Begining was boring. Had some good action parts
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Great movie, my son and I would watch this everyday!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,best super hero movie I've ever seen
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,The best super hero ever made. Joss nailed it for this film!! Dark knights got some trouble headed his way!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,awesome movie.  Made me really want to be a superhero.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,So much fun to see again and again
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Great movie... Non stop action
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Wonderful, funny movie. Good character development, for the most part."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Far better than any of the heroes individual movies.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,It was action packed from beginning to end! Absolutely loved the characters!
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Up there on my list of memorable comic book movies
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,"This movie was a complete letdown, it was so disappointing. it was boring and cheesy. I was completely psyched  to watch this movie since I am a fan and I thank God the the lady behind me was so clueless that I laughed alot in every comment she had to say, if it wasn't for her this movie would've been complete torture. Only te last 30mins of the film where good, the other 1hr & 30min HORRIBLE."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"I give it a 98/100. It was epic. My plan is to see it 10 times in theaters before it goes out on DVD. The only thing was that it was a little slow in the beginning, but other than that, it was spectacular. It's all 4 of my favorite movies combined."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Es buena, pero no deja de ser una pelÃ­cula pochoclera, y comica. Orientada para un publico que solo busca el entretenimiento a corto plazo y chicos."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,So far... 2012 best blockbuster movie.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,it was a great movie
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Whedon's group dialogue and an amazing performance from Mark Ruffalo as a character thats often portrayed as pure ham make this certainly one of the best films of 2012 and a contender for best comic book adaption.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Excellent movie. Great collection of Marvel franchises.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,Buenos efectos buena accion pero algo le quedo faltando.
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,predictable.  Slightly interesting.  Missable.
"Jun 22, 2012",negative,"The only good thing about this movie is its comedic moments. Otherwise it's long, sloppy, and shallow. A truly good superhero movie can move you to tears (i.e. Gordon's anguish about Harvey Dent's fall from grace in the Dark Knight.) This movie lacked any sort of emotional depth. I don't know two of these characters (Black Widow, Hawkeye), have no attachment to Ruffalo as Hulk, and hardly fear the skinny, egocentric Loki. This movie was generic and underwhelming."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,So good. So very good.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,The most fun I've had at the movies in a long time. Joss Whedon you are a god among men.
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"A brilliant and fast paced action, With great development on all characters. A must see."
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Very well done movie, had an absolute blast watching it and I look forward to avengers two already!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,"Can't wait until this Sunday
Avengers assemble!"
"Jun 22, 2012",positive,HHHHHOOOOOTTTTT!!!!!!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon. Superheroes.  Act III.  That is all.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"So fantastic movie. This movie had the power to stay me be sited at my sit. Oh what a movie it was. I wish to watch it again. It had the action, comedy (sometimes), fun, thriller. Most amazing scene was when Hulk throw Loki again and again. Ha ha ha. Hulk did so much comedy end the end of the movie. So good."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Saw it Awesome!!!!!!!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Coming from a very serious reader of these characters from their source material, I couldn't stop grinning at every scene and line of dialog. Finally, someone nailed the comic-book movie. Fitting that it would be Joss Whedon."
"Jun 21, 2012",neutral,I just liked the hulk
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Performances were great,especially Iron Man.It was a great mix between comedy and action.A must see"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Good job marvel!!! Keep it going till the infinity gantlet. Love the new camera angles (ie driver view of cars flipping over) good chemistry between actors. Even if iron man is the leader, hulk stole the show!!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"All I gotta say is, if you haven't seen this movie something is very wrong with you. This movie really brings out the inner kid in you with laughs in every corner."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"funny, i like the hulk and robert downey jr"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Amazing Superheroes Assembled!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Pure awesome. Enough said!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Great special effects and action
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Awsome Movie really loved it!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Loads of fun and action which makes the improbably plot passable.  Was a real fun to watch!  Must see in 3D, its the first movie I've seen that takes cinematography shots with 3D in mind!  You will be missing out watching 2D!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,One of the best movies ever! Love the action and humor.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. Great graphics. Have really enjoyed the recent comic book movies . Ever one seems to get better.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"A little slow to start, but when the action hits man does it hit hard"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Saw it first day .. My favorite movie !
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"it's good, but whedon's fetish for killing fan favorites puts a damper on this otherwise great film."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Got around seeing this. It was pretty good. Captain America is kind of a bitch
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Best movie ever, this generations star wars"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Loved the movie, only have small very few take aways from the movie, but it is the best movie of the year so far... just waiting for Gotham's reckoning now..."
"Jun 21, 2012",neutral,Wasn't really for me :/ but it was definitely well made.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,I went and saw this with friends the night of my friend's and mine open house! Loved it! Saw it again a month later with my dad and stayed for the extra scenes at the end! It was well worth the wait!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Well worth the wait!!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"In a word, ""Awesome!"" Best movie I've seen in a long time and a new favorite. It definitely lived up to the hype and my expectations. There aren't many movies worthy of 5 stars from me, but I'd give this one 10 if I could."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"For a movie that had a 5 movie build up,  it had such a big chance of being a major disapointment. Good thing for us a great director was signed and it could very possibly the best super hero/comic movie out there! Great story, great action, great characters! Finally the Hulk was done right"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Probably the second best superhero movie of all time behind the dark knight. The dialogue was great and the action and visuals were aweinspiring.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,the movie was awesome and at times funny. Love the hulk in this movie.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"A perfect summer blockbuster. The first act has to pick up steam, but once it does it's an unstoppable rocket."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Being a comic book geek I have one thing to say to all involved in creating this movie. Thank you, you deserve every penny you make from this."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"I love all the avenger and I know all of there custome. The hulk, iron man, black widow, banner, Jarvis the captain, and captain America. I think that is their costume"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Cool story. Not a superhero fan. Loved the music.
"Jun 21, 2012",negative,"I see a lot of reviewers who are seemingly scared to write their honest feelings about this movie for fear of public scorn.  Either that or they simply should not be writing reviews and found their way into the wrong job through some morbid twist of fate or other.  If you want run-of-the-mill action with the same run-of-the-mill action plot & script but with up to date effects then this is a good film.  But don't expect anything more than a modern day cliche for the same old mundane ""Seen it a million times"" generic crap."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Love Downey and Hiddleston!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"I was really not looking forward to this, thinking it would be just as bad as the other marvel movies released recently... but it turned out to be one of the best movies i had ever seen"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"One of the best super hero movies ever made, and that's saying a lot considering they had to mash up four main characters. Can't wait for the sequel!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,A must see for anyone wgo hasn't seen it yet.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"If your a person that loves movies with action, this is definetly the movie for you."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Action packed, consistently funny, and displays the super heroes like never before, The Avengers is sure to please everyone."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,me gusto mucho fue fantastico
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed the continuing character development as well as the exciting action. If you don't stick around after the credits of Marvel movies, you're missing out!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"seen it twice, Freaking awesome, even my wife & kid liked it."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Was pretty good. Too long! Don't think I would give it 93%. Maybe 80%!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,This was really good!! Can't wait for the next one!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,AWESOME!! Best Hulk yet.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"At the end of the day, I guess it's exactly what I expected."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Probably the most fun I've had at the movies since I was a kid.  A smart and entertaining film filled with great characters.  Not only did Avengers meet its expectations but the film somehow exceeded it.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Great film, like another iron man film but he's got a whole badass team this time!!!!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"This movie validates a majority of the nerd community's existence. As if the nerds are all out there saying 'see! I told you the Avengers could fit into modern context and still be freaking awesome!'. Kudos to the top heads in this one. It must have been tricky trying to fit together all these people's storeis (no matter how farfetched some of them seemed when they first came out in their own movies.) and they pulled it off really well. In terms of the summer movie season this movie definitely kicks it all off with a bang. Hilarious, action-y, lots of great character moments, plenty of Tony Stark witty banter. It's a visual wonder and every bit is great to watch. I recommend this movie for just about anyone interested in it and who can get past the PG-13 rating. Enjoy!"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,the avengers is a truley awsome movie.  the movie is action packed it deserves the 1 billion dollers it got  and all the good reviews
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,One word: Awesome!!!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Great movie! Saw it several times.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers had every possibility of going horrendously wrong. Typically incompatible characters were somehow blended together into a balanced amalgamation of humour and action. A couple of the characters were uninteresting enough to be lost in the mayhem, but nobody cares."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Great movie. A must see! Funny, action-packed and one of my Top 5."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,One of the best comic book adaptions I've seen. Joss did a stellar job of giving each hero enough screen time and the humour is fantastic.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,Good once every part of the storyline is set. Starts real slow and the 3D was not all that great
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"A good movie just don't watch it with TDKR. Avengers has jokes, puns, and classic one liners. Good movie"
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,lots of action! Fun and amusing as well!
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"If this was a tv show, it would be a rerun of Captain America and Iron Man. And just like when you're eating a salad.... Gotta add a toss of bacon bits (Hulk), wonton crisp (Hawkeye) and whatever olive or something (Natasha). I think thats her name.

If it weren't for the humor, I would be lost in the dark forest forever.

And now for my final say, yes it will be watching a rerun on tv. I have a really strong sixth sense feeling that I'm about to watch this again real soon."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Wow what a wild ride this was. I love Marvel.  Beautifully shot, sexy characters & a twist of humour like no other."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,"Good movie, but completely overrated."
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,I loved this movie!!!! It made me so happy.
"Jun 21, 2012",positive,The Avenger's sets the bar for all superhero movies coming out this summer.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,this film is my favorite film of this year  so far
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Yeah... I'm in love with a comic book character.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"We loved The Avengers, a solid 5 of 5 stars in every way. One of my favorite movies in a while. If you like classic good vs. evil battles, you will love this movie. Spectacular special effects and 3D as well! We will be buying this Blu-Ray for sure!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,LAUGH GASP BANG POW CRUNCH HOT SMASH YUMMY EXPLOSION HAHAHA BOOM OH MY GOD BOOM SEXY KAPOW SMASH LAUGH THE END.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Incredible writing and direction. The movie gave each hero his,/her due and kept a great sense of humor through out."
"Jun 20, 2012",negative,Not much to say except... it is terrible.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"This ladies and gentlemen is a Marvel masterpiece, awesome story and sweet action . HAS BRILLIANT SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!!!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,This is a great ensemble movie. There is plenty of action which moves the plot alibf.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Come on! The whole world knows it..the Best Super Hero Movie Ever!!!.....so far, Dark Knight rises coming soon
p.s.: I had a Shawarma today it was the bomb...I need to find Tony Starks Yelp account"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Started with a bang and kept on rolling from there with an amazing cast and an action-packed plot.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,All my son *whos 4* sat through the whole movie completely immersed into the movie and all he could say when we walked out the theater was HULK SMASH!!! was very awesome movie very well done!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon delivers.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,loved Robert Downey Jr. as always.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Amazing movie ! Loved every minute of it :)
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Such a great movie! Not only did it have great actors, but it also more or less followed the proper story, keeping true to its origins. It had great visual effects, with an overall mind-blowing feeling to it. It is definitely a must-see!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic book movies ever made. There is a lot to praise here... Despite its epic scope, the film never falls apart from its lofty ambitions- partly because it's packed with likeable performances and some of the funniest dialogue ever uttered in a superhero flick. It takes itself seriously, but just enough- the film is also well aware of what it is, which is, at its core, a highly entertaining albeit emotionally shallow superhero team-up flick. On a technical level, this is a significant achievement, particularly the revamped CGI Hulk, who is several steps beyond his digital cinematic predecessors. It should get Oscar noms for Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects, but probably not anything else given current Academy trends."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Epic masterpiece nuff said
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,THE GUYS LOOK GOOD THAT WAS I CANDY FOR ME !!!!!! :D EVEN THOUGH MY BF IS STARING AT ME RIGHT NOW BUT ITS TRUE 1005 FOR THAT MOVIE CANT WAIT FOR THE SECOND ONE THE HULK WAS HILARIOUS MAY I ADD :D
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best Superhero Movie Ever!
"Jun 20, 2012",negative,America is entirely on crack! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Virtually unwatchable. Liked Iron Man -- this was atrocious.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Maybe I'm biased since I don't have a thing for Superhero movies... but I thought it was an 'ok' movie. In essence, it was a Thor sequel with a bunch of random superheroes thrown in. I'm slightly disappointed that this film is ranked 3rd as the highest grossing films of all time though, it wasn't really anything special about it."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"really a great movie, however if you have not seen any of the other marvel movies i would suggest watching them before hand or at least watch Thor."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,All I can say is .......AWSOME!!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,The Avengers is a great combonation of The Marvel Universe. Many great actors and a good story.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies that has come out, my kids wanted to see it again right away."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Just plain fun -- but the aliens were too easy to kill. The invasion was destined to fail.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,there are no words...
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Two words: ""Puny god."" :-D"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year so far.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year so far.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Not a comic book fan but this I can do.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Awesome movie kept my attention from beginning to end i would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked me
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Doesn't disappoint - a good film all around. Action, comedy and great effects - it's all there. Catch this at the cinema if you can!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"It was amazing! The perfect mix of action, and comedy. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,I loved it! One of the best movies I've ever seen!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,really good and funny
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Been waiting years for this and it lived up to all expectations! Loved it!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of the year. Marvel did a great job tying all of the stories together. Has a lot of action and even some humor. I highly recommend this movie.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Great movie!... even tho no to watch in 3D, heck, any movie should be watched on 3D :P"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"I liked the movie. My husband and I went to see it, and I'm not a big ""action movie"" person, but this one kept me interested."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"possibly the best movie of the year! great action, very funny, good character development, and still stuck to the plot very well. can't wait for the next one!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Great theme love the movie!!!!!! I hope you enjoy and like it as much as I did!!!!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Too much slapstick comedy for my taste
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,perfect hilarious and genuous a blast to watch
"Jun 20, 2012",negative,"Extremely overrated. 
Poor acting from Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.
The mindblowing actions scenes didn't make me forget the painful hour and a half I watched the hero's fighting each others. Overused concept."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Greatest movie of all time!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie I've ever seen. I'm surprised how they got enough screen play for each character. By far one of the best movies to watch.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,The movie was amazing and totaly worth the $11 it cost to get in and watch it in 3D.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,josh Weldon is god!!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,One of the best super hero movies I've ever seen. I can't wait for the sequel!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,This was awesome!!!!
"Jun 20, 2012",neutral,I just didn't understand why I was the only one in the entire 300+ crowd of people sitting in the IMAX theater who wasn't getting the jokes. What's so funny about Captain America and Thor fighting each other? Hello?
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"I actually saw the a Avengers on opening night, but ive been away from writing reviews on here for a while, hence the delay in this.

I think i'll review the Avengers in four different aspects: The characters, content/story, action and execution.

The Characters: I have never seen a spin off movie that takes so many different and diverse characters from other franchises, puts them together and still maintains the continuity of all the characters as individuals while also giving them a great amount of development which makes them feel like they come from the same universe. You have Thor a demi god, Captain America a super soldier from a different time and age, Iron man a modern day narcicist/playboy/billionaire/philanthropoist/genius in a high tech suit of armor, Bruce Banner/Hulk(we'll go into more depth on him momentarily) an exiled man-beast with anger issues, Two top assassins (Hawkeye and Widow) and all of them are more different than the sun is from the moon but theyve all been tied together so well by Sgt. Nick Fury of shield, Agent Coulson and the other Shield operatives, that they feel like they all are apart of the same cohesive whole. In short I have never seen a movie that takes so many well developed characters and stays true to their origins while making them feel fresh and interesting.

Now...I love me some Iron man, Cap and Thor...BUT, I have to give only one character some major props in this movie Review. 

THE HULK: I love the hulk and have been disappointed to an extent with the other two hulk movies, the first was too mellow dramatic, dark and story driven, lacking action. The second felt too unrealistic and the hulk looked like a abrecrombie model painted green and given an extra does of steroids. But this...this is THE Hulk movie. First off Ruffalo pulls of the mild mannered Bruce Banner so well he over shadows Bana and Norton by a mile in my opinion. Secondly The Hulk himself Not only looks like both the comics version AND Mark ruffalo (finally a hulk that looks like the actor that plays him!) but he has the best action scenes and overall best scenes in general in the whole movie BAR NONE. Spoiler ALert

When the Hulk bashes Loki into the Ground and refers to him as ""Puny god""..i could watch that over and over for 2 hours straight.

Now...The last thing on the characters in the movie i wanna mention refers to the aforementioned Loki.

Loki: I thought Tom hiddleston was the best and most memorable part of Thor, and He's def the highlight of the avengers when it comes to the bad guys. Loki is such a well done villain. you sympathize for him in a way but you know he must be stopped and he's fun to watch in all ways. 


Content/Story: I really was pleased with how faithful to the comics this story was. Using elements from the first issue of the original Avengers with Loki as the Primary villain and combining that with the use of the Chitauri armies, which also segways into an Awesome possibility for a sequel by including the tease of Thanos in the end credits, genius. The big kicker for me with the story, however, is how well the team involved in writing this story did at meshing all the various story elements that led up to the Avengers from the other separate character films. Mt hat's off to the writers and the director Joss Whedon on making such an interesting and fun/epic story.

Action: I have never seen a movie that handles action so well, a good combination of well coreographed fight scenes, plenty of explosions but not in that mindless michael bay style, good CG elements and clever sets with breathtaking environments and situations, the avengers delivers in a way that should make future action films stand at attention and take note.

Execution: this is the overall shining point of the Avengers, All these elements are fantastic and make the movie a classic on their own. the characters the memorable story and action, they all rock your socks off, but how the creative team, actors and all other members involved with the production of this film took all these elements and brought them together into a very well made, tightly knit epic movie going eperience that will go down as an instant classic and groundbreaking feat in comic book films.

All in all I obviously am giving the Avengers 100%, ive never seen a movie that does what it did so well before and I hope that they take the same level of care and enthusiasm as well as the same amount of time for the sequel as they did with The original, looking forward to more from the Avengers, if you havent gone to see it yet, get out there!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Hulk done smash...well done, mr. Whedon, well done."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best comic book film ever made. Enough said.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,EPIC..that is all I can say.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Awesome movie ! it was action packed from begining to end also funny !
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Not many comics turned films or superhero films turn out to be good but this was just awesome.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,My fave movie of all time!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best film in years. hilarious from start to end and a good film for all
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"took a while to kick in but was mint!
Hulk was hilarious!!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"For a Fan-Boy like me, it doesn't get any better than this. ""Mom, what did you do with my comic books!"""
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Perfect spring/summer blockbuster.  I'm a big fan of Netflix, but films like this still make theaters relevant and worth the expense."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,love this movie the hulk steals it
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,definetely raises the bar for superhero movies!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Of the films leading up to this one, this one surely takes the cake as the best of the  Avengers series of films.  The only issue I would have is that if I was a viewer who hadn't seen the films leading up to this one then I would be confused about the characters in the film and why ""S.H.E.I.L.D.""  would pick them over other heroes in the marvel universe.  If a sequel is made, here's to hoping studio companies allow marvel characters to be shared because it would be awesome to add in certain characters like Spider-Man and some of the X-Men to the Avengers' team."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"The movie had loads of connections to better explain the movies more.  Therefore, a lot of fighting was on there and that's good.  People love action scenes and they made it all in there.  Also, the movie has a good sense of humor.  Robert Downey Jr. did fantastic in the film as Iron Man, and the props were perfectly made.  I hope you enjoy the movie."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Awesomeness,that is all I can say!!!!!!"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150342613921676.338148.568861675&type=3#!/photo.php?fbid=10150851459526676&set=a.10150342613921676.338148.568861675&type=3&theater
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Probably one of the best movies I have seen in a long time with awesome fighting scenes, great effects , and very witty humor. The only complaint is the fact that they didn't show more of hawkeye or make him his own movie  he is definitely one of my favorite characters in the avenger movie I hope they will develop his character more or at least make like an origin movie for him or something"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"'Avengers' sparkles right there, to its starkest gleam with its dialogue and authentic humor and lives manic energy with ginormous set pieces, like the quantum of gamma of Tesserac."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Excellent movie!  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I would recommend re-watching (or watching) Thor and Captain America. And as they did with other Marvel movies, stay until the end of the credits.  There are 2 extra scenes during and after the credits."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Saw it twice! It was an action packed film from the beginning to the end! So That's why I rated it five stars!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Awesome and action packed!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"the plot is slow and boring, but the part that I like when they fight, it looks really cool."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,It's awesome I seen it. Plus on the other hand it has comedy too
"Jun 20, 2012",neutral,"I don't see what all the fuss is about..... there's more to movies than comics, when will the world realise this? This movie was severely average."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Action was in almost every seen, I wish the hulk would have gotten meaner."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Awesome. Loved seeing all of these characters together. Makes waiting for their next individual movies a little less painful.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,i did see it. It was a cool movie every
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Better than all Marvel movies COMBINED
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,great movie full of action and comedy
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,The Avengers both different and not different but this movie better than other superhero movies.
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"very good film, i really liked the story to it"
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Really good! Loved Robert Downey Jr (aka Iron Man)
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Absolutely EPIC.. The best movie of this year so far..
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best super hero movie
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Action-packed, humorous and all out entertaining, THE AVENGERS is a prime example of what Summer fun at the movies can be had."
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,I thought that it was amazingly good!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Flat out the best superhero movie I've seen to date.  Thank you for getting it right Mr Joss.
"Jun 20, 2012",neutral,Really cool effects i guess but i almost fell asleep watching it :\
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Omg I love this movie!!!!!
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,undoubtly an exotic movie
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,Best F u cken movie ever
"Jun 20, 2012",positive,"Probably the best marvel film of this decade, really good film, even for the actor play, not always good, the story is great, and the thz fun is nzver forgoten, which respects perfectly the comics.	And I say that as a great marvel fan. Really a must see."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Omg!!! Great movie.. See it over & over

"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"It blew my mind away with its mind blowingly awesomeness! Can't wait for dvd on my big 55"" flat screen tv! Next big movie... The Amazing Spider-Man"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Greatest flick this year!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,A very fine comic book movie.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,It was amazing. I've seen it twice since the midnight premier!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,this is the greatest movie i have ever seen
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Only Joss Wheadon could make this happen. For a movie to bring about and fully realize a team of characters such as The Avengers, who better than the author of one of Marvels best team Based Runs(Astonishing X-men). Wheadon brings to life a team of superhero misfits so organically it really is amazing to behold. Because of that we got more than just a movie where people in tight suits blow aliens up(which the movie does really well also), making the non-action just as interesting as the fights."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Great combo of action and comedy
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year so far. No contest!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Mmm K, can we talk about the gay we are using Gwyneth to cover up in this movie?"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Great movie cannot wait until sequel!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,A little long bug overall pretty good movie.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Great movie, starts off very, very slow but ends with a smash."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"good movie, kinda slow at times, but definitely worth watching many more times in the future, this is a MUST BUY though, if you don't have it right now, get off your ass and go get it.,"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"It is definitely a ""must go"", fast paced action movie and has a plot that will continually interest you, keeps your attention and contains a lot of comic relief or just flat out comedy"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Well done I think Joss has stepped things up for this one and I like the fact they went more in depth with Black Widow and Hawkeye!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"excellent effects, acting & heroics."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,I really enjoyed the humorous mixed with the action.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Do you like action that taste likes cake and crack? This movie is for you.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Great action and good comic hero hero fun.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Well, I haven't seen anything so good in a looooong time. Hands-down, this is my fave movie of this year, and probably even the last three years!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Worth the hype of a summer movie, not worth 93%."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"WOW this is the best SUPERHERO movie I've seen this year!
it's like a Big WWE episode but with super hero
A(solid)+"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"This movie was freakin awesome I loved every minute of it! It great action great story line it was just great I would so pay to see this movie again, and I never do that!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,This movie was Awesome!!. There's is so much action my favorite part was when Thor and Hulk fought.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Fantastic Film. All characters worked well for the movie, even the minor ones. Whedon did a great job directing. Pure entertainment."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"LOVED IT!!!  I grew up on the Avengers,  it was great to see them in action... and eye candy to boot"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Being of a film genre that doesn't usually attract my attention, I'm glad I chose to join a friend for this fun ride with a great group of superheroes. Entertaining all the way!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Great all around. I hated Robert downing jr in iron man, but everyone did great!! Great action and it's funny!!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Best comic book movie ever. I grew up collecting comic books and never thought I'd see an all star team like The Avengers make it onto the screen let alone be as good as it was. It was true to the spirit of the comic book, had plenty of action and had the fun that is a necessity in making a comic book movie."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Dialog and fully humanized characters you can believe in and care for as only Joss Whedon can do. The characters never get lost in the explosions as in some actions movies and each superhero has some spotlighted scenes where you can believe the movie is just about them, then someone else shows up!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,I have watched it 5 times already!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Very funny easy to get into and the diolog was halarious
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"One of the top Comic Book Movies to ever be released. The movie was packed with Humor, Action, and most importantly, Disagrements between the Avengers. The movie had an outstanding cast but it diminished Hawkeye (my favorite Avenger) to a pointless character. It focused TOO much on humor and was slow in some parts. I give it 4 Avengers out of 5."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Already seen it & thought it was very good. It had some good action & an okay storyline.
"Jun 19, 2012",neutral,a very overated superhero movie its a 7/10 the dark knight rises will be a much bettter movie
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The greatest movie ever (13 year olds view) Iove this film, I really cannot emphasise how great it is, please, don't miss this opportunity."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The entire weight of this movie is founded upon the individual strengths of the indiviual movies leading up to this point. So if you liked Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, than you will have an absolute blast with this movie. It is surprisingly funny, and it is quite amazing how each hero was so well balanced in screen time and butt-kickery alike. My gripe with this movie is not with the movie itself, but all choices leading up to it. But Whedon took lemons and made lemonade. I will save my nerdy arguments about the actor choices for each hero, their physiques, costumes, abilities, personas, back stories, etc. for a more appropriate audience, but let me finish with this:  Considering it's all we have, it's pretty damn good."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Favorite movie of all time!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers takes everything good from the 'superhero action hit' films and expands upon them. So much so, that I was nearly crying during this movie, nearly losing my voice and sight from tears of laughter, and even sitting in a monotone seriousness for other things. 

This movie was the best theater experience I've had yet. The 3D, while not too overbearing but also not non-existent, really was done well and beyond that, the plot and characters were thought out perfectly for a movie of this magnitude. In a movie theater, movies are great because they're on such a large screen, but this one really put me in the film and made me enjoy spending my time and money to go to the cinemas. I dub it best theater film I've seen not because I loved just the movie, but because as an experience, it was done right.

I hate so much that The Avengers took so long to come out because I have several friends who just plain don't like the 'superhero' flicks because they're cheesy or done wrong. Well let me tell you, if all of them had seen this first? There would be no comparison."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"A big comic book fan for years, not anal dont mind changes, different outfits, ages or what is supossed to be from comics. 
From time to time someone gets it really right. Not only was i impressed about how much fun this movie was but i think people who dont even like comic book movies will like. It has action, humor, great cgi, acting and a decent story. 
women will love the cut men and men will love the sexy women. 
and when it takes off it never looks back.
as a comic book junky the action scenes were straight out of the comics. 
loved it saw 3 times already and would see it again."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Marvel,Marvel,Marvel..Hooray!! and about time!!

This time round, the movie makers have done the superhero genre justice, on their own; only Downey's Iron Man character stood out. But in this movie, all characters shone.

Great movie, keep it up!! 5 stars here"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Watch it. Like seriously it is a totall must see! Omg
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,The Movie Is The Bast FX Ever
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,'Nuff said. Excelsior!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"You. Yes, the one reading this. Stop what you're doing, and go see this movie. NOW. I'll wait..."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,I enjoyed this movie but I feel there was too much hype and killed it a bit for me
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,seen it but would love to watch it again and again
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Already seen it awesomeeeeee
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie I've ever seen!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Don't know why everyone loved this one SOOO much. It's too flawed, the first 40 mins are completely boring..."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The greatest film I have ever seen. The acting is flawless, the dynamic of the cast can really be felt, every character gets screentime, good lines and action scenes, Tom Hiddleston is perfection, he's so beautiful and talented. I've seen it 5 times, will be seeing it more. What I also liked was it was genuinely funny too! Just amazing. Go see it!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,waited for a long time for this one and it was well worth the wait. best action movie I have seen in a long time. will definitely be buying it when it comes out on dvd
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,My daughter saw this movie and said it was really awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"I loved it, it was a  awesome Sci Fi flick"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Greatest Joss Whedon movie ever made.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,A great film which has brought together all the superhereos of recent times. The hulk is the best played character and provides nearly all the laughs. I think Captain Amercia could have been portrayed a little better but overall still great.
"Jun 19, 2012",negative,Not enough fighting.avengers is supposed to be fighting this movie had too much background on the characters
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"You know? I only have one thing to say on Marvel's The Avengers.                

Go see it."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"It's a summer super hero film that shouldn't be missed.   Not a life changer, but an entertaining way to spend 2 hours."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best movie yet its at the top of my list
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,This movie was awesome
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,The second best superhero movie ever made!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE EVER!!! JUST LOVE ROBER DOWNEY Jr IN THIS MOVE HE IS SO FUNNY!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Embora tenha subido um pouco no meu conceito apÃ³s rever-lo, ainda penso que nÃ£o passa de um grande e superficial, para nÃ£o dizer descartÃ¡vel, entretenimento."
"Jun 19, 2012",negative,"Avengers Assemble? No, Avengers a shambles!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,So good I watched it twice!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Amazing movie!!! Downright hilarious, action packed and has a decent story line! A must see!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Would I watch it again? HELL YEAH!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Move over, ""The Dark Knight""! We have a new ""best superhero movie"" candidate! It's been 4 (more or less) years since we saw Mr. Robert Downey Jr. as ""Iron Man,"" and looking over, like, five movies of buildup. I think we can agree that Marvel has accomplished so much since 2008. We've got The Invincible Iron Man, The Mighty Thor, First Avenger Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, and newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye (who are even more badass in the comics). Of course I would be giving this movie a perfect score, given the fact that I'm such a comic book maniac, but if I were the average biased critic that hates superhero movies in general, I'd say, ""Hey, this is actually pretty damn good."" Why is it so good, anyway? If you've been following the Marvel movies since 2008, (not counting X-Men, no offense to them) then you'll definitely be excited that these various superheroes are finally teaming up to stop a common foe. Really, I can't say anything good about it that hasn't filled up a barrel already. You'll have to watch it yourself. Listing the bad aspects is a lot easier, since it's really just nitpicking and it's going to be a rather short list anyway. Spoiler-free. The biggest criticism is actually the plot itself because of how straightforward and simple it is (Loki's attacking and the Avengers have to stop him), but that's how all superhero movies are, so you shouldn't complain about it. Other bad things include... well that's it really. You have to be a real nerd to point out anything bad about it simply because it's inaccurate to the comics. Ex: Chiatauri aliens don't shapeshift and look like Kree, not to mention that they weren't in the original story; Ant-Man and Wasp aren't in it, being replaced by Hawkeye and Black Widow, Iron Man isn't using his golden Mk. I armor, Hulk doesn't talk much, Thor doesn't have his helmet, Nick Fury's black instead of white in the comics (except in the Ultimate comics), blah blah blah, nothing really bad about it. So why don't you get the hell over to your nearest theater and watch the damn thing already?? (I'm still waiting for the next big comic book movie... The Dark Knight Rises isn't it)"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Good god what a film!!! Perfect!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Awesome Ã°'? movie cant wait for the second Ã°'?
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is an action-packed, heart- filled thrill ride. The 4 years leading up to this have been totally worth it. The acting was spot-on, the story was great, everything. I knew Joss Wheadon wouldn't let me down. This movie is 10/10, 5/5, and 100% non-rotten."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Great Superhero action flick
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Natural progression for Marvel's flicks lately.  The source material from the previous movies (Thor, Captain America: First Avenger, Iron Man) played really well together.  I think Hawkeye could have used a little more character development, since the backstory isn't really fleshed out much...but the portrayals of Hulk, Iron Man and Captain America were spot on."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,best movie i have seen in a long time
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,absolutely amazing. action packed and extremely funny
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Just a bunch of fun. Great cast, great dialog, decent story"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The best marvel super movie I have ever saw, the acting, action, hilarious, all we're soo good especially iron man and hulk those two were funny love this movie!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Awesome movie!...exciting from the start!...
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Maybe the best Superhero movie ever made..... good solid story and tons of action. Only minor flaw is the part in the battle in the city when the aliens have Cap by his head and his mask comes off. Why are studios always doing this in a superhero movie - just leave the secret identity stuff alone.

Can't wait for a 2nd one!!"
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"The Avengers or as it is know in the UK 'Avengers Assemble' is the culmination of what started back in 2008 with Iron Man, back then The Avengers was a distant dream that no one could have predicted would have ended with one of the greatest superhero movies of all time! From its spectacular visual effects to its laugh out loud humor. The Avengers lives up to its incredibly high hype and raises the bar for all superhero movies."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year!
"Jun 19, 2012",neutral,"For me the Marvel films have been hit or miss, and the plots and overall flow tend to be really lacking. Flow is one of the big problems Avengers has. The flow is forced. Even after half a dozen movies (if you include Ang Lee's Hulk) we still have a lot of back story left untold, and to assemble the team and arrange events for our climatic action packed fight sequences we're sped through a bunch of montages and some hackneyed plot points. 
As an ensemble super hero team picture I rather preferred Fox's X-Men films. The key to a Super-Hero movie, in my opinion isn't the mask, it's the man behind the mask, and here the men behind the masks are short-changed so that we can rush them all together and see what happens when earth's mightiest hero's assemble. The final action sequences are indeed epic, but they just didn't erase the bitter taste from the first half of the film which didn't have quite enough development. 
In general I've found both DC and Marvel's animated offerings tend to exceed their live action productions, perhaps buoyed by the fact that it's okay to have an occasional miss in the animated genre, but a flop in live action causes heads to roll. The Avengers cartoon series, despite not meeting the level of the Justice League or '90's X-Men standards for an ensemble cast, still has a better overall flow and development than what is found in Whedon's script. That's the advantage of a serial, but there's also more to it. That series is just more character focused. Look at Fox's X-Men. Lots of characters, but we have one character to focus on, and even the auxiliary characters are all there for a reason until the third film. There was simply no interesting character development in Avengers. Thor starts in Asgard ends in Asgard. Tony starts out selfish, displays some self sacrifice, but we've already seen him do this before in nearly an identical set piece in the first Iron Man, so that's no development. Hawkeye similarly just goes full circle, and Hulk is simply comic relief, not the heart of a character arc. Cap coming into the modern world is the obvious character plot that should be at the heart of this movie, but it seems as if a lot has been left on the cutting room floor in that arc - perhaps a director's cut will put some of it back in and give it a little more of the heart this film is lacking."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Very entertaining throughout. Awesome fight scenes. I was worried that because I didn't see a few of the individual superhero movies, I'd be lost but that wasn't the case at all."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Great movie! Action packed with a few humorous parts. This is a movie to buy on Bluray
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,It be relly awsome moive
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Loved it! Great mix of action and comedy!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,The suspense is thrilling!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Its absolutely perfect. Just perfect. It blends comedy, action, drama in a way that is so rare to find. You will LOVE this movie.

It will be hard for the amazing spiderman to top this."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,It Was Worth The Wait Two Thumbs Up
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,What a super-hero movie should be-- excellent visuals and Whedonesque humor.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,Enjoyable for the most part and I liked how all the stories came together. A few standout performances but overall a little disappointing considering the hype but still excellent entertainment.
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,one word ... Awesome!!!!!
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Watch out , just for HULK..."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Slick action, great chemistry between the actors, witty and funny at times, solid performances, tremendous special effects, and overall a great film. Whedon was able to blend these characters together smoothly while staying true to their individual back stories and is able to give out enough screen time to each star without losing track of the story. The newest superhero portrayals, Hawkeye and Hulk, are nice editions. Mark Ruffalo is the best Bruce Banner/Hulk yet. Undoubtedly Marvel's best film adaptation to date."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,<3 it so much my son n I watched it twice :D
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,"Saw it four times.  Defines the term ""Nerd Porn."" It was so good that I originally hated Captain America... saw The Avengers and then watched Captain America again... and loved it."
"Jun 19, 2012",positive,It was awesome movie. It had great acting and great special effects. My favorite avenger was the HULK.
"Jun 18, 2012",negative,Such a boring movie! felt sleepy within half an hour of the movie!! poor story...
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Greatest hero movie! Nuff said!
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Wowser, this was jawesome, clever, witty, legendary, you name it this movie had it. Yes, my only issue was the villian and the fact War Machine wasn't mentioned by Stark. Well at least I don't recall. Other than that, fantastic job by the cast and crew. This truly was an epic picture."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,one of my favorite movies of all time I don't like super hero movies but it was outstanding
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,it wasnt all that to me
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"I really liked this movie! I don't think it was overlay amazing, but it still was very good. A must see for sure!"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,One of the best movies i've ever seen in my life.  Have to see this in 3d though.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Epic is not even the word that can describe how perfect this movie was for me.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great action movie...  The BF was very happy!
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Absolutely fantastic! Storyline, character development, and even the use of the Hulk was spot on!!! Definitely worth seeing in the theater, and a must buy when released on Blu Ray!!!"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Very exciting and action packed...
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Stuff blows up. I laughed at least once. There were some women and fast cars. So, yeah I enjoyed it."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,I enjoyed the storyline and how well they matched up each hero to blend in the movie.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,loved loved loved this movie
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Excellent film. Action was great, but also funny. Kept my attention from start to finish."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,The Avengers throws interesting characters with laughs and a cartoon action spectacle for limited attention spans.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"the most hilarious movie!! it was soo entertaining, even kids will enjoy :D"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Even though I'm not a huge superhero fan, I still liked it. It really can appeal to pretty much anyone."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great movie i wanna wach it again
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Is the Avengers the greatest superhero movie of all time? No it is defiantly not. The Avengers is highly overrated and does not come close of deserving the title ""greatest superhero movie of all time""  when it is not nearly as good as The dark knight, Spiderman 2, and it's first origin movie Iron man. With that out of the way I like to say that while this movie did have 4 marvel superheroes working together on screen for the first time trying to save the world, i did not enjoy it. The superheroes were so damn annoying whenever they started arguing with one another with one liner jokes. I'm not even kidding when i say that the one liner jokes and arguing made up about 60% of the movie! The Avengers also dragged...a lot. Whenever there was no arguing or one liner jokes between the Heros there was a lot boring dialogue from Loki, hawkeye, and black widow on the ship. If you watched the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. It almost put me and the kids in the theater to sleep. It wasn't until the last 30 minutes or so that the movie became interesting to me because it was all non stop action from there. Overall, The Avengers reminded me of  the transformers sequels because they all have a little laughs here and there, boring dialogue, and non stop action in the last minutes of the movie. 2 and half stars for me."

"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"A great superhero movie, Lots action and some generally funny moments, even the Hulk gets a great scene."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,badass an big wow o.O

"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"fair well written, well directed, some good acting made this movie oneof my favs this year, see all these superheroes in one movie was fantastic , taking a few things from the individual movies all the characters came from in a very beliavable way, ending with pure shine and spectacle with action sequences that are unforgettable"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"One of the best comic book movies ever made. I didn't think they could pull it off, but they most definitely did."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,This is one epic action movie.
"Jun 18, 2012",neutral,Evil villain from outer space steals object that can destroy earth. Super heroes band together to stop him. Super heroes win. Many buildings and cars get smashed up in the process. Yawn.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great Fun. Relax and go for the ride.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,will buy it and watch it multiple times
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Best movie I've seen in a long time! Lots of action, and I really enjoyed the comedy!"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"This shows that you can blend big time characters without horrible results, unlike Spiderman 3. The Hulk was finally done right and steals the show. The new standard for comic book movies."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great movie and some fun action
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Who didn't enjoy this movie? It packed with action, superheroes, humor, CGI, damn good acting, and the hunger for more. Justice League better look out."
"Jun 18, 2012",negative,too many talk. need more action
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Outstanding! Edge of your seat fun.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Loved this movie and though my 4yr old knew nothing about the comics he still loved watching it!
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"What you go to the movies for. Great characters pulled out of a comic book and given some dimension. Lots and lots of action, but not too much that you get lost or don't care. Laughter. Witty script (or adlibs?). Very rare I care to see a movie twice in the theatres, but this one I did."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"in the movie iron man we were promised this and if you have been waiting for the avengers in great hope for the past 4 years the you're in luck. as a big fan of the comic books it was great for me and my friends to see this movie at last. this has something for everyone and at least one character you can relate to no matter who you are, you got iron man, hulk, captain america, thor, all these great characters together on the screen and with the way the movie ends leading into what will happen next in the marvel cinematic universe will have half the audience screeming in exitment nd the other half saying ""who the f**k is purple dude. go see this movie you wont regret it"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,awesome movie the #1 action movie i saw all year so far
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,It was so amazing! I loved every moment of it!
"Jun 18, 2012",negative,Could not have been more bored.

"Jun 18, 2012",positive,By far the movie to beat this year is the Avengers......excellent movie based on a comic book.....=0)
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Absolutely loved went to see it like 5 times
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Every once in a while there comes a movie which you can watch over and over again. One of those times.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,I SAW THIS!!! I LOVED IT!!!!!!
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Ok I'm a comic book fan. I wasn't overt thrilled with Thor and Captain America but that's good because hype wise I was expecting good. What I got was genius great. I loved the whole movie. Now I will admit my kids got bored during the ""emotional"" parts of the film where they built up the ties between the team but the last part, about last hour, was a damn roller coaster. It had ups and downs and there was that small chance one of them would die. It was great. The whole movie was a BLAST. Also heard rumors there will be a re-release of the movie with most the stuff that added more emotion and back story, like how Thor got back, to the re-release and will come out in August. I'm probably gonna go see that and hope for an IMAX poster lol. Go watch this though. There's a reason it's made over a billion."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"This movie shows the true unity of marvel superheros in a way that is detailed and right for a great movie like this. with action, comedy and adventure."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Sometimes the hype is bigger than the actual movie, this is not the case. Close to being one of the best superhero movies of all time. I wanted to say something negative about the movie, but I just can't."

"Jun 18, 2012",neutral,"This overrated superhero movie that's had me excited since Ultimate Avengers' release, ended in disappointment after almost two and a half hours of action scenes and special effects. If you want to see this because you liked the Captain America or Iron Man plots, you won't like the Avengers, for there's no scene that makes you think the characters wouldn't succeed in their goal of defeating Loki's army. The 2.5 stars are for the Hulk's funny moments."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Awesome movie seen it twice
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,best comic movie made in years
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,loved it. great action and never a bore. humor adds to the allure. fantastic in 3D. would recommend watching it in 3D. much better that way.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great movie can't wait for number 2.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Was just a great movie.  Even for someone who does not like comics
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,amazing movie need to see i dont even have words to decribe this movie:) perfect cast
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"Checklist for Avengers movie. Okay, here we go. Character development and exposition: Check (done in the individual character's lead-up movies). 4-year build-up: Check. A new actor to play Bruce Banner: Check. Alright then, now, it's time for the Avengers to 'Assemble', squabble amongst themselves a bit, get their team groove on to fight a titanic threat, Fight...and FIGHT some more...with lots of obligatory eye-candy thrown in for good measure (see S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier). I had fun watching ""Marvel's The Avengers"". It was great to see Cap, Shellhead, Thor, and company together on the silver screen doing their thing...quite well I might add. There were some scenes that I especially enjoyed, such as Thor's little tussle with the Hulk. The characters are all faithfully handled - (Mini-Spoiler Alert!) I loved the Hulk's solitary line of dialogue. It's nice indeed to have comic book lover Joss Wheden at the helm. But, on the whole, there were no real suprises for me, and in the arena of 'Big 2' (DC and Marvel) superhero movies the Marvel entries still haven't reached the 'epic' stratosphere for me on an emotional level...not, say, like ""Superman: The Movie"" and Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, which I think aimed/have aimed higher (of the Marvels, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" as well as Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", a movie that many reviled, though not I, have come the closest...and perhaps ""Captain America: The First Avenger""). Make no mistake about it, taken on its own merits, ""The Avengers"" is a good, fun, popcorn movie...and there surely ain't nothin' much wrong with that. But sorry, Marvel - DC's aforementioned iconic characters still own the edge in my book, at least cinematically."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,this is good movie but their us so many hero's movies out their but when we went to see it but of geeky fans where their dressed in Thor and hulk suits °_°
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,The best superhero movie since the dark knight.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Loved it! So exciting! I love the Hulk now.
"Jun 18, 2012",negative,"whoever thinks that this movie has a plot,they need to get their heads tested.the action is sometimes good but im not gonna waste time critising it.shit movie"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"It's all been said, this movie rocks!!! Thor goes toe to toe with the Hulk and holds his own? That's right, he does! Very true to the original comic mythos!"
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Entertainment in full throttle!
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"This weekend Marvel is releasing one of the most anticipated films of the year: the second Avengers film. As we count down the days until launch, I wanted to review the original film that had fan boys drooling all over themselves. It's no secret that many consider this movie to be, ""the greatest comic book film of all time''. I do not necessarily agree, but this is a damn fun movie to say the least. ""The Avengers'' is directed by Joss Whedon and boasts an incredible all star cast: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johanson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, and Samuel L. Jackson.

Early in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Tesseract was introduced. In this film, it is the crown jewel. The long lost god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is up to no good. When he is brought to Earth by the power of the Cube, he yearns to rule over the pathetic human race. Loki's plan is to bring an army from outer space and subdue the Earth. He needs the Cube to do so. However, he may be in a little over his head. Nick Fury (Jackson) a member of the S.H.I.E.L.D program, is assembling a team of Earth's mightiest heroes. Captain America (Evans), Iron Man (Downey), Black Widow (Johanson)--good lord--, The Incredible Hulk (Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Renner), and the god of thunder, Thor (Hemsworth). Together, these Avengers must fight for the people of Earth, and thwart the puny god's plan. They only have to learn to work together first.

When your making a superhero team up movie, you have to have the right cast. They have to work well together, be likable, and they have to be people you root for. This film accomplishes these three things perfectly. The chemistry between these characters and actors is unparalleled. Chris Evans--who everyone loves now as Cap--leads the team in the battle to save Earth. Downey and Ruffalo's characters work amazingly well together. the two of them share multiple scenes, all of which are great. Captain America and Iron Man obviously bash heads with each other. They are polar opisates of one another. It was great watching the banter between everyone, but especially those two. What I think was so impressive about the characters--despite the shallow character development--was just how well the writing picked at who they are as characters. Iron Man's flaws are brought up, and so are the Captain's. It was brilliant writing, and I applaud Whedon on this. Honestly, the only characters they were pushed to the side were Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Unfortunately, Hawkeye lovers may feel upset at how little he's in this film. Thor is not really a big part of the movie either. Black Widow is there more than both combined, there just isn't much for them to do character wise. However, each does get their own great little moments, so the script doesn't completely forget them.

So far we have very good performances, so let's move on to the filmmaking standpoint. Joss Whedon hasn't made many films at all. He has written and directed a few television shows however. I'll be honest, as a director, I don't love Whedon. When I think of iconic directors, his name never comes to mind. From a writing standpoint, Whedon is fantastic. The script--while not deep and somewhat shallow--is full of fantastic dialogue and witty banter. The humor is always present, and is always fresh. I wouldn't recommend watching this film over and over however. I think some of the humor becomes dull after to many viewings. Personally, I would watch it sparingly so as not to become annoyed with the humor. If you watch it once or twice a year, it's great. Moving on, we have some great sets. It's blatantly obvious allot was put into the impressive set pieces. They are very well crafted and made with care. However, the horrible cinematography makes the sets look to much like sets. If there is one major criticism, it's definitely the camera work. The film was shot by Seamus McGarvey, a praised cinematographer who has won awards and been nominated multiple times. His work here however is just nasty. There are many ugly dutch angle shots, and plenty of awkward shots that are at awkward angles, just to show off the sets. The result is that the camera work looks too much like a reality television show, and the sets look like sets sometimes.

Not surprisingly, the action mostly delivers very well. I must praise the visual effects department for their incredible work. The CGI looks--most of the time--stunning. It does hurt knowing there aren't many piratical effects. Sadly, allot of it is just fake CGI. However, it does look very sleek so it somewhat makes up for the fakeness. Watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film. Admittedly, Whedon does a great job bringing these heroes together. I admire him for that, seeing as that is a very difficult task to accomplish. Seeing these guys interact-whether it be when they are quarreling or working together--was a joy.

Amidst all of this greatness, there are flaws. Every film, even the great masterpieces of cinema have flaws. The Avengers has a very shallow plot. Motivations of the characters aren't fully realized, whilst the villains motives are clearly painted. The film doesn't develop it's characters very much, but rather lets the stand alone films do this instead. Towards the end, the action goes into Transformers territory. I still cringe at the Dark of the Moon alien war machines. There are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film. I fear that if we removed the witty one liners and action, the film would fall apart. However, there are brief moments where the film hints at themes that aren't really exploited like they should be. ""People need a little bit of old fashioned'', is a line delivered by Colseson. A noble theme, that unfortunately is lost amidst the flurry of explosions and jokes. There is a great line delivered by Loki, ""you were made to be ruled'', which is possibly the most powerful theme in the entire movie. I think this is what kept the film together. The idea of a god that wants to rule over and subdue, much like the totalitarian rulers of the past--and present in North Korea-- is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble. If we take out the jokes and action, that core theme stands there and saves the movie.

""The Avengers'' is what everyone hoped it would be: fun, funny, and full of action. Watching this team on screen together was amazing. The chemistry is there, the humor is ever present, and the action is fun. The direction is solid, the writing is brilliant, the performances are great, and the sets are well made. Despite how shallow the plot is, and despite all the shortcomings under the surface, this is a wildly fun film that everyone can enjoy."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a nerd's wet dream come true. No director knows comic books like Joss Whedon. The tone of the film is perfect; it's humorous throughout but has juuust enough seriousness so that we care about the story and characters. The set pieces are brilliant and just about every actor brings something great to the table. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's executed SO well that I can't help but love every minute of it."
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,The perfect summer movie.
"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Best super heroes movie so far!!!!!

"Jun 18, 2012",positive,Great Movie...The Best I have seen!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"The 5(?)-year culmination of Marvel's superhero film universe, 'Marvels's The Avengers' represents arguably the biggest (and riskiest) attempt at franchise domination since Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' series. 'The Avengers' has also been considered the only major competition of the Caped Crusader in terms of box office success. It seems it is Marvel vs. DC once again.

But back to the actual film. 'The Avengers' is a superb and expertly-crafted action movie that fires on all cylinders and hits on every beat. Pacing is excellent here and the film is clearly divided into three distinct acts. Aside from the action (which is expectantly exciting, fun, and not too cheesy), the dialogue, courtesy of writer/director Joss Whedon is sharp, witty, and, when coming from the mouth of Robert Downey Jr., especially funny. There are a few plot holes and character-power inconsistencies to speak of, but overall these are minor complaints compared to strong story and character arcs present in the film. I only wish all mega-blockbusters were this good. 'The Avengers' lives up to the hype."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a fellow Fanboy.. Nuff said.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Such a great movie from beginning to end :D
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,it was a good movie combining all superheros

"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Funny and packed with action.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Lots of action and action heroes but not really any point to movie other than to show case stars.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,my whole family loved it
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,I have got to say that this is one of my favorite movie of all time. They did a great job with the witty character of Tony Stark and also with the witty comebacks that people would have to have to go against him.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Had a great and fun time while watching the movie. Robert Downey did one hell of a job
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Avengers Assemble !!!!! that is I am going to say and all I have to say
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Everything I wanted it to be!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,awsome and hilarious
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Takes its own direction while remaining true to the spirit of the comics. This is right up there with the best of the super hero flicks.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Really one of the best movies I have ever seen..
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,The Hulk and Iron Man stoled the show!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"The best Marvel movie no hands down, they did a great job with the direction. The Hulk was actually badass and funny at the same time, Mark did a way better job that Edward Norton and Eric Bana. Even Thor was badass and way better in this than his own solo movie. I cant wait to see what Marvel (Disney) does next."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,It was better than I thought it would be!  We all enjoyed it although our daughter thought it was too loud.  She would have preferred watching it at home where we can control the volume.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,See it for great fun.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Got it in 3d it's a long movie..
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,everything was great! except SHIELD's flying fortress...propellers??really??

"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Awsome superhero movie, cant wait for the sequel"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Simply....AWESOME!!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"I'm not saying that this was the ""best"" in the Marvel series. But, I'm still glad I saw it in the theater."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"This movie is just amazing! The acting, CGI, and other affects were just amazing! Please watch it if you have the time, trust me it's totally worth it! :D"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Masterfully put together and leaving a hopeful path for a next one. The movie clearly shows each superheroes personality and how it conflicts with one another, plus the superheroes own agenda."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"It is awesome ! Hope they make more of them! 
Ps- Thor is hot!"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This movie was awesome 4 years was definitely worth the wait
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,funny plus action can't beat that!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,In my opinion this movie is overrated. The action is its strong point. But the movie had some feeble comedy attempts which really i do not think worked out. The acting was quite mediocre except for Robert Downey jr. Mark ruffalo was a present surprise as the hulk though other than that the plot was flawed and hard to understand you really don't know what's going on with Loki before the time of the movie.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This movie was spectacular!! The acting was phenomenal and the action sequences were quite intriguing. Love it and would definitely see it again :)
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This movie was far the best team up I have ever seen.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,The best movie after the hunger games
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I have ever seen.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Jim is giving this movie 5 stars (me 4,5 ).  Loved the interaction between the characters.  I really want  to see Captain  America now."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,It was practically every type of movie BUT horror and romance
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This was an awesome movie if you are into Marvel superheroes. I recommend  watching it.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This movie was funny and full  of action. I loved it. I give it an A+. Must see. I am going back to see it again.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,It is refreshing to see a superhero film made by a comic book / film geek.  Whedon gets it right.  Just enough additional character development mixed with classic marvel humor.  The visuals ate tight without looking forced.  Considering the director worked with a cast chosen by previous films he did an amazing job of creating cohesion.
"Jun 17, 2012",neutral,"Loved the action, wasn't keen on the storyline. Mainly enjoyed it for Chris Hemsworth."
"Jun 17, 2012",negative,"Fell asleep during the movie, woke up to a funny moment... ""puny god"". That's the extra half point."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Me and my family miss the beginning before they showed the title, I honestly love Hulk he was so funny. The fact that they took the characters from pervious movies and they still kept the people who played them, I know it's not a big deal but it is. I'm so glad they showed the ending and left u guessing such a good idea"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,i think this movie was amazing the best one i have seen it was also very funny and it shows that no matter how different they were they were able to team work they did have some difficultys but it all worked good i hope they make advengers 2 or something ^_^ :-)
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"A review for this movie really isn't necessary. Only 1 problem: invisible flying aircraft carriers, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"FREAKING amazing!   Have seen it twice, going to see it again before it leaves theatres.   Great action, nice humor, loved the two 'bonus' scenes at the very, very end of the credits...."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"BEST MOVIE EVER, can't wait for the next one. I hope they add the Wasp and Giant Man."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,EPIC.... MOVIE.... EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,best movie I have seen thusfar
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,great movie near perfect laugh out loud loved it
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,love love love. glad I watched them all before seeing this.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"This movie was action packed, hilariously funny, and extremely entertaining. So glad I saw it."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Just a quick review this time.  A well put together film which doesn't completely insult the audiences intelligence (those that have it anyway) and will also please the switch-the-brain-off, popcorn eating masses.  A good action film with thorough character development and not an overemphasis on just one or two characters.  If you enjoy movies that mix standard blockbuster special effects,  action, etc as well as good direction and smart storytelling then check this out."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Nothing mind-blowing, no amazing story line or plot. The comedy in the movie makes everything worthwhile."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"It's pointless at this stage to write a review on The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble for Brits). It has now become the third highest grossing movie of all time and has received almost unanimous critical acclaim for being the no holds bar, action packed summer blockbuster that we've all been waiting for. More importantly, it represents a resounding success for the now 4 year long build up that consisted of 5 theatrical features that represented origins for a collection of super heroes that are now able to finally throw down together. Comic book fans obviously love this movie. But even myself, not being a comic reader, would find it extremely hard to find fault in what is a more or less flawless recreation of the Marvel superheroes on screen and the best comic book adaptation to date, in the purest sense of the word.

The story deals with the God of mischeif, Loki, continuing his pursuit of the all powerful Tesseract energy source, which will allow him to unleash an extraterrestrial army onto the Earth that will ravage it and subjugate humantity to his leadership. Not being successful in protecting the Tesseract, the high tech government funded organisation SHIELD now needs to harness the combined forces of the Earth's greatest superheroes to fight the common enemy and save the world; Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and the Hulk. Being able to reign in such massive forces of nature and heroism, however, turns out to be a much harder exercise than once thought.

Joss Whedon, the fanboy writer who's had several high profile projects under his name, deserves massive credit for reigning in a film that juggles a big, larger than life cast of super heroes, all of which have their fans to please off the screen, and their own personal stories and journies to allude to on the screen. Directing and writing, he balances the film just right, allowing all the players their time to shine, giving them enough time to grow an attachment to the audience and to perform all their heroic, special effects laden derring do in ways only the best summer blockbusters deliver. Whedon both treats his subjects with due respect while also having fun with them. Some of the best moments in the film deal with the various members of the team meeting up for the first time and inevitably coming to blows with each other due to their various insecurities about themselves and everyone around them; the collective egos have a hard time letting each other breath when they fight for space. This leads to moments of hilarity and dramatic weight, all combining to create a cast of highly volatile yet likeable individuals. This is important for any massive action movie like this to get right, since when we get to the smackdowns, we're invested in what's happening to everyone, which in turn raises the tension and excitement. Otherwise, its just pointless audio/visual noise.

All the performances are fine, even though some characters end up having a lesser impression than others due to the structure of the story. The two standouts are for one the always great Robert Downey Junior, who steals scenes effortlessly as Tony Stark/Iron Man, even though he's perhaps downplayed a little more than in his own movie. The other is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, the newcomer amongst the group as the Banner character has gone through the rockiest changes of all in his cinematic history. Being the third to play the role theatrically, Ruffalo nails the meek, awkward but blazingly intelligent Bruce Banner, someone who fights to hold back the rage that boils within, but has also learnt to control it for good. Another welcome angle is that the Hulk alter ego is also played by Ruffalo through motion capture, allowing the actor to play the full spectrum of his character's attributes. The others carry on from their previous outings without a break and deliver where it counts.

Any faults with the movie mainly pertain to nitpicks and personal preferences. For what it is, The Avengers is near flawless. It does exactly what a movie like this needs to do to work and work well. Anyone interested in this kind of movie will not be disappointed. My problems mainly have to do with the limits of a movie of this nature. By its nature, big superhero mashup films like this are going to suffer from length and an overabundance of action and visuals on the screen. On the whole, the film doesn't feel long for its almost 2 hours and 30 minutes running time, but there were moments, particularly during the action scene in the middle and during the massive climactic one, where the film dragged and it felt like it was just running on auto-pilot, with everyone fighting an ongoing army of generic looking aliens, or eating up time having to perform a certain task integral to the plot. Plus, as is the case for an action blockbuster, particularly one that has so many characters, emotional attachments or an edge of the seat sense of peril and danger aren't really present here, neither are there any provokative ideas to think about (there are some contemporarily based points about manufacturing WMD's and renewable energy thrown around briefly). The emphasis is mainly to give the characters space to set themselves up for a huge fight, while intercutting their personal relationships with each other. It works fine for what it is, but it doesn't reach anywhere further. Plus it could be said that while the visual effects and action are all first rate, nothing about them stuns you. It's all delivered with workmanlike efficiency, letting the action taking place to breathe on its own, shot smoothly and coherently. It does what it needs to do, nothing more.

Ultimately, The Avengers is exactly what you'd want from a movie like this, delivering on all cylinders. It's a testament to Joss Whedon's direction and writing that he makes delivering a movie of this quality look so easy. It successfully shows up all the lackluster, lazy, amateurish attempts at action blockbusters that plague cinemas nowadays. With the massive success of this film, hopefully others will step up their games and try harder to deliver the goods. This is unadulterated, summer movie madness at its best, a pure beast that has no pretentions for anything else but to entertain. And it does it really, really well."

"Jun 17, 2012",positive,a must see best action film 2012 best comic book film to date
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Amazing. Cool, fun, funny and lotsa crazy good action! SEE IT"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Some cheesy moments, but overall great movie. Could have spent a little more time explaining the Hulks new ability to control his anger and transform when he feels like it but by far the best hulk smash movie to date. The other characters were great. Great action, awesome plot. I can't wait for the next one."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,epic as usual. I love how all the other movies were tied in.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Goig to see it again!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Flippin' OUTSTANDING!!  I had my doubts that they would be able to maintain the action as well as coordinate the connections between the various team members, but they did it without drawing it out through several sequels.  There was even some well-placed an well timed comedy thrown in.  I was also impressed that they were able to introduce and bring level two fairly new characters (Hawk-eye and Black Widow) without the story or other characters suffering."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Great film. Would I watch it over and over again? Eh, I'm not sure. I've already seen it twice in theaters (it was REALLY good) but I'm not sure It's one I would choose to buy and re-watch like the individual heroes' films. It definitely has its classic moments as well as some dull even cliche ones. Overall, though, I think it would be difficult for any superhero movie fanatic not to love this flick. Truly enjoyable and definitely worth seeing."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Best movie of the year.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Perfect Movie Luved it!!!!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Great movie! lots of action and very funny! great movie all around. didn't spend too much time on one character!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"I didn't see all the prequels to this, but didn't need to in order to understand all the Avengers.  Movie had humor, adventure, and good effects."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"See all the iron man movies, the newest hulk, Captain America, and Thor before seeing this movie will help you understand all the events in this movie."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Wow... I can see this one again, and again, and... When's the DVD out??"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,The movie to which all other action movies will be compared
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is an interesting, entertaining and well-made movie. It has that balance between a drama and an action movie. It's unpredictable, funny and clever."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Love it a must see over and over lol
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"""You really put a lid on it.  What's your secret?  Mellow jazz?  Bongo drums?  A big bag of weed?"""
"Jun 17, 2012",neutral,"Totally mediocre.  Way over hyped.  Some comical moments, a good action scene at the end, but I spent most of the movie being bored.  I think it's high ratings are a classic example of people forcing themselves to like something that they had high expectations for."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,This the best and the best and the best
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Was a really great movie!! Kinda could have done with out all the quiet moments of just jibber jabber. The action rocked!!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Fantastic story combined with wonderful special effects make this film teriffic
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"If only all summer movie going fare was on caliber with this film. A vastly entertaining film about the power of a community made up of powerful people. Full of deeply human moments as well as crowd pleasing superhuman ones, Joss Whedon has delivered the finest super hero film next to The Dark Knight."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Fun, but certainly not something I would watch twice, still, it works in with the rest of the never ending series...and Scarlett Johansson is still hot! :)  The hulk is the only standout really."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,this movie rocked my socks!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,awsome well done. go hulk
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"When I first heard of this movie, I was curious to see if Marvel could pull it off.  Well, they did it with flying colors.        Looking forward to the sequel."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,i loved the movie ... Kept me interested till the very end!!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Saw this wen it came out. Effin awesome! Saw it 5x!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. If you haven't seen this, RUN, don't walk to go watch it today.  Funny, action packed, really good plot - it has everything a summer movie should."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"There are two movie adaptations that Hollywood needs to set as their templates for success in the future. The Dark Knight is one, for its gritty film noir-esque take on the Batman franchise, and The Avengers is the other, for its masterful concentration on character dialogue and story while still being able to bring in sci-fi entertainment such as superpowers and aliens."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,fun with some humor. The movie keeps you interested and you don't notice the near 2 and half hours fly bye
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,My favorite movie of all time!
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,very good action scenes
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Yeah, big studio, big smash 'em, but a great load of fun!"
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Loved it! Action, humor, story, it was all there. Made me go back to my childhood marvel books. Very entertaining, awaiting the next one..."
"Jun 17, 2012",neutral,"I've seen this film 4 or 5 times now and every time I do I find something else to not like about it. :/

First of all, it's extremely messy and way too crowded. Joss Whedon did the best he could. I'm convinced if anyone else had directed Avengers it would have been a complete wash. There is very little character development and an extremely thin plot that deals with the tesseract opening up a portal to allow an army of faceless chitari warriors in to take over the earth...That's it. 

The film suffers from having to establish characters and mythos in a very short space of time. It felt disjointed and out of place amongst the other movies that take place in the Marvel cinematic universe. As a popcorn blockbuster it is awesome and fun. But for me the Avengers is a severe disappointment.

Here's hoping Joss and the team can build from it and produce something more impressive for Avengers 2."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Not as good as it could have been.
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Nearly everything works in this perfect popcorn movie.  The all-star cast is a joy to watch, and they have plenty to work with thanks to Joss Whedon."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Fantastic super-hero film. Perfectly executed, laughs, action and Samuel L. Jackson with an eye patch. All the Elements there."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,"Its FILLED with action, also a dash of humor. Most of all, has a great story-line."
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,Such an exciting funny movie I loved it and would watch it again in a heartbeat
"Jun 17, 2012",positive,It is nice to see good scripted movie with a blend of witty banter.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best movie I have ever seen in my life.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"best marvel superhero movie... funny, smart, entertaining, interesting, well-acted, action packed 2 and 1/2 hrs."
"Jun 16, 2012",neutral,"at this point i've had my fix with superheroes...joss has a great comedic voice but all in all I found this movie long, arduous, predictable and...long."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Nice hodgepodge of characters and convincing, but the CGI and constant noise dulled ones senses.
Always love the little scenes after the credits."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Fast paced and action packed ""The Avengers"" epitomises what having fun at the movies is all about. The quintessential summer blockbuster!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Wow just amazing, funny scenes as well. Im planning to see it again but this time in imax 3D. Hell of a movie here"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"i thought it was... ok, kind of a weaker plot compared to the other hero movies ive seen."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Everything I hoped it would be!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,This movie is so epic and amazing seen it 3 times and getting it on blue ray
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,A must see for this summer.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Noticeable bloopers, Still a movie I'll enjoy for years to come! Thanks Stan Lee for sharing your world with us!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Great movie!  Enjoyed the plot and filled with action.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"The MOST AMAZING MOVIE EVER! I absolutely loved this movie!! It's up there with The Dark Knight as best super hero movie of all time. I was laughing, sad, and all other emotions at once. Had some of the coolest action, effects, etc EVER! Even if you don't like super heroes watch it. Even if
You dont like action, watch it. Even
If you have no desire to watch this, watch it. It's that good."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Saw this one in IMAX 3D. I really enjoyed this movie, it was an fun ride almost from beginning to end."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Best of the Marvel movies!!  I believe introducing all of the characters in their own movies aided in the flow of the film, there was no need for extensive, film consuming character development."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Predictable, but carries a strong cast and is quite entertaining"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Just see it. Wonderful balance of characters, comedy, and drama. Loved it and will own it."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Good but slow in the beginning
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Phenomenal movie to start the summer with! I although wish I would have gone to the bathroom before watching. I found myself scavenging for a spot where the plot to slowed down but there was none. The Avengers was funny, fast, entertaining and action-packed.

I never got bored. Needless to say I had to run to the bathroom like Flash exiting the theater. I would have joined The Avengers but they don't seem to be quite fond of Flash."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,had a blast with my niece watching this movie....
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"The Marvel fan in me thought it was awesome, and the kid in me wanted to go buy an Iron Man action figure afterward."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"It was okay; lots of action, but nothing new."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I think this was a great movie it was very exciting but the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because now if they make another movie with one of those characters it will seem boring compared to this one. So bad planing ahead but it was a good summer selling block buster I liked how it wasn't all we don't like each other because were super heros this was a great movie, it's amazing."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Best action movie in quite some time, with some very memorable moments, liked hulk and iron man's characterization"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Good old-fashioned fun in the mighty Marvel manner.  The action is entertaining and coherent, the comedic bits are just right and the acting is above-average.  Robert Downey Jr. is great as always playing Iron Man, and Chris Evans really impressed me as Captain America.  I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon but I have to give him credit for pulling this off."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Anytime you bring together a handful of a comic nerd's favorite characters for a movie, he's going to be partial.  Watching the Avengers was a dream come true for a guy who waited 30 plus years to see it onscreen.  The Hulk was awesome and Mark Ruffalo grew on me, and I was very skeptical.  Robert Downey Jr.was amazing as Tony Stark once more.  It was also great to see each hero get his 5 minutes of special time on screen.  Still the film was not perfect.  There was a long period of little action in the middle of the movie, and some of the origin and character setup may be too much for non comic book movie goers."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,I loved it one of the best marvel movies and superhero movie!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Absolutely a most see!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best movie ever!!!!! Funny and packed with action.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I loved it! this is by far the best super hero ever made as it has everything a super hero movie needs action,some witty humor,an all star cast, and great CGI."
"Jun 16, 2012",negative,I didn't like the movie.  Too much CGI.  Everything is CGI.  The comics were never written with such catastrophic nonsense.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best of all Team Avenger movies!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Everything a summer movie should be. It deserves every penny it has made at the box office.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,The best film I've seen this summer
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Good albeit predictable.  I thought the main villain was disrespected a little too much to really be taken seriously.  It was awfully exciting seeing so many protagonists from different movies thrown together.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Finally, a movie that delivered exactly what it said on the tin. Minus .5 points for occasionally poor CGI."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Great cast that performed beautifully. Great script with tons of lines that are memorable.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I can see why this movie broke the box office records soeasily! It's a non stop action packed thrill ride from beginning to end! And the cat is so star packed it's insane! And there's enough comedy to keep everybody entertained, so go as it if you haven't and go see it again if you did.. It's definitely the movie of the summer!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Fun, but redundant. How many different ways and for how long can you watch them display their super fighting powers before it gets boring?  I DID like Robert Downy, though. He was hilarious. I understood this movie better once I saw Thor. Think I would have liked it better if I had seen ANY of the super hero movies first."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Perfect. 
Besides not having Edward norton"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Fun action entertainment!  Hulk needed a bigger role!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Humor, action and a few tense moments combined with a great set of actors (and Joss Whedon) made this a suprisingly great fucking movie!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,absolutely awesome!!!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Very surprised to totally enjoy this :)
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best Movie of the Year...
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Very action filled and great!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Me and my son went to watch this epic movie we both thought it was excellent the effects were out of this world if you are a marvel fan this is a must see you and your kids will be talking about it for weeks. All I can say is hulk smash
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,The absolute best movie I've ever seen. There are small little jokes implanted in the movie. Never a dull moment.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,It was fab got my copy ordered for September
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"The Avengers lives up to my expectations. It gives the audience a two and a half hour thrill ride and doesn't forget to add a bit of plot here and there. Although the climax was a bit disappointing, the Avengers does it's job. The major problem I had with the film was Loki. He seemed tough, then weak, then tough again. The whole alien invasion was overused and predictable. Avengers had good action and humour but not good story."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"The movie was amazing from the first minute to the last. The movie had the suspense like no other and was full of extraordinary surprises. The Avengers had so much action and a few moments of comedy. I also think the actors were perfect for their characters. The actors were Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlette Johanson as Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo as The Incredible Hulk. I highly recommend this film due to its stupendous acting,incredible action and awesome graphics. The Avengers is a movie I would definently see again."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Loved it, funny, all great heros, villian"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,This is a very fun movie. Don't leave the kids at home.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,the best movie from marvel
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Presently surprised!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,seen it really good in 3-D
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Effin Robert Downey Jr is the man! The plot was like whatever but it was assembled pretty well felt like a $200million movie.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,One of the strongest Superhero movies ever.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,fantastic - the impressive cast make it perfect
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Save for Captain America, this was the best of the Marvel movies so far. Sure, the storyline was, well, barely a storyline; but in a film like this, it really doesn't need one. The enthralling action and too-cool-for-school characters really did make this an enjoyable film to watch, especially via stereoscopic vision courtesy of IMAX! Terrific stuff."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Great film... impressed with the way they squeezed in enough story to address all of the heros without shortening anyones story too much.Some cheesy moments but great overall.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,In 3D it was really good. Loved seeing all the characters on one screen.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Loved, loved, loved this movie!!!  I just don't understand the importance of Scarlett Johansson role: other than eye candy (that is subjective).  Other than that, the cast played really well off each other.  As always, Robert Downey Jr.'s acting  rocked.  Along with Mark Ruffalo."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,who has seen this movie if so how good was it
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,awesome movie. definitely a must buy
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,The comedic timing throughout was perfect.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Comedic relief saves this movie. Horrendous hollywood scripting of course increases the tackiness, saved by Robert Downey JR's lovable quick wit. The enemy army couldn't of been less scary. Never seemed as though The Avengers or the world were in any kind of harm. Film time seemed to be the only reason The Avengers hadn't already won."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Literally.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Fantastic!  Had lots of humor as well as the typical summer explosions.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Very Good. What more can be said? VERY Good! Though Scarlett Johansson russian speaking was rather offensive. I hate that americans assume that east europeans are just another form of white.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,worthy of 3-D!! Excellent
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Action packed, great special effects from start to finish."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Because of movies like this 3D Cinema was invented. Big action fun.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Better than expected
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Excellent in just about every way. Except 3D. That was unnecessary.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Amazing action. Has some comedy.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a movie that kicks into high gear from the get-go, and it doesn't stop there! A rarity in summer blockbusters of recent years: a well-acted, well-shot superhero movie that is smart enough to balance fun adventure, genius wit and a terrific & sometimes dramatic story!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I absolutely loved watching this one. The only element marring it's entertainment value is the fact that it draws from the Thor, Hulk, Ironman and Captain America movies, none of which I've seen. It's still a great movie that I would very highly recommend seeing. STAY UNTIL THE VERY END (AFTER the second set of credits)."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,I require a good bad guy to enjoy a movie and Loki was extremely lacking in this movie especially compared to his performance in Thor in which he seemed powerful and played mind games.  That said the avengers team was a joy to watch.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Marvel's The Avengers is a very good movie.  I recommend to go watch it.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Fantastic film, perhaps the best super-hero movie of all time."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Great movie. All movies tied in well
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Hands down the best marvel film to date, and one of the best action films of the last decade. Exceeded my expectations in every way."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,One of the best comic book movies!  So much fun.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie, not much of a plot but doesn't need one. The previous marvel movies had all the backstory so this one could start fast and finish faster."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,by far the best action pack flim....
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Surprised how much I enjoyed it...
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Superb imagery, combined with compelling action, with subtle hints of comical devices."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I want more awesome movie!, lots of action!, lots of superheros!, lots of bad guys!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Fun, exciting, the time flew by! Can't wait for more installments of this franchise!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,What a fun summer movie. All the comic book movies of recent years wrapped into one. And you can't go wrong with Robert Downey Jr.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,awesome movie....funny a must see movie for any Marvel buff
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Awesome Movie. A Must See!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Excellent an overall blast go see with your friends.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Truly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time! There was a slight lack of depth to anything beyond the exterior of smoke and mirrors effects, and at points the suspense they are trying to build falls flat. Overall a great film, and definitely my favorite so far this year."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Marvel's The Avengers was a fantastic compilation of some of the greatest heroes in modern history. I was slightly worried going into the film wondering if each hero would be given an appropriate amount of screen time and if the film would show favor to one hero or another. I was pleasantly surprised to see that each hero was given his or her due and the chemistry displayed between them was nothing short of brilliant. Of course RDJ stole the show for most of the movie with his quick-whited humor, but each character displayed why they were an integral part of the marvel universe. If anyone reading this has not gone to enjoy this film, I highly suggest it...maybe the best superhero movie of all time (save the dark knight of course)."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,I loved the movie... But if your not a Marvel Fan.. Stay away!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Awesome movie! Loved it!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"I was expecting to be moderately entertained by another League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, as I think Captain America, Iron Man 2, and Thor did a good job on lowering my expectations. Instead it was a grand time with a fun villain, solid writing and performances, and was extremely entertaining. The Avengers was a perfect balance of the basic storytelling elements of plotting, action and character. Admittedly that's a good thing for an ensemble this big. Whedon did the right thing, making simple character interaction the bulk of the film. There were some pretty well played fight scenes in there - Loki's first capture, Thor fighting Iron Man, but the best parts came from Banner and Stark interacting, Loki's relationship with Thor, Black Widow doing reverse interrogations, and of course the all around genuinely funny one liners. The fact that Whedon was able to balance each of the superheroes, both in their motivations and in their style of action in a massive franchise film like this with a coherent plot and ample stakes, is pretty impressive. It's kind of sad that this brilliant man has had to wait so long to be handed a big-budget film. I also loved the casting of Ruffalo as Hulk. This was definitely the best representation of Banner/Hulk I have seen and the best thing I will take from this film is hoping that there will be a Ruffalo stand-alone Hulk film."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,my new all time favorite movie.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"The movie was fun and creative, but the only downside to me, was that it was too slow."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Joss is my hero. This is now one of my all-time favs! Loved it!!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Very well done and so funny too.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Just to throw my 2 cents in, yep, as far as comic book super hero movies go, it pretty much rocks.

Sure, if you take about 3 seconds (maybe less) to pick it apart, it's full of ridiculousness (really, it's not a true story?) and predictability.  But whatever, for a Saturday afternoon popcorn flick, it totally delivers.  I'm sure there will be a sequal (or 8) and I'll be there to see it/them."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,was a really good movie
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"It was the best movie I've ever seen because it was funny,well made,and had the best actors and the best charaters"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"great movie! most of it was very funny with lots of action, as well as a good storyline!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,exceptionally action packed! I like single hero movies better because the storyline can develop better and the characters have deeper personalities but this still caught my attention
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"All you Joss Whedon fans will enjoy this movie.  Our audiende was cracking up at his very witty humor, and it is fun."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,great fun love this movie it. bring back the fun of going to a movie!!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Best comic book movie to date! Epic film
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Mind-blowing non-stop action.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"It's the second best Super Hero movie behind The Dark Knight. Assembling all of the guys for such a huge movie could have gone very bad, and it was exactly the opposite. From beginning to end, it was about as perfect as you can make a movie of this genre. Had Heath Ledger not turned in one of the best acting performances of all time, regardless of genre for The Dark Knight, this one would reign supreme. 

My biggest concern was how they brought in Mark Ruffalo to play Hulk. He was flawless, so much so that this movie indeed is better off without Edward Norton. Being able to say that is a damn fine compliment to the movie. 

Should eclipse the $600,000,000 domestic mark. Probably end up around $1,500,000,000 internationally."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,the best superhero movie ever made.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"This movie was fun, with lots of great one liners - both visual and vocal!"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Love love loved it!!
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,A personal childhood dream comes true as Joss Whedon directs this star-studded adventure flick of Marvel's Mightiest Heroes. WOW.
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,best movie of the summer
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Crowd pleaser, show stopper, brilliant set-pieces, epic one-liners, kickass humor; all concocted together to make this a winning formula. 
Note: But it ain't no Nolan superhero film."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"Done well 
Great cast 
Should've been longer though"
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,"This is the best superhero of all time.
I really love it."
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Must See Movie Two Thumbs Up :)
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,Great mix of action and humour...
"Jun 16, 2012",positive,One of the best movies of the year.
"Jun 16, 2012",neutral,"Not all that impressed, but I'm not sure why I thought I would be when half this movie is based on failed franchises. And, the Iron Man crew can only take up a certain amount of time intriguing us before the other interwoven failed characters confuse us by trying to fit squares into circles. They just don't work; an uncontrollable rage monster and a powerless propaganda agent have no place with superheroes."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Just about the coolest movie ever!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,best movie of the year! loved every minute of it.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Poor storyline with frequent dull dialogues compensated by a stellar cast, some great timed humor and action. For me -  Hulk stole the show!!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"this movie redifine how to do comic book movies.  I see a lot of up and coming movie directors studying this one to see how the story telling, acting worked just right for years."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,The king of superhero movies.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"This movie was perfect summer escapism. A wonderful mix of action, comedy and character. Great script, sets and overall production. Do not miss this movie."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Best movie in a long time!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,It's Thor part 2. Very good and the Hulk wins the Oscar!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Plain and simple the greatest super hero movie of all time
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"am entertained. I think that is just about it. :P
Thor and Captain America are hopeless/helpless .... they should not have existed in the first place. Ugh.
My eyes wandered towards Hawk-eye, Hulk, and Loki....in fact, Loki still has the most interesting story behind."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"If I could give more stars, I would.this movie is simple amazing. Whedon did an amazing job. I am a comic book person and although I was slightly disappointed with the fact that ant-man/giant-man and wasp were replaced, as soon add I saw the movie I instantly didn't mind. No matter who you are, you must see this movie. Do not believe the nay-sayers."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,LOVED the actors the whole movie actiony so awesome XD :)
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Pretty entertaining and full of action... the story line was ok
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,i loved this movie. i have always been a marvel fan...and to have them all together is awesome. i cant wait to see it again.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,seen this at the drive in great edge of your seat laughing the whole time
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,As complete a film as you are going to get with such a large cast of main characters.  That is to say it excels at it.  Satisfying yet still a sense of more to come.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Awesome, Amazing, definitely recommened & funny throughout..held my atention :)"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Now THAT'S how you make an action film. Terrific special effects, plenty of funny one-liners and lots of bangs, booms, whirs, zips, whooshes and kathunks. I especially appreciated the kathunks. Overall, the entire series (thus far) was awesome, and this was a worthy tube of icing. I'm waiting impatiently for more.

Thor: ""Have care how you speak! Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother.""
Natasha: ""He killed 80 people in two days.""
Thor: ""He is adopted."""
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Definitely the best superhero movie. The screenplay itself is entertaining. You add up the special effects and other CGIs, then this becomes the superhero movie of the year!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,exactly as advertised! awesome.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,I grew up as a kid watching Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  My kids will grow up watching the Avengers!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"best movie i've seen all year, best superhero movie period. AWESOME"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,This movie could never live up to expectations but it sure tried its best to. An edge of your seat thriller to the very end with a cast of characters that were made to fill the shoes of their respected hero or heroine. Robert Downey Jr. was always an exceptional pick to play Iron Man but until this movie I hadn't exactly found an Iron Man movie that really lived up to the hype. That all changed in this movie as he rocked that Iron Man suit and  willed this movie to greatness. Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Evans were also fabulous in this movie. Even the Hulk had a few great one liners. Tom Hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time misguided and misunderstood Loki. His ability to make Loki into someone you love and despise at the same time is brilliant. The plot was excellent and to this point the best superhero movie ever made.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Whilst its not one of Marvels better films, Avengers opens new doors in the Super Hero universe.The AVnegers is filled with superb acting, especially by Mark Ruffalo, brilliant visuals, and great camera work, but it cannot save the film from its rather pedestrian plot."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,The Avengers was a pleasure to watch and the storyline was complete. This movie is everything a superhero movie should be!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"it was ok, definetely overrated"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Whedon manages to juggle an enormous cast effortlessly, making us understand each character and their motivations. The film would have a hard time standing on its own without the previous entries, or at least would lose a lot of the fun. Much has been said about Mark Ruffalo's Hulk/Banner, and he is the standout of the film, especially considering how many times the Hulk has been done wrong. The third act threatens to collapse under its own weight but somehow manages to stay afloat despite itself. Pure fun."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,I love this movie!!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Action filled, it exceeded my expectations."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Awesome movie. How could it be bad??
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,It is what it is...wise cracking super heros...lots of movie magic and all that ...but somehow uninteresting.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,10 Stars!!!!  Can't wait to own it and watch it over and over and over again!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Great summer fare.  Lots of blow-em ups and larger than life, literally, characters:  Mark Ruffalo as simmering anger (i.e.the Hulk) is amazing, Robert Downey Jr. is a wonderful screen personality.  Scarlet Johannsen is made to play action heroines--she never looks like she breaks a sweat!  And that schtickt of playing the innocent girl to get info out of men was brilliant, really.  It did take a while for me to get into it:  actually, I was ready to walk after 20 minutes--too much talkey-talk and back-story--but it was a hundred degrees outside and the theatre's air conditioning was working and then Thor started smashing some heads so I happily stayed.  Funny lines:  when Stark wakes up with all the other Avengers around him:  ""Did somebody kiss me?""  Thor when told his brother Loki was a homicidal maniac:  ""He was adopted.""   It's a hard concept to pull together--who are we cheering for and why--and they almost did it."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Took my kids to see it and I loved it great movie lots of action and some funny parts
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,LOVED IT!!! Even if your not into super hero/ marvels its still a great movie!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Has to be the best movie in decades. Action and humour all rolled into one. Love how the 'superheroes' all kind of dislike each other especially Iron Man.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,This was fantastic. They whole family enjoyed it. Action packed with humour. Must go see
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,If you have liked any other superhero movie this is a must see.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"A GREAT, FUN, and a little laughter MOVIE!!!!  A MUST SEE!!!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"This IS the greatest movie to come out this year (as of June 15th, waiting for Dark Knight Rises) I can't put into words how awesome this movie was. So worth every penny spent on the IMAX 3D ticket."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Fun summer blockbuster
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Avengers Assemble!!!! Thanos is here to wreak havoc!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,An amazing movie that did not fall flat on its face during the battle scene at the end. Humor combined with action and an extraordinary cast makes The Avengers a must see and own movie.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"The Perfect Balance of humor, blood shed, explosions, and heart. The Avengers Assemble in an amazing way."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,I thought it was going to SUCK bigtime.; but it was pretty darn hilarious and Awsome.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"the HULK, nuff said."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"The Avengers movie was fun, lively, energetic and action-packed !! I think the movie needs actors who are more ethnically diverse to portray some of the super hero characters. Overall, this is a fun movie and the 3D visuals are colorful and really help the action scenes, especially the fight scenes with Iron Man and Thor, then Thor and the Hulk, and finally an epic battle with Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Black Widow and Hawkeye against Transformers-style villains .. don't think too much about the plot and enjoy some summer escapist thrills."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"A fun film from start to finish, thoroughly entertaining with a great cast!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,It was very good..although I would not recommend unless you have some background knowledge of the characters... I did not...so I was completely lost in the beginning.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon pulled out all the stops, mixing together a movie that blends comedy, drama and action into a easily palatable experience for both fanboys (and fangirls) and casual observers."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Outstanding movie! Better than all the other marvel movies combined!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Best movie of all time period
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,fantastic movie..can't wait for the sequel.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,A fun romp but nothing quite new under the sun.  OK the aircraft carrier was cool but.... battle scene at the end could have had 5 minutes chopped off.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"A really fun movie with a lot of action and humor, the only reason I gave it 4 1/2 stars is that the main villains plot and motivations are a bit week."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,A strong cast with some surprisingly witty repartee helps to really lift this film above the usual superhero bumf. The plot isn't anything we haven't seen before - but who cares? There's something here for everyone.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Such an amazing movie!!!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon did an excellent job. Love it!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Not enough stars to rate this!!! Loved it!! All i can say is amazing!! Loved the Hulk the best.. Oh and Iron Man .. And Thor.. Well just everything and everyone
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"One of the best movies of the year so far, great action sequences with good character development is what a superhero film with multiple protagonists needed. Script was well done and they no one else could direct this film like Joss Whedon did! Hopefully he returns for the sequel."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Terrific fun. So happy for Whedon!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,One of the best movies I've seen! Definitely a MUST SEE!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Mind blowing! It was so good!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Worth watching in the theater.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,mmmkkjKjjjjjjjjjjjjllllllytyyttttytttrtfggghhhffjifgitfutghgth bbhhggjgyuryhrihhjrjxjdjjdxjfjfjfjjfjggjjrjjhhhejdjfjfutjjhbbghj
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,verry good and funny
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie I have seen in a long time.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"A great film that is entertaining from start to finish. Alright, it is predictible but you don't care because it's such a fun movie to watch."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Best movie I've seen in awhile. Loved it. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Great movie, action and story telling. You will connect to one of the Superheros if not all. Must see."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,It starts a little slow but as the movie progresses it becomes amazing.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Whoa, this thing was over-hyped for sure. I don't care if it had Thor, Iron-Man, the Hulk, and Mace Windu from Star Wars, this thing is not what it's projected as being... Yeah, now we get to see a sticker slapped on every box of Lucky Charms too. (However, the script is cleverly written, and it is just a fun popcorn budget movie, not the masterpiece people are claiming it to be)."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Without a doubt the best film I've seen in 2012! Go see it now!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie ever!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Filled with action, character development, and humor that every movie needs."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Before I go into details, I will say this was a GREAT movie. The action and humor carried this movie and made it a 4 star for sure. The basic plot: Blue cube stolen, superheroes recruited to retrieve blue cube, safe the world from blue cube, blue cube found, world saved by superheroes. You can't get any simpler than that, but they could have done better. If you enjoy Robery Downey, Jr.'s comedic one-liners, this movie is full of them. My personal favorite, when Ironman refers to Thor as ""Point Break."" If you've seen the movie, you'll get it."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,First half dragged a bit but worth watching. Iron Man & The Hulk made the movie. The other characters were so so.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Great! Wonderful! Fantastic!  I love Marvel movies and I think this has been the best!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Loved it!! Tom Hiddleston plays a wonderful Villain (Loki).
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"This is a great movie, from the beginning to the, love the hulk, love how it was directed. Great performance from every actor and actress"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,It did what it was meant to well.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Great culmination of the various independent movies.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,great movie I like that they kept the same actors to continue playing the characters it should be that way for the next one...:-P
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"I won't go as far as to say this was the best superhero movie ever, but it was definitely worth the wait. The cast worked together superbly and I felt like I was living a comic book in action"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"I Ã¢?Â¤ this movie!!!!  This movie is great because it's not your average action movie- it has some humor in it. For me, personally, I love comedy movies. But this movie is a great combination of action and humor. They cast the roles perfectly."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Classic !!! On the same level as E.T. and star Wars alson Superman
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"This movie packs a punch with a great storyline, great acting, and top-of-the-line epic action-packed scenes that will please almost any audience."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Great action and effects, excellent casting, and overall fantastic story. There's a perfect balance between the real world of today and future technology, which makes this movie a unique experience. It's good for families with enough action and shots to keep adults entertained."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Great movie we loved it and we will defiantly be be buying the DVD and Digital copy when it becomes available again AWESOME job .
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,The best movie this year by far.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,This is an ok movie but the best part is when the Hulk busts out and is the Hulk! I saw it in 3D but i wish i would of watched it regular! In my opion it would of been better not in 3D!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,This movie was the best movie ever!!! I loved it so much!!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Spectacular!  Would definitely recommend and will buy the DVD when it come out.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Most entertaining movie you will see this year.

"Jun 15, 2012",positive,I absolutely loved it!!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Really good. Super funny
"Jun 15, 2012",neutral,took too long to really get the story going. Too much fighting between themselfs.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,best movie of the summer!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Oh we loved it!!! ("",) Great movie, ACTION PACKED! Thank you!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Just a fun popcorn muncher.  I love the hulk!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,best movie of the summer so far
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Best movie this year. Robert Downey Jr. Steals the show, and Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK to date"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,One of the best movies ever! The humor mixed in with the action is what tops it off. Actors are brilliant! I follow Loki!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,the best action movie i seen
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,spider man shouldve been in it though
"Jun 15, 2012",negative,Robert and Scarlett.... Leave the rest
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Exceeded my expectations , and loved it"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Just Great! Obvious plot but done so well and with such humour you cant not love it!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Loved it! Every minute of it was great.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Really awesome action packed movie with some humor in it
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"My favorite movie this far this year. Great writing and direction (yay Joss Whedon), great cast but we knew that going in. Fun ride and may see it a 4th time in theaters. Can't get enough. Can't wait to own this. Or see part 2!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Excuse me while I turn fanboi for a moment -- Joss Whedon is a freakin' genius!! He's pulled off something nearly impossible here -- a big-name ensemble cast where everyone gets their moment in the sun, with snappy intelligent dialogue, big visual effects, a satisfying story, and something that retains the fidelity of the comic-book characters for the fans. Stunningly good!! My pick of 2012 so far -- and possibly the whole year."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,The way comic book movies should be.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,awesome!  definitely one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,The best movie ever!!
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Everything about this movie was perfect.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,I love love love this movie!!! aaah Thor I'm inlove :)
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"Loved loved loved it!! The action, the comedy, and the story line was awesome!!"
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,Awesome bc of an awesome director.
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,it ws awsumm...lived up to the hype !! luvd it :)
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,"The Avengers is Amazing in every way it has tons of humor, intense action(Battle in Manhattan), great dialogue and truly lives up to all fanboys' dreams(including me). Whether you're a fanboy or not I strongly recommend to see this movie. IT'S A HE'LL OF A FUN MOVIE TO WATCH!! I've already seen it like 5-6 times."
"Jun 15, 2012",positive,it was nice to see the avengers come to life :D
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Awesome movie realy funny
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"HUGE SMASHING Entertainment! Great direction, fantastic dialogues and great casting. 
Remember it comes from comics so don't expect deep political reviews of the financial crisis in wall street during last year. 
Joss Whedon was able to bring the best from every character with the right dose of nerdiness every Marvel fan needs. Few rare slow moments but actually very well cut. Hmm not good for too little kids."

"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Hulk was super funny and Thor OMG
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Good entertainment. Iron Man and Hulk are definitely the driving force of the film.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,I loved this movie.  Watch it. Watch it.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
puny GOd!!!!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,It was so cool I loved it

"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Awww snap this movie is the awesomest movie ive ever seen I cant wait for the second avengers with SPIDER MAN WAHOO 	my favorite superhero
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"If you see this rating and you know me, you'll know why I rated it 5 stars. Outstanding!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Like it or not, it literally and objectively could not have been better."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Best movie ever created!! I was into it from the start and it just kept getting better and better!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Definitely going to buy!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Loved it!!! especially the hulk & Thor <3
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Perfect mix of action and humor. Every hero has their own spotlight and it was melded together in the end to be the best team to ever assemble. Joss Whedon has me wanting to watch his other project he has worked on.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Just a great comic book adaptation. Can not say anything bad about this film.
"Jun 14, 2012",negative,"All of that money put into one of the most dissapointing films I've seen in a long time. I really thought this movie would be pretty acceptable because I liked the hulk and iron man movie but this film was a whole other piece of paper! From the smart-ass comments and ""witty"" jokes that caused awkward laughing, to the excess amount of talking that was possibly 90% of the movie. This should've been called ""hero's therapy"" because all it was was every character being hostile towards each other and then finally realizing that everybody has their own story and should be treated equally and they should actually work together to fight the villian because it was just soo hard figuring that out earlier."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"It's good for what it is, a simple action movie, not focus on plot. I must say that the Hulk stole the show, well, him and Scarlett Johansson's booty."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,A stunning finale to a marvelous set of movies! Can't wait for more marvel!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Love it!! End of story XD
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"I was expecting a bunch of story lines crossing over and fighting for attention, and didn't expect to like this one. LOVED IT!!! Super fun action, great comedy and character development.  Only a few minor holes in the story that were easily forgotten when HULK SMASHED things.  Can't wait to buy the bluray and own it."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,The best film experience I've had in a long time.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,This movie was Awesome!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Awesome Movie!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"awesome movie, somebody finally did the Hulk right!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"This movie is relentlessly in motion, which may sound very cool, but it becomes tiring, all one speed. And, you've got Scarlett Johansson and no one tries to get it on with her, no way!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,One hell of a ride very well done
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,THIS IS A MOVIE I COULD WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN (:
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Too damn good to pass up
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Super hero team saves the world.  The special effects were pretty awesome, but grew tired of one hero trying to outwit the other.  There were some really funny parts."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,I SAW THIS MOVIE OPENING NIGHT AND IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE AS FAR AS RIGHT NOW!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS FULL OF ACTION AND HAS ALLOT OF FUNNY MOMENTS HAHA
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,an epic action film worth waiting and watching for
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"I'm such a superhero lover! and this movie was great!!!! I'm a huge fan of Captain America, Thor and Iron Man...and this movie man me love them even more! great action movie! dare to say, best of the year!!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,I loved this movie!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,This movie was BOSS!!!! GO AND SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Very good. Loved the character interaction. They did a very good job of cap and iron man's disagreements. And the Hulk in the end out did Tony stark in the comic relief. A movie theater must see.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,One of the greatest movies ever made!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Joss Whedon is a genious!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Excellent! The Hulk rocks again!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"It's humorous and visually entertaining, but feels like something is missing throughout the entire film. It lacks heart and any emotion whatsoever. While it is an action/hero movie, I'd rather go see a sappy chick flick than sit through a 2 hour long action fest with no interesting point. In the end, while I didn't connect with the film, others may enjoy it and I suppose, depending on the person, I would recommend it to a friend."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"One of the most awesome-st movies I have seen, this is the kind of movie where you can re-watch again and again. Well, maybe not that frequent.

It changed my perception on 3D movie, the tech has matured so much that I might consider buying a 3D TV!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,If I could I would add more stars it was awesome
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"very entertaining, must see again."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,the most amazing super hero movie that ive ever seen
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,The Avengers lived up to it's hype. My only regret is that I have only seen it once. A must watch for movie lovers of all ages.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,This movie was pretty funny I enjoyed the movie.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,The best Comic Book Movie- with superb special effects and fight scenes!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,My two year old even loved this movie! He sat quietly and watched the whole thing. Lots of action and great acting a must see for comic fans!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"This movie had great acting, action, and comedy. At times it seemed as if each character had been trying to get the best punch line through out. The picture and effects are the best ive ever seen. Who doesn't like superheros? Definitely a must see for fans of movies in general"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,".great movie, glad i went to see it."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Possibly the greatest superhero movie ever. The effects and dialogue shine.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"the third best movie ever, LOVE IT"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,It was a brilliant film. Love the Iron Man!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,BEST MOVIE EVEEEEERRR<3
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Action packed movie with engaging dialogue!  Somehow found a way to split screen time between 6 superheroes and still keep the movie balanced.  It was also surprisingly funny for an action movie.  Marvel got it right, if only all there other movies could find the right balance in action and writing that the Avengers has!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,The best Marvel output yet.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Fanboys and casual movie-goers alike will both find something to love in this amazing summer movie kickoff. Jam-packed with action, humor, wit, questionable physics, and characters you genuinely care about, you have to be one serious stick in the mud to not thoroughly enjoy the Avengers experience."
"Jun 14, 2012",neutral,kind of boring. should have had more action in the beginning. i was falling asleep when they just kept talking and talking. it was also confusing in some parts:/
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Best Superhero movie ever! Although their are plenty of other really great superhero movies out there (Batman Trilogy, Iron Man, Captain America) this movie has a compound effect having all the superheroes together. With a talented directer, amazing storyline, awesome action scenes, great actors, and hilarious moments sprinkled. throughout, this is a must see for any action and superhero fan!"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Better than all the films leading up to this one combined!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Great movie, will land in my top 10 list for this yr for sure ."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"My new favorite movie!!! The Avengers is action packed along with some humor, and a must see movie."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Gave it a 4 for not messing this film up. Could have received another star if they hadn't poorly portrayed hawkeye.  Yawn.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"So many great characters playing off each other so well. Funny, exciting, and a fun time. It never hurts to have so many ""prequel-esque"" movies prior to draw characterization from."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,This movie is great.....even for fans that are not too big on Marvel like me! Worth the watch..:)
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Simply the best movie since Star Wars ...... nuff said.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"This movie carried the torch into the summer with it's head held high. I give a big kudos to Director Joss Whedon for knowing the strengths and weaknesses of his actors and characters. Also, for knowing what the audience was looking for in such an epic story. More Hulk, but less Bruce Banner. More Iron Man, and more Stark banter. Less Captain America ( I am a huge Chris Evans fan) the character is kind of boring compared to the rest. A moderate amount of Thor, since he is one kick butt super hero, however his character (no offense to Chris Hemsworth) is a little bit lacking in the fun department. He's a bit too serious. Add a few dashes of Hawkeye and Black Widow for introductions sake. Not to mention I can't imagine a dude on the planet who would turn away a sexy Scarlett in leather. I can't wait to see where they take all these Superhero series'. Maybe Joss can direct them all?"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,The perfect popcorn movie.
"Jun 14, 2012",negative,Wasn't the best movie. Disappointment
"Jun 14, 2012",negative,"The movie is fucking terrible.  I have NO CLUE as to why this movie has such a prominent fanbase.  The Avengers is just bland.  None of the character psychologies in this movie are ones we've never seen before.  They should have called this movie ""Marvel's Delta Flight Movie""

All of the characters seem the same.  They're all snooty.  They act like a bunch of smart-asses in the film.  Now, I know the argument could be made that they're superheroes and they've done this before, so they have the right.  But there is no real character development in the movie.  The only character I felt that had a story arc was Thor.  He's not even that interesting.  Also, Hawkeye and Black Widow are basically far from memorable.  Hulk (Dr. Banner) can't break a single octave with his voice.  He's like the William Hurt of superheroes.  Iron Man's stuck up attitude is tiring after 3 movies and just gets a bit annoying.

The villain is a joke.  Locke was just not a suitable villain for such a massive production of Marvel heroes.  HE himself is also bland and his motives are lame: ""take over the world"".  In fact, I've never seen another movie with so much emphasis on taking over the world.  Not only is this coffee bland, but it's also spattered into your face.

I understand how when you compare Marvel and DC movies together, you find that Batman is structurally superior and the Marvel movies are just more fun.  Mindless fun that is.  Correction: just mindlessness."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"I really enjoyed this movie.  A good balance of witty banter and action.  In this day and age with high priced stars, I was shocked to see all of the major actors come together for this film.  I am ready for A2."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Good fighting scenes, great CG.  The story was lacking in originality, and the antagonist of the story Loki played (Tom Hiddleston) was just a big cry baby he couldn't be the king of his home world, so he decided to make people from a whole other planet suffer?  I think the villain should be more complex & interesting.  I just felt Loki wasn't a big threat to man kind. Avengers had it's moments but the movie is Ok. The kids will love it. If your a comic book fan you won't be impressed by Avengers,  Iron man was much more entertaining to watch and that's just one Super Hero.I give this movie  6.8 out 10"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,A feel good movie with lots of action and humor. I liked it!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie!!!  Hope they make more!,"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Best movie of 2012 thus far!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Marvellous, brilliant as always,the actors and actress have done good considering the pressure of presenting the super heroes"
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,This was fun and hilarious!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,the missing half star from this rating comes from the questionable bias placed on Iron Man on the producers' part despite better performance potential from the other stars.
"Jun 14, 2012",negative,I was a bit disapointed in the Advengers.  I felt that I was watching another Iron Man movie with the other characters having guest spots.  I expected the others to play larger rolls and not appear as sidekicks to Iron Man.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,A flabbergasting movie which entertains even those who have not seen the previous films with the Marvel characters.  I was left wanting more.
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Awesome ...loved the Hulk
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Excellent entertainment.  This film does it all!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"This movie is over the top in everything, and that is exactly how a marvel avengers movie should be."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Best movie of summer '12. Action, suspense, comedy and sci-fi all rolled into one. Captain America shines as the leader of The Avengers."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"I was sure that juggling this many characters couldn't be done, especially knowing the main villain was from the clusterfuck that was Thor's big screen debut, but Joss Whedon has delivered beyond reasonable expectations. The Avengers is about as good a  blockbuster as you could hope for.

Not content to merely have all the characters present and engaging in action set pieces, The Avengers earns trust early on with each character gradually pulled into the story with motives that stay true to their characters' previous film(s) and print legacy, and allegiances forming despite initial conflict rather than being the status quo from the outset. Whedon manages to make the formation and idea of this ""team of misfits"" feel relateively organic despite them all coming from seemingly unrelated stories of their own.

Tom Hiddleston's Loki is far more menacing and well-used here than in Thor, providing palpable stakes while having as much fun as anyone else. Performances from all key players are uniformly on target, even Hemsworth -- who I've made no secret of hating in Thor -- not only feels more at home in this film but manages to land a few laughs.

While the film does struggle somewhat to wring tension from this many characters with seemingly invincible powers, there is a sense of another plate ready to be spun at any moment without ever feeling excessive; anything can happen but it has to happen for a reason. Fans of any single character checking the movie out only for them may feel short-changed, but given the complete mess this could have been, it's a minor miracle that it works as well as it does."
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,"Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is a blockbuster in every sense. It spends half of its time to build a premise only to deliver an astonishing third act that can very well be one of the best choreographed action sequences in comic book movie history (that actually can be followed by the audience). Following five Marvel movies that gave glimpses of a build-up to this, it has satisfied not just the comic book fans but also the general audience for blockbusters in its gargantuan implementation.

The plot is a no-brainer. A cosmic level threat that endangers Earth, a group of heroes brought together to tackle it, they fight amongst each other at first before joining hands and facing the enemy. You can say it's an amalgamation of Roland Emmerich's ""Independence Day"" and Stephen Norrington's ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", only sweeter. The film fulfills its true purpose of entertaining the audience with superheroes performing various feats with the help of CGI effects while delivering punch liners. There are scenes after scenes where we see either of the hero talking with another and delivering a line that cracks up the cinema hall. Tony Stark aka Iron Man has most of them, because he's played by Robert Downey Jr. There is also Captain America (Chris Evans), a super soldier, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a Norse God, Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) whose anger turns him into a huge green monster. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Runner play Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow and Clint Barton aka Hawkeye; they do not have superpowers but they are effective assassins. Watching over them all is Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D who has finally got sufficient screen time than only appearing in post-credits.

The main villain is Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who by the end of the film ""Thor"" has come to Earth. He's after a tesseract (introduced in the film ""Captain America"") that is in possession of S.H.I.E.L.D and captures it along with converting some scientists and assassins to his side via hypnosis. He uses the tesseract to open a portal that can bring the alien race Chitauri to attack Earth. These monsters which are brought to Earth solely to be blown up by the superheroes in various ways are not introduced until the third act. So we are stuck with Loki for the major part of the movie and expect him to do some bad. Hiddleston does a better job here to keep himself a threat against the heroes, maintaining his character's wily reputation. He's got some nice scenes, one with Black Widow and another with Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). It is a very funny sequence when he gets defeated in the end.

For a superhero action movie, it has some interesting scenes that has to do with the actors than special effects. There is one where Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, both scientists but people with deformities in their own ways, discuss each other's work as well as their problems. Another notable one would involve Clark Gregg and his deep reverie towards Captain America.

The tesseract and the alien beings ('Chitauri') are what plot-generators call 'MacGuffins'. They have enough significance to be mentioned by every major player involved, but lacks any importance than to be destroyed magnificently. The climax takes place at Manhattan which is destroyed by heroes and villains equally during the fight. If the aliens cannot get hold of even Manhattan, what's the point to call it an 'Earth Invasion'?

There are enough places in the movie for the comic book fans to induce nerdgasm. Joss Whedon, himself a comic book writer (whose work on X-Men is said to be one of the best), has understood his target crowd well to deliver an action-packed, catchphrase filled superhero lollapalooza.

"Jun 14, 2012",positive,It was great! Worth the time and money to go see it!
"Jun 14, 2012",positive,Awesome film! Best of the year thus far!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Instant classic, period."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Niente male! Contando che precedentemente gli unici film decenti erano stati quelli di Iron-Man, mentre Capitan America, Thor e Nick Fury tre boiate colossali per incassare i soldi al botteghino per finanziare questo; che per trovare un altro vero attore oltre a Robert Downey Jr. (Samuel Jackson Ã¨ troppo defilato) bisognava prendere Mark Ruffalo, che nell'interpretare il Dottor Banner non fa rimpiangere Edward Norton ma sembra Lawrence Olivier rispetto a tutti gli altri... dai, il film mi ha stupito perchÃ (C) regge anche nella sua scontata fumettositÃ . Menzione ovviamente per Loki, che nemmeno in ""Thor"" ricordavo cosÃ¬ ben caratterizzato come super fellon! Ottimi effetti speciali! Viene voglia di riguardarlo."
"Jun 13, 2012",neutral,"The movie wasn't completely awful, but its ending was so predictable. It's final battle was just like Transformers 3. The final battle ending was just like the Phantom Menace. Closing the portal was way too convenient. Hulk controlling his anger was convenient. And why does Fury keep saying, ""Fight the battles that we never could."" Obviously it's possible for you to. You have 2 agents, who seem to be taking care of things just fine. One guy was super weak until you pumped him on steroids. Do that again. It's bull **** that no one can replicate a formula created in the 1940s. And the alien army dying out when the mothership blew up was the most convenient thing that has ever happened. At least in the Phantom Menace, the robots shutting down made sense because they are computers. The evil alien army shouldn't have died when the Mothership was destroyed. If you knew they would all die, then why would you send the Mothership to the battle in the first place? Everyone talks about The Dark Knight Rises having plot holes. Look at this!!!! That's why I only gave this mess and 2 out of 5. Because its only strong mount is its Michael Bay styled action. There is no complexity and no new plot. It was made to entertain you with explosions for 2 and a half hours. If you get it on DVD or Blu-Ray, then it will probably end up on a shelf gathering dust."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,A damn near perfect movie.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Truly an amazingly contrived action flick!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,I thought this movie was amazing! The 3d effects were average but the movie was awesome!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Excellent movie.  Robert Downey JR. really pulled the whole film together and the Hulk was hilarious.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,The Best Movie of All..
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Wow! Words can't explain the awsomeness that this movie holds.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,was OK...I fell asleep
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Just under the Dark Knight for best superhero movie.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Amazing. I am still surprised with how well Whedon brought all of these characters together. This movie is absolute genius.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Sickest movie in a long time.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,I knew there was a reason I loved Whedon. Absolutely loved the movie. it definitely incorporated all the characters quite well and had a decent story line. Adored Loki and the new Dr Banner.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,This movie is SUPER!!!
"Jun 13, 2012",neutral,"What? This is it? Underwhelmed, to say the least.  

Obviously, the verbal sparring is fun.

But Loki is a terribly wimpy villain. Hulk got that right! (Can't wait to see Michael Shannon as General Zod - now that should be one helluva opponent!)

Everyone's indestructible, so where's the sense of danger that one of them might get hurt or die?  Hell, they don't even get nose bleeds!

Even the more human super heroes (Capt. America and Black Widow) take blasts that would have killed anyone else.  Love how Black Widow jumps off a flying speeder, drops 100', does a tuck-and-roll and gets up like no big deal.

And let's compound all of this with the fact that most of these super heroes are more intent on beating the crap out of one another before even airing a cursory discussion about what's their beef.  Thin characters, bonehead plotting.

Good special effects, but the whole affair runs about 15 minutes too long.

Glad so many others enjoyed this, but wow - was this ever just ok to me.

For far better points of reference, see X-Men I and II and Iron Man I; these are indeed super movies."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Loved it~action packed, funny, 3D effects were cool"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I just loved it, saw it twice at the theater already I'll buy the blu ray 3D and watch it so many times.... =P"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Despite being dragged out at parts, uneven, and blind to some great opportunities, this movie is still quite a blast. The characters are well-written and interact amusingly. The acting is not quite as uneven as the plot, though it ranges from piss-poor (i.e. Cobie Smulders) to pitch-perfect (i.e. Mark Ruffalo); the majority of players lean towards the latter. Cliches and plot-holes riddle the drab story; but the execution, action, and character play deflect those bullets."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,pure Hollywood entertainment
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie. However I am more of a DC Comics fan and being how good this movie is, if DC ever decides to do a Justice League movie they have a high bar to beat."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Easily the second best super hero film behind ""The Dark Knight.""  The way Joss Whedon interweaved these stories together was impressive.  The depth in the story line was a little underdeveloped and cliche which was the one thing that prevented this from surpassing ""The Dark Knight,"" as the best super hero film.  I am sure the sequel will go beyond this film much like ""The Dark Knight"" was a better film than ""Batman Begins."""
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Just a whole lot of fun! Amazing special effects and action. Funny, and entertaining."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Great points: the Heroes
Disappointing points: The Villain"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,This movie was excellent and a must for all comic book nerds. I would've liked to see a little less of the punch lines and more of the story behind each superhero but overall well made.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,The movie was exceptional! This is a must see if you have not seen it yet.  I thought the combination of actors and their characters were well managed and merged perfectly with the visual effects.  The one character that pushed it over the top for me was The Hulk who in my opinion was the best.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Amazing! Wasn't even looking forward to this but turned out I loved it! Good movie
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,See it or ill send the Hulk on you.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Entertaining enough....
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Bang, bang rip everything up movie. Very satisfying."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Total fun! I did not think for two hours and fifteen minutes. Exactly what I wanted.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Great movie. Entertaining through out.  What makes the movie excellent is that was perfectly built up by the previous solo movies, such as Iron Man, Thor, etc.  This movie delivered a star cast, with great action and humor.  A must see. I saw it twice."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Great movie! Enjoyed it alot and look forward to an Avengers II
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"The plot is simple enough for everyone to understand, it's awesome seeing all these great heroes fight as one.  Best Marvel movie out there."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Lots of action with surprising actions that will dazzle most.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Great movie just wish they kept the same actor for the hulk but most of the other things like fight scenes and story was great
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie since TDK!!!!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Fantastic, this movie lived up to and surpassed the hope."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Great movie! Best hero movie out there!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Awesome stuff, best marvel movie to date."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I saw it twice, I was utterly pleased with casting, story line, editing, character interaction, musical score. Just completely fantastic"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Fantastic...loved the Hulk!!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Best Hero movie of All-time!!! Can't wait for the sequel
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Best yet! Iron Man was my fav.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I have found that many of Marvels movies have not lived up to expectations, but this movie is by far a masterpiece of superhero awesomeness. Now Marvel just has to keep up the good work."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Great SuperHero movie!! awesome...love Scarlett.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,A handful of awesome superhero movies in one go!  Thor VS Hulk alone!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"As always, a veeeery long destroy the city scene!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Fucking Awesome!!! I gave it 4 stars only b/c it is an action movie. Die Hard is the only action film to deserve 5 shiny gold stars.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"It was a fantastic film, that I recommend to anyone, especially people who enjoyed the movies leading up to it."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Not a good story line but really good special effects
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Action+Comedy=great movie
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Loved it!! I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over!!
"Jun 13, 2012",negative,Very disappointing. The story was almost non-existent and it was so boring that there was a steady stream of people wandering out . It was saved by the ending which was mediocre by today's standards. Very little tension and far too much motion blur 3/10
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,I haven't been so thrilled to see a superhero movie since Iron Man 1.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I'm not sure what everybody is raving about, it was good but it wasn't the Dark Knight.  I think maybe I'm just tired or superhero comic book movies... all style and very little substance.  For what it was it was quality so I guess that bumps it up to 3.5 stars."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Epic! Amazing! Incredible!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Easily the best film of the year! Joss wrote perfectly for all the characters.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,great movie I loved it ! I wanna see it a third time (:
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Super , the best hulk movie ever"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I liked it, but apparently not as much as everybody else. but I like thinkers a little bit better, so there we are"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"If I had to explain this movie in one word.. If would simply be.. ""perfect"""
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Most entertaining flick I've seen in a long time.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Awesome. Love you, joss!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Well it was pretty much what I expected.

Fans of the long list of recently rushed Marvel hero films will be satisfied with this bloated no-brainer action flick. I was reminded a lot of the Transformers films, as it pretty much consists of non stop CGI fuelled action and explosions for the full two and a half hours.

It had plenty of funny bits thanks to the influence of Joss Whedon, but the fact that all the super heroes are virtually invincible and will have to appear in the next 2 films they make completely saps any tension from the movie- yes they are going to all survive, yes they are going to win.

Also I understand why they changed the actor for Bruce Banner (and Ruffalo is perfectly acceptable), but I prefered Edward Norton."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"I know what all of you were thinking ""they don't show the hulk that much in the commercials"" well, hulk has plenty of amazing scenes. the avengers was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my ENTIRE life and will be the same for many years to come. it gives each character equal time and equal witty/action scenes mostly all together, it concludes very tastefully and leaves u wanting more which we'll get in a year or two a must see for anyone!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,A perfectly exciting action movie mixed with humor all together great movie
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Awesome!! just Awesome!!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"one of the best movies i have seen in a while. the only thing that turns me off is Nick Fury/ Samuel L jackson's increasingly cliche superhero movie saying through out the whole film. tom hiddleson is a stunning super villan. ruffalo seems made for the hulk role. Evans and helmsworth work for their respective roles, robert downy jr is a natural fit as tony stark. jeremy renner is a pleasant surprise as ""hawkeye"" showing of his inner BAMF. Scarlet johannson serves no real purpose in this movie except to be a pretty face. Joss has set the standard for what a superhero movie should be. 4.5 stars."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Everything looks right out of the pages of this Marvel franchise! Best 3D experience till now!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,its insane how good the movie is.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Best Marvel one yet!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"The Avengers has what every superhero movie needs. With non-stop action, spectacular visual effect, solid acting, solid script, and laughable jokes, it really gives fans what they have waited for since the 2008 Iron Man."
"Jun 13, 2012",negative,Not good at all. Crap in fact.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Off the charts...can't wait for the next one
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,I really enjoyed this movie! Its amazing!(:
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"If the Hobbit doesn't blow me away, this movie is the greatest movie of the year!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Great all around movie it had everything. All action movies should model off the Avengers
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"great movie not gona lie, but. my boy spiderman, no1 will ever touch those. yep the 3rd 1 as well. of course, it was ""2 rushed"" like im 2."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"i wishh i could rate this 10 STARS!! i loved every bit of this movie. from robert downey Jrs comedy, to the hulks action. there was a lot of pressure on this movie to be good, and for the producers to get it right. and they did a very good job in making this as alive as can be!!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"The film isn't perfect. (as it's destructive reign at the box office might lead you to believe.) I'll get it out of the way. I'm a DC fanboy. Batman and Superman have consumed more time in my life than I'd care to divulge.  (I entered to John Williams' Superman theme at my wedding. My wife, the much more traditional Canon in D) I'm not one of those who is so biased he can't see the competetitor's merchandise for what they are. Avengers is a substantial achievement. Interweaving multiple films with a multitude of stars and hex woven into a singular narrative? (A robot man, a norse god and a super soldier walk into a bar...) is no small feat. Marvel set the bar high. When Iron Man stormed the gates in 2008, it was a sight to behold. RDJ defined the role in a way that was going to make it difficult for any actor choosing to take the mantle when he inevitably steps down. (a task the Superman franchise has yet to successfully accomplish after Reeve's stepped down as the Last Son of Krypton...in 1987.) Incredible Hulk was amusing if forgettable. Captain America and Thor were both superbly fun, and well crafted, they simply felt like they had just come off the superhero assembly line. I don't mean it in a cruel way. They're good films, they just aren't superb ones. Avengers was more than the sum of it's parts. Thanks in no small part to Joss Whedon. (If you don't know who that is and call yourself a nerd, GET OUT NOW!) His ability to tell stories with a massive cast in tow is well documented. (Firefly, Dollhouse, Astonishing X-Men, Buffy, Angel) (As a matter of fact, I'd say the only other one to successfully do so would be Bryan Singer on his X-Men films, sorry Ratner.) I really, really liked this film. But I wanted to love it. There were so many moments I wanted to stand up and cheer, but I don't think I ever connected personally with the characters. It was a roll-coaster ride, and a d*** fine one to be sure. I just wanted some moments of subtlety. Something personal. I know what you're thinking, ""Shut up Nerd! Nothing makes you guys happy!"" Not true. X2, Superman; The Movie and Batman Begins/The Dark Knight are just about as close to movie making perfections as you can get. I can watch any of these at the drop of a hat and be roughly as amused as I was the first time I saw them. Just b/c Joss didn't get the brass ring this time, doesn't mean he can't reach for it next time."
"Jun 13, 2012",negative,"i really don't know if i am mad or the people who are liking it , seriously immensely  overhyped film.Don't get me wrong i love superhero movies.Iron man 1 is marvel's best movie. 2 stars= 1 for Hulk+ 1 for effort !!!!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Too much like the last transformers.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,great super hero movie. to think the guy that directed buffy and angel pulled this off. just amazing
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,I like Super Heros movies. All the characters were great! Just hope they can keep it going and keep all the same actors... Come on Justice League!
"Jun 13, 2012",neutral,Was so bored the first hour in I turned it off.
"Jun 13, 2012",negative,not a fan...I'm an X Men girl I guess
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"it was a really good movie! a lot of unexpected scenes, id watch it again!"
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,What more is to be said?! Its The Avengers man!!  Kick ass!!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Gran bei cazzotti. Quantita' giusta e storia decente. Ma la gnocca non convince e ci si ritrova a sorridere solo nelle tre (3) gag sparse per il film.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Loved it! Can't wait for a sequel!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Despite having our theaters stuffed with an annoyingly overabundant amount of superhero movies, ""The Avengers"" reminds us why we're so drawn. Certainly entertaining for all ages, you can't help but keep in mind who will really enjoy this film: KIDS. Marvel sets the perfect stage for the dreams of any youngster, brings to life our own inner childhood fantasy, injects steroids into it, and calls it a movie."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,as always good action scenes
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"It was just I had expected it to be: weak storyline, amazing action, and campy humor. Somehow, in the small gaps between the action sequences, you could hear crickets chirping, and there were quite a lot of technical errors.
On the whole, its a nice summer movie where you put on the 3d glasses, shut down your brain, sit back with a butload of popcorn and cola, and enjoy.

IMO, X-Men: First Class was much MUCH better. But thats just my opinion."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Highly enjoyable superhero romp with a nice injection of silly humour.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"In a film like The Avengers, which brings together strands of several prior pictures into a mostly cohesive whole, it is arguably inevitable that individual pieces will end up working better than the sum of its parts. That the film works at all is almost a miracle, and it's so purely entertaining and contains so much that works like gangbusters that it's tempting to ignore what doesn't work and merely salute the enterprise. It is a relentlessly engaging and confident motion picture, boasting a cast that in a more respected genre would make it an Oscar-bait film. But the film comes so close to out-and-out greatness that it's almost disheartening to point out the core issues at fault, both because it feels petty and because it's almost a genre masterpiece. Still, there is much to like and quite a bit to love about Joss Whedon's The Avengers. On a pure popcorn spectacle scale I can't imagine anyone feeling that they didn't get their money's worth. As a piece of art however, it's a trickier proposition.

I'm forgoing a plot synopsis because I can't imagine anyone reading this who doesn't have a general idea of the film and its characters. First of all, the initial twelve minute pre-credits sequence is absolutely terrible. It's a poorly written, stiltedly-performed set-piece that artlessly reintroduces Tom Hiddleston's Loki (Thor's turncoat brother) and establishes the McGuffin (the rediscovered 'tesseract' from Captain America). It's by-far the worst sequence in the film, so it's mostly uphill from there. Anyway, the rest of the first act is spent reintroducing our favorite Marvel heroes and reestablishing relationships. Captain America-himself, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) gets somewhat less to do in this early chunk, as the film makes it clear that he is a supporting character in this superhero team-up (it's no secret that a scene involving Rogers trying to reconnect with his old life didn't make the cut). For continuity junkies like myself, it is a thrill to see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) in a mutually beneficial romantic relationship, and Stark's 'recruitment' moments with SHIELD agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) crackle with familiarity and genuine friendship among all three of them. The introductory bits for Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) are filled with intelligence and wit while the somewhat delayed entrance for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) provides one of the most emotionally compelling moments in the film. The genuine brotherly love that Thor and Loki share gives the hero/villain relationship a deeper shading and Hiddleston once again refuses to play a purely stock villain (his confidence and certainty is a bluff).

This first act ends with most of the heroes introduced to each other and co-existing as they attempt to decipher Loki's master plan. It's this middle 45-minute chunk where the picture soars the highest. The dialogue is vintage Whedon even while every character speaks in a voice uniquely their own. Tony Stark is genuinely thrilled to be conversing with a scientist of Banner's capabilities, and Banner warmly embraces at least one person who cares more about the scientist than the monster inside of him. Downey Jr. gives a better all-around performance here than he did in Iron Man 2, while Mark Ruffalo once again proves how effortlessly he elevates every film he appears in. Johansson gets several enjoyable moments, including an interrogation sequence that both reveals backstory and establishes character. With all the talk about how noted-feminist Joss Whedon would handle a bro-fest like The Avengers, the answer is simple. Neither Natasha Romanoff (IE - Black Widow) or SHIELD agent Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) are remotely sexualized and their skills are completely taken for granted. Moreover, if you look around the SHIELD aircraft, about half of the onscreen agents just happen to be women. 

 Anyway, this second act is where the picture shines, perfectly balancing character interaction with token plot advancement, while climaxing with a spectacular action set-piece that is both viscerally exciting and emotionally engaging.  Hemsworth gets surprisingly little screen-time overall, considering that the film is most closely connected to Thor, but he gets far more of an opportunity to 'bring the thunder' than he did in his debut picture (at least they bother to explain why Natalie Portman isn't around).  Clark Gregg basically operates as the cool-headed professional amid the carnage as well as occasionally as the audience surrogate, as thrilled to see these guys all in the same room as we theoretically would be.  Smulders is basically an exposition device while Jeremy Renner's Barton (IE - Hawkeye) spends so much time under the brainwashing control of Loki that he doesn't really get to do more than cut loose in the action climax.  Still, pretty much everyone enjoys interacting with everyone else, and the fun is supremely contagious.

Truth be told, the second-act 'conflict' doesn't make sense in hindsight. We're told that these super-powered heroes can't get along, yet they only come to blows when Nick Fury's (a frankly slumming Samuel L. Jackson) subterfuge is revealed. They seem to work together just fine except when SHIELD gets in the way.  Still, the second-act climax pushes a token emotional button, and the film even acknowledges that the would-be hero's journey is somewhat fabricated for the sake of uniting these damaged souls. And the whole concept of 'these grand heroes coming together to solve a problem' seems unnecessary. Point being, if aliens invaded the Earth, would it not be expected that Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the fellow agents of SHIELD would make a choice to at least pitch in and prevent widespread carnage? The idea that Nick Fury has a grand idea to unite these heroes and that these heroes have to put aside their differences to work as a team seems like an attempt to graft an overriding theme to a story that really doesn't have one. It's a minor quibble, but the whole 'Avengers Initiative' that Nick Fury endlessly babbles about seems like a solution to a non-existent problem.

Furthermore, like so many would-be event pictures, the film's storytelling basically ceases at the 2/3 mark so that the big climactic battle scene can begin. If you've seen any of the marketing, you know that the film ends with an alien invasion in downtown Manhattan. The action itself is fluidly shot, creatively staged, and coherently edited. And while it avoids repetition because it has enough recognizable combatants to always have someone different to cut to, the climax is a purely visceral exercise with just enough crowd-pleasing moments to overcome its familiarity to last summer's Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Unlike last summer's Michael Bay FX demo-reel, the invading aliens seem to go out of their way to not vaporize civilians and bystanders onscreen, to the point where their 'shoot to miss' strategy becomes noticeable. And while Alan Silvestri's score is serviceable, it's badly missing some kind of unifying theme and/or emotional chorus that would give the pyrotechnics a jolt when required (Steve Jablonsky may have cribbed the Zeck Hemsy Inception trailer music for the Transformers 3 climax, but it damn-well worked). And the logistics of Loki's plan call into question the basic intelligence of our heroes, as we ask ourselves why they didn't realize where Loki's attack point was going to be right from the start and/or why that specific building doesn't seem to have even basic security measures. Still, the film does right by each of its heroes, giving them each multiple chances to shine (yes, the Hulk does indeed smash and it is pretty terrific when he does).

The climax also highlights the inherent danger of having a shared universe, as you have to somewhat explain why EVERY capable hero doesn't pitch in when the chips are down. As we see human 'Avengers' like Black Widow and Hawkeye doing a perfectly fine job fending off the invaders, we have to stop and wonder why other equally capable reinforcements didn't show up to help. Why are none of the other SHIELD agents defending the city? Why didn't Stark call in Rhodes to man the War Machine battle-suit? Why doesn't Odin conjure up some dark magic and send Asgardian warriors, since it's his son that's causing this chaos in the first place? And without a super-powered villain to fight/destroy in the finale (Loki is around, but he's basically watching his handiwork and sneering) or any kind of status-quo changing moment to end on, the film lacks an emotional climax of any kind (SPOILER - the film needs to end with the heartbreak of Thor killing Loki, but Marvel doesn't have the courage for that kind of finality). It's all about watching people in candy-colored suits blowing up a vaguely-robotic army. Considering Joss Whedon is known for his unabashedly operatic season finales for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, it is borderline shocking that the film lacks any kind of story or character-driven climax to go along with its large-scale action beats (the film further annoys in this regard by threatening to kill the one character who you most-certainly know isn't going to die).

So if the film lacks the heart and narrative discipline of Joe Johnston's Captain America, it is easily better, smarter, and just-plain more entertaining than any Marvel Studios production not set in the 1940s. The dialogue is generally whip-smart and laugh-out-loud clever at the same time. All of the principle performers are in peak form, and the picture has a scale that does its four-color origins proud. And while I may have desired more than just fireworks during the third act, those fireworks are quite impressive and are truly cinematic in nature. But the plot is a bit confused, with much of the film spent jogging in place for the inevitable climactic smack-down promised in the trailers. The film opens and ends pretty terribly, with an epilogue that has a bunch of news footage praising and criticizing the newly revealed heroes plus Fury babbling yet again about how the heroes will return when they are needed while brushing off the shocking real-world implications of what just happened (both the invasion and the response).

But the middle two-hours are rock-solid entertainment through-and-through. Tony Stark is allowed genuine character progression while Mark Ruffalo is such a fun Bruce Banner that I'd gladly watch a solo Hulk film where he never actually 'Hulked-out'. When The Avengers highlights the character interaction that makes up the soap opera-ish world of comic books, with great actors digging into genuinely meaty characters, it's firing on all cylinders. And the action sequences, even when they are purely about the action choreography and special effects, are top-notch (even the 3D looks great). Long-story short, I wish The Avengers was a truly terrific film, but I'll have to settle for it merely being a darn-good movie."

"Jun 13, 2012",positive,"Impressing Visual effects , good cast."
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Brilliant movie favorite movie of the year!!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Really enjoyed this. The dynamics between the heroes are entertainingly explored and the film doesn't lose momentum at any point.  The 3D aspect wasn't necessary as I didn't feel it was utilised well. Kept me engaged for the whole 142 mins!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Enjoyable fun. Reasonable storyline whose twists and turns weren't totally predictable. Good action scenes.
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,That Was A Really Good Movie.!
"Jun 13, 2012",positive,Awesome movie in 2D but it is even better in 3D.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Good action, OK story, should see it in 3D. Didn't like the kiddy humor."
"Jun 12, 2012",negative,"Completely stupid action rubbish. Bored of enless sequels, Marvel have now moved into a ""tag-team"" style format. The individuals don't really have interlocking abilities though. Usual bad man is bad, plot (daddy didn't love him enough - diddums) and the usual, massively overpowered ""heros"" ensures success before the film even begins. Unexpected glee when ""Black Widow"" (lol) tricks the bad man into telling her a secret, and some excellent cartoon-like slapstick moments from the Hulk. Also, a flying aircraft carrier. No, really."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Loved the plot. Best movie ""HULK"" yet!!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Movie was very drawn out.  Hulk made it worth it.  Robert Downey jr was awesome and Scarlett is always great to look at
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Greatest movie I have ever seen so far, it combines action, suspense, comedy and a feel for characters other movies tried so hard to do and fail, iron man was great but avengers is greater and its the only movie to get the hulk right and show how he cool he is."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,this was an awesome movie I loved it
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Seen it four times so far. Will most likely see it again before it leaves theatres!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Great apex after all the build up movies that came before.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"The most solid ensemble heroes flick of the last decade.  Joss Whedon's trademark wit and pacing mark this film as a keeper.  Everyone pulls their weight: from Iron Man, to the recently unthawed Captain America, and even Hawkeye and Black Widow.  Worth the big screen bucks."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Best.  Superhero.  Movie.  Ever.  

Thank you Joss for restoring my faith that such films are still possible."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,good fun show lol several times
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"As good a movie as you'd want or expect with all these super heroes. Lots of fun including laughs, but some shots are dark and hard to see - not a fan."

"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Great film, a must see on the big screen, highly recommended!!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Outstanding and incredible action packed. Marvel doesn't get any better than this.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Honestly, one of the best movies I've ever seen. Every single character had a perfect character arc, and every one got great screen-time. Visual effects were second to none, and every actor/actress is at the top of their game. Really, really good movie."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Great movie. Loved it!!!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"loved this movie, it was the best 3d movie i have seen yet.  lots of 3d though out the movie."
"Jun 12, 2012",neutral,"The appeal of this movie lies in the action sequences. The characters are played well, namely the Hulk, but if you like movies with deeper meaning (Iron Man was a movie about weapons manufacturing, X-Men First Class was about the Cold War) Avengers will disappoint because its all about mindless violence."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"BEST. MOVIE. EVER. I know that there wasn't really anything to AVENGE, but an epic movie topped with some Awesomness. Funny too, but the action was the best. I think the hulk will smash if you hate on him..."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Best movie of the summer!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Without a doubt, the movie poster will be listed with ""blockbuster"" inside the dictionary!!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,It was good not great!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,My kids say it is the best superhero movie ever made.  Hmm...we shall see.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,My new favorite movie!!!!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Non stop action. Every character was given their chance to shine. I didn't even notice the film was over 2 hrs long.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,It was a great movie. Cant wait for part 2 ;)
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Best superhero movie yet...
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Excellent movie. Good storyline and lots of action.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Better than I imagined it would be!
"Jun 12, 2012",negative,I just saw with my wife Scarlet Johannsen's unbelievably brilliant performance in LOST IN TRANSLATION and would DIE to see her like that again. I didn't' hate this. But I am SO SICK OF CG EFX. SICK SICK SICK. All the movies out of Hollywood are crap these days and the RT critics have lost their taste barometers completely! 93% Positive... Horrid.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Takes what made it predeceasing films work and puts it all together, the chemistry of this team is simply perfect, they may not get along but they'd take a bullet for each other. Haven't seen it yet? What are you doing reading what other people think, I know this much, this is one movie released in my lifetime that is destined to be a classic"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Well played Disney.  Nice tie in, great story, love it!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Saw it! Its AWESOME!!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,the best movie out there lots of funny moments while still delivering non stop action.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,was freaking awesome! hulk kicked butt..
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Enjoyable fun summer blockbuster.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,It was pretty great!
"Jun 12, 2012",neutral,"As much as this film was hyped up, I feel that this film falls over the first hurdle right at the early stages. Which really disappoints me, as this was involving many of the Marvel universe characters to be teamed up for the first time, that had done so well on their own from previous blockbuster films.      

I found that the pacing of the story was very slow and was very mellow and really didn't have the same sort of tension you'd normally find from the characters from the comics. Plus, at times, I felt it lacked any sort of direction. 

The only positive side is the companies like Double negative had really put together some top notch VFX, especially during the climatic battle at the end. I'd also like to add that the Hulk character, is a significant improvement from past films in aspects of animation. There were times however, when there was a lot of green screen moments, which looked really awkard on screen, as it felt a bit off. Minor speculation. 

What I really hope to see from the next film, is that they focus more on the story and the character development between one another, rather than focusing on the VFx which we know they can already deliver."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Great action scenes but could've used more. The middle gets a little slow.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Awesome superhero movie! Excellent action and graphics.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Probably the BEST movie this year, bringing together a wide range of cast and joining four separate movie heroes in a seamless and believable story. I am soo watching this one a few hundred more times when it's released in dvd!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"The powerful cast, excellent graphics and brilliant directions makes this film a splendid summer viewing..."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Action packed, witty, and incredible. I don't usually watch superhero movies but I'm glad I saw this one!"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,legan ... wait for it ... dary
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,The comic movie I've been waiting 20 years to see.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Not the perfect Marvel film...but darn close to it.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Put together very well!  I loved it!
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Loved the cinematography. Make sure you stay through the credits for an extra scene.
"Jun 12, 2012",negative,"This is the most overhyped, overrated, and blandly created movie ever created. If you like superhero movies, watch this movie, because you have terrible taste in cinema. If you don't like superheroes and have good taste in cinema, go watch something else. ANYTHING."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Worth the wait. Seen it 4 times and still not enough. I can not find anything really bad to say about it.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,thats was amazing movie
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"From the point of view of a non-comic book fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

A long running time combined with a great deal of scene setting dogged the first half of the film which has prevented me from giving a full 5/5, but once the scene was set and the film fully kicks into top gear, it is utterly flawless in execution. 

Show stealer: Mark Ruffalo - inspired choice for the Hulk."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"After five years of waiting, and 5 other movies, it is finally here! And man was this movie awesome. I was honestly expecting to be disapointed, just because this movie was so hyped and to think about it, it was the 6th film in a series, but it was really good. Loki as the bad guy (I thought before it was a poor choice) was dead on. He was much more evil compared to more jealous and trickster like in Thor. All the heroes were good and it didn't feel all mashed together. They all kept their induviduality, which I was afraid wouldn't happen, but Robert Downey, Jr. steals the show (but not too much that he over shadows everyone else). Plus there are some sweet fight scenes between the heroes, Hulk vs Thor, Thor vs Iron Man, and we were kind of robbed of Iron Man vs Captain American, but I guess I'll forgive them. Also, Mark Ruffalo was a much better Bruce Banner then I thought he would be. The movie is just shy of 2 and a half hours, but its not draggy whatsoever. I honestly wished it was longer. Minus the Dark Knight, the Avengers is my favorite super hero/comic movie."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Great movie for the nerd on all of us
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Cuando Hollywood contrata a un guionista de comics para rodar una pelÃ­cula pueden suceder dos cosas diametralmente opuestas. Una es The Spirit. Otra es Los Vengadores.

El seÃ±or Weedon hace una muy buena peli de superheroes pero no termina de bordarla debido a que repite los problemas que ya se vieron en Serenity: guiÃ³n flojo y sin chicha pero unos diÃ¡logos estupendos. Si en Los Vengadores 2 trabajase el trasfondo de la historia de la misma manera que las pullas verbales que se tiran los unos a los otros, serÃ­a la mejor pelÃ­cula de superheroes de la historia."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Amazing. It takes your expectations for a superhero movie, let alone Marvel film, and blows it out of the water sky high. The characters were perfect, the story was perfect, the effects where perfect, I have not one complaint. If I did, it would come across as nitpicking and when it comes to film, it's not how I play."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Best movie I have seen in a very long time. Amazing
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"The first marvel film that manages to balance action and comedy, combining characters that didn't work too well in their own films (Captain America and Thor) that work well in this one."

"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Liked it, good 'in' jokes and ties in the characters well.  Not sure about the whole 'Loki' as a bad guy thing (too wimpy) but overall it was a good film"
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"Awesome movie!  Besides a little dawdling in first half, the movie made a huge stride in second half. Action was top notch. Great humor and hulk's smash were inevitably the main highlights of the movie. Two thumbs up!!"

"Jun 12, 2012",positive,The best super hero movie to date.
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"F****** Awesome! Robert Downey JR. always gives us one hell of a performance! I wish though the new hulk had his own movie like all the others. I could see him being a good hulk but he's drowned out in this film because of everyone's else presence, which just made me miss Edward Norton that much more. That would have been one hell of a movie to see Robert and Edward look out. I really like how this series is going adding each characters own movie then adding em into the fray with the others."
"Jun 12, 2012",positive,Very action-packed! Must see for Marvel fans!

"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"With the release of Iron Man in 2008, Marvel Studios ignited an unprecedented plan in movie marketing.  Instead of simply commissioning another super hero team-up film and inundating the public with commercials, web banners, and billboards, Marvel decided to âdouble down.â?  In an effort to separate themselves from other Marvel properties licensed out to 20th Century Fox, such as X-Men and The Fantastic Four, Marvel Studios spotlighted each major character from ""The Avengers"" in their own feature film.  The five films: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, all achieved moderate to great success at the box office.  But their individual accolades were simply byproducts of their primary function; extremely expensive and well-made commercials to generate unparalleled anticipation for an Oceanâ(TM)s Eleven-esque super hero extravaganza that could blow the mind of even the most critical of all fan bases.  Marvel Studios placed its fate in the $220 million hands of this film, trusting it will serve as the lightning rod for the next round of individual sequels as well as new projects.  But first, The Avengers must make the dollars assemble.

Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow and The Hulk must unite as a team to fight off the alien invasion attempt by Thorâ(TM)s adopted brother and the God of Trickery, Loki, and secure the Cosmic Cube before he . . . oh does the synopsis really matter? Itâ(TM)s The Avengers for god sake.  Earthâ(TM)s mightiest heroes come together to save the world, duh.  With a built-in audience of this proportion that wouldâ(TM)ve purchased tickets before there was even a capital âTâ? on the scriptâ(TM)s title page, itâ(TM)s the âhow,â? not the âwhyâ? thatâ(TM)s important.

Joss Whedon, revered for his sci-fi television work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly, is the very brave soul who took on the directing and screenplay writing for this incredibly ambitious project.  Before Whedon even uttered the word âactionâ? for the first time on set, his biggest challenge would be obvious; allocate ample screen time for all of the characters while simultaneously keeping them relevant to the plot.  The X-Men franchise failed in that attempt with major pieces feeling like they were crowbarred into the story like Halle Berryâ(TM)s Storm and James Marsdenâ(TM)s Cyclops.

Whedonâ(TM)s result?  Well, say all-time great and Hall of Fame baseball player Mickey Mantle hit a ball out of Yankee Stadium, then The Hulk who just happened to be standing right outside eating hot dogs and smashing the cart, jumps up and thunderclaps the ball into outer space, at which time Superman, on a slow crime day, flies by during a âClean-Up The Orbitâ? walk-a-thon, catches the ball and flings it into the next galaxy as he very irresponsibly litters across the universe . . . it would still not match the mammoth home run that is the film, The Avengers.

In creating this film, Whedon has reveled his own super powered alter ego.  He is simply âThe Maestro.â?  Every character, no really, every character is integral to the story.  Much like The Hulk himself, the filmâ(TM)s BMI is 0, itâ(TM)s pure muscle, not an ounce of fat added or a second wasted.  Even unheralded characters like Jeremy Rennerâ(TM)s Hawkeye and Scarlett Johanssonâ(TM)s Black Widow are emphasized with paralleled importance and captivation to the main players within the plot.  Whedon conducts a master symphony for how to incorporate a large cast into a heightened reality without losing the individual relationships and genuinely humorous moments between the characters.

No one is going to mistake lines from The Avengers with The Shawshank Redemption, however the The Avengers' script carefully walks the tightrope between movie and comic book quality dialogue.  The intangible and sometimes corny feeling of a comic book is present when characters like Captain America speak, but the syntax is amped-up to match the grandiose stage of the film.

As important as good dialogue is to a film, a comic book movie is DOA without great fight scenes.  The action in The Avengers is the stuff of pure geek dreams with special attention paid to The Hulk.  As with every hero team-up in comic book history, the characters are not friends right away, first they must have a misunderstanding and square off against one another.  Itâ(TM)s just an old, but necessary tactic in comics so that fans get to see how one hero would do in battle versus another.  Kudos to Whedon for keeping that time-honored tradition and having the wherewithal to know that much of what makes a successful comic book film are the things you donâ(TM)t change.

Of course for the film to even have a prayer at joining the upper echelon of super hero cinema, The Avengers need to battle an exceptional villain.  Loki played once again by Tom Hiddleston from Thor, gets to flex his âevil muscleâ? even more than in the characterâ(TM)s previous film.  In one particular stand-out scene, Hiddleston exhibits Lokiâ(TM)s power of breaking down a personâ(TM)s psyche in such a menacing way that it temporarily revs up the characterâ(TM)s âevil meterâ? to Joker-like levels, further exemplifying the pain and unraveling Loki continues to deal with himself.

As for the heroes, the chemistry between the big four of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans) is quite impressive.  Fittingly, the mood and conversation is very awkward when they first meet, but by the end of the film itâ(TM)s as if theyâ(TM)ve known each other for years.  Downeyâ(TM)s 1:1 depiction of Tony Stark from the comics is once again unsurpassed, but to spotlight another performance and perhaps the most challenging to convey in all the sci-fi madness is Chris Evans' Captain America/Steve Rodgers.  Rodgers not only has to deal with an alien invasion, trusting new teammates and the fate of the world, but heâ(TM)s also still grieving over the loss of everything heâ(TM)s ever known from his life in the 1940â(TM)s.  The introduction of a new and confusing world in 2012 is as alien to him as Lokiâ(TM)s army.  Evans is able to incorporate a believable innocence and ignorance for Captain America, galvanizing the team at their most difficult moment and elevating to the levelheaded and courageous leader everyone respects.

Earthâ(TM)s mightiest heroes were already smashing box office records around the world before Day 1 on US screens.  Even more important, this film will earn repeat business that could rival Titanic or Avatar, making it the 12th film to break the billion-dollar mark.  That kind of revenue would prove the formula used by Marvel Studios to set up this film is an unmitigated success, green lighting each of the individual Avenger's sequels, scripts for lesser-known characters in Marvelâ(TM)s gallery and an inevitable counter reaction from rival DC Comics to finally bring ""The Justice League"" to the big screen.

Epilogue:  Five Years Later

After ""The Avengers 2"" and ""The Justice League"" rake in a combined total $1 Zillion, producers from each studio will be taken by stealth submarine to a secret meeting with director James Cameron at the bottom of the Mariana Trench to negotiate a deal for ""The Avengers Vs The Justice League"" in Super IMAX 5D Hologram resulting in a paradox that will turn hair white and burn out the eye sockets of every geek in the world, a la what the âburning bushâ? did to Moses in The Ten Commandments and the Ark of the Covenant to the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark, respectively.

"Jun 12, 2012",positive,"When I see the movie, I felt like this is Iron Man and Hulk movie. The other heroes aren't that important! Good comedy, cool CGI and actually it's already expected to be good. Just lack of overwhelming sequence. It's only whelming and although it's a great family movie but absolutely isn't the movie of the year or something."
