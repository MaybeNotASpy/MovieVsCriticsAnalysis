"Apr 10, 2024",negative," It's the end of the year and everyone is exhausted and ready for rest — except for the kids, who are hyped up on candy cane sugar and the prospect of the long days of summer stretching out before them.  Fear not! There are a host of kid-friendly films coming out, which you can plonk the kids in front of while you sit in silence, and which you might actually enjoy yourself.  A grab bag of storytelling tropes, generic characters and musical styles from the well-thumbed Disney playbook, Wish unfolds in a one-size-fits-all fairytale land ruled by the sorcerer king Magnifico (a comedically underutilised Chris Pine).  Magnifico's benevolent dream of nurturing and granting the wishes of his constituency has curdled into selfish tyranny: He's keeping all the wishes in the kingdom's mystical vault, to be handed out whenever he deems one of his citizens worthwhile.  But when plucky teenager Asha (Ariana DeBose, doing the thing) wishes upon a star — which looks like a Miyazaki sprite reconfigured as a corporate emoji — she sets in motion a challenge to the sorcerer's supremacy, championing a humanist utopia where the dreams are reclaimed for the people. No points for guessing that this analogy for the dangers of monopolising dreams is drenched in irony, coming from the corporation with a stranglehold on the childhood fantasies of generations.That's just business as usual for the Mouse House (""When it comes to the universe, we're all shareholders,"" is an actual lyric in one of the new songs here). Set that aside and there are sprinklings of the old Disney magic to be found — including an amusing chorus of chickens, a talking goat who might have sprung from Pinocchio's Pleasure Island and a forest full of animals that even features a cameo from Bambi. The showtunes — primarily penned by singer Julia Michaels and songwriter Benjamin Rice — are a little forgettable, though on occasion (This Wish; I'm a Star) they generate sparks. (Plus, it's hard to resist when the refrain from When You Wish Upon A Star is threaded into parts of the score.) Wish isn't about to challenge Frozen for kids' repeat-viewing supremacy, but you could do worse for a pre-teen movie diversion this summer holidays. The impulse to account for how some fictional freak (complimentary) got to be the way they are — especially tempting when wading into that most cash-grabby of genres, the origin story — is one usually best avoided. As with a magic trick, to 'explain' this is to reduce a character to less than the sum of their parts – to sub out a tantalising mystery for a game of connect the dots. It's rather a relief to be introduced to a young Wonka who, as incarnated by Timothée Chalamet, is already a fully formed chocolate wizard (slash magician slash inventor). He's just arrived in a new city after seven years at sea, ready to launch his confectionary career — even if the money-grubbing members of the local ""chocolate cartel"" (Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton) are less than welcoming. Deep Roy played 165 Oompa Loompas (including an entire glam rock band) in Tim Burton's 2005 film adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Will Hugh Grant in 2023's Wonka ever measure up? Director Paul King (Paddington, Paddington 2) applies a fairly light touch when it comes to psychoanalysing his protagonist's obsession – unlike Tim Burton's 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with its flashback to Willy's childhood under the thumb of a sugar-hating dentist.  King preserves and, in fact, amplifies Wonka's magic. What does gets muted in the translation, however, is the unnerving weirdness of Roald Dahl's character – his darkness, his off-putting humour. The misadventures of the bratty Golden Ticket winners in the Wonka factory, as recounted in Dahl's 1964 book, reveal a candy man with a truly warped sense of ""just desserts"". Chalamet's Wonka, meanwhile, is willing to abandon his calling for the sake of new pal Noodle (Calah Lane).  The Dune star gamely gives Willy his all, and proves endearing in the role, convincing even, but he hasn't got a madcap bone in his body. He looks like he belongs in a pre-Raphaelite painting, not a zany sweet shop. If the film isn't quite up to the preternaturally scrumdiddlyumptious standard of its namesake, then it would certainly still pass muster at any of Wonka's rival chocolate companies. It's ducks amuck in this animated adventure from family-friendly hitmakers Illumination Studios (Minions; Sing; The Super Mario Bros. Movie), as a flock of New England mallards find their feathers ruffled on an unexpected trip to the frightening big pond of New York City. Convinced by his wife (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) and ducklings (Caspar Jennings and Tresi Gazal) to take a break from the winter doldrums, a beleaguered drake (Kumail Nanjiani) gathers up the family — and a tagalong deadbeat uncle (Danny DeVito) — and heads south for the warmer climes of Jamaica.  Best laid eggs soon go awry when a cloud of fog sends them off course and tumbling into Manhattan — where the mallard-justed skein run a-fowl of a deranged but resourceful pigeon (Awkwafina, channelling Natasha Lyonne), and fall into the clutches of a dastardly restaurant with Duck à l'Orange on the menu. Much like their Minions and Sing series, Illumination's latest feature is bright and bouncy and largely pitched to audiences who've only recently learned to waddle, with plenty of sight gags that will quack up undemanding audiences.  Screenwriter Mike White (The White Lotus) lands a few serviceable jokes amid the standard-issue story beats, while French director Benjamin Renner (who was Oscar-nominated for 2012's Ernest & Celestine), garnishes the farce with the occasional visual grace note (there's a shot of the ducks cruising across the New York skyline that really is quite poetic).  Keegan-Michael Key, meanwhile, does an amusingly over-the-top accent as a caged Jamaican parrot who longs for his tropical homeland, and — proving it's been a banner year for heron representation — the legendary Carol Kane lends her voice to a trickster bird that gives Robert Pattinson a run for his squawking money. Despite being a sequel to the biggest hit in DC's Extended Universe, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom arrives as the ignominious end of the line for Warner Bros' troubled superhero franchise, with new bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran having officially announced the end for Jason Momoa's underwater beefcake. Having ascended to the throne of Atlantis, Aquaman (Momoa) is dividing his time between regal duties and raising his new baby with Queen Mera (a barely present Amber Heard, not exactly dispelling those wild behind-the-scenes rumours.) That is until David Kane (Candyman's Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) — hell-bent on avenging the death of his father in the first movie — happens upon an ancient, all-powerful trident and summons the dark magic of a fabled lost kingdom to wreak havoc upon Atlantis. To protect his people, Aquaman must team up on a quest with his exiled brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), make a whole bunch of lazily written wisecracks and pound a few six-packs of Guinness with his dad (Temuera Morrison). (Let's just try and ignore the fact that they're drinking them straight outta the can.) There's also a plot about global warming and an impending climate catastrophe, which has something to do with the villain burning chunks of a mythical substance called Orichalcum (stop sniggering, it's a thing). In theory, any movie teeming with fantastical ocean creatures, neon-streaked underwater metropolises and Nicole Kidman riding a freakin' cybernetic shark should be a no-brainer blast of escapism. The film borrows liberally from The Lord of the Rings, Jules Verne, Avatar and Star Wars (Martin Short voices a Jabba the Hutt-like gangster fish, bless), among others, yet can't summon much in the way of its own personality.

"Apr 10, 2024",negative," Founding the island kingdom of Rosas, the sorcerer Magnifico (Chris Pine) collects the fondest wishes from everyone willing to offer them, each hoping they’ll one day be granted. Unfortunately, those who part with them forget what their wishes were, waiting ceremony after ceremony for their special day to arrive. Enter Asha (Ariana DeBose), an idealistic but scrappy girl about to turn eighteen and seeking to apprentice with the sorcerer king she believes in… until she learns most of the collected wishes will never be granted. After losing any chance of getting the job by confronting Magnifico about his policies, Asha is inexplicably allowed to depart with this dangerous knowledge, later wishing upon a star to fix the problem no one can remember. To her and the audience’s surprise, a star named (wait for it) “Star” actually shows up to do something or another, and it just gets weirder from there (not in a good way). Last year’s Elemental by Disney/Pixar looked like it had the chops to be the next big/cool thing from the Mouse House. While it chugged along to some success, “the magic” seemed to be missing, even more so than the lackluster Encanto, about a magical house owned by a vindictive grandma (you know it’s true). With a century of Disney works and animation in the Hollywood history books, the search was on for some kind of cinematic celebration, but instead of a Fantasia sequel or other introspective idea, moviegoers instead got Wish. Whether this began as an original idea co-opted for the anniversary or a creation designed around a bullet-pointed checklist, deliberate choices were made. Magic? Check. Kingdom? Check. Awkward yet spunky heroine either in or involving herself with the royal court and causing disruptions to the status quo? Check. An irredeemable yet worthy villain to be defeated at all costs? Well… let’s look a little bit closer at what co-directors Chris Buck (Frozen and Frozen II) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (Raya and the Last Dragon) have put their names on here. From the moment we meet Magnifico, hints of his paranoia are obvious, handsome smiles and charismatic facade be damned. From seeking his own power to putting down any threat to what he’s created (read: exclusively his), we’re never given a real reason why, just a shredded tapestry, something about “never again,” and a mysterious book of forbidden magic no one should ever use — plus more than a few clues he’s kind of a jerk. On the flipside, Asha has no power other than hope and spunk, but everything goes her way as long as she keeps trying; she never makes an unpopular decision or ever actually evolves, because obviously she was perfect just as she was. In the meantime, there are a ridiculous number of songs — each as mediocre as the next — in addition to a barrage of Easter eggs hinting at better Disney fare. Every decision seems to stop at the first idea anyone had and is never plussed in any way or given any complexity; does anyone there still Pixar anymore? Maybe it would have been a better idea to model this 100-year celebratory film after The Emperor’s New Groove and make fun of everything rather than peddle a lifeless husk dressed up like a feature film. Wish teases a hardship backstory which could have introduced sympathy for the villain (instead of alt-evil Captain Kirk from the Kelvin timeline), but in retrospect the shredded tapestry may have only been a nod to the prince’s clawed portrait in Beauty and the Beast. In other words, how is anyone supposed to notice the real story clues from all the winking and nodding? Why do the seven members of the kitchen staff seem oddly familiar? Why do so many of the wishes look lifted from the plots of older Disney films? Never mind when the light bad guy goes extra bad (you’ll guess exactly how that happens) and suddenly all the magic is “wicked Disney green.” There’s nothing to solve or really look forward to because even the surprises feel unexceptional — obligation rather than revelation — reminding fans of better Disney animated films and tropes. In fact, the end credit sequence does exactly the same thing; instead of celebrating how awesome what they just watched was, characters from previous animated classics are shown as though made of stardust. Yeah, sure, okay. The Little Mermaid in 1989 was credited for the start of Disney’s Renaissance animation period, one that ended with Tarzan ten years later. Fast forward another decade, and the studio’s traditional animation gave in to full CGI, but the storytelling was still there… until now. With barely enough material to make it over ninety minutes once you add in the credits, it’s clear Wish exists merely because the studio demanded it."
"Apr 10, 2024",neutral," The problem with Wish, Walt Disney’s official 100th anniversary production, is not that it is a bad film. It is that is crushingly ordinary. While undoubtedly there are many younger viewers – and young at heart, of course – will be entertained, in the long term this is not going to be remembered as one of the greats. Directors Chris Buck (Tarzan, Frozen) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (head of story on Raya and the Last Dragon) have both made better films. On the Mediterranean island of Rosas, 17 year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose) auditions to become apprentice to king and sorcerer Magnifico (Chris Pine). Magnifico is loved by the people for granting random wishes out of dreams given to him by his subjects. When Asha learns that Magnifico’s actions are not so benevolent, and she is visited by the very star that she wished on, Asha resolves to free Magnifico’s captured wishes and return them to their owners. There is a superficial resemblance here to Neil Gaiman’s novella Stardust, but really the origins of the story are fairly obvious: the events are initiated by a character wishing on a star. This is not the only reference to Disney’s animated history to be found in Wish. The production runs awash with visual and character-based cues from Mickey Mouse to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid, and many others. According to one Internet source I read, these nods run to at least 40. It turns the film into something of an Easter egg hunt, distracting from and weakening the main storyline. One or two might have been rather cute. 40 is definitely some way beyond overkill. Asha is a reasonable protagonist and Magnifico a semi-decent villain, but the film’s supporting cast runs far too broad and numerous. Asides from Asha’s mother, grandfather, and pet goat (voiced by Disney stalwart Alan Tudyk), she also has seven close friends – each one resembling one of Snow White‘s seven dwarfs. While viewers might remember royal baker Dalhia (Jennifer Kumiyama) and the irascible Gabo (Harvey Guillén) by the end of the movie, it seems unlikely they will also be able to name and identify Hal, Simon, Bazeema, Safi, and Dario. The film becomes overburdened with characters, all to make a film reference. Aesthetically there is a bold attempt to blend computer-generated animation with a flat, painterly look intended to resemble hand-drawn traditional art. As an experiment it is interesting, but as an overall presentation the look backfires. The loss of detail makes the animation look weaker. More than once I was reminded of a cut scene in a videogame. The songs, by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, seem to hit all of the expected beats without generating a specific ‘knock-out’ musical number. The same goes for Dave Metzger’s orchestral score, which feels suited to the events onscreen yet never inspires much enthusiasm. These drawbacks represent Wish in a nutshell: it is competent but boring, typically Disneyesque yet unenthused and forgettable. The quality of the Walt Disney Animation Studios goes up and down with time, like any long-running enterprise. Wish seems to catch the studio in a fallow period. 2022’s Strange World was uncharacteristically poor, and looking forward there is nothing announced but sequels. It is slightly unfortunate that Wish‘s closing credits are decorated with images of Disney’s long legacy of animated features (although, notably, The Rescuers, The Black Cauldron, and a handful of 1940s films fail to get a look in.) They are there to be celebratory, but simply remind us how much better Walt Disney can be."
"Apr 5, 2024",negative," You know the star that streaks above Cinderella’s castle in the intro to every Disney movie? Well, in Wish (now streaming on Disney+), the star is an actual character, apt for an animated musical released in acknowledgment of Disney 100, the brand title assigned to the entity’s celebration of a century in business. And so we get a classic-style Disney tale of magic and castles and anthropomorphic animals, led by a plucky princess-type voiced by Ariana DeBose (who won an Oscar for 2021’s West Side Story). Mediocre word of mouth led to reluctance to venture to theaters led to disappointing box office returns (about $250 million worldwide, a mini-flop by Big Disney Movie standards) – and perhaps growing ennui for Disney product that feels so calculatedly on-brand. Suffice to say, where you land on the spectrum of Disney fandom is likely to dictate how much you enjoy an overly familiar story with all the usual genre trappings, albeit with one new element: Bountiful references to Disney animated musicals past. Some of you just read that sentence and wrinkled your nose. I did too. But maybe it won’t be TOO annoying, right?  The Gist: The kingdom of Rosas was a perfect utopia – and then growing resentment for the ruler who only wants to control his subjects hit! King Magnifico (Chris Pine) founded Rosas as a safe place for all who wish to live there, but that security doesn’t come without a cost. Once residents settle down in Rosas, they have to give Magnifico a wish. Those wishes manifest as floating bubbles that the king keeps safe in his castle, and once a month, using benevolent sorcery that’s about to become not so benevolent, he uses his magic powers to grant one person their wish. This doesn’t make much sense if you think about it even a little bit, but we should just try to enjoy the song that explains it all and move on. Our protagonist is Asha (DeBose), a 17-year-old Rosasite (Rosasanian?) who works as a tour guide for prospective residents. She has a 100-year-old grandfather and a mother who has near zero defining characteristics and a kind father who used to sit in a tree with her and wish upon stars before he died. That’s sad. You may cry now. Here, have a tissue. Go ahead and blow. Asha is so dedicated to her beloved homeland, she scored a plum job interview to be Magnifico’s apprentice – but during that interview she learns that the king is a vain j-hole who probably loves smelling his own farts, and a control freak who will never grant her 100-year-old grandfather’s wish. Why? Magnifico thinks a simple wish to inspire other people might prompt things like independent thought, peasant revolt or even – gasp – the ability to poke holes in the convoluted premise of this movie, and therefore see through his scheme to maintain rule over the land. Asha isn’t a fan of this. She pushes back a little. She doesn’t get the job. Crestfallen, Asha and her pet goat Valentino, who wears what I can only describe as a custom goat onesie, venture out to wish upon a star. And when she wishes upon a star, does everything her heart desires come to her? No! Gotcha there! You weren’t expecting THAT answer, were you? Rather, what happens is, the star comes down to her. The physics of this occurrence are, of course, affected by Disney magic; surely, this isn’t a movie in which a massive ball of broiling, unfathomably hot gas obliterates the planet with the nigh-incomprehensible force of its gravity. No, the star is alive, and about the size of a baseball, and it has a little emoji face. She names it not Harold or Jane or Carmichael, but Star. It can hear and respond to her and even perform feats of magic, e.g., rendering anthropomorphic all animals within magicshot, which means Valentino now has the voice of Alan Tudyk, and that bunny over there and that deer over there now very much resemble beloved Disney characters from other movies. Drink! Asha’s first order of business is to bust into Magnifico’s castle and steal her grandpa’s wish back. But Magnifico saw the star fall, and is enraged by the thought of a magical occurrence happening that he didn’t perpetrate himself, so Asha’s staring down the barrel of a tricky endeavor. Meanwhile, the queen, Amaya (Angelique Cabral) exists, and becomes a plot device. Asha wonders if Star can help her enact real change around this joint. Magnifico senses the growing unrest, so he descends into his secret Plummet Hole to become super-extra-evil. And everyone involved in this plot eventually stumbles over half-hearted references to Peter Pan, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Snow White and all your all-time favorite Disney films. Hooray for Disney! Happy birthday! If your wish was for this movie to make a billion dollars, I’m sorry! Better luck next time! What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Wish is sub-Encanto. Actually, Encanto was pretty good, so Wish is more sub-Tangled. That one isn’t as good. It’s fine, though, where Wish is aggressively OK, and nothing more. Performance Worth Watching: Normally with an animated feature, I get cute and rejigger this to be “performance worth hearing,” but, DeBose’s spirited singing aside, I remained uninspired. And so this acknowledgment goes to Star himself, being a purely visual being who communicates with action over words, a boon to those of us who think too many characters in animated movies gibber on and on and on and on. Also, Star is symbolic of Disney Wonder And Greatness, and therefore deserves all the praise. Hooray for Star! Hooray for Disney! Can I be acclimated into the Disney Borg now? Our Take: Anyone else grasp the irony that Wish is essentially a cautionary tale about the danger of belonging to a cult led by someone who appears benevolent but is actually quite sinister? (Bob Iger’s ears might be feeling warm right now, or maybe Walt himself just rolled over in his cryogenic death-box.) Now, speaking as someone who absolutely enjoyed a recent incredibly expensive trip to Disney World, and who appreciates many of the entity’s films as both art and entertainment, and might marry Donald Duck if given the chance, and doesn’t believe in Disney magic but sometimes finds it very persuasive, but doesn’t go home to bask in a shrine full of Disney paraphernalia (Star Wars doesn’t count – I collected mostly all that crap before the big buyout), I can say that Wish is a bit much, but also not enough.  Allow me to clarify: A collection of references does not a movie make, and this one comes rather close to being that; it’s a bit much. And the story is a two-thirds realized conglomeration of familiarities that could use more narrative beef and less barely disguised self-congratulation; it’s not enough. The only way Wish departs from formula is by back-end feeding itself to itself. Where some Disney films are objectively derivative, this one is the narrative equivalent of exiting the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train through the gift shop and loading up on obscenely overpriced souvenirs.  Now, the animation is first-rate. The star is cute. The goat is almost funny. DeBose’s performance is notable. I chuckled two, maybe three times. At a little over 90 minutes, it moves quickly. The number “Knowing What I Know Now” roused a little bit of passion. I wasn’t necessarily bored, nor was I enthralled. I was vaguely engaged in the story. Is that good enough to commemorate an entire century of multimedia domination? Most definitely not. Wish looks back when it should push forward. Maybe Disney 101 will give us something more vital, instead of something merely watchable. Our Call: Disney 100 turns up a catch-22: Those who have seen many Disney movies are the target audience of Wish, but those who have seen many Disney movies have already seen everything in this movie. SKIP IT. "
"Apr 3, 2024",positive," El fenómeno Wish ha sido curioso. Disney decidió honrar sus 100 años de historia con una película de animación que rememorara los viejos tiempos al mismo tiempo que presentaba a las nuevas generaciones una protagonista lo bastante interesante como para aceptarla en los estándares modernos. Demasiadas cosas, ¿no? Este doble objetivo causó el malestar de la crítica, pero se llevó el favor del público de manera aplastante, lo que inevitablemente lleva a una reflexión: ¿la prensa especializada ha perdido su inocencia para disfrutar de las películas? Si algo requiere Wish para poder disfrutar de ella es llegar sin expectativas, igual que llegábamos a las películas cuando éramos niños. Si pienso un poco en esos años, miro con envidia la libertad de ver cine sin condiciones, sin estar corrompida por reseñas ajenas o por la información que me ha llegado antes de darle al 'play'. Esas noches de viernes en las que tus padres te sorprendían con una cinta de la que no sabías nada pero te tragabas igualmente. Ese es el espíritu que quiere recuperar. Disney confió a algunos de sus mejores profesionales la misión de rendir tributo al centenario de la compañía de Mickey Mouse. Por un lado está Chris Buck y Jennifer Lee, ambos autores de Frozen y su secuela -no hace falta que añadamos más-; por otro, Fawn Veerasunthorn, cineasta que estuvo al mando de la historia de Raya y el último dragón (2021). Un equipo de ases que han sacado adelante una película muy decente, pero que se queda corta ante su monumental curriculum. Wish se centra en una chica de 17 años que vive en un reino dominado por la magia del rey Magnífico. Todos los habitantes donan sus deseos al trasladarse allí y esperan pacientemente a que el rey se los cumpla. Es una historia que rompe con la tónica general de las aventuras de la compañía, principalmente por la dinámica entre los personajes. Lo realmente importante aquí no es que Asha sea una chica joven con ideas propias -de esas ya hay varias, por suerte-, sino que está apoyada por una comunidad que la quiere y, en concreto, por una reina que decide escucharla a pesar de que las consecuencias pueden ir en su contra. Quizás no tiene las canciones pegadizas que muchos esperaban o la solidez argumental de joyas como Encanto, pero Wish logra traer al público una sencillez y candidez que hacía tiempo que no veíamos."
"Mar 12, 2024",positive," The lyrics, ""When you wish upon a star..."" are rather synonymous with a large mouse house and its parent company, The Walt Disney Company (https://thewaltdisneycompany.com). Therefore, it should come as a shock to no one that Disney Studios put out an animated film during its 100th anniversary called Wish. Released just before Thanksgiving 2023, the movie was seen as a love letter to the first 100 years of the Iconic Mouse and the empire that surrounds him. Filled with ""Easter Eggs""' Wish embodies the ideals Walt Disney imagined a century ago, now it can be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home with the Blu-ray combo pack being released for sale at your local retailer and in a special Wal-Mart Exclusive 4K SteelBook. Living in the Kingdom of Rosas, 17-year-old, Asha (Ariana DeBose; West Side Story) interviews with King Magnifico (Chris Pine; Star Trek) to become his new apprentice.  The King holds onto all Rosas citizens' greatest dreams and once a month grants someone back their wish.  In becoming his assistant, Asha hopes the King will grant her grandfather's (Victor Garbor; Alias) wish in honor of his 100th (Disney, anyone?) Birthday. When the King refuses, Asha and her friends learn that there is more to the king and his kingdom than meets the eye. However, she makes her wish on a star and suddenly she sees a way to set every citizen's wish free. DeBose has moved up the ranks from the ensemble in Hamilton to leading roles in a few short years and the accolades are well deserved.  She has an incredible singing voice and she is solid in any role she takes on.  Pine, while not the most talented singer, manages to get through his songs while infusing the King with a deeply resonant and commanding voice. Alan Tudyk (Resident Alien) is a master at voices and this time lends his vocal talent to one very cute goat named Valentino. The rest of the ensemble is good as well and helps to round out the vocals nicely. The 2160p video quality is excellent which helps the audience to pick out some of the more subtle ""Easter eggs""  and show intense detail on the clothing worn by the characters.  The colors look great and have subtle highlights and the bright yellowish-gold color of the star helps to make it jump out of the screen at the viewer. Dolby Atmos soundtrack is most noticeable in the orchestration of the songs with layers upon layers of instruments topped by the smooth vocals.  The dialogue utilizes the front speakers while the ambient sounds invade the ears from all directions. Besides Play Movie and Sing Along with the Movie options there are almost two hours of extras including Once Upon a Studio, 100 Years in the Making: The Story of Wish, Wish D-Classified, Outtakes, Deleted Song ""A Wish Worth Making"", and Deleted Scenes.  The 100 Years in the Making extra is a very comprehensive, multi-part, hour-long documentary-style piece that pays homage to what came before. It is worth the combo pack purchase price all on its own. While Disney had its heart in the right place, Wish needed more time and work to make it worthy of celebrating 100 years of the most recognizable animated character on the planet.

"Jan 4, 2024",positive," Wish: el poder de los deseos (Wish, Estados Unidos / 2023). Dirección: Chris Buck, Fawn Veerasunthorn. Guion: Jennifer Lee, Allison Moore. Música: Dave Metzger. Edición: Jeff Draheim. Con las voces de: Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, Alan Tudyk, Angelique Cabral, Victor Garber, Natasha Rothwell, Jennifer Kumiyama, Harvey Guillén, Niko Vargas, Evan Peters, Ramy Youssef. Duración: 95 minutos. Calificación: Apta para todo público. Distribuidora: Disney. Nuestra opinión: buena. Tantas veces ha sido imitado, homenajeado o directamente plagiado, que Disney decidió celebrar su primer centenario con un grandilocuente homenaje a gran parte de su historia, disfrazado de moderna película de aventuras. La pregunta es si el espectador actual es capaz de valorar esta suerte de interlineado audiovisual de corte autorreferencial, o solamente se quedará en la cáscara externa que, dicho sea de paso, no tiene mucho para dar. Como para que queden dudas de qué es lo importante a la hora de emprender un proyecto como el de Wish: el poder de los deseos, el estudio decidió crear toda una película basándose en su tema más emblemático, el de Pinocho, “When You Wish Upon A Star”. Y de esa manera hacerse su propio regalo de cumpleaños. Con voz en off y libro de cuentos incluido, el film comienza narrando la historia de un hombre que, luego de perder a su familia, se convirtió en poderoso hechicero, rey y custodio de los sueños del pueblo de Rosas (Chris Pine). Pero con una singularidad: cada habitante, al cumplir los 18 años, ofrenda su deseo más íntimo al mago e inmediatamente lo olvida, a la espera de que el todopoderoso líder acepte o no concedérselo. Este esquema presumiblemente virtuoso se quiebra cuando la joven Asha (Ariana DeBose, en el original), aspirante a “aprendiz del brujo” descubre que este es en realidad un dictador egomaníaco que no concederá nada que pueda significar poner en peligro su liderazgo. El Síndrome de Hubris animado, a todo color y apto para todo público. Con la ayuda de una mágica estrella y un grupo de diversos amigos que, más o menos convencidos, la ayudarán a desenmascarar al villano, Asha pasa de ser una leal súbdita a convertirse en la líder que lleva adelante una revolución para liberar los anhelos de todos. Porque como bien decía Pepe Grillo en su canción: “Cuando le pides un deseo a una estrella, no importa quién eres. Todo lo que desee tu corazón vendrá a tí”. Con esta base esquemática y maniquea -que remite a la piedra basal que convirtió a Disney en lo que fue y es-, Wish inicia un recorrido por innumerables referencias a la obra de la compañía creada por el viejo Walt. Tantas que por momentos uno se descubre autodesafiándose a encontrar la mayor cantidad posible de guiños al pasado, como si se tratara de un concurso, en lugar de prestarle total atención al relato. Total, se entiende igual. Y así se multiplican los tesoros ocultos: los amigos de Asha análogos a los siete enanitos, el abuelo de la protagonista cumpliendo cien años y deseando crear “algo que trascienda generaciones”, un tal Peter que sueña con volar, una mujer buscando el vestido perfecto, un oso llamado John, Bambi, varitas mágicas, entre muchas otras alusiones que no se pueden revelar porque adelantarían el desenlace de la historia. Igualmente, vale aclarar que no se trata de una película pensada solo para cincuentones nostálgicos, porque el caudal infantil -que representa el público más importante para Disney- tiene a su heroína empoderada, su épica aventurera y muchas, muchísimas canciones, colocadas con precisión quirúrgica cada vez que el relato mengua en interés. Con respecto a estos momentos musicales, previo al estreno en los Estados Unidos se generó en redes una polémica en torno al rumor de que muchos de estos temas se crearon mediante inteligencia artificial. De haber sido cierto, resultaría verdaderamente sorprendente que un algoritmo sea capaz de componer mejores canciones que el 90 por ciento de los artistas de trap y similares. O no tan sorprendente. Sin perder el objetivo de que la película está construida en función de la celebración y no como proyecto artístico autónomo (sería como la Muchachos de Disney, pero sin un Lionel Messi que conduzca la historia), es importante destacar la manera en la que se ha podido amalgamar lo clásico con lo moderno. La animación, siempre irreprochable y a partir de la última tecnología, elige encuadres, texturas, fondos y una paleta de colores que remiten directamente a la edad de oro de la empresa y, por ende, a sus producciones icónicas. La preocupación por conjugar pasado y presente es uno de los méritos más destacables de la propuesta, coronado por una secuencia de créditos finales que reafirman la idea y lo ya visto. Con la imaginación como bandera, paradójicamente Wish: el poder de los deseos elige honrar la historia de Disney de la manera más lineal y conservadora posible, apelando a la emoción de un público fiel por sobre el riesgo de iniciar un camino más disruptivo, que a su vez sirva como puntapié inicial de lo que vendrá. Hecha esta salvedad, que con justa razón desencantará a muchos, tal y como está planteada lo que hace la película, lo hace muy bien. Y siendo que siempre hay que mirar lo que es y no lo que pudo ser, Wish redunda en una sentida conmemoración a la obra y gracia de Disney. Como el castillo que aparece al inicio de cada film de la compañía, pero extendido por 95 minutos. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Jan 4, 2024",positive," Disney se autohomenajeó con Wish: El poder de los deseos, al cumplir la compañía sus primeros 100 años. Y lo hizo con un filme musical, apegado a muchos de los tips, clisés o como quieran decirles que suelen poblar este tipo de películas, destinadas claramente a los más pequeños. Veamos. Tenemos a una joven, simpática, arriesgada, animales que hablan, habitantes de un pueblo que se la pasan cantando, y un hechicero que es el Rey Magnífico en Ciudad de Rosas, un lugar que parece encantador, pero... Los malos son hombres, y las buenas son las mujeres. Todos viven en armonía, sabiendo que el Rey guarda sus deseos, y, cada tanto, después de que uno llegue a la mayoría de edad, los concede, aunque no todos. Es que el tipo se apropia de muchos de ellos, y aquellos que le parecen irrealizables, que van en contra de su pensamiento o, en el mejor de los casos, que no le sirvan a la isla de Rosas, directamente los deja ""guardados"". Asha, la joven del comienzo, se acercará al rey, porque espera conseguir un trabajo como aprendiz del rey, y con el paso del tiempo descubrirá la magia oculta del soberano, que les miente a sus súbditos. Y al ver que hay deseos que nunca se van a cumplir, quiere robarle los deseos y entregarlos a sus verdaderos dueños. Un dato importante es que los niños al darle sus deseos a Magnífico (voz de Chris Pine), los olvidan. Hecha la ley... Los deseos, representados aquí como bolas burbujeantes, azules, flotantes y brillantes, no pertenecen a Magnifico, pero a él le encanta creer que está a cargo de ellos, cuando debería ser al revés. Asha (voz de Ariana DeBose en el original) vive con su abuelo. Su padre, filósofo que miraba a las estrellas, murió cuando ella tenía 12 años. Y ella va ahí, a un árbol que le recuerda a su padre, pide un deseo y una estrellita baja y la acompaña.  El cabrito Valentino (que podrá hablar, gracias a la estrella) y la misma estrella a la que Asha le pide el deseo son los coprotagonsitas de esta, como dijimos, comedia musical, con lindas canciones, pero sin ningún hit que uno salga tarareando a la salida del cine, tipo Coco, Frozen o La Bella y la Bestia. Codirigida por el veterano Chris Buck (Frozen) y la debutante Fawn Veerasunthorn (trabajó en Moana y Raya y el último dragón), Wish presenta algunos cambios. Por lo pronto, la protagoniza una chica de 17 años que no tiene un interés amoroso a la vista. Si hay algo que le interesa a Asha es su familia y su círculo grande de amigos. Así como descubrirán una nueva presentación de Disney, no se muevan de sus butacas durante los créditos finales: encontrarán a muchos, si no a todos, los personajes más entrañables de la compañía. Si encuentran alguna copia subtitulada, además de los nombrados podrán escuchar a Victor Garber, que era Thomas Andrews en Titanic, y a Evan Peters, de la miniserie Dahmer. Comedia animada. Estados Unidos, 2023. Título original: ""Wish"". ATP, 95'. De: Chris Buck. Con las voces originales de: Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, Alan Tudyk, Victor Garber, Evan Peters. Salas: Hoyts Abasto y Quilmes, Cinemark Avellaneda, Cinépolis Recoleta y Pilar, Showcase Belgrano."
"Jan 3, 2024",neutral," Desde este jueves 4 de enero coincidirán en los cines de la Argentina las nuevas producciones animadas de Disney y de Universal con Illumination.

"Jan 1, 2024",positive," Wish feels soulless at times, but the film is a step in the right direction for Disney Animation Studios, as the company acknowledges they have fresh characters, not merely sequels, even if the characters retread classic storylines. Wish also comes across as studio acknowledgment that 2D animation has a place at the table, which is significant considering they’re celebrating 100 years. The film doesn’t break molds like Spider-Verse and it doesn’t bring a revitalizing freshness like Mutant Mayhem, but there are some feels created and the story of Asha is original enough to warrant a viewing.  Asha (Ariana DeBose) is a citizen of Rosas, a Mediterranean kingdom protected by a magic sorcerer named Magnifico (Chris Pine), who provides safety for all of his citizens in exchange for their biggest dream. Every month, he grants a wish, while everyone else continues to not remember theirs. Asha desperately wants a family wish to be granted, specifically her grandfather Sabino’s (Victor Garber), but she also hopes to become the new apprentice of Magnifico. After a disagreement with Magnifico, Asha finds out that there’s more to his keeping track of wishes than she originally realized, so she enlists her goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk), her dwarf-like friends, and even a wished-upon star to free the dreams of her people and give them back their biggest wishes. Historically, Disney uses a few different approaches for the voice cast in musicals. DiBose and Pine do some really good work in the voice acting department, whether singing or not. Their story mainly focuses on their battle of wits and strength. No other character is either a distraction or a bright spot, so I think the key is that it’s important to find actors and actresses that can do sing and voice-over, unless you’re going to craft their character around the inability or put in some serious training. Speaking to music and characterization more specifically, the songs are functional. They are carefully crafted, potentially too much, and bring joy and goosebumps, but they aren’t quite as memorable as some of Disney’s recent turns. Basically, they’re just cheesy enough. This is where the easter eggs and references are strongest and while they’re momentarily cute, the film just needs more than that. Pine’s Magnifico performs well on his own and in the famous duo/combative style that all Disney films use, but his songs fall into a familiar category: they merely exist. Most of Wish’s weight comes from the references to various Disney properties, but since the new material doesn’t really resonate, the references and callbacks receive more focus than they probably should. The characters and songs don’t leave much of a mark aside from Asha, Star, and “This Wish”. The film makes it clear that Disney shouldn’t abandon 2D for another 12 years nor should 3D, CGI, and Pixar Animation Studio be their only story-telling lens. Live-action remakes aren’t the answer either and this is why Wish is so important: it should stand as a reminder that whether animated or live-action, story must come first. Disney has already shared early photos of Inside Out 2. We also know Elio is coming out and there’s an official announcement for Toy Story 5. There’s also confirmation of Moana’s live-action along with a few other live-action films already in post-production. Disney Animation inspired generations and now those artists are creating stories such as Klaus, The LEGO Movie, and even the classic The Iron Giant. So if Disney intends to remain competitive or at the very least inspirational, they should take notes from Wish and continue to push the bar. The film is good, but it’s also very safe. Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes."
"Jan 1, 2024",neutral,"When you remind audiences of classic movies they grew up with, even as an Easter egg, it takes away from what’s being played in front of them. You’d rather watch the reference. And that’s the biggest problem. The film has no identity of its own.

"Dec 29, 2023",negative," “When you wish upon a star, it makes no difference who you are,” runs the famous theme song of the 1940 Disney version of Pinocchio. It would be nice to believe that were true, although depending on the nature of the wish, living in a rich country probably helps. In any case, when you entrust your wish to a power-hungry sorcerer it’s a different story, as we discover in the convoluted Wish. It’s billed as the first ever wholly original Disney fairytale, though it’s hard to see more than a tenuous link between Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen and the massively successful Frozen films, which several key members of the Wish brains trust worked on, including co-directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn. Intended to mark the 100th anniversary of Disney as a company, the film takes place in the imaginary medieval kingdom of Rosas, brought to life through a lush but slightly ungainly blend of traditional 2D animation and the modern digital kind. The outwardly benign ruler Magnifico (voiced by Chris Pine) maintains his hold over the population through the insistence that he alone has the power to grant wishes. But just one wish is granted a month, meaning you can wait around your whole life to no avail. And while in theory everyone has a chance, in practice the lucky winner is usually, if not always, a member of his clique. Pitted against this tyranny are the downtrodden yet spirited teenage heroine Asha (Ariana DeBose) and her allies, among them an incongruously deep-voiced baby goat (Alan Tudyk), a “fallen star” who resembles a glowing airborne Pokemon, and a gaggle of human friends who parallel the Seven Dwarfs. Clearly, this is supposed to be some sort of allegory (one of the laboured song lyrics includes the word “allegory”, in case of any doubt). Less clear is the intended significance. Is it anti-socialist? A skit on organised religion? A belated mea culpa from Disney for its century-long effort to corner the market on magic and wonder? If the story had a persuasive inner logic, the multiple layers of potential meaning would be a blessing rather than a curse. However, the script, credited to Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore, feels like a corporate product in the absolute worst sense – as if it had been concocted during a team-building retreat by a group of executives who had heard of the existence of humour and poetry, but had never seen any concrete instances. On one level, the total artistic failure of Wish is reassuring because it shows there are occasions when vast amounts of money and supposed expertise really don’t make a difference – or at least aren’t enough to save you from falling flat on your face. “When it comes to the universe, we’re all shareholders,” maintains one would-be inspirational number, performed by a troupe of woodland critters modelled after those in Bambi. One thing we can all count on is that nobody will be humming that in another 80 years. An earlier version of this story stated that the character Asha is voiced by Ariana Grande. This was incorrect, Asha is voiced by Ariana DeBose. "
"Dec 29, 2023",negative," Situada en el mar Mediterráneo, la pequeña isla de Rosas se ha convertido en un idílico paraíso donde reina la armonía y la prosperidad. Un refugio que ha abierto sus puertas a todas aquellas personas dispuestas a construir una sociedad perfecta. Un lugar seguro y de oportunidades justas que celebra las diferencias culturales de sus habitantes y que salvaguarda sus anhelos más profundos. No obstante, dicha felicidad tiene un alto costo. Todos los ciudadanos mayores de 18 años están obligados a renunciar a su más grande sueño para depositarlo en las manos del rey Magnífico (Chris Pine), el fundador de la utópica comunidad. A simple vista, las acciones del monarca parecieran altruistas. Después de todo, los humanos suelen preocuparse demasiado en realizar sus sueños, distrayéndose por completo de sus obligaciones diarias. Al quitarles este peso de encima, el simpático gobernante les promete cuidar de ellos y concederles un deseo cada mes, respaldado por un poco de magia que le fue otorgada años atrás.  Pero, ¿cómo es posible formar una sociedad ideal si sus habitantes han sido privados de algo tan inherentemente humano? Dicho cuestionamiento ronda la mente de Asha (Ariana DeBose), una joven que está a punto de alcanzar la mayoría de edad. Para la protagonista, el hecho de que el rey Magnífico tenga el poder absoluto para decidir quién cumplirá su sueño, y quién morirá sin haber tenido la oportunidad de realizarlo, le parece injusto. Luego de que su abuelo Sabino (Victor Garber), un anciano de 100 años, no es elegido por el soberano en su ceremonia mensual, Asha pide ayuda a las estrellas para conseguir que éste cumpla su más grande anhelo. Su clamor es respondido por un diminuto astro que, con una pizca de magia, le auxiliará en su misión para desafiar a las fuerzas que rigen el sistema, convirtiéndose así en una potente voz para el pueblo oprimido.  Con referencias a la melodía When You Wish Upon A Star de Pinocchio y a los personajes de Bambi, Snow White y otros clásicos animados de Walt Disney, Wish (Wish: El Poder de los Deseos) rinde un merecido homenaje a la compañía productora en conmemoración por su centenario. Una historia que amalgama los elementos característicos de sus producciones más celebradas (una valiente heroína, un parlanchín compinche y un antagonista con poderes mágicos) junto a los slogans de sus parques de diversiones. La tarea principal de Asha consiste en lograr que Rosas sea verdaderamente «El Lugar Más Feliz de Mundo», uno donde los sueños, por más imposibles que parezcan, puedan hacerse realidad. La fantasía de Disney se hace presente a través del relato y de sus canciones originales, himnos de empoderamiento que buscan encontrar un lugar dentro del amplio repertorio de baladas que han acompañado a múltiples generaciones durante los últimos 100 años.  Si bien el corazón de Disney está en el lugar adecuado, y se agradece que el mensaje de activismo y de lucha por construir un mundo mejor en el que cada individuo posea la libertad de cumplir sus sueños sin condiciones continúe llegando a las nuevas generaciones, es una lástima que Wish no tenga el ímpetu suficiente de producciones previas de Walt Disney Animation Studios para que su lección resulte cautivadora y urgente. Asimismo, la mezcla de humor infantil con la complejidad de su temática no consigue obtener ese balance adecuado para deleitar a todo el público. Lo único que deseábamos era una nueva aventura musical inventiva e inolvidable pero, desafortunadamente, ese deseo no logra hacerse realidad por completo. "
"Dec 29, 2023",positive," Where were you when Walt and Roy O. Disney founded the enterprise that would become Walt Disney Animation Studios? Unless you’re a centenarian, you weren’t around. The company was launched in October 1923 as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio. By 1926, it had become Walt Disney Studio, and a few years later it was incorporated as Walt Disney Productions. For the first decade of its existence, the studio focused on short films, such as “Steamboat Willie,” released in 1928. Then, in 1934, work began on what would be the studio’s first feature-length production. “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” released in 1937, was a critical and commercial success. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008. Even though “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” occupies a special place in cinematic history for pioneering a new entertainment form, I’ll bet you can’t name a single member of the voice cast — unless you’re a Disney superfan. Adriana Caselotti voiced Snow White, while Lucille La Verne, an accomplished stage actress with many Broadway credits, was tapped to provide the voice of the Evil Queen. The new animated musical fantasy film was directed by Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn from a screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore. Buck previously worked on several Disney projects, including co-directing “Tarzan,” “Frozen,” and “Frozen II.” “Wish” is Veerasunthorn’s directorial debut. She previously served as several Disney films as a storyboard artist, and as head of story on “Raya and the Last Dragon.” The story is set in the kingdom of Rosas, where 17-year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose), a steadfast idealist, uncovers a shocking secret about King Magnifico (Chris Pine). It seems that the citizens of Rosas voluntarily give up their fondest wish — and even the memory of that wish — to Magnifico, who promises to keep them safe. The king is a powerful sorcerer, and claims he can grant anyone’s wishes — but, in truth, he only grants a few that he deems innocuous. Magnifico’s motivation is his role as protector of the kingdom: He refuses to permit any aspiration among his subjects that might somehow bring unrest. Asha learns that most people’s wishes will never be granted — including the wish of her grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber), who simply wants to inspire others through music. Because she questions the king during her interview for an apprenticeship, Magnifico dismisses her, and tells her none of her family’s wishes will be granted. Unable to convince her family of Magnifico’s deceitfulness, she runs out into the night where she eventually makes her own wish beneath the twilight sky. That wish is answered by a cosmic force in the form of Star. Asha and Star join forces, and they — along with Valentino (Alan Tudyk), Asha’s goat who can now talk thanks to Star — recruit some of Asha’s friends to recover all the wishes King Magnifico has been stockpiling in his castle. This is liable to fluster the anti-woke crowd, because it sounds suspiciously like a girl is about to challenge the patriarchy — oh no! Circle the wagons and prepare to post incoherent rants filled with misspelled words on social media! Modern politics aside, “Wish” is a perfectly enjoyable, entertaining fairy tale. It is an expressive nod to the past, paying tribute to Disney’s extensive legacy in animation. The film is filled with narrative and visual allusions, both overt and subtle. Adult viewers will perceive its self-awareness. There are so many references to previous films it’s as if the writers are sitting in the theater nudging and winking at each viewer. The songs in “Wish” aren’t among Disney’s best. There may have been an effort to replicate musical styles from 100 years of films, which made the overall effect inconsistent. Sometimes the feel of the music doesn’t quite synchronize with the tone of the scene. Visually, the film is gorgeous, though there’s no effort at leaping forward in terms of animation technique. That’s not a criticism: “Wish” doesn’t require that kind of innovation. Disney literally established the artform, and for 100 years has continued to transform and modernize it without forgetting its roots. The viewer’s understanding of Magnifico’s disposition might have been strengthened by more backstory, but I am inclined to think that it wouldn’t matter much to younger viewers: A villain is a villain, after all. Kids usually recognize the bad guy with or without a detailed biography. Pine hits all the right notes in voicing the character as he gradually becomes more corrupted by dark magic. One might be tempted to draw parallels between the kingdom of Rosas — “Where your dreams and your reality can collide,” according to the song “Welcome to Rosas” — and some modern régime that seeks to sacrifice freedom for security. The concept of hoarding wishes sounds a lot like restricting people’s freedoms. If Star embodies hope, light, optimism, creativity and imagination, it is a potential source of both transformation and revolution — which is why Magnifico becomes obsessed with controlling it. In another hundred years, “Wish” may not rank among Disney’s top 10 films, but I think it will become a treasured classic for some to revisit from time to time. Its potential appeal spans generations, entrancing older viewers with nostalgic cues while delighting a new generation of Disney fans with solid storytelling, colorful animation, and a talking goat. With any luck, some of those younger viewers may absorb the film’s forward-looking social commentary."
"Dec 27, 2023",negative," En esta historia conocemos al reino mágico de Rosas, donde Asha, una adolescente bastante ingeniosa y soñadora, pide un deseo tan poderoso que es escuchado por una fuerza cósmica: una pequeña esfera de energía ilimitada llamada Estrella. Ahí, Asha y Estrella, se enfrentan al rey Magnifico, quien fue el encargado de ilusionar a las personas y no cumplirles sus deseos, para salvar a su comunidad y demostrar que, cuando la voluntad de una persona valiente se une a la magia de las estrellas, pueden ocurrir cosas maravillosas. Para que su concepto inicial tenga algo relacionado a su creador y así homenajear de forma correcta a la productora, Wish: El poder de los deseos (Wish, 2023) se basa en algo que Walt Disney decía cuando tenía que describir el objetivo de su compañía: que los deseos de las personas se hagan realidad. Partiendo de esta base, la cinta suma varios tintes musicales y crea todo un universo alrededor de esa idea para transmitir el mensaje a su audiencia. Por el lado de su guión, esta suerte de homenaje empieza a contener fallas desde el vamos, comenzando con un ritmo vertiginoso para presentar a Magnifico, su villano. Cosa que sirve para entender el contexto y conocer su historia de antemano, pero al mismo tiempo este ritmo tan acelerado falla y deriva en un escaso enfoque al presentar a Asha, su protagonista. Esto da como resultado un desarrollo confuso, con personajes planos y con bruscos saltos en la trama que van de la mano de varios huecos argumentales. Aunque el folklore que rodea su historia sea muy bueno e interesante para reflexionar, igualmente no termina de explicarse bien para lograr que el público se adentre en el tema. Al ser un musical, las canciones no podían ser menores y, en este caso, forman una parte importante de la narrativa conteniendo ritmos bastante pegadizos, grandes interpretaciones y letras (en la versión original) que sirven como una suerte de catarsis del momento por el que está pasando el personaje que la interpreta. En su diseño de animación también se puede observar la gran disposición que tiene la cinta para homenajear el centenario de la empresa, exhibiendo una técnica bastante similar a la de Spider-Man: un nuevo universo (Spiderman Into the Spider Verse, 2018) en la que se hace una mezcla entre el 3D hiperrealista y el 2D tradicional, pero con una vuelta de tuerca bastante alejada de la técnica utilizada en la película de la araña para hacer el intento de mostrar algo innovador que se aferre a la animación tradicional de Disney. Aquí se representan los escenarios de una forma en la que se mantienen completamente estáticos como si fuera la escenografía de una obra de teatro. Pero aunque todo esto suena muy prometedor, la gran falla aparece en el diseño de los personajes, quienes carecen de emociones por sus rostros totalmente inexpresivos. Wish: el poder de los deseos es una pieza bastante perezosa que aparenta no tener ganas de ejecutar, como si fuera un rompecabezas incompleto con ganas de ser finalizado, y que pretende que la magia que rige su universo sea quien la salve y la convierta en un homenaje recordado, pero solamente termina siendo un proyecto bastante correcto con un bellísimo y desaprovechado arte."
"Dec 26, 2023",neutral," There’s been a lot of chatter around Wish and the fact that its release celebrates Disney’s centennial, where the major theme across a heft of the studio’s films – that of wishes being granted – would be tied together.  It’s a sweet notion, without question, but it would appear that the creatives behind the film seem far too obsessed with referencing past glories that they forgot to build a compelling story of their own. You’ll spot such cute Easter Eggs throughout that reference past titles as Peter Pan and Zootopia, but Wish‘s own personality is compromised in the process, and it’s truly a shame as Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn‘s musical tale isn’t without its charm.  And a lot of that charm stems from the lead vocal work of Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine, the heroine and villain of the piece, who sing and swan their way through the film’s thankfully brisk 95 minute run time. DeBose voices the sweetly Asha, a 17-year-old girl, who lives in Rosas, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, and, as we gather from her opening jingle (“Welcome to Rosas”), is a champion of her little village.  Gearing up for an interview to be the apprentice for Rosas’ King Magnifico (Pine, divine), Asha is hoping that in snaring such a position she can grant the wish of her 100-year-old grandfather, Sabino (Victor Garber). You see, Magnifico, having studied sorcery, is able to grant the greatest desires of his subjects; each of them give up the memory of their wishes to be sealed and protected by the king until he can grant them. Once a month, at a ceremonial event, Magnifico chooses one wish to be granted.  It’s a little convoluted, but it works. We all know nothing is exactly going to go to plan, and when Asha’s quizzical nature gets the better of her, she angers Magnifico, who reveals that sweet Sabino’s wish is just “too dangerous” to grant.  Asha pleads in its actuality of inspiring the next generation or to simply return Sabino’s wish to him (there’s another plot point about the subject forgetting their own wish once they speak it into the universe), but it’s to no avail and the young lass loses any chance of an apprenticeship and returns home defeated. Given Magnifico’s enhanced thirst for power, Wish feels quite telegraphed in its narrative footing, and, unsurprisingly, a little rogue magic comes into play; Asha’s “wish upon a star” manifests into a physical form, granting the forest creatures the ability to talk (and sing), which extends itself to her trusty goat sidekick, Valentino (a scene-stealing Alan Tudyk).  From hereon it’s standard Disney fare, and whilst many other House of Mouse products have resigned to the same structure, Wish never manages to elevate itself beyond such, with its musical arrangements failing to leave much of an impression, despite the best efforts of its cast; it must be said that DeBose truly has such a wonderful tone. Despite reuniting the Frozen duo of director Buck and screenwriter Jennifer Lee, the emotional resonance and rapid wit that so often pepper Disney outings is lacking across Wish, and as much fun as there is to be had in finding the “ghosts” of Disney’s past throughout, the gimmick can only hide so much. By no means is Wish a complete misfire, more that it’s decidedly average.  It’s harmless and light, and Asha makes for a fine additive into the annals of Disney princess-dom (even though she’s not really a princess in the traditional sense), but in knowing what the studio is capable of, and in banking so much on this film’s relation to the centennial, we can’t help but wish for something a little more impactful. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Dec 21, 2023",negative," The film will no doubt contain all the flash and sparkle a $200 million production budget can buy, yet Aquaman 2has quite a hill to climb. Despite a petition signed by four million fans, the now-controversial Amber Heard returns to try and revive her public standing after losing big in the Johnny Depp defamation case. Will it work? That’s part of the adventure in checking it out. The film was not previewed to media. Always a good sign.
The feathered gang from ‘Migration’. Likely to land as the biggest kids’ film of the festive season is the very funny animated lark Migration (***; 92 minutes; PG), a family-friendly treat from Illumination, the makers of Despicable Me, Minions and Sing. Feeling a bit like a old-style Pixar film (back in the day when Pixar understood its connection to its audiences) the tale follows a family of mallards who are persuaded to finally leave the comfort zone of their pond and fly south with all the other birds. Hoping to find a reasonable version of paradise they go off course (of course) and wind up in the big, bad city where they are confronted with a host of comic dangers, the most heated of which is a crazed chef. Beautifully animated, Migration is a hoot and a half, with lashings of slapstick and a nicely packaged theme about the importance of being part of the wider world. Oh, and of family, of course. Way over at the other end of the spectrum, sadly, is Wish (*1/2; 95 minutes; PG), a very expensive and rather dull musical fantasy misfire from Disney that joins the long list of films to demonstrate how far the studio has fallen from its mission to serve its traditional family audience. The wobbly story involves a singing teen girl called Asha who sets about trying to reclaim the cherished wishes of her community, which are being held in floating bubbles by the nasty King Magnifico. The film, which has already tanked in the US both critically and commercially – who’d want to be a Disney executive these days? – struggles with casting Magnifico as the villain of the piece.  The dude starts out as a benevolent sorcerer who creates the loving world Asha and everyone else lives in. He seems like a nice guy. Though Wish contains none of the identity politics that have soured other Disney flops (Strange World; Lightyear; Elemental), its main snag is just how abstract and drab the premise is, with its mediocre songlist and surprising dearth of humour leaving viewers unengaged. If Disney creatives can’t do better than this, Heaven help them. Woody Allen hits another latter-career high with Coup De Chance (***; 96 minutes; PG), a French-language comedy thriller about a beautiful socialite Fanny (Lou de Laâge) who begins questioning the state of her otherwise  happy marriage to successful, if shady businessman Jean (Melvil Poupaud) after she runs into old flame Alain (Niels Schneider).  With much more camera movement that we usually get, Allen brings his well-honed lightness of touch as Fanny’s mother Camille (Valérie Lemercier) begins digging into the mysteries behind Jean’s business practices, which prompts him to engage a professional hitman. Allen’s love for richly nuanced performances and witty dialogue is as strong as ever, his choice of shooting the film in French no doubt designed to please his legion of fans in France. Talk about fan service. Think David Lynch on meth and you’ll have a sound handle on Poor Things (**** 141 minutes MA), a devilish delight from director Yorgos Lanthimos and Australian writer Tony McNamara (based on the 1992 book by Alasdair Gray) designed for those keen to dive head-first into something different, darkly funny and somewhat deranged. Set in a heightened version of Victorian Europe, Emma Stone is virutally unrecognizable early on as Bella, a hyperactive brain transplant patient of the experiment-loving Dr. Godwin Baxter  (Willem Dafoe, perfectly cast). Keen to sample the outside world, she heads off with her forlorn lover Duncan (Mark Ruffalo) on a long cruise that leads to adventgures in philanthropy and prostitution. Anchored by a truly remarkable, edgy performance from Stone the film is graced by fantastic set design and amazing cinematography that toggles between black-and-white and luscious colour. In One Life *** (108 minutes) PG), Anthony Hopkins puts in a typically understated, affecting performance as Nicholas Winton, the English stock broker who, along with a team of dedicated volunteers, rescued hundreds of children from Czechoslovakia in the late 1930s on the even of the Nazi invasion. Alternating between the pre-war period – with Johnny Flynn playing the young Winton with quiet stoicism – and 1987, the film chronicles the risky effort to transport the children and Winton’s attempts to share his story.  It’s a true jewel of a film, a touching real-life tale about real heroes, with the exacting recreation of Winton’s appearance on the popular TV show That’s Life a powerful highlight.
Sydney Sweeney & Glen Powell in ‘Anyone But You’. Loosely based on William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing , it’s a highly predictable jaunt about two one-night standers (played by Sydney Sweeney & Glen Powell) who have to pretend to be together so they can survive a wedding and avoid unwanted entanglements. With way too many shots of the Opera House and strained caricatures of Australiana, the film contains plenty of near-nudity, including porn-like shots of naked men with their genitals falling just below the frame line. All hail the crusade of adult-geared rom-com fluff, yet it is chiefly the easily pleased who will forgive the film its lack of invention and the rather glaring fact that the main male character is a total and unlikeable prat."

"Dec 16, 2023",neutral," Wish de Disney está pensada para ser un homenaje, pero en realidad no es otra cosa que una película que hace un recorrido acartonado por todo lo que la compañía fue y aún es, en alguna medida. A modo de un obsequio visual y argumental a un universo en expansión, pierde sentido, interés y belleza al hacerse más obvio y repetitivo.  Wish es un cuento de hadas amable. Pero también una forma de curioso autohomenaje que Disney se dedica en su aniversario número cien. Ambas cosas podrían haber resultado bien juntas — de hecho, durante la primera mitad de la película lo hacen— a no ser por un problema. Disney no añadió a la mezcla originalidad, tampoco sentido de la innovación y mucho menos, la noción que, como producción, el tributo que el estudio se rinde a sí mismo, necesitaba ser, al menos, algo más que un subrayado de sus ideas principales y más socorridas. Pero no solo es esto último. También, es un refrito tedioso de sus grandes éxitos, mezclados a conveniencia para crear la sensación, que el recuerdo vale por recorrido a través de sus puntos más altos. De modo que en Wish está presente cada elemento de lo que ha hecho de Disney lo que es. O al menos, a sus películas, mundos infantiles en constante expansión. Desde una chica en apuros, hasta animales cantantes, pasando, por supuesto, por un villano carismático y la ausencia de uno de los padres. Los directores Chris Buck y Fawn Veerasunthorn construyeron un escenario en el que la magia lo es todo. Está en los deseos, que se convierten en un mal mayor a medida que la trama avanza, en el trasfondo de cada personaje e incluso, en su inevitable moraleja. Pero, por extraño que parezca, el poder de un trasfondo semejante — que podría basarse en la emoción, la maravilla e incluso, la ternura sincera— no es otra cosa que un escenario vacío. Lo es, porque esta película destinada a abarcar los múltiples estratos de una compañía de entretenimiento gigantesca es curiosamente vacía. A pesar de su ambición —el comienzo de la historia insinúa ser el centro medular de todos los cuentos de hadas— el argumento de Jennifer Lee y Allison Moore se conforma con lo básico. Lo cual es, por cierto, una especie de terreno que cambia sus propias reglas a conveniencia. En una isla misteriosa del Mediterráneo, un rey es capaz de conceder deseos a sus súbditos. Pero con varias condiciones a cuestas: la primera, que solo él debe escuchar la petición. La segunda —y que el emocionado ciudadano no conoce— es que lo olvidará. No quedará huella en su memoria, de ese anhelo del corazón, que podría ser cumplido o no. Y lo hará para siempre, lo que convierte la oportunidad en la pérdida de algo valioso a manos de un monarca con ambiciones casi divinas. Una premisa semejante funciona en la medida  en que es evidente que el deseo no es solo la verbalización de un “anhelo del corazón”, como el guion repite a cada oportunidad posible. También es un recorrido de considerable interés a través de la identidad de cada personaje que forma parte de la historia. ¿Qué necesita cada uno y que pierde, cuando el rey le hace olvidar sus inquietudes y necesidades? ¿Cómo se expresa esa ausencia? La trama olvida todas esas preguntas en beneficio de algo específico. El rey (un Chris Pine que imprime al personaje un sentido del melodrama irritante), es el que sopesa la importancia de lo que arrebata, de lo que pierde sentido entre sus manos y convierte a su súbdito en alguien incapaz de aspirar a algo más. Claro está, la protagonista Asha (Ariana DeBose) es la excepción a la regla. También, la única que descubrirá el pacto casi Fáustico que el reino debe acatar. Pero allí acaban las diferencias de esta figura plana, cuya principal misión es encarnar a todas las princesas de Disney en una nueva versión para el milenio. Asha no tiene interés amoroso (como Elsa, Mérida, Moana, Raya) pero sí una gran preocupación por todo el resto de su familia y amigos. Lo que la emparenta con Blancanieves, Cenicienta, Tiana y Ariel. Descubrir que todos a su alrededor son víctimas de una estafa emocional y espiritual convierte a la joven, hasta entonces corriente, en una heroína por accidente. De la misma forma que Anna de Frozen, Jazmín, Pocahontas y Mulán. Por último, esta voluntariosa chica irá en búsqueda de su destino y su realización, como Rapunzel en Enredados. Pero lo que podría haber resultado una mezcla intrigante, se convierte, durante la primera media hora, en una aventura con un trasfondo moral que no desarrolla del todo. Asha descubre el secreto de la magia del rey — y como lleva a cabo sus discrecionales concesiones— y debe encontrar la manera de revertir la omnipotencia de la que hace gala. Mucho más cuando comprenda que la aparente de los deseos, también es una forma de control. Pronto, Wish se pierde en las implicaciones morales de algo semejante y decide dejarlas a un lado, para concentrarse mucho más en el crecimiento de su heroína y su forma de comprender la autodeterminación. Temas todos muy actuales, pero que el estudio ha explorado mejor y con más elegancia en otras tantas producciones. En comparación con el resto de las princesas más recientes de Disney, Asha es un endeble reflejo de la búsqueda interior y de la necesidad de comprender el poder personal como un faro en medio de la confusión. Y lo es, porque Wish, en su conjunto, carece de la suficiente profundidad para que sus personajes sean algo más que vehículos incompletos de una idea mayor. Para el final de la cinta, ya no es tan importante si los deseos se cumplen, ante la posibilidad de sostener un recorrido interior consistente. Pero para su secuencia de cierre, Wish no tiene el menor interés de concluir sus ideas más singulares. En lugar de eso, se inclina por coser y cantar, lo que logra con el peor sentido de la emoción posible. Quizás Wish sea la demostración de que Disney necesita más que un anhelo colectivo de celebrar, para recuperar su magia. El mayor problema de la cinta."
"Dec 15, 2023",negative," Many cultural critics mourn the death of the monoculture. However, there are few companies more engrained in cultural consciousness like Disney. Between its films, experiential offerings, and a plethora of personal characters, the company rooted itself in the history of American pop culture. Its tendrils are long and have helped shape discourse about film and television for decades. One needs to look no further than those who decry animation as “cartoons for kids” to see the impact of their dominance. To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Disney chose to focus Wish – the animation studio’s 62nd feature – on the “origins” of the star. What we get is a feature-filled with loving tributes to the company’s history. Sadly, this also leaves the audience with bad songs and a shockingly thin story. Following the story of Asha (Ariana DeBose), Wish takes us to the mystical realm of Rosas. In this kingdom, King Magnifico (Chris Pine) offers a trade: safety for your wishes. About fifteen times a year, Magnifico grants his citizens’ wishes, but only once he confirms the wish will not upset his utopia. When Asha discovers her 100-year-old grandfather (Victor Garber) will not get his wish granted, she fights with Magnifico. In the aftermath, Asha sings to the sky as she wonders about Rosas’ future. Suddenly, a living-breathing star, named Star, comes out of the sky. With Star’s help, Asha hopes to return the wishes that will go ungranted to the people.  From its opening number, Wish suffers for serving too many masters. This begins with its seemingly corporate mandate to celebrate Disney as a company over telling an innovative story. For decades, Disney created nods to its previous films by reusing cell animation visuals and animatics. For example, Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella feature the same dance sequence to close the story. Robin Hood utilized character designs from the Disney talking-animal library. At times, Wish opts to utilize similar pastiche. However, it does on a much higher scale, with mere minutes between these easter eggs (sometimes showing multiple in the same scene). This often sacrifices story in favor of delivering a moment of fan service.  Few companies have utilized fan service quite like Disney. The concept, which seemed to gain power when used by Star Wars, Marvel, and even 2013’s Mickey Mouse, gave the fans unique moments they’d longed to see. In an IP-driven era of television and film, giving audiences what they wanted seemed like a strong pitch. Yet the divides and changing sensibilities of some fandoms hurt some of these products, while those with vision could serve both masters. That’s where Wish finds its struggle, as it utilizes the fan-service to play on nostalgia and fan-knowledge, rather than integrate the concepts into the heart of the story.  When one starts to pull at the threads of Wish, the storyline quickly falls apart. Rather than use the concept of giving up one’s “wish” for safety and exploring that complicated philosophical trade, there seems to be mass delusion over getting one’s dream returned to them. This also supports the idea that we would prefer a one-time payout of our highest dreams rather than struggle to achieve them over time. Additionally, some individuals become a shell of themselves when they lose their wish. It’s remarked on a few times but also seems selective in those affected. Each of these threads on their own could be interesting to explore on their own, and could frankly be the entire premise of a future Disney film. Yet Wish jumbles them all together, does little to explore any of these concepts, and plows ahead with its frankly underwhelming protagonist.  Early in the movie, Magnifico tries to speak to Asha about the wishes. When she immediately pushes for her grandfather’s wish, Magnifico remarks that it usually takes longer for potential assistants to ask him for the favor. We’re meant to believe that Asha is strong of heart and mind, but it’s clear that her interests are based on her own perceptions of the world. She’s an idealist, but the film never tries to grapple with the reality of her situation. Instead, she’s proven to have the “correct” opinion over and over again, specifically because of Magnifico’s increasingly bad decisions. There’s almost no grey area in this movie. Life is not that cut and dry. To make matters worse, the songs throughout Wish fall unbelievably flat. The standout ballad “This Wish” is stuffed with platitudes. The same issues plague “Welcome to Rosas,” “I’m a Star,” and “Knowing What I Know Now.” Additionally, each feels wildly formulaic. Shockingly, these are much better than “This is the Thanks I Get?!” – which instantly enters the discussion for the worst Disney Villain song of all time. This frankly abysmal and forgettable series of songs put Wish at afurther disadvantage. Finally, we’ve discussed the plethora of ideas in the screenplay. It’s a movie full of ideas, never focusing on any one-central concept. Unfortunate colloquialisms making their way into the script (“Peep the name,” “Ungrateful much?” and “the prob” are all uttered in this movie) that instantly date Wish. Yet perhaps the most frustrating comes in character design. Even though the cell-shading concept is a new look for Disney, the actual character design is nearly identical to those in Encanto, Strange Worlds, or Onward. Disney/Pixar needs to show more variation in their design, as this makes the side characters difficult to identify. Ultimately, Wish will have its fans. In fact, our own writer – Josh – was quite high on it. However, it’s difficult to get excited about a movie that feels as empty as Wish does. Disney must step back and not rely on our love of existing stories. They need to create the next great chapters in the company’s legacy. Wish has the elements within it to be that movie. However, forcing it to handle a strange concept and then also serve as a celebration of original art, never allows it to live up to its potential. "
"Dec 14, 2023",positive,"It's a solid, solid way to celebrate its anniversary. "
"Dec 11, 2023",negative," It’s been a rough 2023 for Disney. After strike delays and the failure of various big-name releases, Wish has suffered the ignominy of being the worst-reviewed Disney animation in nearly 20 years. The film opened to the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score since 2006’s Chicken Little. Can this new musical really be that bad? Reuniting Frozen screenwriter Jennifer Lee with co-director Chris Buck, the film is set in the magical kingdom of Rosas, ruled over and protected by the sorcerer King Magnifico (Chris Pine). The seemingly benevolent ruler offers his citizens one wish on their 18th birthday, taken from a store of wishes given to him by the kingdom. Magnifico’s apprentice, Asha (Ariana DeBose), hopes to use her wish to fulfil her grandfather’s dream, but this leads to her finding out that Magnifico is not as caring as people believe.  With all the visual flair you would expect from a Disney production, there isn’t much to the story other than the familiar hum of the past. It’s broadly about hope, overcoming adversity, and of course, magic, but so much time is devoted to securing viral moments that there’s precious little reason to care about the characters’ success. It’s as if the film’s creatives were brought in, shown previous hits, and told “do something like that”. It’s easy to point to musical numbers like Pine’s laboured “This Is The Thanks I Get”, and be reminded of “You’re Welcome” from Moana, or perhaps Encanto’s “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”.  It’s a shame that such an assembly line approach would be wasted on this excellent cast. DeBose is likeable as the heroine, but has little to work with in comparison to other lead characters, with scarce backstory and little social interaction with the world around her. Pine, in his first voice role since a brief appearance in the first Spider-verse movie, nails the fake charm of the villain, but is unlikely to be keeping anyone up at night with a performance lacking genuine menace. Alan Tudyk voices an animal sidekick in a running Disney gag that at this point feels cynical.  Wish’s release coincides with the 100th anniversary of Walt Disney Studios. Unfortunately, this only highlights what is missing from this by-the-numbers fairytale that never comes close to emulating the magic of the past. "
"Dec 11, 2023",positive," Like many children born in the 1990s, I was blessed with the many animated wonders of Disney, shaped by numerous heartwarming, educational stories. Now, as an adult, I still maintain high levels of enthusiasm and anticipation for each new Disney Animation release, especially original movies. Under the guidance of directors Chris Buck (director on Tarzan, Surf's Up, Frozen, Frozen II) & Fawn Veerasunthorn (head of story on Raya and the Last Dragon), two well-known names in animation with multiple creative at the studio, Wish combines the storytelling craftsmanship of the former, with the exciting directorial debut of Veerasunthorn, whose previous credits involve valuable contributions to many of Disney's beloved stories. The premise of Disney Animation's Wish follows many typical studio formulas, for better or worse. In the magical kingdom of Rosas, the 17-year-old protagonist, Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose), a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it's answered by a cosmic force – a little star of boundless energy called ""Star."" Together, Asha and Star face the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico, to save their community and show that when the courageous will of a human connects with the magic of the stars, anything can happen. Only from this synopsis, it's relatively easy to predict most of what will happen in the movie. The narrative structure of Wish proves to be, to some extent, a tribute to Disney's legacy. On one hand, this choice evokes a nostalgic longing bringing back a simplistic villain with basic motivations, something that many admirers of Disney's Renaissance Era will appreciate. On the other hand, it remains a traditional formula with several limitations, hindering the exploration of bolder, more surprising narrative paths. Buck and Veerasunthorn execute their ideas well but rely too much on the central theme and character to tell their story – a factor that, for many viewers, is the key difference between it being a rewarding or disappointing experience. That said, at the heart of Wish, we find a beautiful, powerful message about the importance of wishes in our lives, a theme that resonates with both younger and older audiences. Wishes are intrinsic to our souls, and without them, we lose purpose and meaning in life. The pursuit of what we desire and dream of is presented in this story as the catalyst for true freedom, highlighting how our relentless will to pursue our goals, whether improvised or long-term, is crucial for personal fulfillment and genuine happiness. Further exploring this theme, Wish also delves into the complexities of the personal discovery journey we all undergo at some point in our lives, represented by the protagonist. Asha, portrayed with wonderful charm by DeBose (Academy Award winner for West Side Story), is the living embodiment of the wishes that shape our identity. Her arc is an emotional dance – often literally – between uncertainty and determination, emphasizing how personal wishes aren't mere impulses but essential elements for everyone's transformative journey. DeBose, with her powerful voice, gives the character an authenticity that touches the hearts of the audience, making Asha's trajectory a captivating focal point within the otherwise generic narrative. In fact, the voice cast is one of the strengths of Wish. Chris Pine, taking on the role of the cliche villain, delivers one of those performances where any viewer can tell that the actor had a blast recording the film, adding an amusingly sinister touch to his lines. Alan Tudyk is another household name as a voice actor contributing greatly with his comedic ability, providing many hilarious moments – there's an unexpected chicken sequence that left me laughing long after it finished – as the new toy destined to fill Disney store shelves. The diversity of voices and the convincing delivery of the various actors are commendable. Naturally, an animated flick from this particular studio cannot exist without plenty of original songs. The music of Wish features a score by Dave Metzger (Once Upon a Studio) with beautiful melodies that fit well into the magical world of Rosas, but the spotlight is on the songs that are written by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice. While there are one or two less inspired moments – the villain's musical sequence didn't convince me, and several songs have verses with too many words, creating an occasionally awkward rhythm – the timing of the songs is precise, as the lyrics are thematically rich and critical for the development of characters, necessary world-building, and explanation of certain plot details. Personally, it's hard not to pick This Wish as the standout, which promises to become a new fan favorite. As for the animation itself, Wish offers the expected in terms of visual quality while also crafted with a risky, somewhat innovative approach for the studio. The combination of painted 2D drawings, serving as stunning background scenery, with classic 3D designs for all of the characters, generates a unique aesthetic for the movie. The decision to focus the action exclusively on the city of Rosas is also a breath of fresh air, deviating from the common trend in animated movies of presenting numerous remote locations and characters. This choice strengthens the cohesion of the plot and the audience's immersion in a singular environment. Disney Animation's Wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams. Although the narrative follows a familiar structure and doesn't delve beyond the central theme, the nostalgia it evokes is certainly appreciated. Ariana DeBose's powerful voice embodies the inspiring determination of the protagonist, leading a talented cast in a movie marked by its beautiful blend of 2D and 3D animation, as well as original songs that, for the most part, will win over the audience. It's another charming chapter in Disney's vast library, offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages."
"Dec 8, 2023",positive," There were a lot of animated films this year. While that seems to be the case every year this past decade, 2023 has a lot of big-name titles. And despite having caught up with most of the non-Hollywood titles (NIMONA, SUZUME, etc.), I needed to catch those others. ELEMENTAL last week. MARIO, TMNT, and WISH this week. And there’s still THE BOY AND THE HERON, ROBOT DREAMS, THE MONKEY KING, and CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET to go. Add the live-action screeners to that list and it really is impossible to see them all. We’re less than two weeks from the GWNYFCA vote, so I’ll be focusing on English-language most since the group doesn’t generally watch many foreign films. Then I’ll pivot to the International Oscar submission before the OFCS voting window that starts 1/1/24. There’s always a strategy. The order of watching does matter. I only hope that Searchlight hits my inbox with POOR THINGS and A24 hits my mailbox with THE IRON CLAW soon. Both open Buffalo on 12/21 … two days after the nominations cutoff. It really is wild that a major Hollywood studio and multi-billion-dollar toy company allowed something like BARBIE to be made. The self-awareness and self-parodying on display is of the sort that would normally be quashed via legal jargon in whatever contract director Greta Gerwig had to sign before starting to write the script with Noah Baumbach. If that doesn’t show you the power of sitting at the table, whether it comes to box office take or Oscar nominations, I don’t know what will. Gerwig took her clout and turned it into that rare product-placement tie-in that actually has something valuable to say. Don’t call the result a message movie, though. It never stands on a soapbox or demeans one side in order to champion another (I’d honestly argue it could have done a lot more to skewer Mattel executives with purpose rather than merely jokes). It simply allows its characters to naturally evolve by way of providing necessary conflict. Because none of these dolls have ever faced that sort of existential crisis before. They’ve all maintained their pristine utopian forms in Barbieland as they were passed from child to child so their innocence could become a personality trait. So, throwing a curveball like depression or fallibility proves to be a monumental adjustment. You’re going from zero (a record loop of routine complacency) to sixty (questioning the very fabric of your reality) in an instant. No wonder it throws Barbie (Margot Robbie) off enough that her body chemistry shifts. Give a perfect imaginary ideal a whiff of the cesspool that is human biology and everything falls apart. Because it also falls apart that fast for us. One setback can spiral into years of torment. That yo-yo-ing ruins lives because we crave normalcy. To start over? To realize we’ve never actually begun? That’s too daunting to even consider. What’s ingenious about Gerwig and Baumbach’s story (say what you will about the whole, but you cannot deny the best part of BARBIE outside its immaculate production design is its script) is that they kill two birds with one stone via their conceit. Not only is the idea of Barbieland being a literal manifestation of a child’s imagination allow them to dig into a Barbie’s potential to empower (connecting each doll to the many youngsters who have indelible memories of them), but it lets them comment on the ways in which the toy’s reductive nature in a patriarchal, capitalistic world is problematic for those gains too. Barbie awakens to the fear and anxieties of being a woman in a man’s world just as Ken (Ryan Gosling) opens his eyes to the possibilities of having autonomy after a lifetime of always being relegated as the plus-one. We begin to see that neither end of the spectrum is perfect (although we should all be able to agree that Barbieland is much closer) and that the real lesson is realizing empathy and originality is key. And that it’s not always external forces that delude us into thinking conformity is better. Oftentimes our worst enemy in that regard is ourselves. Can dolls made real who bring back what they learned to their fictional existence teach that lesson alone? No. They get halfway with some wonderfully witty humor capped off by memorable turns from Michael Cera as Allan and Kate McKinnon as “Weird” Barbie, but we need someone on the other side to complement and bolster that journey. Enter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) and her mother Gloria (America Ferrera)—two women fighting for their place in a world that treats them like second class citizens. Two women who can educate the Barbies about reality and reclaim a bit of magic by remembering what it means to dream. The result is inspiring. It’s also heartbreaking (yes, Ferrera’s monologue is that good and hopefully turns her into a dark horse Oscar pick). For all the great things Robbie and Gosling are doing on a comedic level of committing to the bit, their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature of listening to, understanding, and ultimately accepting another’s lived experience and desires. Because we all deserve to exist as our own person outside the shadows of utility, ownership, or conditions. We all deserve the opportunity to love ourselves and have that be enough. For those who don’t understand that THE WALKING DEAD is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones, director Tae-hwa Eom and co-writer Lee Shin-ji’s CONCRETE UTOPIA might be able to drive the point home. Why? Because the living monsters are the only ones available in their webtoon adaptation (Kim Soongnyung’s “Pleasant Bullying”). The horde of murderous outsiders looking to take over apartment complex delegate Yeong-tak’s (Lee Byung-hun) home aren’t zombies. They’re desperate men and women just like those inside the walls. They simply weren’t lucky enough to reside within the only building spared from an apocalyptic earthquake. So, is it really a utopia? Or a fortress under siege? Are the inhabitants worthy of the comfort and security fate let them retain while the rest of the city freezes amidst the rubble? Or are they tyrants monopolizing their fortune and using delusions of grandeur as “the chosen” to steal and kill with impunity? It truly is the same central question behind Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard’s comic books. Is Rick Grimes really any different than the Governor or Negan or whomever else his band of survivors happen across? Or is he merely benefiting from his position as our protagonist? Eom and Lee deliver the end of days for these Koreans and let us watch whether compassion or greed rules the day. The residents coexist with the “outsiders” (soon to devolve into the label “cockroaches”) at first. Not necessarily by choice since they storm the doors out of necessity for shelter, but well enough to be civil until a food shortage starts turning everyone feral. Suddenly it’s “Us vs. Them.” A resident-only meeting is called to vote on what to do and Yeong-tak becomes their unanimous leader after selflessly running into a fire to protect them all. Cue the inevitable “evictions.” What follows is the usual chaos this archetype produces. It didn’t quite mark me as effectively as HIGH-RISE or ANIARA, but its slow descent into Hell as tensions and betrayals mount is effective. Credit the de facto leads in Min-sung (Park Seo-joon) and Myung-hwa (Park Bo-young) as a young couple that isn’t quite as easily swayed to the side of cutthroat tyranny as most. She’s a nurse who wants to help from the beginning. He doesn’t, but his conscience stays intact to ensure his many mistakes supply sufficient guilt. Will they be able to stop this out-of-control locomotive once it gets going? I won’t spoil things by answering that question. Just know CONCRETE UTOPIA doesn’t shy from the dark depravity we know the actions of “ordinary people” in such extraordinary circumstances will reach. Not that this choice isn’t without complexity, though. Eom and Lee don’t have a season or more to play with the duality of “violent good” and “violent evil” via separate factions with character development. So, they portray it through one man: Yeong-tak. Lee Byung-hun is up to the task. He’s a very determined and very impassioned leader with a strong personality hiding his secrets. He’s hero and destroyer both. How the film plays that conflict out isn’t surprising in its overall arc or demand that we question whether loyalty and protection negates the opportunism and deceit that allows it to flourish. The specific things that occur, however, can be quite shocking. There’s one moment towards the end that made me gasp as loudly as Myung-hwa. Despite being totally in character and believable in the moment, you don’t want to accept it. You still want to give these people the benefit of the doubt because you’d hope others would give it to you in the same situation. Sadly, it doesn’t take a long time looking outside the window onto our own turbulent reality to admit that, these days, the benefit of the doubt is a luxury few if any deserve. Despite the very sharp turn towards dissent that caused me to forget to even put Gareth Edwards’ THE CREATOR on my watchlist, I found the film to be both exciting and affecting. My favorite science fiction works are those that mine down from their high concept conceit to provide character-based drama instead. So, where you might think this is a story about war between humans and AI, it’s actually a potential redemption arc for a man who lost everything as a result of his fealty to a government wielding fear as a means to control its citizenry. Joshua (John David Washington) had a choice, though. While the events of the prologue (quick hits of humanity creating AI, AI evolving into human-like simulants, and the inevitable rubicon crossing that was a nuclear blast in Los Angeles) inspire him to fight for his species, years undercover gave him an out. Tasked to follow Maya (Gemma Chan), daughter of the so-called Nirmata, or “Creator” of New Asia’s free race of simulants, Joshua falls in love. The two marry. Maya becomes pregnant. And it seems all is well until an unprovoked attack reveals he’s been playing both sides. Cue tragedy. Pain. Regret. Edwards and co-writer Chris Weitz flash-forward five years to find Joshua broken and alone when the real plot begins. The US Army (led by Allison Janney’s Howell and Ralph Ineson’s Andrews) still wants to find the Nirmata—now more than ever since intel says he’s created a weapon that will give simulants an unequivocal victory. So, they recruit Joshua to lead the mission back to his old stomping grounds. They promise him he might even be able to reclaim what he lost. What none of them could guess, however, is that he’ll actually get the opportunity to find even more. How? Via a young simulant girl (Madeleine Yuna Voyles’s Alphie). The US calls her a weapon. His old New Asian allies (including Ken Watanabe’s Harun) call her their savior. Joshua simply sees a means to an end—a way to find Maya again. Whether or not it’s just because she’s a child, his old rhetoric about simulants being “programming” gradually fades. He feels something for her. Maybe it’s pity at first, but it blossoms into respect and perhaps even acceptance. Because her innocence somehow renders her “real” in his eyes. And watching humans try to kill her renders them into the monsters they’ve always been. The result is thus less about the dangers of artificial intelligence and more about America’s growing lack of empathy for those it deems foreigners (abroad and domestic alike). It’s about our ease at projecting our own violence and aggression onto our victims in order to justify our increased vitriol towards them as if it was us who was harmed by their very existence. The messaging and themes become closer to colonizers versus colonized. It’s Americans going to distant lands under the auspices of protecting home. Murdering with impunity and bloodlust in response to a tragedy they refuse to acknowledge their own complicity in igniting. Sound familiar? So, much talk tried to connect THE CREATOR to the Hollywood strikes and the risks of AI displacing artists when its narrative more closely aligns with the current Palestinian plight against the globally-backed Zionist state of Israel. When do we finally recognize what’s happening? When the body in the crosshairs is no longer an adult we can imagine as the enemy. The same happens here. Joshua has extenuating circumstances as far as not putting a bullet in Alphie’s head straight away, but her being a child quickly becomes as much a deterrent as the possibility that she might take him to Maya. I’ll leave why that duality means more in the context of the whole to the film itself since elaborating would create spoilers. All I’ll say is that it hit me exactly how Edwards and company hoped despite what I had read about it being a cold, emotionless affair. I will even disagree with comments about Washington being an unfeeling protagonist too since this might be his most three-dimensional and human performance yet. Add the gorgeous production design, breathtaking special effects (on a relatively tiny budget compared to its ilk), and a pitch-perfect ending and this thing is firing on all cylinders. Here’s hoping more people watch it sans expectations to discover just how good it really is. It’s a new beginning for Mom (Jodie Comer) and Dad (Joel Fry). Their home is set in the heart of London and they have a baby on the way. Unfortunately, this chapter starts for them just as another ends for the entire world. Relentless storms and flash floods become so destructive that I thought the beginning of Mahalia Belo’s THE END WE START FROM was a metaphoric hallucination about childbirth for its main character. Only after young Zeb’s birth is crosscut with water crashing through a window do we realize it’s really happening. London is gone. Adapted by Alice Birch from Megan Hunter’s novel, the narrative moves to its logical next step: a parent’s house. Luckily, Dad’s parents (Mark Strong and Nina Sosanya) are borderline survivalists living high above sea-level with a stronghold of provisions. But even those must deplete at some point. Eventually, those who were privileged enough to ride out the early chaos become the ones unprepared for what the world has become in the meantime. The story shifts to one of protection. Delusion. Nightmare and fantasy. Some can push through. Others cannot. Belo’s film is slow-moving as a result. What began with a rousing couple of scenes with some real electric drama settles into a series of ordeals that want to be more confrontational than they are actually shown to be. More than once Mom and Dad get into a disagreement that ends with a jump cut to her having to fend for herself. Eventually she meets an ally in O (Katherine Waterston), another mother with a toddler, and we follow them as they move between shelters and chase the pipe dream that is an island commune seeking to forget the past while building a future. Comer is very good in the lead. It’s easy to underestimate the performance since the whole turns into a one-woman survivalist show for long stretches. So, while it feels like we’re just watching the same thing in different forms over again, there is nuance if you’re willing to look. Even so, it’s the supporting characters that stick to your memory since their impact is more explosive. Waterston is fantastic—especially in her final scene. Strong too. Even Benedict Cumberbatch steals a moment via a brief cameo. They each shape Mom’s decisions to move forward by either allowing herself to look back or rejecting the urge. Those who can take something more from the themes of motherhood and separation will surely come away with a lot more to say and like about the overall film. I personally found myself appreciating the journey more than taking anything away from what ultimately proves to be familiar tropes within the post-apocalyptic genre—albeit much quieter and more introspective than usual. It’s a solid story that looks and sounds great, but I wouldn’t be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion that’s ravaging Mom’s heart. You can't really blame the filmmakers for going full fan service with THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE. I would have liked a story, but loosely connected action set-pieces within Nintendo's sprawling Mario-adjacent universe is still fun. And that's what the young kids in its target PG-rated demo want anyway. Because this isn't for nostalgic Millennials and Gen-Xers. This is an advertisement for new generations to board the bandwagon. So, we get a Mushroom Kingdom obstacle course complete with every power-up imaginable. A battle royale with Donkey Kong, Mario Kart race on the Rainbow Road, dungeons, water boards, and even Brooklyn with varying camera shifts to make the screen look like a side-scrolling platformer. Add a decent classic rock soundtrack, some interesting remixes of the original score, and a mostly passable voice cast and this low stakes romp excels at superficial entertainment. Does it also disappoint? You bet. Especially on the level of being a real movie rather than episodic introduction with more loose ends (Is Peach human?) then concrete mythology. The whole multiverse angle has been played out too, but ... whatever. That's the easiest way to juggle multiple ""stages."" The real head-scratcher, though, is an end stinger that epitomizes this mixed result's weirdness by teasing a character (Yoshi) whose world they literally showed an hour beforehand. Two things: Love a reboot of a known property that doesn’t default to origin story (even if MUTANT MAYHEM is the origin story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ coexistence with humans, it keeps their first fifteen years post-ooze a fun flashback montage) and love that director Jeff Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and that trio’s other co-writers let the “heroes-in-a-half-shell” be teens (what a great, young voice-acting cast to make it believable too). The story itself is a nice entry point into this new TMNT world (very reminiscent of the grunge animation popularized by the SPIDER-VERSE films). It introduces the idea of ooze, throws a bunch of mutants that haven’t been in previous films on-screen, and gives the leads a trial by fire confidence boost to prepare themselves for the fights ahead (watch the credits for a Shredder tease). The action is slapstick-y and kinetic with great choreography and the tone never falters in large part due to making April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) a teen too. Jackie Chan as Splinter and Ice Cube as the big bad Superfly are both inspired choices and the needle drops are memorable (give Four Non Blondes their royalty check), but I will say that the joke construction gets very grating. Rogen and company went heavy on the name dropping and pop culture references that seem to scream “hey, we’re hip!” in the kind of way aging dudes who aren’t hip anymore would. I kept waiting for one of the turtles to actually turn to the camera and wink, that’s how cringey it became. Hopefully they can shore that up with the inevitable sequel. A people duped into believing their once benevolent king still has their interests in mind despite falling prey to ego and avarice must rise to defeat him by following the one person able to see through the deception because of her selfless heart. Directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn along with screenwriters Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore pretty much deliver everything you'd want from an old school Disney film—complete with over-the-top villain (Chris Pine is having lots of fun as Magnifico) and talking animals and objects (Alan Tudyk is great as Valentino the goat, but nothing beats the mushrooms). It's big on emotion and message yet very short on plot (Ariana DeBose's Asha leads a rebellion of the soul to take back the wishes her neighbors volunteered to Magnifico under the auspices that he was ""protecting"" them and not just hoarding them for loyalty once he loses himself to fear). Neither is necessarily a bad thing. I would have liked better songs, though, since they range from catchy (""Knowing What I Know Now"") to obvious (""This Wish"") to mostly forgettable (""This Is The Thanks I Get?!""). The real draw is the animation. It's like WISH took 2D cell paintings and modeled them in 3D. The backgrounds are simultaneously flat watercolors and 3D-rendered rooms with perspective depending on the camera's angle. Same with the clothing, hair, and faces. The duality can be jarring at first, but quite beautiful the more you sit with it. “Moshfegh and Oldroyd [reach a point with the climax] where the curtain must be lifted to show the scars this world has etched upon the bodies of those we'd like to believe still maintain a semblance of innocence.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Coon and Kozak show that The Star Wars Holiday Special truly exists on an island alone as an unwitting cautionary tale never to be repeated again.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “Scorsese understands he can't truly tell [the Osage's] story as a white man in a way that gives them the voice they deserve. So, he tells the tale of their oppressors instead. And he does so with zero sympathy for even their most sympathetic members.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “The result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals. [But,] while a good time was had, I can't shake the sense that there was potential for so much more.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Some of what results can be confusing, but all of it is dramatically potent. And it's mostly due to a wonderful performance from Zalopany.” – Full thoughts at HHYS."
"Dec 7, 2023",positive," As Disney celebrates its 100th year, its Walt Disney Animation Studios borrows its past for its latest film, “Wish,” its 62nd, making references to at least a few of the 61 that came before it. Most notably, “Wish” leans into the idea of wishing upon a star, giving viewers a few bars of the melody from “When You Wish Upon a Star” — from 1940’s “Pinocchio” — before the movie even actually begins. And visually, it uses state-of-the-art digital tech to execute what the film’s production notes refer to as a “watercolor storybook style” meant to evoke the watercolor paintings that inspired early Disney films including “Sleeping Beauty,” “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and, yes, “Pinocchio.” Fortunately, “Wish” is more than a walk down Memory Lane. While not an instant classic, the music-filled adventure is a wholly enjoyable, perfectly pleasant cinematic experience — one with a message about holding on to and working toward one’s dreams. As with many a good Disney movie, an appealing young woman resides at the heart of its story. Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose) is one of the residents of Rosas, a fantastical island located off the Iberian Peninsula where wishes can come true. That is thanks to King Magnifico (Chris Pine), a sorcerer who grants one wish per month from those given at a ceremony marking a person’s 18th birthday. (All of this is covered quite thoroughly in the energetic and catchy DeBose-led opening number, “Welcome to Rosas,” one of seven original songs penned by singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and producer-songwriter-musician Benjamin Rice.) There’s a catch, however, to this whole wish deal: Once you make your wish, it’s held onto by Magnifico until he grants it and the person making it forgets what it is until then. Sounds a little iffy to us, but the people of Rosas love their king. That includes Asha, who is set to interview to be his apprentice. Get that prestigious gig, she figures, and she can persuade Magnifico to finally grant the wish of her 100-year-old grandfather, Sabino (Victor Garber or “Alias”). She seems a shoo-in, especially because, as she learns, she has a fan in Magnifico’s wife, Queen Amaya (Angelique Cabral, “Big Sky”), who admires the way Asha is there for her friends, family and others on the island. It isn’t long into her interview, though, that Magnifico and Asha find they aren’t crazy about one another; Asha becomes disheartened by the reason Magnifico has never granted some wishes, like that of her grandfather, and he is offended that she so quickly would ask anything of him. Disillusioned after Magnifico’s latest showy wish-granting affair, Asha makes a wish — yes, on a star — and soon has the company of a little personified ball of energy that she calls, well, “Star.” As Magnifico takes a turn toward cartoonish supervillainy, Asha, her suddenly talking pet goat, Valentino (Alan Tudyk), Star and others risk much to stop the king, who’s now getting high on his own supply … of wishes. The screenplay by Jennifer Lee — the writer and co-director of “Frozen” and “Frozen II,” who’s now the studio’s chief creative officer — and Allison Moore packs in so many supporting characters that few of them have an impact. Even Star, a very important player, never feels fully developed, but the silent little electric thing certainly has its magical moments. And while Tudyk is good for a few laughs as the over-the-top Valentino, the “Harley Quinn” voice actor sounds as if he’s voicing a cross between Clayface and the Joker, his characters on that hilarious Max adult-oriented animated series, to the point that it’s a little distracting. That said, directors Chris Buck — Lee’s co-director on the “Frozen” films” — and Fawn Veerasunthorn (head of story on Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon”) — keep things moving along nicely as they keep the focus on the two well-developed characters, Asha and Magnifico. The performance by DeBose (“The Prom,” “West Side Story”) helps endear us to Asha from the film’s first few minutes, and the gifted singer shines with leading numbers including the yearnful “This Wish” and the determined “Knowing What I Know Now.” However, it’s Pine (“Star Trek,” “Hell or High Water”) who steals the show as the power-hungry and vain magic man. The charismatic actor seems to be having a lot of fun singing the king’s disgruntled and self-loving “This Is the Thanks I Get?!” As the self-referential “Wish” arrives in theaters on “Thanksgiving” week, the 100-year-old Walt Disney Animation Studios is all but asking for a little appreciation. Thanks to many films of this quality or better, it’s earned it."
"Dec 7, 2023",neutral,"I enjoyed this movie, even though I felt a bit left out by it. I recommend watching this film with subtitles which include song lyrics (some subtitles include song lyrics, some don't)."
"Dec 6, 2023",negative," When Disney Animation head Jennifer Lee announced Wish as the company’s century celebration film during their 2022 D23 Upcoming Slate Presentation, fans were skeptical. To celebrate 100 years of Disney magic, Lee told the audience that the studio would be producing a new animated musical based on the titular star from their theme tune “When You Wish Upon A Star,” with recent Oscar winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story) attached to voice the lead character. It felt to many like Disney was indeed scraping the bottom of the IP barrel. Unfortunately, despite a sizeable effort, the finished product manages to prove those initial criticisms well founded.  Wish comes from co-directors Chris Buck (Frozen, Tarzan) and animator-turned-first-time-helmer Fawn Veerasunthorn, with Lee and Allison Moore behind the screenplay. The film is set in the medieval era within the Kingdom of Rosas, where King Magnifico (Chris Pine) and his wife Queen Amaya (Angelique Cabral) rule and govern. The deal? If one wants to live in the Kingdom of Rosas, under the protection of Magnifico, residents must give him their one true wish as part of a ceremony when they turn 18. When 17-year-old Asha (DeBose) discovers Magnifico’s dark secret, she makes a wish so powerful that a literal star shoots down from the night sky to help her.  The cinematic fairytale begins with a classic but sloppy storybook introduction, as Asha explains the history of the Kingdom of Rosas to the audience. This opening sequence highlights Wish‘s biggest problem: the writing and directing just don’t match up. The unfortunate result is a movie that never lives up to its potential.  Visually, that opening and the rest of the film work wonders as an homage to past Disney classics. The watercolour animation style is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Some frames look like paintings taken directly from the Louvre. The defined pencil strokes, the wider aspect ratio, and gorgeous nods to Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and more will hit any Disney fan right in the feels.  But after the first few sequences, it quickly becomes clear that Wish’s underdeveloped story doesn’t live up to the studio’s gorgeous animation. At the film’s conclusion, Wish feels uncannily like a generic version of modern Disney hits like Encanto or Moana. It contains only a few moments of the distinct magic that so often elevates the animated classics that have come before. The very best Disney films are simple, but this one is anything but simple in premise and ultimately presents far more questions than it gives answers.  The fact that Wish’s most significant flaw is its story is severely disappointing, given one of the film’s greatest strengths is its initial premise. An animated feature representing a century of Disney Animation seems like a no brainer. The idea of a young girl trying to stop her King from stealing his Kingdom’s wishes is also great. Combining them into one overarching concept could have been great, but with the creative choices made, Wish is messy and overcrowded.  At the film’s start, Asha visits her best friend Dahlia at Dahlia’s bakery. When she arrives, we meet their six other friends who combine to represent the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White, an idea perfect for a Disney celebration, but not one with the story complexity that Wish has and should be focusing on. What’s worse is that the film actually had the time to explore most things the movie sets up, but the writing ignores those more unique features in favour of generic adventure story beats. In fact, the most entertaining parts of Wish are all in the first 25 minutes. After that, the plot grinds to a halt and rarely escalates in any non-predictable way.  Wish also falls short in the villain department. Disney’s Golden Era Villains were pure evil, no questions asked. Flash-forward to the 21st century and there have been a real lack of memorable baddies. If there was ever a film primed for a new and timeless villain, Wish was it. Disappointingly, King Magnifico is a generic combination of past Disney characters without any unique or delicious characteristics to make him iconic. That’s perhaps most perfectly laid out in King Magnifico’s villain song “This Is The Thanks I Get?!” which is catchy but, as many have pointed out, sounds nothing like a Disney villain song. The music in Wish comes from pop singer/songwriters Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice. While both are immensely talented, they were perhaps not the greatest pick for this project. “This Wish”, sung beautifully by DeBose, is the only track that comes close to evoking the feeling one gets from listening to their favourite Disney themes. The rest of the soundtrack is akin to the mediocre pop fair you hear on the radio and immediately turn off or tune out. Given one of the most necessary attributes of a Disney animated classic is lavish musical numbers, the lack of memorable ones in Wish is extremely disappointing. It’s baffling that the studio approved these songs, knowing what the movie was attempting to celebrate.  With all of these clashing creative choices, Wish is yet another cinematic example of the lack of focussed Disney leadership. It’s becoming painfully apparent in the finished product across every brand under the conglomerate’s massive umbrella. Wish could have been a timeless classic if it had a hint of its own identity and embraced the necessary elements of iconic Disney films of the past. Since the film commits to neither, it seems unlikely Wish will be the bright star Disney Animation desperately wanted it to be.  All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men.

"Dec 2, 2023",neutral,Disney once upon a time provided outstanding movie magic for the entire family. Sadly that time has passed.
"Dec 2, 2023",negative," Wish doesn’t originate from an interesting character or a fresh story. It originates from a desire to self-congratulate. The movie is about the Disney star – the one Jiminy Cricket sang about wishing upon and the one featured in the studio’s logo. It imagines something like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where all the Disney animated characters exist in the same world. References to them are everywhere, from the beginning all the way through to the post-credits scene. Ironically, in its desire to celebrate Disney magic, Wish fails to generate any magic of its own. Asha (Ariana DeBose) lives in the kingdom of Rosas. She dreams of working alongside King Magnifico (Chris Pine), who has collected the wishes of his people, ostensibly to keep them protected in bubbles. Occasionally, he will select one to come true. Asha learns that he’s not nearly as benevolent as he seems and is, in fact, hording wishes to prevent them from coming true. Frustrated by this, she wishes on a star for a way to stop him. That star comes down from the sky, giving her pet goat the ability to talk and…well, this is a weird movie. On its own, Wish is mediocre yet harmless. The animation is pretty, if not innovative. The songs are catchy, although there’s nothing on par with Frozen’s “Let It Go” or even Encanto’s “We Don’t Talk About Bruno.” The plot aims for a sweet theme about the importance of having a wish in life. That’s nice, but not necessarily treated with the depth that emotions were in Inside Out or love was in Beauty & the Beast. Overall, the movie is lower-tier Disney. That’s because the story is working too hard to be a tribute. Not every reference is blatant. Some certainly are, as when Peter Pan wanders into a scene. Others are more subtle. You can’t help noticing them, though, and they're distracting. Ariana DeBose is wonderful as Asha. Nevertheless, the character’s journey is flat, given that she doesn’t have an actual arc for herself. Her arc is intended to serve Disney. Similarly, King Magnifico isn’t a particularly fearsome villain since his motivation is driven by a need to infer his connection to other Disney figures. Maybe the worst sin of all is that the star itself is kind of boring. Thanks to an inability to speak, it isn’t able to develop a personality. Considering the star is the single object the entire movie revolves around, that’s a massive flaw. Wish obviously aspires to be another Disney classic. It should have aspired to develop a tale worth telling."

"Dec 2, 2023",neutral," *** Fresh out of jail and acclimating to Southeast Portland, Wilder (Zachary Ray Sherman) has his feet in different worlds. His initial connection to the outside is former prison pen pal Riley (Jessica Barr), a young, open-minded sex worker. Then there’s the sway of the past: Wilder has a 6-year-old son he’s never met and an ex (Lindsay Burdge) with every reason not to trust his gestures toward reconciliation. That may sound like a moralistic setup, but directors Aaron Keene and Sara Burke (both former Portlanders) withhold judgment. Can’t Seem to Make You Mine is a patient character study, all handheld close-ups, watching and waiting as Wilder negotiates the tensions of life beyond a cell. Sherman, another former Portlander, plays Wilder as an ex-con whose battle is not with an outlaw spirit, but his own nervous system. Can his twitchiness handle an interminable safety lecture at a new welding job? Can he give his estranged son an impromptu bath without distress turning to anger? In this way, the film blurs Wilder’s suggested make-good arc into something increasingly lifelike. Redemption is too idealistic a concept when relationships are built moment by moment. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Hollywood. 7:30 pm Wednesday, Dec. 6. Filmmaker Q&A after the screening. **** Near the end of Napoleon, the eponymous French emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) demands to know what happened to the adoring letters he wrote to his beloved Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby). Yet for all his lordly airs, Napoleon doesn’t sound like a conqueror; he sounds like a high schooler whining about his flirty love notes to a cute girl in algebra class getting tossed in the trash. Such is life in Napoleon, which fuses the beautifully erratic humanity of Phoenix with the sweeping meticulousness of director Ridley Scott. Portraying Napoleon as both a devilish strategist and a lovesick dope is hardly a stretch: When the emperor died in exile in 1821, his final words were, “France, the army, head of the army, Joséphine.” That demands a paramour of mythic proportions, though “mythic” hardly does Kirby’s Joséphine justice. A scene in which she bares her crotch to Napoleon (“once you see it, you will always want it,” she prophetically declares) is memorable, but barely necessary; one word spoken in Kirby’s steely, velvety voice could seduce all but the sternest of authoritarians. Napoleon is even better as a sex comedy than it is as a violent spectacle, which is really saying something: Even the melees Scott staged for Gladiator are outdone by his poetic and brutish re-creation of Napoleon’s theatrics at the Battle of Austerlitz, which leaves Lake Satschen filled with ice, blood and cannon balls. Still, Scott never lets us forget that Napoleon is the overgrown adolescent who, in one scene, shames an Englishman by shouting, “You think you’re so great because you have boats!” Cry havoc and let slip the boys of war.

Amid its putative decline, the franchise has unleashed some of its liveliest and strangest films, from the oedipal Shang-Chi to the operatic Eternals. The trend toward general wackiness continues with The Marvels, which is less a sequel to 2019′s Captain Marvel than a multigenerational, quasi-musical buddy movie. Wearing a crimson bodysuit and wrangling glowing CGI effects, Brie Larson returns as Carol Danvers, the cosmic warrior known as Captain Marvel. She’s ditched her battle-ready pixie cut from Avengers: Endgame, but gained some new friends: astronaut Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Captain Marvel fangirl Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), both of whom prove invaluable allies in Carol’s war with a planet-hopping despot (Zawe Ashton). After a baffling first act suffocated by references to previous films and streaming series, The Marvels allows its heroic trio to bond and bumble with ease, whether they’re jumping rope on a spaceship or navigating a song-and-dance routine on an aquatic planet. In that scene, Larson wears a sumptuous red ball gown, which reminds us that Carol is never one thing—she’s casual and committed, gritty and glamorous. The greatest superhero Larson ever played was Grace Howard, the ferociously compassionate group home supervisor in Short Term 12 (2013), but as long as she’s willing to lend Marvel her unpredictable light, the franchise would be wise to let it shine.

Fortunately, director Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Thor: Ragnarok) has both the charm and insight to make Next Goal Wins an enjoyable, if slight, trip to the pitch. Based on the 2014 documentary of the same name, the story follows rage-aholic coach Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), who is assigned to lead the American Samoa national team, the laughingstock of international football since a humiliating 31-0 loss in a qualifying match for the 2001 World Cup. In theory, Fassbender’s casting is part of the joke—an actor known for his dramatic intensity (see: 12 Years a Slave) transplanted into a formula comedy—but his Rongen is more despondent than fierce, and he ends up the weak link in the cast. Fortunately, the rest of our players make up for it with humor and humanity to spare, particularly Oscar Kightley as the ever-optimistic club president and Kaimana as Jaiyah Saelua, the trail-blazing transgender player who is the heart of the team. Next Goal Wins works best as a loving tribute to sports movies of the past that, at a breezy 103 minutes, moves quickly and doesn’t overstay its welcome. It may not be a blowout, but it’s still a win in my book. PG-13. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

The film opens with a bang as chaos spreads in a Right Mart during Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving night; Roth treats the scene more like a zombie invasion than a shopping event. The plot then jumps forward a year as a killer in a pilgrim mask targets a group of teens he finds responsible for the previous holiday disaster. Thanksgiving may be Roth’s best horror effort since he traumatized audiences with Hostel (2006). Yes, the premise is silly, but the movie knows it, winking at the audience with absurd scenarios and over-the-top gore (one scene involving a cat is especially welcome). The killer’s identity, motivation, and even downfall can be guessed pretty early on, but seasoned horror fans should enjoy watching Roth cook with ingredients borrowed from Pieces (1982) and I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997). Dinner is served. R. DANIEL RESTER.

Unfortunately, in all the hullabaloo, the filmmakers seem to have forgotten to make the project itself innovative or compelling. Set in the Kingdom of Rosas, our story follows Asha (Ariana DeBose), who accidentally summons a magical wishing star from the sky, which threatens King Magnifico (Chris Pine) and his monopoly on all things enchanted and wishful. DeBose works wonders as our adorkable heroine, but there’s little to say about Asha as a character beyond that. Worse, the film’s forgettable songs lean heavy on bombast but light on poetry (the exception being Magnifico’s ode to his own despotism and the first proper villain song Disney has unleashed in years, “This Is the Thanks I Get?!” ). Visually, there’s nothing to complain about: The film’s fusion of retro watercolors with a CGI sheen is a marvel to behold. At a breezy 95 minutes, Wish doesn’t overstay its welcome and kids are sure to enjoy the cute critters and slapstick set pieces. Older fans, however, may realize their true wish is to see something else. PG. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

Set 64 years before Katniss Everdeen volunteered as tribute, the story follows young Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) as he’s assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) in the future’s favorite child beauty pageant/televised bloodsport. In theory, this is the origin story of how Snow went from the penniless son of a disgraced noble to the all-powerful villain Donald Sutherland played in the main trilogy. However, Snow doesn’t have much of an arc to speak of, starting and ending the film as an ambitious schemer, with his only lessons being the very obvious consequences of his actions. Snow’s eventual maxim, “It is the things we love the most that destroy us,” doesn’t amount to anything since his romance with Lucy Gray is as baffling as it is predictable and his survival is a foregone conclusion. The action outside the relationship drama is tepid at best, as Ballad retreads the beats from the earlier films but with worse editing and fewer sci-fi elements. The movie only comes alive when the actors themselves seem to be taking the piss out of the whole concept—particularly Viola Davis, who plays gamemaker Dr. Gaul as a cross between Willy Wonka and Emperor Palpatine. After 150 minutes of screentime that feels like far more, she asks Snow what the Hunger Games are for. Sadly, the best answer Ballad can give us is “because Lionsgate Films needed a tentpole in Q4.” PG-13. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

Not a glorious centenary classic but hardly the egregious bomb of repute either, Wish is Disney celebrating its 100th birthday in so-so style. It’s a normcore fairy tale with a bare-bones plot that gestures at bygone classics like Pinocchio without doing enough to be worthy of comparison. I enjoyed its colourful world-building, the sparky voice cast – especially Ariana DeBose as the hero, Asha, and Chris Pine’s Trumpy villain – and a faint socialist message that might have Walt turning in his grave.Pine, especially, is a lot of fun as the voice of Magnifico, the preening, petulant ruler of the Mediterranean kingdom of Rosas. With his manicured looks and dark sorcery, he’s like Saruman with a better grooming regimen. He secrets away the deepest wishes of his subjects – given physical embodiment as bulbs of light – in his tower, promising to grant them all... eventually.  Of course, as 17-year-old Asha (West Side Story’s Ariana DeBose) quickly discovers, he’s intent on keeping them all for himself. Which, as Disney villain plans goes, isn’t quite up there with turning puppies into a coat or putting a curse on a baby, but still galvanises Asha into summoning a wish-granting Star from the firmament to bring justice to the land. Despite the passive nature of his foul(ish) scheme, Magnifico is Disney’s best villain since Tangled. The screenplay, by Allison Moore and Frozen’s Jennifer Lee, makes him a populist type who’ll be all-too familiar these days. The Star Trek actor gives him a whiny entitlement that gets full airing in his big musical number ‘This is the Thanks I Get?!’, one of a handful of strong tunes by songwriters Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice.The best of them, the rabble-rousing ‘Knowing What I Know Now’, feels like Disney’s answer to ‘Les Misérables’s ‘Do You Hear the People Sing?’. Belted out by future EGOT-winner DeBose, with back-up vocals from Angelique Cabral as Magnifico’s estranged queen, it’s charged with a surprising sense of political awakening and recasts the dream-hoarding Magnifico as the kind of greedy monopolist that the ungenerous viewer might even compare with Disney itself.  Less successful is the mash-up of 2D and 3D animation, an attempt to pay homage to Disney’s hand-drawn house style that doesn’t come off, and a goat sidekick who gets to talk but has nothing funny to say. When even Alan Tudyk can’t rinse laughs from a sidekick role, your script probably needs another sprinkle of magic.

"Dec 1, 2023",neutral," Disney’s newest animated original Wish can be described as the cinematic equivalent of the gift shop you’re forced to walk through at the end of the ride. It’s not the worst movie that you will bring your kids to but the obvious goal is to vacuum up more money for the mouse. The film itself is supposed to be honoring 100 years of Disney, with a fairy tale story in the image of past iterations, such as Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Snow White, only without half of the imagination. A few of the original songs are good, the animation looks crisp, but little interest in giving the audience something fresh. Instead Wish serves up more nostalgia, an empty exercise, resulting in a fairy tale as fleeting as a shooting star. It begins in the friendly town of Rosas, where the people work together in harmony, while the wizard Magnifico (Chris Pine) has the job of taking the wishes of the people, granting only a select few every year. His new apprentice becomes Asha (Ariana DeBose), a young woman with the hopes of being as good as the man she follows, that is until she gets to know the real Magnifico. When she discovers he refuses to grant wishes that would benefit anyone outside of himself, Asha chooses to wish on a shooting star, who soon visits her with powers she’s never had. Now, with the help of an adorable star, a talking goat, and her seven friends, they must try to stop the power-hungry wizard. On the surface, Wish seems like a nice and harmless approach to trying to create an original new fairy tale. Sadly, what directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn have is a Broadway play masked as a Disney movie. The screenplay, written by Buck, Jennifer Lee, and Allison Moore steals from the DNA of Frozen, Peter Pan, Bambi, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. It’s stolen to a fault, where Asha’s friends all represent one of the Dwarves, including one who sneezes a bunch, one with big dopey ears, and another who loves to sleep. It turns the entire narrative into one big easter egg hunt for all the Disney die-hards, making the originality obsolete, along with minimizing any fresh artistry. What should not be denied is the incredible talent of Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine. Their vocal work is quite stellar, including the rousing duet “At All Costs” and DeBose’s big belter “This Wish”. If Wish was left to just the two of them delivering dueling songs we might have a better movie, but instead, it becomes a standard process of Asha needing to bring the townspeople together to take down Magnifico as his power grows as strong as Maleficent. It’s also obvious that the goal is to eventually connect Wish to other fairy tales, including a cameo by Peter Pan and a mirror on the wall that might find a way into other far-off lands. It’s not just the soulless part of Wish that makes it a miss, there are also plot holes, including moments where scenes seem to be missing- that’s something we rarely see in a Disney production. On top of it, there are continuous dollar signs on the screen, from an adorable cuddly star that will end up in a bed with little Suzie, a soundtrack that will garner plenty of streams, and the potential for a stage production that may have worked better than this. It’s a celebration of 100 years of Disney and done in the only way they know possible- all in hopes of making another buck. That’s just a rotten Wish."
"Dec 1, 2023",neutral," Sharp-witted idealist Asha (voice of Ariana DeBose) makes a wish so powerful, it’s answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star in the new animated film, ""Wish."" In Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish,” Asha’s pajama-wearing goat Valentino makes the most of the magic that accompanies a little ball of boundless energy called Star.  How else can you explain the visual and emotional references to “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Fantasia” and the Disney theme parks in “Wish,” an animated film that could have used a little more originality? Constructed much like the princess films that have built the company, “Wish” follows a 17-year-old as she applies to apprentice King Magnifico (voiced by Chris Pine), who can make wishes come true. Unfortunately, he’s pretty stingy on the number. When young Asha (Ariana DeBose) pushes her grandfather’s case, the king becomes indignant and plays the “what about me” card. She sees him for what he’s worth and does a little of her own wishing, which brings a star-like creature into her life. In no time, she’s mounting a challenge to his authority and getting a cadre of characters on her side. Before you even realize Peter Pan is in this mix (no kidding), you’ll have witnessed comparisons to moments in “Aladdin,” “Sleeping Beauty,” “Cinderella” and “Frozen.” Set in a Mediterranean country called Rosas, “Wish” suggests the king holds his citizen’s wishes in his castle. When he grants one or two, hopes are dashed and the country goes into a funk that even a singing 17-year-old can’t lift. The star (which looks like a Funko Pop) gets Asha to reorder her priorities and take on the guy she wanted to assist. That means violent rages can only be a song away. (On that note, the music sounds like early-draft Lin-Manuel Miranda. DeBose can sell them, but even a 6-year-old would see the words aren’t quite up to karaoke standards.) The screenplay, meanwhile, seems like something that emerges from an office forced to invest in a failing 401k plan. It hints at tyranny but presses on because it’s better than nothing. When the happy ending finally arrives, directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn don’t hesitate to toss in fireworks that resemble the outline of Mickey Mouse. It’s as if someone said Disney needed a film that would pay tribute to the company’s 100th anniversary and, darn, if this isn’t it. While the success of “Little Mermaid” and “Frozen” may have corrupted the system, it didn’t need to go this far in pandering to everything that worked once upon a time. There’s a real “I can do anything I want” attitude to “Next Goal Wins” that makes it about as inspiring as a student film without structure."
"Dec 1, 2023",neutral,"When all is said and done in the world of Wish, the brightest features of the animated story are DeBose and Pine’s performances, bringing their talent to Asha and King Magnifico, respectively. "
"Dec 1, 2023",positive," The continuing theme in creations that have come along since Walt Disney released the Mouse on the world has been the importance of hope. How that resonates from films to parks has always been at the heart of Disney magic. It was never made as clear as in the 1940 animated film “Pinocchio.” Jimmy Cricket (as sung by Chris Edwards) told the world that “when you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are. Anything your heart desires, will come to you.” An exclamation mark is put on that philosophy in the new Walt Disney Animation Studios release of “Wish.” Not only is the movie built on a foundation of the need for hope, but it also features an animated star that has been the object of so many wishes. The film isn’t one of the top films to come out of the studio, mainly because the music is not as dynamic as in “Frozen” or “Encanto.” That’s a hurdle that generally is overcome by a solid story from Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck and Allison Moore that is laced with optimism and features a heavy dose of nostalgia. Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose) lives in the magical kingdom of Rosas. She is an idealist who is not afraid to speak her mind, even when it comes to the too on-the-nose named King Magnifico (Chris Pine). The king’s big rule is that every subject must give up their deepest wish. It is his viewpoint that average subjects can’t be trusted with a wish because the odds are high, it will never be fulfilled and that would create great anxiety. He has declared himself the only one worthy of saying if a wish should be granted. This comes during a yearly ceremony where only a few subjects get their wishes granted. Asha believes that each person should be the shepherd of their own wish, whether it comes true or not. Just the idea of something grand possibly happening is what gives people hope. Her viewpoint earns the wrath of Magnifico (worst name ever for a cartoon villain), and it isn’t until she makes a wish on a star that she gets help. The star (a character destined to be a popular toy) comes to the kingdom and gives Asha magical powers. Most of the film is a very traditional good vs. evil tale. What elevates it is the references to past Disney projects from “Peter Pan” to “Mary Poppins.” Asha’s friends are the sneeziest and dopiest group to come along since “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Pine plays the king with such bravado that he is only one twirl of a mustache from being melodramatic. Directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn have painted him as a male answer to Maleficent from his obsession with mirrors to his evil rants. It is refreshing to see that the primary villain is male as Disney has filled films with evil queens and nasty stepmothers for decades. Buck and Veerasunthorn took an interesting direction in the animation. Although the primary characters have the standard look of drawn characters (via a computer), the backgrounds have a different texture. Each setting looks more like an ancient tapestry than the kind of perfectly crisp backdrops of recent animated movies. The look fits with how the film uses a modern approach to its theme but a classic approach to the storytelling. The seven all-new songs in “Wish” were written by Grammy- nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter Benjamin Rice. Michaels has written songs for the likes of Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes, while Rice’s works have been recorded by Lady Gaga and John Legend. It’s a nice musical pedigree for both of them, but their songs for “Wish” never reach the kind of memorable status of past works. Songs from past animated offerings such as “Let it Go” or “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” are immediately recognizable. DeBose gives everything she has, but her talents just can’t lift up the music. Despite the weak soundtrack, “Wish” works because of its strong continuation of the Disney mantra, a warm animation style and a very fun wink and nod to so many past Disney productions. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Nov 30, 2023",positive," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Wish review says that lovely visuals and an extraordinarily talented voice cast including Ariana DuBose and Chris Pine elevate the animated feature that is otherwise just meh. In the beginning, I was happily enchanted by Disney’s latest animated feature, Wish, partially because I immediately adored the gorgeous setting with its intriguing Moorish embellishments. There are so many dazzling artistic opportunities available when basing a fantasy on a Mediterranean island, likely located between the coast of Andalusia and Morocco. Okay, so I lived there for a few years, fell in love with the area, and think the whole world should revel in its aesthetics. The gifted artists who worked on Wish did the setting full justice, with its colorful patterns, lights, architectural highlights and dimension. The movie is a sight to behold. Children may not be aware of the cultural treats, but subliminally they’ll be delighted. Helming the animated film intended to celebrate the rich animated heritage of 100 years of Disney was an ambitious project for fresh directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn. Their debut is not bad, considering all they had to weave into the film, including on the nose references to the “When You Wish Upon a Star” theme. Disney enthusiasts will have a great time noting the nods to the classics. Unfortunately Wish may not make the cut to join the pantheon of those Disney classics. It just doesn’t reach the same heights. While the plot is forgettable and the message almost imperceptible, the cast does their best to elevate the material, and by and large succeeds. The radiant Ariana DeBose (who won an Oscar last year for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s Westside Story) reaches a voiceover high note in her portrayal of feisty heroine Asha. Chris Pine is at his best voicing the hero/villain King Magnifico. They play against each other in a convoluted story about how the residents of the kingdom on the island of Rosas give their fondest wishes to king/sorcerer Magnifico for safekeeping while he decides which ones to grant. Asha uncovers the flaw in his motives and the system, and rallies the locals to take back their wishes. I think I need a nine-year-old to explain it to me. But I did enjoy the music and the humor while trying to make sense of it all. Perhaps I shouldn’t overanalyze it, just lean back and enjoy?

"Nov 30, 2023",positive," Oh, how the mighty have fallen. It’s easy to be weary of Wish, the newest animated parable from Disney, meant to commemorate the company’s 100th anniversary through a barrage of Easter eggs and self-congratulatory platitudes about the importance of following our dreams. Despite adopting an original story, the film from co-directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn falls prey to a multitude of clichés that have become synonymous with the studio in recent years. For every attempt at newness (the art style, the studio’s first Afro-Latina heroine), there is a recycling of old trademarks (the goofy sidekick, the patterned musical vignettes). Therein lies the dilemma of Wish’s ironic charms: To what extent is something a cliché when judged on its own merits? And can a movie like Wish even be evaluated without endless comparisons to its forebears?  Set in the kingdom of Rosas, a magical land ruled by the charismatic King Magnifico (Chris Pine), Wish centers on earnest 17-year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose). Upon almost landing an apprenticeship at his majesty’s palace, her idealism is crushed as she realizes that the ruler whom she exalted isn’t all he seems. Magnifico’s claim to fame is granting his constituents’ wishes, and entrusting him with your wish means being freed from the burden of feeling that absence—in other words, you forget. However, it soon becomes apparent that the king does not plan on granting most of the wishes he’s been given, hoarding them in his palace where they will never see the light of day. When Asha’s own wish is answered by a cosmic force, she and her friends set out to save their community from Magnifico’s control. On its own terms, Wish isn’t half bad. The fairytale at its center is adorable and, combined with the opaque watercolor effect of its 2D and 3D animation, creates the illusion of a children’s book come to life—something made even more evident by the film’s storybook introduction. To that point, it’s easy to wave away any questions that arise such as, “Why did no one else see through the king’s veneer, when his whole thing is stealing people’s dreams?” The moral lesson matters more than any in-universe logic: There’s value in teaching children about the strength that comes from being part of a collective, and that individualism will only get you so far. Pine’s totalitarian ruler is the kind of classic Disney villain the company has been phasing out in recent years and, if nothing else, the concept of a young person becoming disillusioned with the leadership in her country after getting a look behind the curtain feels prescient. Better teach these kids now, before it’s too late! Still, the irony of praising a film about nonconformity from a media conglomerate with such an iron grip on our culture is not lost, and Wish certainly relies on tired formulas. If you thought Olaf from Frozen was annoying, watch out—there are multiple hyperactive sidekicks here. The anthropomorphic star, who looks like a Kirby character and doesn’t talk, is cute, but “baby” goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk) is sure to quickly irritate adults. Meanwhile, the human characters for the most part have the exaggerated cadence and mannerisms of Disney Channel actors who perform as though there are casting agents watching, waiting to whisk them on to more promising opportunities. The songs are also a mixed bag. DeBose makes a wonderful addition to the Disney princess (or not-quite-princess) roster: Her theme—an empowering anthem á la “Let It Go”—is beautiful, and the choice to have Asha sing it twice (once alone, and once as part of a collective) is charming and clever. Other musical numbers, such as Magnifico’s “The Thanks I Get,” are lackluster, the bouncy beat painfully reminiscent of generic radio fodder like Imagine Dragons’ “On Top of the World” rather than the musical theater sensibilities of your classic Disney villain song. It doesn’t help that writers Allison Moore and Jennifer Lee bizarrely choose to pepper references to other, better Disney movies throughout. Given the company’s acquisition and franchising of nearly everything under the sun, one wouldn’t be blamed for reading this as a stab at the shared universes popularized by Disney’s subsidiary Marvel. Despite its current connotation, though, Disney has already been doing these minor tributes to its previous films for decades. Still, it’s hard to imagine Wish having the longevity that the company’s other recent output, such as Soul and Encanto are clearly poised for. From the intricate line art of 101 Dalmatians to the impressive realism of Moana, past Disney movies had enough charm to enchant audiences through the decades without relying on generically cutesy sidekicks and musical numbers with all the personality of a boardroom meeting. Harboring inventive visuals and a heartrending message, Wish has enough heart going for it. What a shame, then, that it wasn’t confident enough in itself to try for success without these clichés.

"Nov 29, 2023",negative," The half-baked story attempts to shoehorn  in as many references to previous Disney films as possible, attempting to explain the origins of characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Mary Poppins, and even Zootopia. Wish is the Spider-Man: No Way Home of the Disney animated canon, an attempt to bind their films into one shared universe. It was cute when Beauty and the Beast's Belle wandered through the background of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Rapunzel showed up in the crowd at the coronation of Queen Elsa in Frozen. Those were clever little easter eggs for the sharp eyed fan; but this mega-prequel feels like a contrivance of the highest order. It's as if the filmmakers started with these bullet points and then worked backwards to construct a story to fit them. It does not work. Star is a cute character and Alan Tudyk provides a few laughs as a talking donkey, but the film around them seems to be actively working against them, giving them very little to work with. Wish is done no favors by a surprisingly bland animation style and a series of generic and unmemorable songs - there's no breakout ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" to be found here. Every song feels designed to be a pop-showstopper but are instead weighed down by exposition. The fact that it spends so much time trying to explain itself should have been a red flag to all involved, but instead somehow this made it through multiple stages of development to become a major tentpole release honoring the studio's storied past. That is perhaps Wish's greatest weakness, much like the studio as a whole, it is too focused on what once was rather than charting a course toward what could be. It feels stuck in the past, trapped by its own limiting conceit, unable to break free of the manufactured nostalgia it's trying so desperately to peddle. Even as someone who feels genuine nostalgia for those films, Wish feels like it's simply trying too hard, and as a result it fails on nearly every conceivable level. It's just a feature length greatest hits reel that makes you wish you were watching something better."
"Nov 29, 2023",neutral," This year, in case you hadn’t heard, Disney celebrates its 100th birthday. And as a present to itself, the animation giant has commissioned Wish – a film that celebrates that most Disney of themes: wish fulfilment. Set in the Mediterranean kingdom of Rosas, it’s a world created by its king, a sorcery-proficient ruler named Magnifico (Chris Pine). He has captured everyone’s wishes, storing them in blue baubles in his kingdom, and doling them out very irregularly. When young Asha (Ariana DeBose) visits the king to see if she can become his apprentice, she has one thing in mind. The latest wish ceremony coincides with her grandfather’s 100th birthday (how very Disney), and she would love for his heart’s desire to be granted. Then, in the way only Disney can, Asha meets a star who falls from the sky – a bright yellow cutie who has magical powers to grant wishes. From there, our wholesome heroine encounters a menagerie of talking animals, including her pet goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk) when she takes a trip into the forest. The film comes co-directed by Fawn Veerasunthorn and Chris Buck, the latter co-writing the script with Allison Moore and his erstwhile co-director on the mega hit Frozen, Jennifer Lee. Unfortunately, there’s little chance of Buck and Lee conjuring the same magic here. To start with, the film’s songs are instantly forgettable. Only in isolated moments, such as when a crop of talking mushrooms get used as drum cymbals, are there flashes of charm. Largely, it feels like a self-congratulatory nod to Disney past. The end credits feature images of such Disney stalwarts like Pooh Bear, The Jungle Book’s Baloo and the foxy Robin Hood. There are even oblique references to Mary Poppins and Peter Pan’s Neverland in the story itself. Plus, if you stay to after the end credits, you’ll find a very sweet rendition of “When You Wish Upon A Star”, the song made famous in 1940’s Pinocchio. Maybe the House of Mouse’s century of achievement merits some sort of celebration, but Wish isn’t really it. The animation does have a pleasingly old-school, hand-drawn sheen to it, and West Side Story star DeBose gives a lively and likeable vocal turn."

"Nov 29, 2023",positive, Sería extremadamente fácil descartar a “Wish” como una oferta animada de Walt Disney familiar y predecible. Todo lo que esta en este filme de alguna forma se ha visto en alguna de sus otras películas. Lo que sucede es que en esta ocasión esto no es resultado de una película que busca reciclar lo que fue exitoso en ofertas anteriores. Esta ha sido diseñada para celebrar el primer siglo de animación del estudio que comenzó con “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” y recientemente revolucionó las redes sociales con We Don’t Talk About Bruno de “Encanto”.
"Nov 28, 2023",neutral," This mercifully short musical fantasy feels as if a studio executive shoveled every one of Disney's animated classics into an Artificial Intelligence program and used the result to construct a 92-minute collective commercial for the centennial anniversary of the Mouse House. This should not be a bad thing at all for younger audiences who've yet to experience the original magic of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Pinocchio,” “Bambi, “Dumbo” and other classics. The agreeably unmemorable songs, spectacular set pieces, faintly touching plot and obligatory comic relief animals and objects (one that could well be the Star wished upon by Jiminy Cricket) will engage them enough for “Wish” to find an appreciative audience. Nonetheless, for the rest of us, this Wishy-washy movie might be best viewed as a feature-length game of spotting numerous Disney references crammed into the dialogue and visuals. Bright and idealistic 17-year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose) — a bundle of nervous energy and overarticulated cuteness — wants to become the emperor's apprentice in Rosas, a magical land ruled by the handsomely beneficent sorcerer King Magnifico (Chris Pine). As a supposed service to the people, King Magnifico collects all the residents' dreams for safe keeping in blue glass bubbles that float inside his palatial house. Once every year, he says he might grant a wish. Asha presses the king to consider granting her father's secret wish. When he refuses, she dares to criticize him for not returning the wishes to the people, and threatens to tell everyone, prompting a suddenly volatile king to reveal the real short-tempered, megalomaniacal dictator under his Doctor Strange facade. She then makes a wish so big that it causes the Rosas citizens to glow — and summons forth the most magical of stars, a celestial entity so famous, it goes by a single name: Star. Does this zippy, emoji-like character free the people's dreams? Nope, but it does enable animals to speak English, just in time for Asha to find a comical sidekick — a talking goat named Valentino (Alan Tudyk). One might ponder exactly what form of criminal activity has King Magnifico committed? He promised to free his people of the burden of unrealized dreams and would consider granting one every year. And the residents agreed to this deal. What if “Wish” is really a cautionary political tale about the dangers of pinning hopes and dreams on a charismatic leader promising to unburden his followers who are blind to the true ego-driven id creature lurking under those sharp clothes and product-fixed hair? “I decide what everyone deserves!” the king thunders, his soft blue eyes turning into green laser beams of raw control and power. He orders his people to hunt down Asha, the single dissenter in this supposedly utopian kingdom. Do they comply? How sad that the animated movie selected to celebrate 100 years of Disney joyously references so many classics but fails to include two components key to their successes: innovation and unforgettable characters."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive," Oh, Oliver Quick. With a name like that and a hardscrabble background story to boot, this eager and naïve and easily mocked scholarship student who arrives at Oxford in 2006 would seem to have a Dickensian quality. But as portrayed by the electric Barry Keoghan in Emerald Fennell’s outlandish and psychologically grotesque and pitch-black comedy/thriller “Saltburn,” our man Oliver turns out to be more of a Tom-Ripley-meets-Patrick-Bateman kind of guy. Writer-director Fennell, who won an Oscar for her screenplay of her film “Promising Young Woman” (2020), once again proves to be a cinematic provocateur capable of creating memorable shock-value moments, though at times the candy-colored, exquisitely staged yet often brutally ugly histrionics are more about the fireworks than substance. Still, this is a greatly entertaining journey through the dark side of class consciousness, a kind of vicious take on “Brideshead Revisited,” only with 2000s pop culture references to films such as “Superbad” and “The Ring,” and songs such as MGMT’s “Time to Pretend” and “Mr. Brightside” by The Killers. Also, there are, let’s see, one, two, three — at least three scenes so startling and graphically weird that we won’t get into detail here, other than to say one involves dirty bathwater, another involves menstruation and the third involves a fresh, so to speak, gravesite. You’ve been warned. “Saltburn” opens with Keoghan (“Dunkirk,” “The Banshees of Inisherin”) as Oliver walking onto Oxford’s campus and immediately finding himself sitting at the outcast table with the other misfits, geeks and nerds. But Oliver has other plans from the moment he sets eyes on Jacob Elordi’s Felix Catton, an impossibly handsome, wealthy and charming fellow who is the center of the student universe, drawing the adoration of all who come into contact with his shining bright essence. Oliver draws Felix’s sympathy with his tales of his rough upbringing and the recent death of his drug-addict father, while Felix finds himself trusting Oliver because Oliver is “real,” unlike Felix’s beautiful and superficial friends. The school year ends. Oliver has nowhere to go. Felix, who apparently has a way of collecting stray humans and keeping them around until they bore him, invites Oliver to spend the summer at his family’s ludicrously lavish estate, known as Saltburn. This is when the high-camp hijinks and the piercing satire truly begin. We meet Felix’s family, including his mother, Elsbeth (Rosamund Pike), a judgmental and effortlessly cold soul who says with a straight face she has an aversion to ugly people, as if it’s a legitimate medical condition; his father, Sir James (Richard E. Grant), a cheery sort who always seems to have his head in the clouds, and his sister, Venetia (Alison Wary), whose eating disorder is the subject of much discussion. Also staying at the house: the aforementioned Farleigh, who keeps telling Oliver he’ll be forgotten once the fall semester arrives, if not sooner, and Elsbeth’s clearly damaged friend Pamela (Carey Mulligan), who has worn out her welcome and keeps missing the increasingly obvious suggestions it’s time for her to get on with her life and, you know, LEAVE. The younger set at Saltburn engages in acts of mildly shocking bohemian activities, from reading Harry Potter books in the fields while fully nude to playing tennis in their formalwear to the obligatory lavish late-night partying that entails sex and drugs and EDM. Felix surprises Oliver with a road trip that reveals a twist I did not see coming — a deliciously warped secret that forever changes the dynamic between Felix and Oliver. One expects this development will effectively end Oliver’s time at Saltburn, but it only serves to embolden Oliver and motivate him to show his true colors. Let’s just say Saltburn and many of its denizens will never be the same. In an ensemble bursting with talent, Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant create supporting players who are so wonderfully out of touch with the harsh realities of the world, so casually indifferent to human emotions at times, that we’d love to see a prequel placing them center stage. (Surely this must not have been the first strange summer at Saltburn.) On the heels of the HBO series “Euphoria” and his turn as Elvis in “Priscilla,” Jacob Elordi continues to build a star-level career. As for Barry Keoghan: He has been given a gift with the character of Oliver Quick, and he knocks the role into the next county."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," by Walter Chaw It’s possible to catch the zeitgeist express and still suck, and here’s the proof: Fawn Veerasunthorn and Chris Buck’s flaccid, disturbing, Les Miz-for-kids Disney flick, Wish. On the verge of giving her fondest wish to the autocrat King Magnifico (Chris Pine) in exchange for his beneficent magical protection, 17-year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose) discovers that Magnifico is actually a fanatical, power-drunk, authoritarian zealot. His greatest fear is that one of his people in the kingdom of Rosas may nurse a fond wish that leads to his downfall, so he hoards them, extracting them during a ritual from his people as they grow from childhood to the rest of their wish-less lives. He keeps them as bubbles of blue smoke in a glass observatory in his castle. Why doesn’t he just destroy the ones he deems dangerous? Asha is a classic Disney heroine who makes the critical error of asking Magnifico why her grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber) can’t have his wish finally fulfilled upon his hundredth birthday. The wish in question–to write a song that inspires the next generation–has been deemed too radical is why. Magnifico shows his true colours and, crushed, Asha assembles her posse of lovable misfit village children to overthrow their ruler. She has magical help, though, in the form of an adorable wishing star she’s summoned with a real curtain-raiser of a Broadway-style number belted with Best Original Song gusto. Their plan to convince the King to return everyone’s wishes for the people to do with as they please brings to mind great ideas of the past like the Internet or Pandora’s Box. There are two things Wish forces you to consider, and the first is that it is a child’s version of Tarkovsky’s Stalker, in which the MacGuffin is a thing that could conjure a person’s fondest wish. The second is that no one has really thought through the ramifications of the movie’s premise. In Stalker, the people who are given their wish kill themselves. In Wish, the first thing the New Republic of Rosas does when it expresses the power of its people is to exile Magnifico into a two-dimensional purgatory for the rest of eternity. Grim. More than grim, it appears to be an apologia for a certain kind of groupthink that glorifies the dreams of the individual over social consequences and the need for an organizing principle. This seems like sympathy for the devil, right? For a defense of murdering dreams in favour of finding fulfillment in quotidian pursuits? I propose a middle road where kids maybe shouldn’t be told they can have or do anything they want, should they only wish it hard enough. On the one hand, the timing for a film like this is good, appearing as it does in the middle of an active period of protest and organized labour action–and indeed, the climactic battle features the citizens of Rosas manifesting the sentiments of “Good Morning Starshine” to focus their twinkle and collectively rise above. Wish‘s connection to Hair is more than follicle-deep, in fact: both are pieces of pop provocation appearing during a period of unpopular war and social unrest. But only one of them has the courage to say that the usual pragmatism and distraction will snuff out all this energy. Wish has its “Good Morning Starshine,” but not its “Flesh Failures” that “face a dying nation of moving paper fantasy.” And on the other hand, the timing of Wish is terrible, because all I can think about is all the dead children chalked up as casualties of an inevitable religious war designed to bring about the end of the world by the death cult we have collectively voted into power. This suffering is the product of wishes, too–the ones had by “good” people worshiping “good” religions. Asha and the plight of her little buddies hits differently now than it would have a year ago, six months ago. King Magnifico–white, bearded, unshakeable in the belief of the correctness of his wisdom–hits differently as well; the idea that a cult leader or a nation of people not doing a good job of disguising how quickly they turn to retribution and tribalism might see the hell they’ve created as utopia is possibly the only thing I found realistic about Wish, even as Wish promises that what you’re seeing when you’re watching a horror movie’s resolution is something good instead of something depressing. I think that’s the overriding impulse driving Wish‘s creation: the wish that this aggressive harvesting of every Disney movie that worked (and a few that didn’t) strikes you as novel and uplifting rather than as an endorsement for the way things always were: vengeance-fuelled and misdirected. In the end, the first casualty of war is always innocence."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive,"From the fantastical fairy-tale setting to the blandly designed characters and contrived plot, nothing feels very original. But there's plenty of charm to keep us watching, a few enjoyably nutty moments and some terrific voice work from an ace cast."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive," Like trying to recreate a delicious meal with all the same ingredients — a strong female lead living in a beautiful, remote place who tries to stem someone’s magical powers — Wish is what the Disney diner has served up. This centenary film to mark the year-long celebration of 100 years of Walt Disney is the story of young Asha (Ariana DeBose) who lives in the magical kingdom of Rosas. The first scene harps back to many classics, with the opening of a storybook and the words, “Once upon a time . . . ” It then uses this device as a tool to explain the slightly convoluted rules that govern Rosas. Beloved King Magnifico (Chris Pine) collects a wish from everyone when they turn 18. Then, when he’s compiled them into a giant bauble that floats around the ceiling of his castle, the giver of the wish forgets his or her desire to do something extraordinary. He wants his citizens to desire little from life and have control over their hopes and dreams. While once seeming to be a handsome hero, he’s quickly revealed as a narcissist wanting to dangle empty promises over the kingdom. There are some cracking power ballads, with DeBose getting the goosebumps rising, a cute sidekick in the form of a baby goat and plenty of nods to other Disney movies and their characters. But the humour and heart of Frozen, Moana and Tangled are just not there — and there’s very little jeopardy or magical moments that make your eyes well up with tears of joy. The pair check into a Gothic Welsh country house hotel where Rosalind –  a genteel woman with a clipped accent, pearls, tweed skirts and faithful spaniel Ludo by her side – spent time as a child and Julie, seeking inspiration for her new screenplay, hopes to unearth buried memories. The floorboards creak, windows bang and Ludo whines repeatedly. Richly layered set textures are deftly employed to unsettle – walls are dark and foreboding and lamps dim, while neat modern touches, such as Julie’s trainers, playfully add contrast to keep us guessing whether this house is haunted or not. It sees wealthy couple Amanda (Julia Roberts) and Clay (Ethan Hawke) leaving their New York townhouse for a weekend away in the Hamptons, just outside the city. The pair arrive at a sprawling, immaculate house to soon be joined by the alleged owner, G.H. Scott (Mahershala Ali) and his daughter, the very outspoken Ruth (Myha’la). Soon the whole of America is in crisis, with the characters guessing it is a terrorist attack, as G.H. constantly alludes to knowing more than he lets on, yet still remains vague. Meanwhile, Amanda is a clichéd white woman idiot. Everyone appears to talk in riddles and you don’t know who you are meant to like – if anyone."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," Indiana Jones hung up his hat. Scorsese went west. Napoleon invaded (again). Greta Gerwig became the first sole female director to join the billion-dollar club with Barbie. Other female directors — Celine Song (Past Lives), Justine Triet (Anatomy of a Fall) — conquered the arthouse."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive,"Wish is engaging and heartfelt but weaves between familiar themes.

The voice acting was strong and a couple of songs are definite standouts.

It doesn’t hit the highs of the studio’s 90’s renaissance era but serves as a solid tribute film."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," ★☆☆☆☆Poor Disney. Barely a fortnight after its latest superhero offering, The Marvels, delivered the worst opening weekend performance at the American box office for a Marvel movie, this new animation has received the studio’s lowest score in 18 years on the review-aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes. Directed by Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn, respectively the co-director and storyboard artist on Frozen, and written by Jennifer Lee, who wrote and co-directed that film, Wish arrives almost a year to the day since Disney’s last animated flop, Strange World. The brand is clearly in crisis. And this is why: Disney has, very literally, lost the plot."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," A pair of hugely complicated marriages dominate two major biopics this week. Both films tell the stories of great men, one called Bernstein, the other Bonaparte, whose love lives, at least in these cinematic interpretations, drove and defined them almost as much as their genius. Bradley Cooper's Maestro is a searingly intelligent drama focusing on the complex relationship between the mighty American composer Leonard Bernstein (superbly played by Cooper) and his wife, the Costa Rica-born actress Felicia Montealegre (a matchingly exquisite performance from Carey Mulligan). Many of those complexities spring from Bernstein's bisexuality. When we first meet him in the 1940s he has a male lover, and there's a slight but telltale pause when his sister (Sarah Silverman) learns that Lenny and Felicia are romantically entwined. However, the film deliberately fudges the question of whether Felicia knows her husband-to-be also sleeps with men, and exactly when she finds out. There is a moving scene when Bernstein reassures their daughter Jamie that there's no truth in the scurrilous rumours she's heard, and a furious row between husband and wife in their grand Manhattan apartment that has a darkly hilarious counterpoint, as a giant inflatable Snoopy floats past the window, part of the Macy's street parade. All this is so sharply written by Cooper and his co-writer Josh Singer (an Academy Award winner for 2015's Spotlight) that there are moments when it feels almost impertinent to be watching, a public intrusion into private tumult. But it is clear throughout that their difficulties are underpinned by mutual devotion, which movingly becomes clear when Felicia is diagnosed with cancer. It was bold of Cooper to let Bernstein's thrilling musical talent play second fiddle to all this. But the film still chronicles his dazzling career, and explains how he was tugged in different directions, between his extraordinary talent for composing stage musicals (above all the incomparable West Side Story) and his equal facility with classical music. Not long before he died, incidentally, I was privileged to see Bernstein conduct. It was an unforgettable spectacle, watching an elderly man walk arthritically to the podium, slowly pick up the baton and shed decades. It was as if he was holding a wizard's wand the wrong way round, with all its magic animating him. Cooper, both with his performance and direction, captures that wonderfully. His principal achievement in this film, only the second he has directed after 2018's splendid A Star Is Born, is to convey the thumping charisma that made everyone in Bernstein's orbit dance to his tune. Moreover, Maestro does not deserve to be tarnished by the brouhaha that erupted when it first emerged that (non-Jewish) Cooper was sporting prosthetics to replicate Bernstein's nose. Bernstein's children gave their approval, which is good enough for me. There has been another brouhaha around Napoleon, Sir Ridley Scott's epic telling of the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. As I predicted in my First Look review last week, historians have got very huffy about the inaccuracies, and the broad characterisation of the title character, enigmatically played by Joaquin Phoenix. They have a point. The film is sumptuously watchable but also inherently flawed. Phoenix mumbles his way through it, sometimes to the point of incoherence, and David Scarpa's script doesn't allow Napoleon to express himself much beyond the battlefield (where he's a tactical genius) and the bedroom (where he's a bit of a weirdo). We are rather sketchily shown how he rose in post-revolutionary France to be crowned emperor, becoming as obsessed as any hereditary monarch with fathering a son to succeed him. Yet of his myriad other achievements, all those innovations that gave rise to the adjective 'Napoleonic', there is nothing. Still, at 85, Scott remains a heck of a storyteller, even if this is not quite the full story of Napoleon. Above all, the battle scenes are fantastic, starting with the victory that established the ambitious Corsican's formidable military reputation: his surprise attack on the English to end the 1793 Siege of Toulon. There are plenty of sound reasons to watch this film. The music is terrific (very stirringly, Edith Piaf accompanies Marie Antoinette to her execution), Rupert Everett is perfectly cast as the Duke of Wellington, and in particular, Vanessa Kirby is wonderful as the beguiling Josephine. It is easy enough to see why Napoleon is smitten from the moment he first catches sight of her, although, again, one of history's most celebrated love stories is largely reduced to his lust and her forbearance. By the time this picture reaches the small screen, it will have put on weight. In due course Apple TV+ will show the director's cut, which lasts about four hours. I'm rarely in favour of film-making at that tremendous length. But there's no doubt that this Boney needs more meat. With lacklustre animation and forgettable songs, it tries desperately to be a new Frozen but falls many snowballs short, despite a decent voice cast led by West Side Story's Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine. The story unfolds in a magical, ethnically-diverse island kingdom, ruled by King Magnifico (Pine), a control freak who takes and stores the wishes of his loyal subjects. Asha (DeBose) is a spirited 17-year-old girl who first seeks an apprenticeship with Magnifico but soon realises he's not the benign protector he appears, and, with the help of a wishing star, enrages him by challenging his power over people's emotions. It's a nice enough idea, if rather complex for the likely audience, but there's nothing bewitching about Wish. Unlike Frozen, it lacks charm and charisma. Leave The World Behind (138 mins, ★★★✩✩) is a Netflix thriller in what you might call the Armageddon genre, starring Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, Mahershala Ali and Kevin Bacon, and executive-produced by none other than Barack and Michelle Obama. Roberts and Hawke play an affluent New York couple who take their kids to a Long Island holiday rental owned by Ali's character, only to experience a series of first unsettling and then downright alarming events that suggest America is under attack. But by what, or whom? Writer-director Sam Esmail presents some spectacular images (such as an oil tanker crashing into a beach resort, and dozens of driverless Teslas crashing) but the film is at least 25 minutes too long. A Quiet Place (2018) covered broadly similar territory much more deftly. Ronnie O'Sullivan: The Edge Of Everything (15, 113 mins, ★★★✩✩) is an intense documentary following the brilliant snooker champion as he wrestles, very profanely, with his demons. It too goes on a bit — to misappropriate snooker jargon you might need a bottom cushion — but it certainly offers some unprecedented insight into what fires Rocket Ronnie."
"Nov 28, 2023",positive," ""Cuando pides un deseo a una estrella, tus sueños se hacen realidad"". Así reza el final de 'When You Wish Upon a Star', la dulce melodía que suena en la intro de Walt Disney Studios antes de cada clásico animado y que se ha convertido en uno de los sellos característicos de la compañía del ratón. El mensaje de la canción, usada por primera vez en 'Pinocho' (1940), resume a la perfección el discurso esperanzador de una casa que comenzó su andadura adaptando los cuentos infantiles del ""y fueron felices y comieron perdices"". Es por eso que para celebrar los 100 años de Disney, nada mejor que convertir su seña de identidad en una película que sirva de vuelta a los orígenes... con un giro actual. La tarea de 'Wish' no es nada fácil. Ser la película que celebra el centenario de un estudio como Disney le pone una carga y una responsabilidad que juega en su contra por las expectativas que genera. Y es cierto que 'Wish' puede que no sea 'Fantasía', 'Blancanieves', 'Dumbo' o 'Peter Pan', los films más destacados de la época dorada de los clásicos animados de Disney, pero cumple al recuperar esa esencia de cuento de hadas, de ilusión e inocencia. De pedir un deseo repleto de felicidad y esperar a que se cumpla por arte de magia, porque solo con desearlo muy fuerte es suficiente. Pero Asha, la heroína de esta historia, no se conforma con eso. Los niños de ahora saben (o deberían saber) que los sueños no se cumplen porque sí, y que hay que luchar para que se hagan realidad. 'Wish' se diferencia de las fábulas clásicas de Disney por su espíritu rebelde y reivindicativo, empoderador, de luchar por tus sueños pero también por los sueños de los demás contra el Rey Magnífico, un poder (llámalo sistema, gobierno, orden establecido) al que le da miedo que la gente sea consciente de su potencial, y uno de los mejores y más terroríficos villanos de Disney en mucho tiempo. Asha tiene guiños a las princesas clásicas de Disney, ayudada por siete amigos que nos recuerdan a ciertos mineros de baja estatura, pero tiene más en común con guerreras como Mulán o Mérida. Y sobre todo con el Hada Madrina. Asha no se sienta esperanzada y ansía que su sueño se haga realidad, sino que pelea porque se cumplan los sueños de todos. Y lo hace junto a animales del bosque que cantan y con la ayuda de una estrella que desprende polvo de hadas. Lo viejo y lo nuevo se dan la mano en una película que cumple como colofón y resumen a 100 años de existencia. A 100 años de magia. Dirección:     Chris Buck, Fawn Veerasunthorn Reparto: Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, Alan Tudyk País: Estados Unidos Año: 2023 Fecha de estreno: 24-11-2023 Género: Animación Guion:     Jennifer Lee, Allison Moore Duración: 105 min. Sinopsis: Asha vive feliz junto a su familia en el mágico Reino de Rosas, que está gobernado por el Rey Magnífico, un hechicero capaz de hacer los sueños de la gente realidad. Pero todo cambia cuando descubre la realidad tras la fachada de Magnífico. Entonces pide un deseo a una estrella... Y se hace realidad.

"Nov 28, 2023",negative," The animation world was recently startled by Warner Bros.’ announcement that they planned to shelve their recently completed feature Coyote vs Acme for a quick tax write-off, rather than spend money to release it. Not to be outdone, Disney Studios offers up Wish, an animated feature that is the kind of artistic misfire that deserves to be hidden away and never spoken about again. This is a creation so alternately bewildering and banal that it’s implausible that at no point during the entire creative process did anyone point out the seemingly obvious fact that virtually none of it works on even the most basic levels. Wish takes place in the kingdom of Rosas, which was founded and is currently ruled by Magnifico (Chris Pine), a seemingly benevolent sorcerer who offers peace and protection for all those who live there. The catch is that they must surrender their deepest wish to Magnifico, who stores them in the lab in his castle in bubbles and once in a great while returns one to the person who made it. Inexplicably, the people of Rosas think this is a good deal, none more so than Asha (Ariana DeBose), a teenager who is all in on both Rosas and Magnifico and is hoping that the latter will present her beloved grandfather (Victor Argo) with his wish to commemorate his upcoming 100th birthday. When Asha is summoned to apply for the job of Magnifico’s apprentice, everything seems to be falling into place. However, during her meeting with Magnifico she quickly discovers that he would rather hoard the dreams for himself (save for the occasional innocuous one), and refuses to relinquish any that could threaten either Rosas or his reign, including the one belonging to Asha’s grandfather. Finally recognizing the folly of people sacrificing their greatest wishes, Asha makes a new wish and, to her shock, gets a response in the form of Star, an impish celestial body that has a wide array of magical powers, including gifting animals, such as Asha’s pet goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk), with the power of speech. With the aid of Star, Valentino, and her friends, Asha is determined to free the captured wishes and return them to the people who made them. At the same time, the increasingly paranoid Magnifico is determined to capture Star and harness its incredible powers for himself. In the broad strokes, Wish sounds like just the kind of grand animated fantasy tale that is synonymous with the Disney name. However, this one feels as if it has been constructed entirely out of ideas scavenged from the studio’s reject pile. For starters, the basic premise is so odd (especially in how the film essentially glosses over the concept of someone voluntarily giving up their greatest wish) that it takes far too long to figure out what exactly is happening. If a reasonably intelligent adult finds themself struggling to understand the key story points, what are the young members of the target audience going to make of it? The characters are also lacking. Although DeBose and Pine certainly give their all in their vocal performances, not even their evident enthusiasm can quite hide the fact that the characters they’re voicing are as blah as can be. Asha is cheerful spunky and resourceful, but completely devoid of any of the details or nuance that might have made her into someone more memorable or interesting. Magnifico seems a little more promising at first but his shift into evil mode is way too abrupt to be believed, and even then, he never becomes truly fearsome in the manner of the most memorable Disney villains. Asha’s sidekicks Star and Valentino are cute enough to sell lots of toys this Christmas but contribute little besides that. The former is just too cutesy, while the latter mostly just drops one-liners that land with nearly audible thuds throughout.  Visually, the combination of 2D and 3D animation is superficially attractive but the two approaches never merge into a cohesive whole and, once again, there is nothing particularly memorable or striking about the design. As for the songs by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, they are uniformly bland, and not a single one of them does anything to advance the narrative or our understanding of the characters. Every single one of them could have been stripped out of the finished film without losing much in the process.  Perhaps the most disappointing element of Wish (a film that seems to be comprised entirely of disappointing elements) is that this is the project that represents Disney Studios as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. As a result, the film is filled with little Easter eggs and references to their past animated accomplishments. On the one hand, these bits are a bit of a welcome diversion: you and your friends can challenge each other to see who can find and list the most without worrying about being distracted by anything regarding the story. On the other, they also serve as an inevitable and perhaps unfortunate reminder of the ambitions and qualities of the films that helped the studio reach that landmark anniversary, and how absent they are from this particular entry. While adults aren’t the target audience for Wish, not even the younger viewers who are its key demographic are going to have that much interest in it either. Because it’s bright and colorful and silly, they might watch it once but most likely won’t return to it as they do with the films, many of them Disney animated works, that they embrace. For a film that spends much of its time talking about magic, it’s too bad that Wish displays so little of it. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"
"Nov 27, 2023",neutral," Disney está celebrando en 2023 su centenario, lo cual no quita que esté siendo un año algo complicado para la compañía. El motivo es que ha sufrido varios sonados fracasos en taquilla como los de 'Indiana Jones y el Dial del Destino' o 'The Marvels'. Ahora el estudio espera resarcirse al menos en parte de ello con el estreno de 'Wish: El poder de los deseos', su nuevo largometraje animado que también tiene el reto de hacer olvidar el enorme fiasco de 'Mundo extraño' en 2022. Por mi parte, tengo mis dudas que Disney vaya a lograr un éxito atronador con 'Wish: El poder de los deseos', ya que es una película que deja con la idea de que el estudio ha perdido esa magia que caracterizó sus producciones animadas durante muchas décadas. No es que sea para nada un desastre, pero sí una producción genérica que de no ser por su presupuesto multimillonario perfectamente podría ser un discreto intento de otra compañía de hacer su versión de un Clásico Disney. Que una película sea totalmente previsible es algo no necesariamente malo, pero que sea muy obvia en la forma de contar su historia es algo mucho más difícil de perdonar, sobre todo cuando parece que estás pisando en todo momento sobre seguro. Eso es lo que hacen los responsables de 'Wish: El poder de los deseos', ya que no hay ni una sola decisión que cualquier espectador mínimamente avispado no se vea venir. Claro está, algunos argumentarán que 'Wish: El poder de los deseos' es una película pensada para los más pequeños de la casa y que los adultos tienen que canalizar su niño interior para disfrutar con ella. Es un argumento razonable, pero llega un punto en el que se utiliza como excusa para tapar las carencias del título en cuestión, y estoy convencido de que estamos ante uno de esos casos. La primera prueba de ello la tenemos con sus canciones, pues prácticamente todas ellas carecen de pasión y gancho. Están ahí porque hace falta potenciar ese toque musical que fue clave en muchas de las mejores películas animadas de Disney, pero a la hora de la verdad solamente 'This Is the Thanks I Get?!' se acerca a tener la fuerza que requieren estos temas para ser algo realmente especial. Todo eso es algo que se traslada a la película a todos los niveles, desde una galería de personajes que en ningún momento llega a seducir al espectador hasta la forma de ir ejecutando su evolución argumental. Ni siquiera esos secundarios cómicos marca de la casa funcionan, algo especialmente evidente en el caso de Valentino, la cabra con la voz de Alan Tudyk que en otras producciones del estudio estrenadas hace décadas se habría convertido en un favorito del público. Aquí está ahí, dice un par de frases de vez en cuando y no se le da una oportunidad real de brillar. A su favor hay que decir que 'Wish: El poder de los deseos' es sin lugar a dudas bastante vistosa en el apartado visual, pero eso es lo mínimo que podemos exigirle a una película cuyo coste ronda los 200 millones de dólares. Y por ejemplo el personaje de la estrella es bastante cuqui, pero uno no puede evitar pensar que está pensado más para vender una buena cantidad de peluches que para cualquier otra cosa. Con todo, es uno de los puntos destacados de la película de forma indiscutible. Y es que la historia central, donde se echa mano de una lucha entre el bien y el mal que suena a ya vista en multitud de ocasiones, resulta muy endeble. Una auténtica lástima, ya que al menos aquí sí hay un villano en el sentido tradicional de la palabra, algo que últimamente el estudio había descuidado en sus producciones animadas, y encima con la voz de un Chris Pine que se nota lo mucho que está disfrutando. El principal problema es que el relato que plantea sobre la magia y los deseos no va más allá de lo meramente superficial. Se adorna con esas referencias que mencionaba antes a títulos clásicos, se lima todo para quitarle cualquier tipo de matiz y se plantea una aventura anémica que sobre el papel tienes los ingredientes necesarios para dar forma a un gran clásico animado Disney, pero a la hora de la verdad no es más que un pálido reflejo. Soy consciente de que parece que he odiado 'Wish: El poder de los deseos' por todo lo que he dicho hasta ahora, pero el sentimiento real es de decepción. Y no porque esperase que fuese un gran película, sino porque parece que se conforma con el mínimo exigible de ofrecer lo que cree que quiere el público, recurriendo a menudo a la nostalgia en lugar de a cualquier otra cosa. Incomprensible que suceda algo así en una película que ha tenido detrás a buena parte del equipo que sacó adelante la estupenda 'Frozen'. Con todo, 'Wish: El poder de los deseos' es un pasatiempo pasable una vez te has acostumbrado a que tampoco tiene aspiraciones por convertirse en algo realmente especial, y que lo que quiere ser una carta de amor a todo lo que ha aportado este estudio al cine animado sea eso, pues sabe a poco. Puede que para algunos espectadores sea suficiente e incluso la celebren en el momento de su estreno, pero dudo que vaya a ocupar un lugar especial en la memoria de ningún espectador dentro de apenas unos años. De hecho, 'Mundo extraño' ya me pareció poquita cosa, pero mejor que la que nos ocupa ahora ya es."
"Nov 27, 2023",negative," Like the mighty empire it is, Disney has been spending 2023 celebrating its centennial. Understandably, one of the world’s most recognizable brands wants to bask in its longevity. But “Wish” is a curious way to carry on the party via the studio’s animation department. Animation is where Disney truly began its conquest for world domination, but this surprisingly bland offering is both small in scale and in boldness. Its story is pushed aside to make way for easy nods and winks, nostalgic traps, and unconvincing reminders of why we should all love Disney. Of course, let’s not be too harsh. When it comes to the basics a very young audience member might still be entertained by this movie and its fleeting charms. It’s the adults that have to accompany their children, many of whom have vivid memories of Disney’s glory days, who will be left empty-handed. The story drops into the magical kingdom of Rosas, an island lorded over by King Magnifico (Chris Pine). It’s a relatively stable place, mostly because Magnifico has the ability to collect people’s wishes. So the inhabitants of Rosas have handed him over all their wishes, which he keeps in glass bubbles high above his castle. If nobody has any wishes in life, they will become passive denizens. Someday Magnifico might decide it’s time for your wish to be granted. Enter 17-year-old Asha (Ariana DeBose), who is applying to become the benevolent tyrant’s new apprentice. But when she questions his methods, Asha is quickly kicked out of Magnifico’s presence. There’s a slight problem for the dictator because Asha was raised by her late father to wish upon a star, and thus keep your wishes to yourself. She makes such a wish and an actual Star drops down! Tinkling and cheery like a living emoji, Star will help Asha change the people of Rosas and rise up against Magnifico.  “Wish” is the first Disney animated feature in a long time that truly feels like pure advertising. It has an appealing visual style in its design, which gives off the look of sketched animation. It doesn’t go for colors that pop. The plot is as subdued as the look. Directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn helmed Disney’s smash hit “Frozen,” yet here don’t show off the same kind of deliriously engaging storytelling. There’s not much to the plot of “Wish” because it’s so bare and phoned in. Magnifico has everyone’s wishes trapped as he struts around, animated with great cocky gestures and hair, and Asha just has to free everyone with the help of Star. In-between the key confrontations are a few funny gags, most involving Star and Asha’s pet goat, Valentino (Alan Tudyk). The latter is given the ability to talk by Star and Tudyk gives the animal some hilarious, droll moments. Asha’s 100-year-old grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber) tugs at our heart strings because his wish has never been fulfilled, which means you know it will by the end credits. There is much skillful work present in this movie but it offers nothing new. Nothing is dared and everything feels manufactured. The songs by Dave Metzger, Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice are lively but sound like carbon copies of everything Lin-Manuel Miranda ever wrote, complete with his knack for rhyming a single word to death. A few do work better such as “I’m a Star,” though the glory days of “The Lion King” and “Frozen” are very missed. The characters equally feel slapped on with little purpose other than to fill villain and hero roles. Magnifico is performed with spirited villainy by Pine, but there’s not much to him. Ariana DeBose is just as good as Asha, but her character also functions as nothing more than a walking song and dance number. Over at Pixar they’ve been delivering films with rich and entertaining concepts like “Turning Red,” though Disney figures audiences are easier to attract with a simple premise in the form of “Wish.” The final standoff with Magnifico is shockingly quick and simple. Over in a flash, the movie quickly wraps everything up with an end credits sequence featuring classic Disney characters drawn next to all the names and positions. So what are we left with? Star as a creation is undeniably lovable, especially when it puts on different hats and other items it finds laying around. Chris Pine is having fun even if he’s not really allowed to let loose. Magnifico is the tamest Disney villain in a long time. What matters to Disney is that the message is delivered that we should keep wishing upon a star, while whistling the tune and buying passes to the theme parks. But of course there’s a reason the company is so successful. It knows families will indeed file in with the young ones to have a good time. Some of this movie is indeed just that, but this studio is capable of so much more."
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," WISH is a movie that looks like it was made before its makers fully finalized exactly what they intended to do. It has a worthwhile metaphoric message, strong vocal performances, and occasional moments of charm and effective humor. However, WISH is also a bit of a mess. In WISH, we are on the Mediterranean island of Rosas. The sorcerer Magnifico (voiced by Chris Pine) has founded a kingdom here, where he is able to protect his subjects with the magic he has learned. Rosas is a tranquil, happy place, where the citizens love their monarch. On each Rosas resident’s eighteenth birthday, they tell Magnifico their wish. If Magnifico deems the wish worthy (and not likely to endanger the status quo), he grants it. Not-yet-eighteen-year-old Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose) hopes that her grandfather (voiced by Victor Garber) will be honored on his hundredth birthday by having his wish granted. To this end, she gets a job interview to be Magnifico’s assistant. Things start off well, but take a turn when Magnifico confides that, one he hears a wish, he removes it from the wisher’s mind, and keeps hold of ungranted wishes forever. Asha thinks this sounds extremely unnecessary and unfair. Even if Magnifico can’t grant the wish, people ought to at least be able to remember what it is that they wanted. Magnifico somewhat huffily disagrees, and Asha goes home, jobless, to her mother (voiced by Natasha Rothwell), grandfather, and pet goat Valentino (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Remembering gazing up at the night sky with her late father, Asha wishes upon a star. To her astonishment, an anthropomorphic little yellow Star comes down from the sky. A great light washes over Rosas, delighting the inhabitants – except for Magnifico, who views this as a threat to his power. The plot from the screenplay by Jennifer Lee & Allison Moore, from the story they crafted with the film’s directors Chris Buck & Fawn Veerasunthorn, has the advantage of talking in broad strokes about something real. As another reviewer has pointed out, WISH deals nigh-directly with concepts of intellectual property theft. The parallels are clear and, given the recently-concluded Writers Guild of America strike, could scarcely be timelier. But too many details don’t fit right. Has no one else in Rosas wished upon a star before Asha? Why does Star come down now? What exactly can and can’t Star do? Likewise, character beats feel odd. When one character goes through what should be an alarming change, it just seems like an amplification of what has come before. Likewise, when a betrayal occurs, we know so little about the betrayer that it doesn’t register. Even the plentiful musical numbers seem a little strange. DeBose, as demonstrated in her Oscar-winning performance in 2021’s WEST SIDE STORY, has a gorgeous voice and uses it to top effect here. Pine shows that he can do leading-man vocals admirably. But the choreography for the musical numbers (excepting those involving singing animals) is made to resemble theatrical staging. It’s not unreasonable to suppose that production/distribution company Walt Disney Pictures is hoping for a stage version of WISH, but surely strictly human dancer-style moves can wait for that. While it’s not explicitly demanded of the art form, animated musicals usually avail themselves of the opportunity to do things that can’t be done in live action. There are bits of this, but fewer than we might expect. There are things to like in WISH, including Tudyk’s slightly pompous baby goat, some stunning backgrounds, and Star’s playful good cheer. It’s just not all that we might, er, well, you know, the title .."
"Nov 27, 2023",negative,For a film that’s meant to sum up a century’s worth of groundbreaking animated feature production — the song “When You Wish Upon a Star” is even baked into Disney’s corporate logo — Wish plays more like a collection of deleted tracks than greatest hits.
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," Enter Wish, the latest musical fantasy movie from the House of Mouse, with its special focus on the origin of the famous “wish upon a star”. Frozen co-directors and writer Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee were brought in for the ultimate Disney tribute movie, but the end result is sadly something of a mixed bag. The Wizard King has the ability to grant wishes to each resident of the Kingdom of Rosas who give him one when they turn 18. Once a month Magnifico selects a citizen’s wish to be granted, but it turns out he actually erases their memories and never returns the unwanted wishes to his people. Nevertheless, Asha ends up getting help from an actual star she wishes on, to save the kingdom and defeat the tyrannical villain. Sadly this storyline and its characters are pretty thin, lacking in inspiration and struggled to keep our attention or interest throughout. It feels like Disney were so focused on a paint-by-numbers tribute to their fantasy musical movies that they forgot to sprinkle on the magic. Despite this, there are aspects of Wish to be praised and enjoyed, the fruit of clearly a lot of hard work by the CG animators and music team. Firstly, the movie's animation has received a lot of criticism online, but it’s really missing the point. It’s a CG-animated film which takes a leaf from the Spider-Verse blockbusters by having a 2D traditional look that beautifully pays tribute to the original way these movies were made. Secondly, we laughed a lot. There are some great comic moments here, especially from Alan Tudyk’s talking goat Valentino, in some really fun set pieces during energetic musical numbers. Speaking of which, where Wish really shines is its songs. New musicals can take time to cotton on to, but Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice’s songs with Dave Metzger’s score really work well.  Catchy tracks like This Wish and our favourite, This Is The Thanks I Get?!, are also all the more aided by DeBose and Pine’s excellent vocals. Lastly, look out for those blink-and-you’ll-miss-it Easter eggs linked to classic Disney movies near the end, giving a nod to all that came before. It's just a shame that, all in all, Wish doesn't quite live up to the studio's legacy."
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," Released in the same year that Disney celebrated its 100th anniversary, this animated adventure pays subtle tribute to the studio's storied past, while delivering its own watchable brand of magic. The kingdom of Rosas is ruled by sorcerer King Magnifico (voiced by Chris Pine), who safeguards people's wishes and grants them when he chooses. Asha (Ariana DeBose) is desperate to be his apprentice, but when she realises some wishes will never be granted, she makes her own wish upon a star. This summons Star, an adorable, energetic yellow being, who helps Asha and her friends defend Rosas against the power-hungry Magnifico. Wishwill mostly appeal to younger audiences, although it ticks a lot of boxes for adult Disney fans - half the fun is spotting the many references to other stories. Pine and theatre star DeBose really shine in their musical numbers, with Magnifico's This Is the Thanks I Get?! an indignant anthem fit for any Disney villain, while Asha's This Wish and I'm a Star are empowering bops. However, the film is let down by an underdeveloped plot that fails to flesh out Magnifico's reasons for going on a wish-crushing rampage. The film is undoubtedly full of magic, hope and nostalgia, but it ultimately falls short of classic status."
"Nov 27, 2023",negative,"The movie is so busy referencing the classics, it makes itself an afterthought."
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," Wish owes a solid amount to what came before. We see this through the decision to bookend the film with a storybook. Its 2.55:1 aspect ratio pays homage to Sleeping Beauty. The animation style also offers the best of both worlds as far as Disney’s animated library is concerned but the watercolor style is a throwback to the earliest feature films. Animation has come a long way since 1923. In another universe, Wish would be in 2D but it wouldn’t be the same–not with the advances in technology. There are homages all over the place, including in Dave Metzger‘s score paying homage to “When You Wish Upon a Star.” After all, this is a studio with a history of making dreams come true! Speaking of the score, the deluxe soundtrack is over two hours in length! According to the production notes, Buck describes Star as a “ball of energy that embodies hope, light, optimism, creativity and imagination—everything that Walt Disney represents to us here at the studio.” After watching the film in mid-November, there’s no disagreement from me. I know I’ve been late in getting my review online but I hope the film finds an audience. We’re living in a world where people are trained to wait for films to arrive on Disney+ and that’s something of  shame. I hope the theatrical run is extended since Bob Iger is back at the helm. But anyway, when people don’t support such films in theaters, studios tend to stop making them. Sure, there were films that were both day-and-date during the pandemic but that was supposed to just be a pandemic thing. Wish offers fine storytelling and it benefits from a theatrical experience. I’m not sure where I would rank it among the 62 feature films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.

"Nov 27, 2023",positive," The story: In the kingdom of Rosas, citizens enjoy carefree lives under the benign rule of their magic-wielding regent King Magnifico (voiced by Chris Pine), but teenager Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose) learns he is not who he claims to be. Her yearning for a better life for her people draws down Star, a being made of light and gifted with magical powers.  Hats off to The Walt Disney Company for being the only studio still making family-friendly films that ask audiences to do more than look at zany creatures or watch sitcoms with drawn characters instead of live actors.  Disney’s animated musicals are in a class of their own. They call on viewers to pay attention to lyrics, drink in gorgeous visuals and follow stories built on the aspirations of idealistic young characters.  Wish ticks all of these boxes. As a work of art, it is an ambitious attempt at summoning the spirit of the Golden Age of animation – the period from 1928 to 1969, when Disney’s Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia (1940) and The Jungle Book (1967) pushed boundaries with every new release. While Wish has a foot in the past, it has the other in the present. Asha is every bit the gutsy modern protagonist. She pines for no man and awaits no rescue, and her courage pushes the story along.  Visually, the 2D hand-drawn look of the past is digitally evoked without slavish reproduction. Look at Asha’s pet goat Valentino (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and 1977’s The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh will spring to mind.  There is a “but” coming, and it is that while Wish includes a range of Golden Age influences, it comes after movies that are also inheritors of that legacy.  Encanto (2021) had songs and magic, and not too long before that was Frozen II (2019), the sequel to the phenomenon that was Frozen (2013).  It would be churlish to criticise Disney for making yet another kid-oriented musical when Wish, Encanto and the Frozen films are of such uniformly high quality.  The superhero work Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023), the Shrek spin-off Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (2022) and Irish independent film Wolfwalkers (2020) not only have all-ages appeal, but also show – in thrilling fashion – that one can hark back to tradition while pointing boldly at the future. Hot take: Released to mark 100 years of animation from The Walt Disney Company, Wish would have been special if not for the wealth of high-quality animation works that have recently been produced. "
"Nov 27, 2023",negative," This one should have been a knockout. In fact, all the pieces are in place for a memorable, magical fairy tale musical. Heck, they’ve even thrown in a talking goat (always welcome), dancing chickens (likewise) and a singing grandfather (prepare the Oscar).  Alas, Disney’s Wish, a handsomely budgeted animation designed to commemorate 100 years of the Mickey Mouse House, is empty inside, a noisy hodgepodge of drippy one-liners and rickety, recycled ideas."
"Nov 27, 2023",neutral,“Wish” is a basic fairy tale that knows its audience and plays to it without guilt.
"Nov 26, 2023",negative," Wish tries to put Disney back on the map — but in the age of Spider-Verse, is there room for the brand’s traditional house style? If you’ve seen any of the animated features in Disney’s sprawling back catalog, then you’ve already seen Wish. The company’s latest is not so much a film as it is a highlight reel of their greatest hits, a Disney expo-turned-Easter egg hunt that rewards even the most casual fan. The instinct to catch every reference does give Wish some sense of purpose. The haze of nostalgia is undoubtedly powerful: Disney has been weaponizing it for the better half of its century-long history. But it’s been a long time since the illusion was totally effective, and that’s a big part of what keeps Wish, occasionally delightful as it may be, from justifying its existence. Despite a game cast and some earnest, pop-infused music numbers, Wish doesn’t really have anything new to say. That wouldn’t be so bad if it existed in a vacuum. Disney’s rested on its laurels before, and has bounced back from far worse. But we’re a long way from the novelty that Steamboat Willie, The Lion King, or even Frozen offered the world. As the magic kingdom grew into a sprawling empire, animation became less of an artistic pursuit and more of an exercise in futility. Disney still strives to keep up with the times — but in the face of so much innovation elsewhere, could something like Wish ever be enough? For what it’s worth, Wish does remix the Disney formula where it counts. Where most of its animated movies are pretty faithful to their respective time periods, Wish follows Disney’s live-action Little Mermaid down a path of anachronism. The kingdom of Rosas is our film’s fairy-tale setting, a melting pot of cultures where people of all creeds live in harmony. Its protagonist is Asha (Ariana DeBose), an adorkable Afro-Latina whose free-flowing box braids stand in cheeky defiance of Wish’s 13th-century setting. What is historical accuracy to a world where animals can talk, anyway? Adding to the offbeat imprecision — albeit behind the scenes — is Chris Pine as the Hispanic-coded King Magnifico, the sovereign ruler of Rosas and sole magic-wielder of the realm. He founded the kingdom on the premise of safe-guarding his people’s wishes… literally. When each citizen of Rosas turns 18, they make a wish and hand it over to the king, who stores it in his castle and reserves the right to grant it at a later date. As long as it’s not too dangerous or too vague, most wishes are fair game. But very few actually meet Magnifico’s requirements — and it’s not until Asha gets close to the sorcerer, in an audition to become his (wink!) apprentice, that she notices the flaws in this system… and starts asking one too many questions about it. No, she does not get the job: Like any authoritarian, Magnifico has a thing about too many questions. But that inspires her to make a powerful wish of her own, one that sends an impossibly cute anthropomorphic star hurtling from the heavens to help her make Rosas a more democratic place. With Wish, Disney finds itself at its most self-reflective. It’s always been a company in conversation with itself — the trends, tropes, and motifs its films once created have become a sort of holy text to be remixed at will — but with other companies in the industry moving on to greener pastures, Disney’s most recent efforts have put it in an echo chamber of its own making. There was a time where Disney’s house style was at least occasionally innovative. At the very least, it was frequently gorgeous to look at — but as the company distanced itself from hand-drawn animation and embraced the convenience of computer graphics, homogeny inevitably set in. Of course, by that time, Disney had long established itself as king of the castle: It’s hard to dissent against the progenitor of so many fond childhood memories, and the standard that so many others have followed. When Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse burst onto the scene, however, that spell was irrevocably broken — and Disney is still trying to catch up. In the five years since Spider-Verse made imperfect, painterly visuals cool, a quiet revolution has taken hold in the industry. It’s no longer enough to coast on a polished, familiar technique, and for what it’s worth, Disney seems to recognize that. Wish runs on an interesting blend of old and new: computer-generated characters play in a 2D, watercolor world. It adds a literal bent to the storybook motif that opens the film, cribbed from classic Disney flicks like Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. But it’s not quite enough to tip Wish into new territory. Wish is, of course, meant to serve as an homage — but at every turn, it conflates that responsibility with rote imitation. So many of its characters feel like regurgitations of past favorites: “Disney face” has been an issue as far back as Tangled, and it rears its head again here, too. Its ideas are occasionally intriguing, especially when it’s willing to confront the part that fear and failure play in our daily lives. But too quickly does it slip into a more traditional (and trite) battle of good against evil, or worse: a winking reference to a far superior Disney film. By the time Wish reaches its Fantasmic-inspired showdown, it’s hard to wonder if it would have functioned better as fan fiction than a celebration of a billion-dollar enterprise. This experiment is not without its merits, and hopefully it’s a sign that Disney is finally willing to take a harder look in the magic mirror. As great as its past triumphs have been, no amount of nostalgia can stand up to the excitement of something new. It’s time for the company to let go of its own fear — only then can it reclaim the innovation that once made it such a juggernaut in the first place."
"Nov 26, 2023",negative," Disney celebrates its centenary with a grimly cynical marketing exercise wrapped in the sparkly cloak of an escapist animated fairytale. Chris Buck’s film unfolds in a utopian kingdom ruled by a sorcerer monarch named Magnifico (Chris Pine). Understanding that hopes and dreams are a potential source of discontent in his populace, Magnifico confiscates the dearest wishes of his people and keeps them safe, very occasionally deigning to grant one. Teenager Asha (Ariana DeBose) realises that stripping the people of their cherished aspirations is not a sound basis for a happy society. She makes her own wish – upon a star, no less – for a fundamental change in the kingdom. It soon becomes clear that, having cannibalised its back catalogue for live-action remakes, Disney has finally got around to making a movie out of its own ident (the animated logo that plays before each Disney production). There are nods in the score to When You Wish Upon a Star, the classic song written for Pinocchio, now as closely associated with Disney as mouse ears. But mostly, the soundtrack is an unhummable mess of warbled exposition."
"Nov 26, 2023",positive," What does that tell you? That they – just as I did – appreciated the themes of celebrating 100 years of Disney and to hold on to your wishes – they might just come true. At the beginning of Disney films, you’ll hear a snippet of “When You Wish Upon a Star,” which was featured in the 1940 “Pinocchio.” It became the first Disney song to win an Oscar. You’ll hear all about wishes and stars again in this story set in the land of Rosas, where King Magnifico (Chris Pine,) a sorcerer, takes each resident’s wish and keeps it in storage. Asha (Ariana DeBose) applies to be an apprentice to the king, who thinks he’s doing his subjects a favor by removing what they long for, because they forget their dreams as soon as they share them with their ruler. Asha has seen the wishes that the king has stored away, and she wants to return them to the people. An adorable little Wishing Star comes down from the heavens to give her some help. The songs are remarkable, with “This is the Thanks I Get?” among the showstoppers. Valentino (Alan Tudyk,), Asha’s cute goat sidekick, always is on hand with comic relief when things get intense. The plot serves as a way to string together references to earlier Disney movies, from “Bambi” (whose title character makes a brief appearance) to “Strange World,” with some of them – constellation-like – sprinkled through the credits. It’s not as memorable or as deep as some of the Disney tales that came before it. But it’s fun, and with its brief running time, might leave you wishing for more.  To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Nov 25, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force – a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe - the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico - to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen."
"Nov 25, 2023",negative,"A lifeless, focus-grouped attempt at throwing back to the classics."
"Nov 25, 2023",positive," It becomes clear during the animated musical ""Wish"" that, although it's a new story, it's also an attempt to collect elements of more than a dozen classic Disney movies in one place: wishing on stars, evil monarchs, adorable woodland creatures that talk, mystical books, ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall"" and even a deer named Bambi. The effect, which marks the company's 100th anniversary, is a cinematic version of one of those DJ Earworm songs that mash up a year's worth of bangers into one song. Ariana DeBose supplies the voice of Asha, a teenager in a land ruled by King Magnifico (Chris Pine), who is known for his ability to grant wishes. Early in the film, Asha realizes the king actually uses that power to keep people docile and that, in fact, he maintains power by stealing his subjects' wishes. So she and a plucky band of friends resolve to reveal his evil plans and give people back their wishes. As callbacks to previous Disney movies such as ""Snow White"" and ""Pinocchio"" pile up, ""Wish"" sometimes feels more like fan service than an original movie. In that same vein, the adorable, non-verbal creature known as Star could not be a more obvious attempt to generate a Minions-like merch cash cow from ""Wish."" It's even yellow. What distinguishes the movie is its look, which combines elements of painterly Disney classics with the computer-generated visual style of more recent hits such as ""Frozen,"" and its sound. The songs, mostly sung by lively ""West Side Story"" Oscar winner DeBose, have energy and style (a couple are in the talk/sing vein of ""Satisfied"" from ""Hamilton""). A crummy tune can stop an animated movie dead but the ""Wish"" numbers give the movie a huge lift while also carrying forward the narrative momentum. You can probably guess how things turn out in ""Wish""; one thing about assembling a new movie from parts of old ones is that it's going to have a hard time surprising us. But that worked — for me, at least — because nostalgia is the point of the movie. It'll be interesting to see what, if anything, happens in the future of this possible DCU. Will we get a movie with Tinkerbell, Asha and Jiminy Cricket joining forces to grant wishes to lucky strangers? Will Hercules, Tramp, Peter Pan and the Beast form a boy band? I am intrigued enough to find out."
"Nov 25, 2023",neutral," Disney turns 100 this year. For its centennial, the studio gifted itself with “Wish,” a film that makes so many references — veiled and blatant — to the Disney brand that it descends into utter shamelessness. This fairy tale feels more like a corporate product than a magical event; it’s a limp dissertation on Disney’s motto that, “When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.” Did some higher-up demand a movie based on that lyric from Jiminy Cricket’s classic “Pinocchio” song? Screenwriters Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore took the most convoluted, confusing path to get there. Playing the instrumental version of the song over the Disney logo for the past few decades apparently wasn’t enough to hammer the sentiment home. “Wish” opens with one of those fancy storybooks, the kind that memorably appeared in films during Disney’s heydey (which, in my opinion, is bookended by 1937′s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and 1967′s “The Jungle Book”). Immediately, this image conjures up gorgeous, hand-drawn masterpieces like 1959’s “Sleeping Beauty.” This old-school throwback soon gives way to the more recent look of Disney films like 2013’s “Frozen.” We’re introduced to the city of Rosas, a place ruled by a benevolent, magical hunk named Magnifico (Chris Pine). It’s not only home to the 17-year old protagonist, Asha (Ariana DeBose), it’s also a tourist attraction. If you’re lucky, you’ll be there on the one day a year Magnifico grants a wish from one of Rosas’s denizens. Though he has magical powers, Magnifico is no genie. People in Rosas give him their fondest wish, which he yanks out of their chest because, as Cinderella once sang, “a dream is a wish your heart makes.” For safe keeping, Magnifico keeps these wishes in floating blue bubbles within his palace. It’s from here he selects the one wish to be granted. Asha hopes that this year, her grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber) will be chosen to have his wish granted. Sabino has just turned 100 years old (like Disney itself). Asha applies for Magnifico’s sorcerer’s apprentice job in order to influence his decision. Things don’t go as planned. But before I get to that, I must tell you what plot detail caused me to write “wait, what the HELL?” in my notebook. When Magnifico removes people’s wish bubbles, they forget they ever made a wish. The rationale is that, without a wish, those people feel much better about their lives. So, there’s an entire city clamoring, for decades, to have a wish granted that they don’t even recall. It makes no sense. We never even discover the details of Sabino’s wish — we only see him playing guitar while surrounded by adoring fans. Is he wishing to be Taylor Swift? Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Magnifico’s nice-guy act is fake. He’s really evil, and he has no intention of granting most of those wishes. He just likes having control over everyone. He even has a big, scary book locked away under glass, one that contains all sorts of bad-magic spells. When Asha confronts him about his devious plans, she earns a powerful enemy. After several Disney films without an actual villain, we finally get an out-and-out baddie. (Don’t believe me? Well, who was the villain in “Frozen?” Or 2021’s “Encanto?” See!) Magnifico looks like a walking thirst trap, and Pine plays him with gusto. He even gets to sing his own villain song, and though he acquits himself nicely, he doesn’t have the impressive vocal talent that DeBose does. That doesn’t matter, either, because the forgettable songs by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice sound like Lin-Manuel Miranda ripoffs. Say what you want about Miranda and the wordplay that drives his critics batty, but the man knows how to craft a song for and about characters. We don’t talk about Magnifico after hearing these numbers. Since everything in “Wish” has to be literal, there’s also the embodiment of that star Jiminy told you to wish on; it looks like the star from “Super Mario Bros.” and the yellow Teletubby had a baby. Of course, it’s named Star and Asha wishes upon it, causing it to fall from the sky and wreak all sorts of cutesy havoc, such as making all the animals in Rosas talk. That development gives Asha the standard-issue talking sidekick, a goat named Valentino (Alan Tudyk). Despite some funny voice work by Tudyk, Valentino is forgettable. Asha’s excellent character design is more memorable than the character itself, though that’s the screenplay’s fault. As in her Oscar-winning turn in “West Side Story,” DeBose does her best and sings her heart out. To keep myself engaged, I pondered this film’s intent and its meaning. Is Magnifico a stand-in for the Disney corporation? I mean, he’s got his own vault filled with items he threatens to keep hidden forever. Is the city of Rosas Disney World? Why does everyone only have one wish? And when will Disney once again be daring enough to kill off its villains the way it disposed of Ursula, Maleficent, and other evildoers? Though the visuals are often quite stunning, you’ll wish that “Wish” had a better story. Not even Magnifico is powerful enough to make you forget."

"Nov 25, 2023",positive,Wish has a very ambitious premise. It's too bad that everything else about it is bland and generic.
"Nov 25, 2023",neutral," I grew up watching Disney animated movies so I have a special fondness for them which have mostly been turned into live-action versions with varying degrees of success. My faves are still the classics I saw as a kid, i.e. Bambi, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc. Wish is the 62nd Disney animated feature and was created as part of its Centennial celebration (October 16 was Walt Disney Company’s 100th anniversary. It’s no surprise that Disney turned to Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the duo behind the behemoth of Frozen which grossed $1.3 Billion. Buck serves as a co-director along with Fawn Veerasunthorn, while Lee co-wrote the script with Allison Moore. The story centers on a 17-year-old girl named Asha (Ariana DeBose) who lives in the Mediterranean island kingdom of Rosas, ruled by King Magnifico (Chris Pine, perfectly cast as a handsome royal whose people actually thirst for) and his wife Queen Amaya (Angelique Cabral). The movie pays homage to classic Disney animated movies right from the start… starting with the epilogue ‘Once Upon a Time’ complete with its antique storybook intro. Asha’s story is decidedly more progressive in that she is no longer pining for a prince or any man for that matter, for her happiness. In fact, she absolutely adores her family, especially her grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber) whose 100th birthday (natch!) coincides with the day of her apprentice job interview with King Magnifico. The story hinges on the relationship between Asha and Magnifico (no, not in that way) as Asha initially looks up to her king and shares a mission to protect the wishes of the people of Rosas. That is until she finds out that Magnifico doesn’t really have the people’s best interest after all. He refuses to grant Asha’s grandfather’s wish, which he deems ‘dangerous’ because it has the potential to inspire others who in turn might turn against him. Aisha is doubly disappointed when she soon finds out about the king’s true colors. I suppose it shouldn’t be a surprise when a king named Magnifico turns out to be a deeply narcissistic and power-hungry man who uses the people’s own wishes as a way to oppress them. Asha later makes a wish upon a star, and suddenly, voila! She ends up with a powerful ally in the form of a cosmic ball of light that drops from the sky. I love the visuals which combine 3D computer technology with the look of Disney’s traditional hand-drawn animation. The forest looks a lot like the one in Sleeping Beauty while the kingdom of Rosas is made out of a diverse population that reflects various cultures. Asha herself has a darker skin tone and black braided hair, while her bestie Dahlia (Jennifer Kumiyama) is of East Asian descent. Kids would likely adore the anthropomorphic look and expressive face of the star, it’s so playfully energetic that it leaves a trail of pixie dust everywhere it goes. The star’s magical power transforms the tranquil forest as the plants and animals come alive. Asha’s hilariously talkative pet goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk) becomes an instant scene stealer. While the movie seems to have the makings for a perfect Centennial celebration, Wish is well, lacking that inherent Disney ‘magic’ if you will. The story aims for greatness and the power of self but is chock full of clichés and tropes that don’t really inspire one’s imagination. Given the reaction of the children in the audience, the movie can clearly still capture their attention, but for the rest of us, we can see right through Disney’s self-congratulatory production and all the blatant tribute to self. I have to admit it’s quite fun to spot the Easter eggs throughout the movie, a wishing well in the forest, a deer named Bambi, Aurora’s dress, etc. Asha’s look seems to be inspired by Pocahontas and obviously, Magnifico’s style and mercurial temperament are modeled after Maleficent who can be charming one minute and terrifying the next. At the same time, having 100+ references to its past work doesn’t exactly translate to a good movie. Ironically, considering that one of the strengths of Disney classics is the music and songs, Wish is sorely lacking in that department. I realize I shouldn’t complain about the plethora of musical numbers given that it’s billed as a musical fantasy, but I wish the songs were at least catchy. No offense to Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice who wrote the lyrics and Dave Metzger who composed the music, but listening to Wish’s bland songs makes me dearly miss Alan Menken and Howard Ashman! It’s really a bummer given both DeBose and Pine have such amazing voices, but the melody of the songs just isn’t memorable. Even its anthem This Wish is meh, I think the only ones I enjoyed are Pine’s defiant rendition of This Is the Thanks I Get?! and the rousing battle cry Knowing What I Know Now with the fun drum beats, but I can’t for the life of me remember any of the songs even an hour after the movie is over. While the creators had a neat idea about how we’re shaped by the dreams we hold dearest in our hearts, overall the movie doesn’t really tug at my heartstrings. I wish this were a more enchanting movie, but no amount of fairy dust on the screen could magically turn a mediocre movie into a magnificent one. I think I’ll wait for this on Disney+ as this has been a pretty bad month for Disney with this and The Marvels (which I really liked) not meeting expectations. Yeah perhaps people just want something more original that’s better executed. Wish seems like an ‘original’ idea because it’s not a sequel/remake but it felt like a manufactured product engineered to celebrate its own past achievements. Film is in my blood.

"Nov 25, 2023",negative," Thanksgiving week tends to be a busy one for movie theaters. Many families have a tradition of going to see a movie during the holiday. But is there anything worth seeing? Here’s arts and culture editor Collin Garbarino. COLLIN GARBARINO: Apple Studios has been burning the tech company’s cash in its pursuit of accolades and awards. Earlier this year, it spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Martin Scorsese’s historical prestige movie Killers of the Flower Moon—a movie which was never destined to make back its budget. This week, another of Apple’s ridiculously expensive historical films from a storied director arrived in theaters: Ridley Scott’s Napoleon. As you might expect, Napoleon tells the story of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the world’s most famous military leaders. You also might expect a certain amount of stylishness from Ridley Scott and his lead actors Joaquin Phoenix and Vannessa Kirby who play Napoleon and his wife Josephine. What you might not expect is how utterly stupid the movie is. This is the kind of movie history buffs get excited for, but director Ridley Scott has a pretty spotty track record when it comes to the genre. His Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood are two of my least favorite movies of all time. If you love history, like I do, then you’ll hate Napoleon. First, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast. He’s too old. The movie begins with the 49-year-old actor playing a 24-year-old Napoleon at the beginning of his career. To make matters worse, in real life, Napoleon’s wife Josephine was six years older than him, but Vannessa Kirby, who actually makes a nice Josephine, is 14 years younger than Phoenix—and she definitely looks it. The average moviegoer will probably find the battle scenes mildly entertaining, but Ridley Scott doesn’t attempt to be historically accurate. He has Napoleon charging out at the head of the army. On impact, cannonballs inexplicably set a mast of a ship on fire. The battle scenes are pure fantasy. The keen-eyed fan of military history will be appalled to see British squares forming up and firing directly at each other. It’s all very stylish, but it’s all a lot of rubbish. Ridley Scott isn’t the filmmaker you go to for nuance, but nuance is just what’s needed when talking about Napoleon. He was complicated. And historians still argue over whether he was an enlightened military genius or merely a brutal tyrant. This movie views everything in Napoleon’s life through the single lens of his relationship with Josephine. He isn’t brilliant, proud, and ambitious. He’s lovesick, jealous, and frustrated—and actually kind of dumb.  I also left Napoleon feeling like Scott was taking a swipe at masculinity itself, attempting to rob one of history’s most consequential men of any distinction. Wish is Disney’s newest animated feature. The young heroine of Wish is Asha, voiced by Ariana Debose. She lives on the island nation of Rosas which is ruled by a benevolent sorcerer named Magnifico, voiced by Chris Pine. Asha hopes to become the sorcerer's apprentice, but she’s horrified when she learns Magnifico is nefarious rather than benevolent, stealing the wishes of his subjects.  Wish takes its inspiration from the idea of “wishing on a star,” which became a central theme in Disney’s marketing. And to be honest, Wish feels less like a movie and more like a marketing campaign to celebrate Disney’s 100 years of animation. The movie follows the classic formula. We get a talking animal sidekick and six original songs. And the movie is also chock full of references and visual imagery derived from earlier Disney movies. For example, Asha has seven loyal friends who mimic Snow White’s seven dwarfs.  Sadly, the homage to Disney’s better years feels wasted because this film is so disappointing. The storyline, what little of it there is, seems to be an afterthought—a mere framework to stuff in all the references. And the songs are mere echoes of the catchy tunes from Disney’s best musicals. One particular song sounds downright blasphemous as the characters sing about how we’re all made out of cosmic stardust and we are our own origin story. So we’re all our own wishing stars. And we’re obligated to never give up on our wishes, which the movie says is the most special part of our hearts. Disney’s really dialed up the devilish “follow your heart” theme to the nth degree with this one. So, it turns out there’s not much to be thankful for this week at the movies. But if you’re looking for a recent historical movie this weekend, you could cue up Jesus Revolution on Netflix. Or if you want a family-pleasing animated movie, you could try The Super Mario Bros. Movie on Peacock. WORLD Radio transcripts are created on a rush deadline. This text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. Accuracy and availability may vary.

"Nov 25, 2023",negative," “A dream is a wish your heart makes,” Cinderella sings. Peter Pan wishes to never grow up; Pinocchio wishes to be a real boy; Ariel wishes to walk above water. For the past 100 years, Disney has invited its audiences to dream alongside the characters in its films. Wishing on stars and making dreams come true have been synonymous with Disney, and embodying that signature theme is Wish. Directed by Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn and written by Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore, the film is a love letter to classic Disney and an ode to the wishing star that has played a prominent role in its history. Since Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket sang, “When You Wish Upon a Star,” the song has become a part of the studio’s identity, playing over its logo since the 1980s. It’s only fitting that, for its centennial, we are presented with the origins of the very star that characters like Geppetto and Tiana once turned to with their heart’s desires. Wish opens like a tale as old as time. With the flipping of a storybook, the film’s lore and backstory are established in a classic and welcomed way. This latest fairytale recalls that of a powerful sorcerer who created a kingdom of protection in exchange for the wishes of his people. The Kingdom of Rosas is like any classic Disney setting: medieval in design with a castle looming overhead. Once a month, the sorcerer and self-crowned king, Magnifico (Chris Pine), grants a wish to one lucky resident. The people of Rosas live waiting for their wishes to come true and for some, like 100-year-old Sabino (Victor Garber), their time is running out. However, Sabino’s granddaughter, Asha (Ariana DeBose), hopes acing her interview to become the King’s apprentice will mean her family’s wishes will finally be granted. King Magnifico has created his kingdom seemingly to protect his people from the dangers of the outside world. His desire to create a haven without pain speaks to Asha’s caring nature, making her feel like the perfect candidate to be his apprentice. Magnifico keeping everyone’s wishes safe sparks hope in Rosas, a future of beautiful possibly. However, Asha learns that he has no intention of granting everyone’s wishes, only those that would benefit him most. As a result, she does something no one thought possible: She wishes upon a star. “So I make this wish / To have something more for us than this,” DeBose sings with powerful emotion. The star, however, doesn’t just continue to shine above. It comes down, shaking the kingdom’s foundation in the process. Taking shape as its own character, Star aides Asha on her quest to return the wishes to the people of Rosas, so they too can feel the magic of a wish granted.  The biggest question one could pose when speaking of Wish is: Does it live up to the expectations of what one would think a film paying homage to Disney should be like? It’s a yes and no answer. It’s definitely the most Disney movie ever. Meaning that it has everything you would expect: talking animals, a good guy turned villain, the theme of loss, a great main tune, and a storybook ending. It’s also littered with easter eggs that harken back to various characters and films in Disney’s catalog, but they’re added in organically so the film doesn’t become just constant call-outs.  It has a perfect voice cast, with DeBose contributing a very classic feel but also signaling the modern evolution of the Disney heroine. Asha has adorable sidekicks in Star and her goat, Valentino, who bring most of the film’s humor in the former’s fun pantomime and the latter’s terrific voice performance by Alan Tudyk. Pine is delightfully nefarious as Magnifico, whose style and vanity mirror the Disney villains of old. The animation style is especially memorable as it paints this story in a combination of traditional watercolor and computer animation, illustrating the evolution of Disney’s animation with every frame. What classic Disney movies need to have, above all, are good songs. Wish is a pretty mixed bag on that front. The film’s main tune, “This Wish,” is excellent. It fits the film’s message perfectly and elicits very uplighting emotion thanks to DeBose’s stunning voice. And while Pine is entertaining in his role as Magnifico, his solo, “This Is The Thanks I Get?!” is terrible. The rest of the songs aren’t very memorable. Luckily, the musical numbers are energetic, with some using influences from other songs like “Colors of the Wind.” In his score, Dave Metzger incorporates notes from “When You Wish Upon a Star,” sparking at least a little bit of that old Disney magic.  Wish reminds its audience what makes classic Disney so special - and that it can’t be replicated. And this is where the film’s pixie dust loses its shimmer. By being a love letter to the studio’s past, the film uses a tried and true formula that at this point is trite. The “why” is obvious of course, but by hanging on to so many influences, Wish struggles to find its own identity. Disney has yet to find the spark that will pull it out of the cycle of trying and failing to replicate what it once had. When Wish ends and the credits roll, you can’t help but reflect on “Once Upon a Dream” when the Disney magic was still there."
"Nov 25, 2023",positive," Synopsis: Wish will follow a young girl named Asha who wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a trouble-making star comes down from the sky to join her. Wish, the new Walt Disney Animation Studios picture, is a warm and winning animated film that acts as an origin story for the studio’s legendary filmography. While incorporating classic Disney themes and clever nostalgia, Chris Buck (Frozen I and II) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (Raya and the Last Dragon) put a fresh spin on classic Disney themes, albeit with a wink at recycled material. The story follows young Asha (Oscar-winner Ariana DeBose), a precocious 17-year-old wise beyond her years. Asha is celebrating her “Sabino’s” (Victor Garber) 100th birthday, as is her mother, Sakina (Natasha Rothwell). She’s young, energetic, and beloved by her community of Rosas. The young woman represents all the hopes and dreams of their family because, simply, they have none of their own. That’s because a sorcerer King Magnifico (Chris Pine), manages everyone’s wishes and is in charge of whose very dreams come true. Luckily for Asha, she is interviewing for a job as his assistant. They immediately hit it off, having a natural rapport. However, Asha sees Sabino’s wish floating in the royal palace. She can’t help but ask the King if he could grant her grandfather’s Wish on his special day. However, Magnifico declines. His explanation? Granting such a wish may be too much for the old man to handle and disrupt the peaceful balance of the community. As Magnifico says, “Imagine a place where wishes come true, where your heart’s desire can become a reality. What if I told you that place was within reach? All you have to do is give your Wish… to me.” It dawns on Asha that the ruler has no intention of giving back the wishes to Rosas, effectively never allowing people’s hopes to shape their futures. Buck and Veerasunthorn’s film, with the help of a clever screenplay from Frozen collaborator Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore (Night Sky), takes off when it begins to act as an origin story for the greedy Mouse’s legendary filmography. For example, after Asha is dismayed by the King’s action, she, yes, wishes “upon a star,” causing a cosmic event seen throughout the kingdom. The result is an adorable ball of energy called “Star” that magically comes to life, shaking the lives of the Rosas community. Star begins to bring objects to life and allows animals to talk, like Asha’s beloved goat, Valentino, voiced by the scene-stealing Alan Tudyk. The animation will be much talked about, with the filmmakers using digital techniques to give Wish a look of hand-drawn images (or storybook drawings) to evoke appreciation from diehard Disney fans. However, while the effort is appreciated, the visuals of Wish have a Saturday morning cartoon look that’s almost jarring initially until the artistry becomes whimsical. In an era of animated choices in the last few years, where studios mix and match styles and take bold chances, Disney has pandered and played it too safe here. However, what Wish does have are some dazzling musical numbers. My favorite is Chris Pine’s thoroughly enjoyable “This is the Thanks I Get,” which is pure Disney magic. And, of course, the gifted DeBose’s show-stopping “This Wish” will surely bring goosebumps to diehards and casual fans alike. “A Wish Worth Making” is a worthy closing number for any Disney animated feature.Wish isn’t a classic by any means, but it has a chance to develop a worthy following. For one, films with lasting legs are always defined by younger generations. And Disney fans will love the nods and origins of the timeless classics, which will bring generations together. Along with what I’m sure will be a massive sale of plush toy “Stars” in the future, Wish is a wonderful holiday treat for the entire family."
"Nov 24, 2023",negative," Wish is set in a magical island kingdom somewhere in the Mediterranean ruled by a magical king named Magnifico (Chris Pine). Everyone who comes to live on the island surrenders their greatest wish to him for “safekeeping,” and a few times a year, he even grants random people their greatest desires. The chance to have their wish granted only attracts more people to the island from all over. Asha (Ariana DeBose) is a 17-year-old girl who seeks to become the king’s apprentice in wish magic. Everything seems to be going great until she realizes. . . he’s not exactly a good guy, holding the wishes of everyone hostage in order to solidify his rule over the kingdom. Desperate to free everyone’s wishes, Asha makes a wish upon a star in the night sky. And a literal star flies down to the island, armed with powerful magic, in order to help her quest. Together with Star and her talking goat, Valentino (Alan Tudyk), Asha hatches a plan to return everyone’s wishes as King Magnifico turns to forbidden sorcery to stop her. All of that sounds like a promising story, but Wish is actually more interested in spending 95 minutes reminding viewers of Disney’s greatest hits. In just half an hour, audiences are peppered with so many callbacks to better Disney films that they’ll be rolling their eyes, feeling assaulted by the intended nostalgia. The House of Mouse absolutely wastes Pine, shackling his charisma and any potential silliness to bland writing. The film sentences him to a backstory with more holes than Swiss cheese, and the gaps in logic don’t end with him. Wish is filled with forgettable songs and unremarkable lyrics that want to seem much grander than they actually are. Its story is tired. Audiences are exhausted by magical kingdoms and the cliches that have made Disney great over the last century. And the one thing Disney should excel at, the art, is such a misfire throughout this picture. Flat backgrounds intended to look like a storybook do not blend well with the 3D characters dancing around. Singing trees in the forest look half-finished, and the characters themselves often seem more like they belong in a Kingdom Hearts game rather than a centennial celebration from Disney. So when Wish fails to inspire audiences with its music, its animation, and its story, what’s left to appreciate? The dozens of callbacks to hit movies that serve as bludgeoning reminders of the past rather than cheeky Easter eggs? Perhaps the film wouldn’t suffer so much if it had instead been relegated to an animated short on Disney+. Expectations would be lower, and the writing could be forgiven for so many holes and unanswered questions. Wish feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. Any number of improvements could have made this a better movie, setting Pine free to be a massively silly villain who hams up the screen, fleshing out the hero and giving her some semblance of a backstory, or even committing to the studio’s past by returning to traditional 2D animation for a change."
"Nov 24, 2023",neutral," Wish feels like Disney didn't start with wanting to tell a story about wishing on a star; it feels like they started wondering how they could organically cram as many ""legacy nods"" to previous films. Wish is a beautifully animated homage to classic Disney, but the film in front of us is weighed down with the baggage that all of the modern Disney movies seem to have. Director: Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn
Summary: Wish will follow a young girl named Asha who wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a trouble-making star comes down from the sky to join her. From the moment that Disney announced Wish on stage at the D23 Expo, it was met with a resounding ""Huh?"" The problem was Disney's elevator pitch for me; this movie was confusing, and the more they tried to lean into that idea, the more confusing it got. The more time went on, the more that this seemed like a Lightyear situation could be right around the corner where audiences might decide to skip the film because they don't understand what it is and Disney pulled back on the legacy aspect of the marketing. At its core, the story of Wish is pretty conventional and also very classic Disney. The studio won't stop trying to pat itself on the back for its own anniversary, and this movie is part of that. However, as the marketing on this film progressed, you were left wondering how much that was part of the actual story. It turns out that the Disney legacy component of the film was more than we needed, and while it was sometimes distracting, it wasn't a dealbreaker. When looking at the idea of Wish, it seemed like Disney went into this with the idea of how many subtle nods to previous movies they could sneak into the film first as a ""yay, we're 100!"" thing and then built the story around it. That's the thing about wishes: they can be as magical as we need them to be, so referencing wishes related to Disney movies can be about as subtle as a 2×4 to the face. There is an entire musical number in the woods where Star makes all of the animals talk, and it seems to exist solely because Disney wanted to try and get as many Disney animal cameos hidden in there as possible. This wouldn't feel so transparent if Disney wasn't selling this film as the bookend for the first 100 years that the studio has been open. The problem with so many of the modern Disney movies is that they often feel like they are one long victory lap for being Disney, and we should be giving them extra kudos simply for being Disney. In the case of Wish, we nearly got the Disney Animation version of ""I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers initiative,"" with how many times they were winking at the camera. At some point, you're not winking anymore; you're just blinking normally, and it's clear that this is the norm for modern Disney, and that's the baggage so many of these films are forced to carry. The various cameos in Wish might be distracting and sometimes take away from the film itself, but the core story is pretty basic, which is in no way a bad thing. King Magnifico is a nice return to form with Disney villains who really don't have a kind bone in his body, and even the kind things he did were done out of self-preservation. His songs are the most fun, and people will likely come out of this film surprised that Chris Pine can sing so well [unless they were one of the three people who watched Into The Woods]. Disney will have a hard time trying to put Asha in the princess line because she is very much not a princess in any capacity, and it is nice to see a Disney movie with a female lead who doesn't have any royal heritage again. Ariana DeBose has a killer voice, and while none of the songs in Wish are bad, they probably don't have a ""Let It Go"" or a ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" in here, either. In contrast to many major films of 2023, Wish could have used some more time to marinate and expand. The whole film felt a bit rushed, and while it might seem on brand to keep things around the 90-minute mark, it made large segments of the film feel like they didn't have any time to breathe. Asha has a whole group of friends with their own stories and personality traits, but there is no time to expand on them. This film could have tacked on some extra time to be an hour and forty-five minutes, and it would have been fine. It also would have given us some more time with the animation. It doesn't always work, and there are moments that it looks a bit wonky, but we'll take a bit wonky when you take an artistic chance than doing the same computer-generated stuff that we've seen since the early 2000s. Wish is not bad, not by a long shot, and there is plenty to like there. Star is adorable. The design is the kind of ingenious work that is the hallmark of a good animator because it is distinct and easy for a kid to replicate in their own coloring book. That is how you create character magic, and they could easily sell a billion plushes of that thing if this movie hits. And while longtime fans will enjoy looking for all the references, you can't build an entire film around that. You need more, and it feels like Disney didn't start with wanting to tell a story about wishing on a star; it feels like they started with wondering how they could organically cram this many ""legacy nods"" to previous films. All of the whimsey in the world can't make up for that cynical feeling."
"Nov 24, 2023",positive,"Wish may not be the grand spectacle for the studio’s 100th anniversary, but it is still an enjoyable and enchanting feature that serves as a throwback to their classic era. "
"Nov 24, 2023",positive," Desde los albores de la humanidad, las historias que consumimos determinan nuestra visión del mundo. Lo que otrora eran mitos, leyendas y cuentos, en la actualidad se han transformado en películas y series que sirven como un espejo que nos brinda insights sobre nuestros procesos personales y colectivos. Partiendo de esta premisa, y sin lugar a dudas, una de las compañías que más ha tenido influencia en múltiples generaciones ha sido Disney. Durante sus 100 años de carrera, este estudio nos ha regalado casi 70 películas animadas que han llenado las salas de cine de magia, personajes entrañables, canciones pegajosas, mundos fantasiosos y dramas arquetípicos que trascienden el tiempo y espacio. A pesar de sus detractores en la actualidad, nadie puede negar que sus largometrajes se transformaron en la piedra angular de la infancia de muchos (acercándonos a temas y planteándonos cuestiones que, tal vez, no tenían cabida en nuestro núcleo familiar o escolar). Buscando capturar la quintaesencia del estudio —y como un homenaje al primer centenar de Disney Animation Studios— llega a nuestras salas Wish, una nueva aventura animada que será la delicia de los más pequeños y que retrotraerá a los adultos a su infancia más tierna.  Como muchos clásicos de Disney, Wish está ambientada en un reino mágico y lejano. Este lugar, llamado Rosas, tiene una peculiaridad: es gobernado por Magnífico (Chris Pine), un hechicero que tiene el poder de hacer realidad los sueños de sus habitantes. Como es de esperarse, todo el pueblo lo adora como una especie de celebridad/deidad y acepta, sin chistar, que él tenga la última palabra en la vida de todos. La historia comienza cuando Asha (Ariana DeBose), una joven habitante de Rosas, va a una entrevista para ser asistente de Magnífico y descubre un terrible secreto relacionado con los sueños que no se cumplen. Esto termina desencadenando un encuentro, aparentemente fortuito, con una estrella que descenderá del cielo para ayudarla a hacer realidad los sueños que Magnífico desea mantener ocultos. Escrita por Jennifer Lee (Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Zootopia, Frozen II) y Allison Moore (Manhunt, Powers, Falling Water) basada en la historia de Chris Buck (Pocahontas, Surf´s Up, Frozen), Wish tiene todos los ingredientes que la hacen una digna exponente de Disney: un reino lejano y lleno de fantasía, elementos mágicos, animales tiernos e inteligentes, canciones pegajosas, personajes excéntricos y una protagonista que se embarca en un viaje de transformación para ayudar a sus seres queridos. Por supuesto, detrás de todo este  Setting aparentemente naive, se esconde una maravillosa reflexión alrededor del poder de los deseos y nuestra posición frente a ellos. ¿Qué sucede cuando olvidamos el motor que mueve nuestra alma?, ¿por qué le cedemos el control a otros de cosas que son enteramente nuestra responsabilidad?, ¿quién tiene la potestad de elegir lo que es bueno o malo para ti?, son algunas de las preguntas que nos haremos en la sala de cine mientras disfrutamos de la aventura de Asha. Interrogantes que todos debemos hacernos, sin importar nuestra edad, y que nos invitan a cuestionar el status quo para tomar acciones al respecto. Siguiendo la estela de los clásicos de Disney, la dirección de Chris Buck (Tarzan, Frozen, Frozen II) y Fawn Veerasunthorn (parte del equipo de animación de Moana, Frozen, The Lorax) toma varios elementos emblemáticos del estudio y los articula en un engranaje visual hipnótico que se mueve a la perfección. Desde números musicales con coreografías al estilo Broadway (con juegos de luces y sombras, utilizando los elementos del set de forma lúdica mientras múltiples personajes entran y salen de cuadro), pasando por secuencias de acción donde el humor físico juega un papel preponderante, hasta escenas conmovedoras donde nos zambullimos en el corazón de nuestra protagonista, Wish es una montaña rusa de emociones que garantiza diversión —y reflexión— de principio a fin. Parte del hechizo que tiene la película se debe al hermoso diseño de producción de Michael Giaimo (Frozen II) que mezcla la animación digital con técnicas analógicas (como fondos pintados con acuarela a mano), texturas kinestésicas e iluminación expresionista que nos hace sentir que estamos viendo un “clásico” con los códigos de animación modernos. Todo esto al ritmo de la banda sonora compuesta por Dave Metzger (The Legend of Tarzan) que trabaja con armonías que nos regresarán a nuestra infancia. Como en toda película animada, el éxito de la técnica va de la mano con los actores que prestan sus voces a los personajes que encarnan. En este apartado, la estrella que se roba el show es Ariana DeBose. Su interpretación como Asha es impecable y marca distancia con varios personajes femeninos de Disney que suelen ser introvertidos y con un verbo suave. Además, nos cautiva con su maravillosa voz en varios temas musicales con un rango vocal excepcional (estoy seguro que This Wish será nominada a mejor canción en los premios de la Academia y su interpretación será de lo mejor de la noche). A su lado tenemos a Chris Pine, quien funge como figura antagónica y que, más allá de su caracterización —mitad rey noble, mitad mago oscuro—, también posee temas donde expresa la dualidad de su personaje (además, seguirle el ritmo en un dueto a Ariana DeBose es algo digno de admirar). De los personajes secundarios, la mención especial se la lleva Alan Tudyk que contrasta con su voz grave la animación del pequeño Valentino (la mascota de Asha) y que se encarga de hacer varios chistes memorables dentro de la historia. Wish celebra el centenar de Disney Animation Studios de la única forma que se podría hacer: con música, magia e invitándonos a soñar. Lejos de quedarnos dormidos en los laureles esperando que un milagro cumpla nuestras metas, la historia es un gran llamado de atención sobre nuestra responsabilidad en la consecución de aquellas cosas que deseamos. En una capa un poco más adulta, Wish nos advierte sobre los peligros del autoritarismo y nuestro rol pasivo en la transferencia de nuestro poder a un supuesto Mesías. Parafraseando a Axel Capriles en su ensayo Poder e inferioridad psicopática: los autócratas y dictadores existen porque se los hemos permitido, dándoles entrada a nuestra parte más vulnerable e ingenua como colectivo, generando una especie de dependencia que se alimenta un vacío anímico donde la conciencia se queda sin actuar. Un tema que, aunque pueda parecer muy maduro, es harto necesario para los tiempos que vivimos (y que ya Disney ha explorado en clásicos como The Lion King) y que, gracias al enfoque que le da Wish, nos invita a salir de la sala de cine llenos de ilusión para retomar el control de nuestras vidas y luchar por lo que queremos. Una lección que todos deberíamos tener presente en nuestro día a día —sin importar nuestra edad—, porque como bien aprendimos en Rosas: no hay un sueño lo suficientemente grande o pequeño que no deba ser perseguido. Lo mejor: su historia contiene la esencia de todas las películas clásicas de Disney (un reino encantado, música, magia, animales parlantes, etc). Su propuesta de animación que mezcla técnicas modernas y antiguas. Sus guiños a otras títulos del universo del estudio. Lo malo: la “vuelta de tuerca” del antagonista de la historia es bastante obvia (y se revela desde el trailer). Aunque todas sus canciones y coreografías son muy buenas, la más potente es This Wish (a diferencia de otros títulos de Disney que tienen 2 o 3 temas memorables).

"Nov 24, 2023",positive," WISH. With the voices of Ariana DeBose, Chris Pine, Alan Tudyk, Angelique Cabral, Victor Garber. Written by Jennifer Lee & Allison Moore. Directed by Chris Buck, Fawn Veerasunthorn. Rated PG for thematic elements and mild action. 92 min. In theaters. Walt Disney Studios is celebrating its 100th anniversary, but it hasn’t had a lot to celebrate of late. The live-action versions of their animated classics – some of which were quite good – are becoming increasingly unwatchable, and Pixar’s recent offerings failed to scale the heights. Thus, it is with great relief that WISH turns out to be the groundbreaking film for which they might have, well, wished. The story sets up the fairytale kingdom of Rosas. It is presided over by the benevolent King Magnifico (voice of Chris Pine), who learned sorcery in order to create a safe haven from the cruelties of the world. When his subjects reach adulthood, they give him their greatest wish, which has two effects. First, they forget what their wish was, and second, they hope that someday Magnifico will use his powers to grant them that wish. Asha (Ariana DeBose) is being considered to become Magnifico’s latest apprentice but blows the opportunity when she asks that her grandfather Sabino (Victor Garber) be granted his wish on his 100th birthday. Magnifico refuses and rejects Asha, showing signs that his actions may be more self-serving than anyone suspects. When Asha then wishes upon a star, the embodiment of that star arrives, creating magical havoc, giving voice to plants and animals, including Asha’s pet goat Valentino (Alan Tudyk). Asha decides to release the wishes – which float in bubbles in Magnifico’s secret lair – back to the people who made them, putting her on a collision course with the king. This fantasy becomes not only a lesson in how power corrupts, but in the importance of wishes (read: personal hopes) to people. By giving up those wishes to Magnifico and leaving them in his control, the people of Rosas may be safe but are living less than their full lives. Magnifico, who created Rosas in response to his own family’s tragic history, becomes the illustration of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions. That’s pretty heavy stuff for a Disney cartoon, and yet it plays out beautifully. “Wish” is also a musical, and some numbers work better than others, but it will take some time to see if there are any breakout hits like “Let It Go” from “Frozen” or “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” from “Encanto.” The key Disney song, of course, is “When You Wish Upon a Star,” from “Pinocchio,” which plays as part of the Disney logo at the beginning, but also following the closing credits. Also, during the closing credits, we get images from many of the Disney animated features from the past, a celebration like the lovely short “Once Upon A Studio,” featuring all these characters and currently running on Disney+.

"Nov 24, 2023",positive," If we were in full-on Scrooge mood we might argue that the film pitched to celebrate 100 years of Disney animation is a worthy successor to the likes of Chicken Little and The Rescuers Down Under. That wouldn’t be quite fair. Wish is a perfectly serviceable effusion of the post-Frozen proto-princess accommodation. Ariana DeBose is in typically fine timbre as the voice of a young woman struggling to shake off fairy-tale tyranny. You already know that she has a moment perched on an elevated area opening her tonsils triumphantly to the sky. Why complain about that repeated trope when Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice’s songs crackle with such irresistible choruses? At All Costs gives DeBose a see-sawing duet with Chris Pine. The percussive Knowing What I Know Now would, if such an unlikely thing came to pass, stop any Broadway translation on a nightly basis. And it’s got a cute talking goat. And a sentient grounded star that, in its simplicity, looks to be gesturing to friendly rivals in Studio Ghibli. What’s not to like? Well, for all the references to golden-era Disney, Wish struggles with similar issues to much recent Mouse House animation. As in Elemental, the film’s apparent allegory fails to land. A storybook opening introduces us to King Magnifico (Pine), a magician who constructs a city that welcomes all those who want to fulfil a personal dream. Is this about the United States? Is Wish The Godfather? Well, maybe. But it gets more complicated. Magnifico captures every dream in a bubble, thus (if I have this right) causing the wisher to disconnect from his wish. Only the few who, at a special ceremony, have their dreams magically satisfied again make contact with those aspirations. I have no idea what this is supposed to be teaching us about the human condition. Initially Magnifico is more of an unsympathetic technocrat than a proper Disney villain, more Herbert Hoover than Richard Nixon, but when DeBose’s Asha pushes back, the familiar green shadows cast themselves across his witchy brow. She wishes upon a star (get it?) and brings just such pointed plasma to earth. And we’re off. The film will do well enough. But its backwards glances serve only to remind us how transcendent Disney animation once was – as recently as Frozen – without offering any hopeful signposts to the future. But, yes, cracking songs."
"Nov 24, 2023",positive," In “Wish,” a new musical-comedy featuring the voices of Chris Pine and Ariana DeBose, Disney celebrates 100 years of animated entertainment with a fairy tale featuring Easter Eggs referencing their classic films. There’s a deer named Bambi, snippets of the Pinocchio theme “When You Wish Upon a Star,” a magic mirror, and many other tributes. “Wish” takes place on the island kingdom of Rosas, a magical place where King Magnifico (Chris Pine) stores the wishes from people all over the world. “Imagine a place where wishes come true,” says Magnifico. “Where your heart’s desire can become a reality. What if I told you that place is within reach? All you have to do is give your wish… to me.” At the age of 18 everyone in Rosas gives the King their deepest desire, which he then seals up in his castle’s observatory. “I grant the wishes I am sure are good for Rosas,” he says. Once a month he announces a winner and grants their dreams come true. When 17-year-old Asha (Oscar winner Ariana DeBose) meets the king to apply for a job as his assistant, she hopes to convince him to grant her 100-year-old grandfather Sabino’s (Victor Garber) wish. When the king refuses, Asha uncovers a terrible secret. Magnifico not only deletes the memories of those who tell him their wants, he hoards the wishes to keep the citizens of Rosas compliant. “King Magnifico has wishes in his castle,” Asha says. “He’ll never give them back. We have to free the wishes and return them to the people.” As they join forces to stop Magnifico, the king manifest all his dark magic powers to stop them. “There is a traitor amongst us,” he bellows. “Find Asha.” “Wish” has all the elements of classic Disney, but falls just short of memorable. The built-in nostalgia should appeal to fans as a centurial celebration, and aficionados will get a kick out of spotting the hidden tributes to the older movies, but the film is stuck in looking in the rearview mirror. It feels old fashioned, a celebration of what came before, from its look, to its storytelling. As pleasant as it is, there’s not much new happening here in its themes of the magic of dreams and power of good to defeat evil. Character wise, its standard stuff, although Valentino (Alan Tudyk), a talking goat with a surprisingly deep voice earns laughs as he announces, “I cannot swim,” like Greek herald Stentor as he dives into the water. Best of all is the Star, a simple character with very expressive face, which is virtually guaranteed to move a bunch of plush toys as Christmas approaches. As a celebration of 100 years of animation, “Wish” isn’t awful, just underwhelming. It feels like a blast from the past, with both eyes on the past, and none on the future.

"Nov 24, 2023",neutral," As a short film that aired before a more thoughtful feature, it would’ve worked. But as a standalone story — even a short one, at just 95 minutes — it’s transparently thin.

"Nov 24, 2023",positive," Unfulfilled potential is a powerful theme for a story. Making Disney’s choice to explore what might happen if an entire kingdom of subjects surrendered their chance to fulfil their destinies by entrusting their deepest wish – and every memory of it – to their king an intriguing premise. Is it better to live with the hope that one day your wish may come true or to hold that dream close to your heart and let it guide your life’s path? We’ll never know. Because, sadly, the House of Mouse’s hundredth-anniversary offering fails to interrogate its own themes, choosing to bimble about looking pretty (it is VERY pretty), ticking off generic highs and lows in the place of real plot points and making knowing nods to animated features past instead. Leaving us to gloomily ponder what might have been. Asha (Ariana DeBose) is a tour guide in her beloved Mediterranean home Rosas. The starry eyed 17 year old loves her family, her loyal group of friends and the beauty that surrounds her. Big of heart and overflowing with imagination, she can’t think of anything more wonderful to mark her grandfather’s (Victor Garber) 100th birthday than witnessing his long-surrendered wish finally coming true. Perhaps her interview for the role of apprentice will help tip the scales in his favour. King Magnifico (Chris Pine) is the keeper of every resident’s wish and the only being in the kingdom who can ever grant them. Together with Queen Amaya (Angelique Cabral) he has established a sanctuary, far removed from the trauma of his past, and he takes pride in safeguarding his subjects. Even from their own desires. His mastery of sorcery makes the monthly wish ceremony a spectacle for all, even if only one wish at a time can come true. But Magnifico’s dark history has begun to blacken his soul and, rather than the hero she expected to impress and serve, Asha is shocked to find a selfish hoarder under the glittering crown. Threatened and insulted by the girl’s innocent request for her grandfather’s wish to be chosen at last, the king lets his mask slip and irrevocably alters Asha’s destiny. Her late father raised her to believe in the power of the stars and that night – as she confides her pain to those glittering lights in the sky – one descends to offer a remarkable reply. After a nostalgic start that throws open a storybook and twirls us back into bygone fairytales, Wish falters and never really finds its dancing feet again and a major culprit behind the stumble is its unforgivably forgettable songs. Following Encanto was always going to be a challenge but, though Dave Metzger’s score is sweet enough, Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice fail to captivate with their jukebox musical numbers. All dissolve from memory like candyfloss in the rain as the credits close. The star that comes to earth to help Asha enlivens the narrative and the soundtrack by enchanting the forest creatures into speech, letting Alan Tudyk unleash his compulsory comedy animal appearance as pet goat Valentino. Yet even Star fails to truly sparkle. Ironically for a feature which has worked so hard to create a whimsical watercolour world and evoke the retro handdrawn aethetic we all love, its magical element looks awfully like a Fisher Price emoji. Somehow in building a world which pays homage to so many films from the studio’s past, Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore’s screenplay fails to create a believable place in which to anchor Wish. Most notably missing is a captivating opening song or meaningful conversation to tell us who Asha is and open up her singular world. It’s hard to care about anyone we meet because we have nothing to connect to. Instead we are given the underwhelming Welcome to Rosas, which…has some jaunty guitars. When shadows overwhelm the king and he gleefully embraces the darkside, Star is the only hope for the fragile wishes under his control. Asha’s fractured friendship group, with one notable exception, reunites to join the fight and determine their own fates at last. They don’t actually have personalities so it feels arbitrary to name them, however, you might enjoy spotting the characteristics they allegedly share with Snow White’s seven dwarfs to pass their screentime. Tonally inconsistent, musically meh and generally lacklustre, Wish isn’t going to ascend to the giddy heights of the classics it references. It is nice enough to look at, gifts us with some fun Chris Pine scenery chewing and leaves on a fairly heartwarming high. Ultimately though, directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn couldn’t extract a narrative with the cojones to gaudily celebrate a hundred years of entertainment in style from their sea of sparkly wishing balls."
"Nov 24, 2023",positive,"Not the animated gem that presumably the studio wished for its 100-years celebration, but a serviceable dose of magical star dust that will surely entertain kids and satisfy Disney super fans. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Nov 24, 2023",positive," “Napoleon,” Ridley Scott’s historical epic about the infamous French emperor, comes up a bit short. Joaquin Phoenix mumbles his way through this visually spectacular, often funny, but dramatically lackluster extravaganza. This Napoleon is a petulant and childish ruler cuckolded by his wife Josephine, played by Vanessa Kirby. His megalomania is strangely missing in this entertaining, but uninspired saga. The latest Disney animated fantasy “Wish,” slavishly follows the template of other Mouse House fairy tales. All of its ideas are all plucked from those other memorable stories. A wizard king holds hostage the wishes of his nation’s people. A young girl wishes on a star to try to free them. It’s tuneful and well animated, but “Wish” only wishes it were as good as previous Disney classics. Oscar-winning filmmaker Emerald Finnell’s pitch black social comedy “Saltburn” is about as pleasant as a bout of nausea. Barry Keoghan is excellent as an Oxford student who worms his way into spending time at a wealthy fellow student’s family estate…but nothing is as it seems. While it’s whip smart and wickedly daring, “Saltburn” is also excessively repellant and depressing. Lil Rel Howery and Ludacris star in the Disney+ comic fantasy, “Dashing Through the Snow.” Ludacris plays a yuletide cynic and Howery plays a chap who may or may not actually be the real Santa. It’s all pretty standard fare, but a likable cast and upbeat spirit make it a genial option for holiday family viewing. Adam Sandler provides the voice of a talking lizard in the Netflix animated comedy, “Leo.” It’s about an elementary school pet who inadvertently changes the lives of the kids in the classroom. “Leo” combines a sweet-natured story with Sandler’s patented juvenile humor. It’s silly, but sincere."
"Nov 23, 2023",positive," According to Disney’s 1950 classic Cinderella, a dream is a wish your heart makes when you’re fast asleep. In the studio’s latest animated extravaganza, Wish, wishes are dreams better left to be protected by a powerful sorcerer and forever forgotten by the person who originally gave them life. Much like this new film’s determined heroine, Asha (voiced by Ariana DeBose), I like that former option better, too. She’s the one who accidentally discovers that the sorcerer in question, the seemingly benevolent ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico (Chris Pine), actually has almost zero intention to grant the wishes he’s extracted from his subjects over the decades. Frankly, he’s afraid of them, a personal tragedy forever coloring how he looks at allowing people to attain their most fervent desires. Instead, he looks at it as a kindness that he’s taken these aspirational longings away from all adults 18 years of age and up, and the fact they’ll never know what they’re now missing keeps Magnifico firm in his belief he’s doing the right thing. Asha disagrees. Now that she’s witnessed the beauty of what the king is keeping all to himself and knowing firsthand how the extracting of wishes has changed many of her friends at their very core, essentially making them a hollow shell of who they were, the teenager becomes determined to do something about this. Singing to the heavens above for a little help, a happy-go-lucky “Wishing Star” comes to her aid, the peppy magical entity descending into Asha’s arms to help free all the wishes from Magnifico’s grasp. I’m a big proponent of judging a motion picture for what it is and not what I wanted — or even think — it should be. Wish makes doing that difficult. In and of itself, the film is perfectly fine. It’s beautifully animated, DeBose and Pine shine, it has a handful of terrific songs, and directors Chris Buck (Frozen) and Fawn Veerasunthorn keep things running at a satisfyingly brisk pace. There are a couple of lovely set pieces, not the least of which is Asha’s interview with Magnifico to become his apprentice, in which the two share a musical moment with the wishes and the former discovers the latter isn’t the leader she thought he was. I was never bored at any point. Yet it is also abundantly clear that Disney’s newest release is designed to help the studio celebrate its centennial anniversary and pay homage to over nine decades of feature-length animated history. There are continual callouts and in-jokes referencing everything from 1937’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to last year’s Strange World to all points in between. It’s a fantastical musical-theater collage of Disney’s greatest (and even its not-so-greatest) hits, and if I were back in college, I’d take bets someone would have come up with a drinking game involving every allusion to a Disney tale during this story’s brief 95-minute running time. This creates an oddly uncomfortable imbalance inside the narrative. Things are simple. They are very straightforward. Little kids are all having a wonderful time. But the filmmakers keep spotlighting similar Disney efforts that took greater risks, ones that didn’t mind offering up complex concepts for younger viewers and their parents to dissect and discuss afterward. Case in point? King Magnifico’s big villain song. It happens right before the sorcerer falls off the deep end and embraces his dark side, and it’s a catchy little number that Pine performs rather splendidly. But its style and its placement directly recall similar moments in films like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin, and even The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and it immediately pales in comparison. The song is toothless, and as such is oddly forgettable. Similar moments just like this one are littered throughout the production. I do love the look of Wish. The animation is some watercolor CG hybrid that gives things a surrealistic aesthetic that’s frequently lovely. There’s also an underlying metacommentary on the “white savior” trope that comes amazingly close to saying something substantive. Close, but not quite, because like almost everything else here, even this element is played so safe, it becomes more frustrating than it is praiseworthy. Even so, if I judge Disney’s latest for what it is and not for what it may have been, I find it very difficult to tell potential viewers to stay away. It’s well made and suitably charming. Best of all, Asha is a divine heroine, and that Wishing Star is a lovable goofball younger kids are going to go nuts over. But it’s immediately obvious Wish has loftier ambitions, ones it refuses to rise to and annoyingly undercuts at every opportunity. The magic spell it casts is minimal at best, lasting about as long as it takes for the end credits to complete their crawl.
