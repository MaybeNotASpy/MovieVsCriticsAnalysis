"Apr 11, 2024",positive," Making a big studio film is always a risk, and intentionally splitting the central narrative across two or more movies amplifies that risk in every possible way. Sometimes it pays off as with the Star Wars franchise’s nearly half-century run, and sometimes it shits the bed — studios spent $400 million making three Divergent films only to cancel the fourth one leaving the whole series without an ending. Dune hit theaters and HBO Max in 2021 with the sequel’s production dependent on its success, and happily, that success came both on the big screen and small. Nearly three years later, that sequel has arrived, and Dune: Part Two is a magnificent follow-up that blows open the action, themes, and relationships of the first in fantastically thrilling ways. Dune ends with the annihilation of the House Atreides empire leaving only Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), alive. The pair are taken in by cautious members of the Fremen as Paul proclaims his intentions to help the people secure freedom from oppression, and the new film picks up mere hours later. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes Paul to be the much prophesied messiah come to save the Fremen people, others suspect he may be a spy, and desert warrior (and frequent guest in Paul’s dreams) Chani (Zendaya) finds her own convictions about the whole thing conflicting with intense romantic feelings. Meanwhile [space wipe!], elsewhere in the universe, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is growing tired of losing very profitable spice harvests to Fremen raids on Arrakis. He dispatches his sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to squash the rebellion and kill the mysterious Muad’Dib (it’s Paul!) leading the charge. Seems like a simple enough clash between good and evil, but what if Paul’s own visions of a Holy War — with him at the helm — takes priority? There’s a lot going on in Dune: Part Two, far more than a review’s plot synopsis can handle, and all of it sings with drama, tension, thrills, and incredibly rich character beats. Director Denis Villeneuve shows once again that science fiction is his home as he builds on the first film’s setup to deliver a true epic. Enormous set-pieces, visually stunning effects, costume design as eclectic as it is mad, and exciting action share the screen with charisma, torrents of emotion (courtesy of a terrific Zendaya), and a shifting darkness worthy of an Empire Strikes Back comparison. Zendaya’s Chani was present in the first film, but she appeared mostly as a silent vision before finally arriving late in the third act, but she’s every bit the heart and soul of Dune: Part Two. You immediately buy into the fierceness with which she fights and stands for her people, and while there’s the tease of YA romance early on she quickly finds her footing as an independent voice leery of Paul’s status as savior to the Fremen. Her love is tangible, but it’s at odds with legitimate concern leading to an emotionally torn performance. Chalamet shines too and hasn’t felt this all-in and tangible since Call Me By Your Name (2017), and Ferguson doubles down as a human monster prone to twisted, heinous, and devious moves in the shadows. Other returning performers including Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, and Bardem all do good work, but newcomers quickly make their mark. Christopher Walken plays the emperor of the known universe, Florence Pugh is his daughter, and Léa Seydoux joins Lady Jessica as another member of the secretive and powerful Bene Gesserit. It’s Butler who steals his every scene, though, as a brutally intense Harkonnen with his own cruel plans for the future. While the bulk of the film’s hefty (but never really felt) running time unfolds on the golden, red sands of Arrakis, Villeneuve wisely shifts our attention elsewhere at times. The script, co-written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, uses that time to introduce new characters and story threads while cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette take the opportunity to cut loose on the visual front. Scenes on the Harkonnen home planet feel almost monochrome in the starkness and their milky, alien-like skin, and it works to maximize the oppressive nature of their rule. It’s tempting to read some connection to today’s very specific, real world conflicts into the film’s depiction of the Fremen and their oppressors, but that would be a mistake. The tragedy and oppression have very real counterparts, but the same could be said of the 80s when David Lynch’s adaptation was released, of the 60s when Herbert’s novels first hit shelves, and nearly any other time in human history. It’s just what we do as a species, every time, all the time, and Herbert’s fiction just added sand worms. All fictions borrow liberally from reality, and to get hung up on correlation is to derail the experience that is Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two. The film can be enjoyed merely as a big, surface-level thrill ride delivering memorable sequences like Paul’s first attempts at riding a giant sand worm and characters worth rooting for or despising. The textures and themes are there, though, for viewers who like their blockbuster entertainment woven through dense world-building, critical commentaries on theocracies, colonization, and the ease with which people succumb to religious delusion. Come for the spectacle, stay for the heart and heroism, the delicious villainy, and the emotionally epic finale. No matter your tastes, Dune: Part Two has you covered."
"Apr 7, 2024",positive," Full disclosure: I am a Dune neophyte. However, I resolved before diving into Denis Villeneuve’s newest release, Dune: Part Two, to finally remedy that. This week, I’ve been basking in Dune through all its cinematic forms. 1984, 2021… there’s so much to see and even more to try and understand. Dune: Part Two hits theaters this week, facing massive expectations. Critics are calling it one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. Does the film live up to the cosmic hype? Or are there “spicy” takes in its future?  Dune: Part Two jumps back into the continuing story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he lands on Arrakis. He resolves to settle in with the local population, rain vengeance down on those who wronged his family… and then there’s that whole thing about being the “Chosen One.” The film features a super-sized, all-star cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Dave Bautista. Denis Villeneuve directs Dune: Part Two from a script he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts. The film comes from Frank Herbert‘s novel.  After what can only be described as a spicy Dune week, kids, yours truly was prepared to come in with some skepticism. How can anything live up to the personality and Lynchian wackiness of Dune 1984? Well, it turns out…. Denis Villeneuve can.  Sometimes, we have to admit when we’re wrong. The proverbial hat must be eaten. The hype is, in fact, real, and at this point, Denis Villeneuve is just showing off. This film is a giant, Hans Zimmer-scored cinematic work of art. The creative team does not put a foot wrong in telling this super-sized and ambitious story. And even more impressive, they not only push but also shove the creative standard forward. Few franchises show the flawless visual mastery on display here. Villeneuve depicts a world that feels real. The graphics and the effects never falter. The characters move freely through the climate, never limited by technology. This world is vivid, beautiful and fully realized in a way we don’t often see.  Meanwhile, the movie pulls together a packed cast of not only seasoned veterans but also some of the industry’s best young talent. There isn’t a bad performance in the bunch. Of course, we’d be shirking our responsibilities if we didn’t give special mention to Timothée Chalamet as Paul. The young actor has been lighting up the screen since his mainstream debut in 2017’s Call Me By Your Name. This time out, however, he’s broken fully from the juvenile roles that have previously been his bread and butter. Chalamet is fully immersed in Paul’s dynamic and complicated intricacies. There’s a heartbreaking emotion here and a power and authority he hasn’t often worked with in previous roles. At the same time, actor and director are fully united in the exploration of Paul’s ambiguity. This is seen most strikingly in the third act. One particular wordless scene shows this in terrifying clarity as Chalamet not only dominates the frame but shows everything he can do with a single look. So much is said without leaning on a single line of dialogue. This silent power is, in truth, a commonality in Dune: Part Two. As a filmmaker, Villeneuve is very much a practitioner of “show, don’t tell.” This script is scant and leans heavily into these vivid worlds or equally striking performances to convey its message. In the wrong hands, this dense, quiet beast of a movie could prove an insurmountable hurdle. The film is pushing two hours and 40 minutes, after all. Yet, while this movie can’t be called “a breeze,” it never feels long, and it never drags. Dune: Part Two is all-consuming.  This is one of those works where seeing this on as big a screen as possible is necessary. Dune: Part Two loudly proclaims this in its marketing. Unfortunately, they’re right. This is a movie made for an IMAX screen. It’s a big, brash IMAX film. When you factor in the Hans Zimmer score? Kids, I could feel my bones vibrating. That’s power.  When all is said and done, this can only be described as an unapologetic rave. This Dune neophyte came into Dune: Part Two and was thrown for a loop in the best possible way. Director Denis Villeneuve jumps into what could easily be a by-the-books franchise sequel and creates a cinematic feast for the senses. Dune fans, sci-fi fans and cinephiles alike should certainly have this one on their lists.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."

Beyond its breathtaking battles and galactic machinations, all soundtracked by a Hans Zimmer score in which the German composer seems to have set all the nobs turned to ‘loudest possible’, what’s most impressive about this seriously-impressive blockbuster sequel takes place beneath the surface. And it’s not the colossal sandworms. No, it’s the subtle character shifts that make Dune: Part Two cerebral as well as cacophonous. The plates are always moving in Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novels: today’s heroes are tomorrow’s pile of corpses. Denis Villeneuve, a writer-director who’s been keen to get his teeth into the tough stuff since his early work like Polytechnique (2009) and Incendies (2010), gets all this. And his screenplay, again co-written with Prometheus’s Jon Spaihts, gives us a hero’s journey with real devil in it. As a sequel, it works for the same reasons that make The Empire Strikes Back so many people’s favourite Star Wars film: there’s a darkness, a bleakness, that makes the fist-pumping moments feel all-the-more earned. There’s a sense, too, that the good guys may not win out. If they’re even good.  It opens with just that stark vision of piled corpses. The vanquished Atreides clan lies smoldering on the inhospitable landscape of Arrakis, while the treacherous Harkonnen, spearheaded by Dave Bautista’s thuggish ‘Beast’, set about harvesting the place for its spice reserves. Only Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides and his mystical Bene Gesserit mum, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, a standout), have escaped the carnage and begun the dangerous business of assimilating with the desert Freman people. On the checklist: guerilla warfare, sandworm wrangling, and something worryingly referred to as ‘holy poison’. Villeneuve’s films can be self-serious, but Javier Bardem punctures the solemnity as Freman leader Stilgar, increasingly Dune’s twinkly answer to Anthony Quinn in Lawrence of Arabia (a key text for the Canadian’s vision – right down to their shared Wadi Rum locations).  The burgeoning romance between Paul and Zendaya’s Freman warrior Chani goes a bit Nicholas Sparks in a mid-movie lull – ‘he was a boy from the other world, she was a girl from the wrong side of the dune’, etc – but those doe-eyed scenes pay off in a final act that upends expectations and gives Zendaya a chance to cut loose.  The Harkonnen foes they engage in thrilling spice harvester ambushes are an even more vicious, visceral presence than in the first film. Stellan Skarsgård’s bloated Baron Harkokken oversees the attempted extermination of the Freman with a ruthlessness that makes his first name, Vladimir, all the more apt. They speak in the language of ethnic cleansing – the Freman are referred to as ‘rats’ – and unleash a new superbad in the Baron’s psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha. Played by Elvis star Austin Butler with the blackened palate of a mamba and sharpened teeth, he’s an unearthly and bloodthirsty creation – a memorable sci-fi baddie. With cinematographer Greig Fraser, Villeneuve captures his violent initiation in desatured monochrome, a stark black and white aesthetic in a movie full of grey areas. Crucially, for all their parallels, Paul and Feyd-Rautha aren’t just two sides of the same coin. Paul’s quest for the soul of the Freman takes Dune: Part Two into some areas that may feel uncomfortably resonant in 2024 – even with all the trippy evangelical mysticism and peyote-like wig-outs. Messianic complexes, populism, violent jihad and ethnic cleansing aren’t the building blocks of your average Hollywood blockbuster. Then again, Villeneuve doesn’t make those.In cinemas worldwide Mar 1.

"Apr 1, 2024",positive," The sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two is rich in multilayered world-building. While its dense story might leave some cold, this is a movie meant for big-screen grandeur, from the detailed costumes to the cinematography, special effects, and score. Set on a desert planet where a hallucinogenic spice sets warring factions against each other, Dune: Part Two is a sight to behold, especially in IMAX. Spice sparkles in the air above waves of sand dunes. Warriors face off in a black-and-white arena while inkblot “fireworks” dot the sky. A domed spaceship lays waste to a sacred tomb in a thunderous volley. Flames spill across a mirrored palace, and a desert people thump a rhythm into the ground, summoning giant sandworms for transportation and battle. Yet for all the filmmaking craft onscreen, your mileage with the story may vary. Fans of Frank Herbert’s Dune novels, first published in 1965, no doubt will enjoy it. Others might have trouble keeping track of who’s against whom or connecting emotionally with the narrative. Those who haven’t seen 2021’s Dune or read the books will find Dune: Part Two much like jumping into the middle seasons of Game of Thrones. That said, what returning director Denis Villeneuve and his team bring to the table is impressive. The 2021 film picked up six Oscars: sound, visual effects, production design, film editing, cinematography, and original score. Here, that artistry again is striking, with Hans Zimmer’s percussive score, Patrice Vermette’s production design, and Jacqueline West’s intricate costumes particular standouts. The script by Villeneuve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts picks up largely where the 2021 film left off—and ends on an ambivalent note, even after two hours and 46 minutes. Thankfully, while the earlier film handled a lot of table setting, this one dives right into the action, unfurling at a brisk pace. After the slaughter of his father and most of their supporters in the previous film, Paul (Timothée Chalamet, Wonka) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Silo), have become embedded with the Fremen, the desert people of the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is the source of Spice, which the Harkonnen family (led on the ground by Dave Bautista, The Boy and the Heron) now mines, having usurped Paul’s late father as governor. “Power over Spice is power over all,” a voice intones before the film even begins, which is about as much backstory as Dune: Part Two allows. The Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem, The Little Mermaid), distrust outsiders and want the Harkonnens gone. They’ve taken in Paul and Jessica because Paul exhibits signs of being the prophesied leader for whom they’ve waited centuries—a position that Paul initially finds uncomfortable. Much of the dramatic tension comes from Paul wanting to avenge his father’s death but being reluctant to take on the “chosen one” mantle. Chalamet plays Paul with a believable sincerity, happy to fight alongside the Fremen and telling Jessica, “They deserve to be led by one of their own. … It’s not a prophecy. It’s a story you keep telling.” As Jessica, Ferguson is formidable, her clipped tone and intense bearing more intimidating than the tattoos that adorn her face once she becomes the Fremen’s Reverend Mother, or religious leader. As other women in her religious order, the Bene Gesserit, plot to create another heir, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh, Oppenheimer) discuss how to quash the Fremen uprising. Meanwhile, the pregnant Jessica speaks with her developing fetus who, in an otherworldly touch, responds in voiceover. Paul’s initial earnestness and scrappiness as a guerilla fighter against the Harkonnens wins him the admiration of the Fremen and the love of Chani (Zendaya, Euphoria). The two create a playful spark in early scenes, such as when Chani coaches Paul how to walk across the sand without causing tremors that summon sandworms. He contradicts her based on what he’s read, then realizes he’s mansplaining to a native and apologizes. The tug-of-war over whether he’ll embrace his fate and just what that might be gives Dune: Part Two substance, even if Paul’s decision ultimately feels abrupt. Among the other players in the all-star cast, Austin Butler (Elvis) is all forehead and no eyebrows as the sociopathic Feyd-Rautha, a Harkonnen set up as a foil for Paul. Bardem earns several laughs with his sly delivery, such as when Stilgar notes that Paul’s humility is exactly what the foretold prophet would have. The Fremen, though coded as Middle Eastern and North African, still have few MENA actors in prominent roles, although Souheila Yacoub (Making Of) is a welcome and feisty addition as Chani’s friend Shishakli. Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better."
"Mar 29, 2024",positive," Fritz Lang, George Lucas, Ridley Scott; the lineage of great sci-fi directors is extensive, but Dune: Part Two serves as an incredibly strong case to make the claim that Villeneuve is the greatest of all time. Maximalist in every conceivable way, the Canadian’s latest offering is an absolute masterclass not only in space operas, but also science fiction filmmaking itself. 2021’s Dune: Part One set a rather high bar for itself, but Part Two sent it into the stratosphere, far above Arrakis. Immediately picking up from the events of its predecessor, Part Two has Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the ranks of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), members of the Fremen, desert-dwelling Arrakis natives. Survivors of the devastating attack upon House Atreides by the brutish Harkonnens, Paul and Jessica are now exiles, largely believed to be dead. Having overcome a Harkonnen attack en route to the Fremen settlement of Sietch Tabr, mother and son are met with a mixture of suspicion and welcoming; some believe them to be spies, and others believe they are the fulfilment of a prophecy to free Arrakis and to start a holy war. Their individual paths become clear: Paul is to embrace the Fremen ways and lead them, and Jessica is to succeed the Fremen’s dying Reverend Mother. It’s here that the (particularly Islamic) influence of prophetic religion upon Herbert’s writing begins to take centre stage, though is still partially diluted from its source material. Stilgar, a native of the fundamentalist South, rapidly becomes staunch in his belief that Paul is the Lisan al Gaib, the messianic figure as prophesied to his people. Representing the more sceptical Fremen is Chani, a native of the North, who joins others in not believing the prophecy. With Jessica having consumed the Water of Life, she has inherited not only the mantle of Reverend Mother, but also the memories of all her predecessors – as she points out to Paul, this traumatic ascension includes inheriting all of their tears, pain, and suffering. Undoubtedly anticipating the discourse that has since grown concerning cultural appropriation, Villeneuve delicately but directly tackles this through Paul and Jessica’s self-insertion into Fremen culture. Jessica’s manipulation of the fundamentalists through the implanted prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib is as skilful as it is sinister, as is Paul’s militant ascent. The Bene Gesserit’s presentation as a more outwardly nefarious entity –“we don’t hope, we plan”– provides genuine chills, particularly helped along by Charlotte Rampling’s marvellous performance as the stony-faced Reverend Mother Mohiam. The display of religious fanaticism is critiqued in such a way that it isn’t parodied for the sake of belittlement, but rather approached as a product of external exploitation. Totally unforgettable are the performances of Austin Butler and Stellan Skarsgård, their chemistry creating an utterly repulsive combination that is as sickening as it is menacing. Though he has relatively little screenplay, Butler elevates the movie to a new level, his presence as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha shockingly enchanting, dominating every scene in which he appears. It seems uncontroversial to say that Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is one of the greatest villains in recent memory. With recent critical failures from the MCU having cost upwards of $250 million whilst feeling like they cost a fraction of that (a result not of untalented VFX artists, but of unsustainable and punishing working conditions and turnarounds), it makes Dune: Part Two’s budget of $190 million all the more remarkable. In every sense of the phrase, Dune: Part Two is a visual marvel and a testament to it being a true labour of love by all who worked on it. Shot entirely in IMAX, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. The seemingly endless Jordanian desert truly brings Arrakis to life, the sweeping sands looking positively vibrant and magically never appearing monochromatic. With Oscar-winning cinematographer powerhouse Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty, The Batman, The Creator) by his side, Villeneuve –a deeply visual filmmaker in all respects– has managed to create one of the most gorgeous films of the science fiction canon itself. With few novels having gained such a devoted fanbase or having sold nearly as many copies as Herbert’s 1965 original, nitpicky comparisons to the source material have always been inevitable, as was the case with Part One. And as testament to the sheer quality of Part Two, few complaints have been voiced from even the most protective of fans. It’s quite fair to say that the Dune universe is one of the most difficult to adapt into any medium, as has been demonstrated with previous entertaining but ultimately unsuccessful attempts – and yet it’s been adapted, and adapted well – complexities, nuances, and all. Though some minor changes were made, with the absence of Thufir Hawat being the most notable, they don’t detract from the quality as an adaptation or as a sequel in itself; at risk of incurring the wrath of my fellow book fans, I’d like to suggest that many of the minor changes improve upon the source material itself. Zendaya, for example, is refreshingly animated as Chani, a pleasant development from her stoic appearance at the climax of Part One, and of her literary counterpart. As was the case with Part One, the pacing of Part Two is noticeably uneven, making it feel slightly top-heavy, though not to its overall detriment. For much of its 167-minute runtime, the action builds itself up slowly but surely, teasingly incremental in its climb – but in its final act, Paul’s story hurtles its way towards a thunderous, earth-shattering climax. And then, at its crescendo, we finish. A coital rhythm, as its original visionary intended, deliberately uneven, but always growing. And the payoff is worth it. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Mar 29, 2024",positive,A must watch! [Full review in Spanish]
"Mar 27, 2024",positive," If you strolled into Haslam’s Book Store on Central Avenue in St. Petersburg in 1965, among the new arrivals you might find on the shelves were Kurt Vonnegut’s “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,” Rex Stout’s “The Doorbell Rang,” Irving Stone’s “Those Who Love,” John le Carré’s “The Looking-Glass War,” and Ian Fleming’s “The Man with the Golden Gun,” the 12th and final novel in the author’s James Bond series. If you directed your attention to the science fiction section of the store, you might also find some new offerings, such as John Brunner’s “The Martian Sphinx,” Kenneth Bulmer’s “Land Beyond the Map,” Philip K. Dick’s “The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,” Avram Davidson’s “Masters of the Maze,” Andre Norton’s “Quest Crosstime,” and, of course, Frank Herbert’s epic science fiction novel “Dune.” The true first edition of “Dune,” published by Chilton Books, can fetch a pretty penny these days. A first edition, first printing copy signed and inscribed by the author sold for more than $22,000 in a recent auction. With the arrival of “Dune: Part Two” in theaters, I would expect to see some collectors with deep pockets drive that figure even higher in the coming months. Even before the Chilton Books edition, the tale had appeared in Analog magazine, divided into two separate serials. The serials — presented as “Dune World” and “Prophet of Dune” — were published in the magazine beginning in 1963. The author would go on to pen five sequels, including “Dune Messiah,” “Children of Dune,” “God Emperor of Dune,” “Heretics of Dune,” and “Chapterhouse: Dune.” Sounds like an expansive body of work for someone seeking to forge a new cinematic universe, doesn’t it? But wait — there’s more. After Frank Herbert’s death, his son Brian Herbert partnered with science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to continue the series. Since 1999, they have written more than a dozen additional novels, including both prequels and sequels to the original books. In “Dune: Part Two,” director Denis Villeneuve continues his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s work. The film is exquisitely beautiful and immersive, breathtaking in scope, and fearless in delivering stunning action sequences that are so vivid they practically erupt from the screen. Unlike the first installment, this time Villeneuve isn’t saddled by the need to provide history lessons explaining the Corrino Imperium and the Landsraad, or focus energy on world-building and chunky exposition. The director is free to plunge headlong into the meat of the story, boldly tackling themes of corrupt power, ambiguous morality, and the use of religion to control the course of society and manipulate the masses. “Dune: Part Two” follows the mythic journey of Paul “Muad'Dib” Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he finds sanctuary with the Fremen who inhabit the desert planet Arrakis. Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have secretly survived the fall of House Atreides. Once they have been embraced by the Fremen, Paul seeks revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. In doing so, he will help liberate the Fremen — some of whom consider him to be the Lisan al Gaib, a Fremen term for off-world messiah. Initially, Paul rejects the idea of being a savior and insists that he does not seek power. Paul sees the occupying Harkonnen forces — led by Rabban (Dave Bautista) — as their shared enemy, and wishes only to fight alongside the Fremen. Because he plays down any ideas of being the messiah, he gains the trust of Chani (Zendaya), young and independent Fremen warrior who gradually falls in love with Paul. Eventually, Paul must choose between his relationship with Chani and redirecting the fate of the known universe, haunted by an apocalyptic future only he can foresee. “Dune: Part Two” also features Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Christopher Walken as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, and Charlotte Rampling as Gaius Helen Mohiam. For “Dune: Part Two,” the director wisely makes a few important changes to the original novel, eliminating some characters, downplaying others, and significantly condensing the timeline. The modifications are necessary: Cinematic adaptations of literary works require perceptive abridgement that does not compromise fidelity to the source material. The film successfully captures — and in some regards enhances — all the principal themes found in Herbert’s original work. Villeneuve imbues the film with anti-imperialist imagery, showing how colonizers plunder Arrakis for their own benefit while treating the indigenous population with contempt and brutality.  Villeneuve also attempts to rectify one aspect of Herbert’s novel by eliminating — or at least minimizing — the “white savior” trope many critics claim is integral in the source material. The focus on Paul’s reluctance to claim the power his followers desperately want to bestow upon him is a crucial element of how the audience perceives the character. Chalamet effectively displays the character’s gravitas and deep inner turmoil to the screen. Paul exhibits his disgust at Lady Jessica’s hidden agenda, and at the way the Bene Gesserit have directed and controlled bloodlines to maintain power.  In a sense, Chani is on her own mythic journey. Villeneuve’s adaptation gives Chani agency, setting her up as a clear juxtaposition to the fundamentalists’ fanatical belief in Paul as a messianic figure. Equally important is the fact that in “Dune: Part Two,” Paul could not have emerged as a leader without the support of both Chani and Stilgar. “At the beginning, Chani is suspicious but also curious about this boy coming from another world,” Villeneuve explains in the film’s production notes. “Something that deeply touches Chani is that Paul is sincere; she feels that Paul wants to learn about the Fremen ways.” Chani, like other young Fremen, doesn’t believe in the Bene Gesserit religious propaganda. She believes that the Fremen should be freed by Fremen, not wait for the arrival of some prophesied messiah.  “She thinks that those old beliefs are a way to control her people,” Villeneuve adds. “But she sees that Paul doesn’t want to act as a colonizer, he doesn’t want to impose his ways, he doesn’t want to be seen as a savior.” Whether or not Villeneuve’s revisions to the source material go far enough to expunge any controversial motifs should be left to the individual viewer to decide. The intent is certainly evident.  “Dune: Part Two” exceeds expectations. With repeated viewings, it may prove to be the cinematic masterpiece many have already claimed it is. Boasting remarkably rich and nuanced storytelling, captivating political and religious conspiracies, a brilliant score by composer Hans Zimmer, and passionate performances from a superlative cast, the film is a sweeping operatic science fiction spectacle.

"Mar 26, 2024",positive,"Dune Part Two is bigger in almost every way. The visual effects, sound design, and production as a whole is immaculate. Narratively, it does feel a bit too unresolved by the end for my taste but hopefully Dune: Messiah comes sooner rather than later."
"Mar 24, 2024",positive," Denis Villenueve’s  mythic sci-fi sequel “Dune: Part Two” has already grossed $500 million globally, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 – domestic and worldwide – surpassing the first film, released back in 2021. Based on Frank Herbert’s anti-imperial, ecologically dystopian “Dune” saga, it revolves around Paul (Timothee Chalamet), heir to the House of Atreides, wiped out in Part One under the fascist aegis of grotesque, genocidal Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). As with any franchise, seeing the first installment is vital to understanding the second. In the year 10191, Paul is hiding out on the vast desert planet Arrakis, where he joins forces with the rebellious, indigenous Fremen, earning the respect of their wry religious elder Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and forming an attachment to feisty Chani (Zendaya) as they defiantly wage guerilla warfare against House Harkonnen. Meanwhile, his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) with her “pre-born fetus,” gulps down the Water of Life, a clear blue liquid that looks like mouthwash that elevates her to exalted status of Reverend Mother within the Fremen’s secretive matriarchal religious group Bene Gesserit. At the center of the conflict is a rare commodity called “spice mélange,” an addictive drug known for its powerful psychotropic powers and prescience (an ability to see into the past, present & future). In smell and taste, it’s like cinnamon. (Because of their constant spice exposure, all Fremen have radiant blue eyes.) New characters include the evil Emperor (Christopher Walken), his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), pugnacious Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) and Lady Margot (Lea Seydoux), pregnant with Feyd-Rautha’s child. Among the most memorable sequences are when Chani teaches Paul how to sandwalk, adroitly avoiding rhythmic patterns in the arid, terra-cotta colored desert that would alert sandworms, when Paul is reunited with Atreides weapon master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and when Paul and the Fremen mount those giant sandworms for a climactic battle…concluding with “The war has just begun.” Written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts with an emphasis on action – as opposed to exposition and character-development – this shallow, self-important sequel runs 2 hours, 46 minutes, dominated by Grieg Fraser’s spectacular cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s propulsive score. On the Granger Gauge of 1 to 10, “Dune: Part Two” is a visually stunning yet sterile 6 – teasing an inevitable Part Three in years to come."
"Mar 24, 2024",positive,"If you are watching “Dune: Part Two” with the right mindset, i.e. from Chani’s point of view, you should be watching the film with growing dread and concerned about Paul, not cheering how everything is coming together. "

"Mar 20, 2024",positive," otta know what happens this very second” finish, allowing time to take it all in and practice patience before Dune 3 comes along. So, as I wrote before, I personally expect to continue demonstrating that required patience.  After all, I qualify as a fan since I once named a blue-eyed calico cat Alia after a Dune character who I hope to meet more thoroughly in the next installment."
"Mar 18, 2024",positive," Once in a while, a sweeping saga masterpiece comes along, such as 1977’s “Star Wars,” retroactively retitled “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” by George Lucas or Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings trilogy” 2001-2003 or James Cameron’s (2009) “Avatar”— “Dune: Part Two” is most definitely in the same league. It not only continues the brilliance of the first film it sets a new bar for just how good sci-fi films should be. With an engaging story and a cast at their very best, along with stunning visuals, this is a masterpiece. As with the Oscar-winning first installment, Villeneuve shows visual mastery of scale and scope, along with impressive cinematography. Viewing the film in an IMAX theater with Dolby sound brought back memories of the prior films listed above. As a result, I recommend seeing it on the most giant screen possible. Based on Frank Herbert’s idolized sci-fi novel, some have said the movie could never be made due to the book’s complexities and the visual science fiction effects. I’m here to tell you it’s been done as director Dennis Villeneuve has succeeded in a colossal way. Part two follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) very closely after the first one ends, as he unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, who are not free men. He’s also on a path of revenge against those who destroyed his family, with the help of a Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who is convinced that Paul is the chosen one. Stilgar believes the mythology points to Paul as the savior, the Emo King. Paul tries to blend with the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani. He passes several tests given by the Fremen. He takes the tribal name of Muad’Dib, vowing vengeance against the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis and revenge for his father’s death. During the combat scenes, watching bodies fall from the sky as colossal ships burst into flames appears virtually like an opera when looking at a film’s style. As Rabban Harkonnen, Dave Bautista is a wartime leader whose situation has exceeded his abilities, while Stellan Skarsgard has shades of Jabba the Hutt. I also enjoyed Bautista’s performance as he dug deep into the role, and it is eerily believable. You’ll feel immersion into vast worlds of endless sand that are only traveled with precise movements. Also, in a parallel scene, on another planet, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, a Princess, Irulan (Florence Pugh), speak with Bene Gesserit’s Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) about the state of affairs. Irluan provides voice-over or narration to keep audiences up to speed on what is happening. You may be wondering about Austin Butler’s psycho-path role as Feyd-Rautha, the evil villain and the star of the movie’s most haunting set, the Harkonnen’s home planet of Giedi Prime, shown in nearly all black and white with infrared imagery. There’s a Gladiator-style stadium that serves as an arena for maintaining his champion status as a butcherer of drugged-up prisoners. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the ultra-evil humongous blob, tests his worth by sending former Atreides soldiers to fight. Again, all of Butler’s scenes are filmed in black and white, delivering the feeling of everlasting doom and horror. He’s the sociopathic nephew of the Baron, who gives a realistic, organic performance. I enjoyed seeing all of the famous stars in the film; Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, and Florence Pugh are all fantastic in their roles. Ultimately, Chalamet is the most transformed, taking on his new role of a leader with some surprises along the way. He rises to the occasion, speaking with astute confidence and determination; his transformation and stellar acting are exciting to view as Paul chooses between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe as he attempts to prevent a horrific future that only he can foresee. On a side note, I was invited to a Zoom Press conference with director Denis Villeneuve, and found it very insightful. Especially when he was asked about the epic scope of the film yet keeping the emotional heartbeat. He replied: It’s everything epic and the action, and that is not something that is that difficult to do. The thing that is difficult to do is to make sure that we don’t lose focus on the intimate relationship more precisely, the story between Paul and Chani. That’s the heartbeat, it’s like their relationship will unfold all drama of the film. Through the eyes of Chani and Paul, we feel the political pressure, the cultural pressure, the oppression. I really constructed the movie focused on the tension between them. I knew that and I kept saying to my crew, “If we don’t believe in their relationship, we don’t have a movie.” And that was my main focus during the whole shoot, to take care and to be as close to them as possible. If you haven’t seen “Dune: Part One”, I’d suggest watching that first, as most of the characters are set up, especially Paul and his family’s transition. You will be blown away by “Dune: Part 2”, as it reminds you that a broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair. You may also have flashbacks to other masterpiece-epic films of the past."
"Mar 18, 2024",positive," Director-writer Denis Villeneuve, along with his cast and crew, had a lot to live up to with Dune: Part Two. The first installment of Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel was a rousing critical and financial success, massive in every sense of the word: an IMAX-sized spectacle about destiny and faith charting political machinations across galaxies. And even with a riveting coming-of-age arc and thrilling set pieces, Dune: Part One merely set up this pivotal sequel.  Surprising nobody, this is a technical masterpiece. When viewed in IMAX’s taller aspect ratio, the visuals are simply gorgeous, showing off the beauty and enormity of this severe yet beautiful universe. With monochromatic sequences set on the Harkonnen’s home planet especially standing out, cinema hasn’t felt this epic since the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Expertly staged set-pieces and battles offer genuine thrills and rich, fascinating worldbuilding. Yet Dune: Part Two drops the ball in other areas, its lack of introspection leaving many viewers cold. Picking up immediately after its predecessor, House Atreides is no more, after the Harkonnen’s massacre on Arrakis, and Paul (Timothée Chalamet) heads deeper into the desert with the Fremen to learn their ways. Staying faithful to Herbert’s book, this isn’t your typical good versus evil story but a stark warning on how faith can be weaponised by colonists. It’s fairly obvious from the start how the narrative will play out but that seems to be by design. Paul’s dark ascension to becoming a prophesied leader unfolds like a car crash in slow motion, impossible to take your eyes away from.  Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) once again plays a key role in Paul’s development, and her arc is fascinating to watch. She too heads down a dark path, as Jessica becomes an influential religious figure and convinces the fundamentalists among the nomadic group of Fremen that her son is the Lisan-al-Gaib—a messiah who will lead the people to freedom and paradise. Although her goal is to aid Paul in his journey, Jessica’s cunning plans to change the Fremens’ perceptions and force a prophecy into existence make for compelling storylines, particularly with Ferguson’s delightfully unnerving performance. It’s a shame then, that most of Jessica’s work takes place off screen.  The most memorable character in the film, however, is Chani (Zendaya). Unlike in Part One, she finds substantial screen time that drives the narrative. Even when she solely acts as Paul’s love interest at the start, Chani undergoes a satisfying arc, serving as a counterpoint to the film’s examination of messianic worship. She regularly questions the idea of fate as well as Paul’s motives, all while proving herself to be a capable fighter and survivor. New women introduced to the cast include Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Lady Margot (Léa Seydoux). The intelligent Princess Irulan plays political games as the Emperor’s daughter, but she doesn’t have much screen time and only discusses matters involving Paul. Similarly, Lady Margot is a devious sister of the Bene Gesserit, a women-only group who control the direction of humanity from the shadows. But Lady Margot’s limited scenes are spent tricking a man into impregnating her for the sisterhood’s breeding programme.  The Bene Gesserit are such an intriguing part of Dune’s lore, and in Dune: Part Two the different members do share scenes that highlight how their own creations and plans have backfired, with disastrous results. Ultimately, though, this is Paul’s story, and the film sidelines the powerful—and far more interesting—sisterhood. Whilst it’s nice to finally have a bigger focus on the Fremen after only supporting parts in the first film, it still doesn’t change the questionable choices made with casting. Zendaya and Javier Bardem, a multiracial American and a Spanish actor, respectively, still occupy the roles of people that are clearly coded as Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), or West Asia and North African (WANA). For example, the Fremen’s language employs Arabic phrases such as “Lisan-al-Gaib” and “Maud’Dib,” making it clear where inspiration lies. Yet MENA actors are simply used to fill the background. We finally see more of the Fremen’s culture—their community spaces and rites of passage—but not enough to truly get an understanding of their people outside of aspects that are tied to the immediate story. This surface-level exploration, along with the fact the director and writers are all white men, lead to an Orientalist interpretation, handwaved as “science fiction” while clearly telegraphing MENA cultures and people.  In fact, Dune: Part Two’s exploration of the “White Savior” had its detractors, with some saying Villeneuve glorifies the concept. Yes, Paul, a white man, is taking on the mantle of the Fremen’s messiah and yes, his mother Jessica appropriates their clothing and culture. But this is all part of the original book’s critique of white saviorism. Where Villeneuve and his writers fail isn’t in their portrayals of this key concept—it’s by underwriting the Fremen. Here they are desert-dwellers with capable fighters, ululating women, and strong believers in destined leaders—and nothing more.  Also worth noting is how all of the key new characters are white. Dune: Part One had a somewhat diverse cast, particularly within House Atreides. But with Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho and Chang Chen’s Dr. Yueh being killed off, this sequel feels white-washed. From Bene Gesserit sisters to Harkonnens, to the Emperor's family, the expanded roster of characters could have been more inclusive. Instead, the film squanders this easy opportunity.  Dune: Part Two improves upon its predecessor, thanks to a bigger focus on the Fremen, but the representation is still watered down. Furthermore, shallow writing and choppy editing issues prevent this from being a modern classic. If Villeneuve and company finally give MENA actors, and the Fremen culture, the spotlight in the inevitable third film, then it’ll surely stand as the masterful adaptation they’re striving for."
"Mar 17, 2024",positive," The critically-acclaimed science fiction epic returned with Dune: Part Two on March 1. Director Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune was met with critical acclaim in 2021, taking home six of its 10 Oscar nominations. Dune: Part Two is already speculated to shake up the Academy Awards again, after nearly doubling the first film’s box office numbers. Part Two collected $81.5 million during its opening weekend, while Part One opened to $41 million, the Associated Press reported March 4, becoming the first major-earner of 2024 and a personal record breaker for its director. Villeneuve’s Dune is the third screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel of the same name, following David Lynch’s 1984 film and John Harrison’s 2000 miniseries. Timothée Chalamet reprises his role as the messianic Paul Atreides, who reunites with Chani and the Fremen people of desert planet Arrakis to wage war against the opposing House Harkonnen. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem all return as their characters in Part One. They’re joined by Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, plus a nearly-unrecognizable Austin Butler and a surprise cameo from Anya Taylor-Joy. The film was greenlit by Warner Bros. and Legendary in October 2021 after Part One’s success, with filming taking place between July and December 2022. Originally scheduled for release on Nov. 3, 2023, it was pushed back to March 15, 2024 due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and later moved up two weeks to March 1. “We worked very hard to be ready for that (original) date but we very much felt that, especially with this incredible cast, that it was worth waiting for,” Mary Parent — a producer on both films and chairman of worldwide production at Legendary — told AP.  Vocalo resident film critic Reggie “The Reel Critic” Ponder called the film “a heroic tale worthy of the big-screen experience,” pointing out that, while Chalamet commands the screen, the actors surrounding him truly make the film stand out. “Dune: Part Two will engross you in its beauty and complexity, yet it might confuse you at the same time,” Ponder said. “If you didn’t quite like Part One, you will like this — and if you liked Part One, you will love Part Two.”"
"Mar 15, 2024",negative," Denis Villeneuve’s return to Arrakis promises much, but in some ways, it must. As spectacular as 2021’s DUNE was, it essentially stopped mid-story in the hope of the filmmaker’s paymasters extending the canvas. DUNE: PART TWO improves on its predecessor in some crucial ways, but the reliance on spectacle leaves gaps in the storytelling and a frustratingly ephemeral interest in the most interesting ideas the film brings forward. The film picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous instalment, with the family and great house of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) slaughtered on our last visit to the desert planet Arrakis. He finds himself ascending to messianic status amongst the native Fremen people (a seed planted by his mother’s religious cult, the Bene Gesserit) and seeking revenge for his family’s massacre at the behest of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), backed by the Emperor (Christopher Walken). Paul’s developing relationship with Chani (Zendaya) – sceptical of the prophecy of a saviour, Lisan Al-Gaib, which Paul seemingly embodies – provides a counterweight to the meddling of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). As Paul battles with whether to seize the power he could as a religious figurehead, a new foe comes to the fore in Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), a ruthless and psychotic replacement as the coordinator of the Harkonnen campaign on Arrakis. The scope of DUNE: PART TWO is sweeping in both visual and thematic terms, and if the above summary seems abrupt to those familiar with Frank Herbert’s books, it is because it would be easy to get lost in the mythology of even this condensed version of his work. On the visual front, whatever viewers and critics wrote about the spectacle of DUNE applies to its sequel: Villeneuve’s vision remains writ large. It’s possible to argue Greig Fraser’s cinematography here is less impactful and blander than DUNE or THE BATMAN. Still, imaginative visuals such as the otherworldly desaturation of the Harkonnen home world or the use of blue to penetrate past the browns and tans of Arrakis show the film still has a few tricks up its sleeve. “Zendaya’s performance, balancing vulnerability as Paul’s romantic partner, fearlessness as a fighter, and scepticism as a Lisan Al-Gaib doubter, give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before.” Additionally, Chalamet gives one of his more impressive performances to date. As Paul slowly starts to give in to the leadership expectations and hopes of others, there is a wide-eyedness to his performance that Chalamet’s harsher critics (with this critic guilty as charged) likely did not expect. Ferguson is engaging as Lady Jessica, but the abundant screen time for those with truncated roles in DUNE represents the film’s most significant improvement from part one. Zendaya’s Chani is given time to be sketched out in a way not many other characters are – including protagonist Paul. Zendaya’s performance, balancing vulnerability as Paul’s romantic partner, fearlessness as a fighter, and scepticism as a Lisan Al-Gaib doubter, give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before. Javier Bardem’s Stilgar also puts forward an earnestness with his religious fervour and hope for a saviour, which puts a bitter sting in the darker aspects of Paul’s role as messiah. With all this said, despite some visual cues and explicit script signalling points that signal the more dystopian aspects of Paul’s rise to power, it’s hard to escape the feeling that reading this in DUNE: PART TWO as a film is extratextual, and instead based on the direction of the Dune novels which followed the ones adapted here. There are a lot of ideas introduced and skirted over – as in part one – around colonial exploitation, white saviour tropes, demagoguery, religion’s role in authoritarian systems, and more. However, few are given time to develop. Within the confines of a sub-three-hour film and sub-six-hour pair, perhaps this isn’t surprising but probably illustrates the core problem with both instalments and DUNE: PART TWO in particular: the sheer scope defies conceptual neatness. “…it’s remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does, but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper (or perhaps no ability to).” In contrast, Denis Villeneuve’s previous sci-fi forays did possess the conceptual neatness required to communicate underlying ideas effectively. ARRIVAL’s wedding of unique alien language and imagery to reimagine the human understanding of our lives is a simple emotional hook on an engaging set of mechanics. BLADE RUNNER 2049 provides a visually stunning and emotionally resonant extension of a simple human aspect of the 1982 original. The direct inspirations for DUNE (or things inspired by the novel, depending on your viewpoint) and things almost explicitly evoked, such as STAR WARS and GLADIATOR, have greater fleetness of foot and simplicity of plot. DUNE: PART TWO obviously aims for a different tone than those, and it’s remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does, but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper (or perhaps no ability to). This entry leans more heavily on the religious and autocratic readings of Paul’s rise amongst the Fremen. However, without much weight behind it, said leaning doesn’t leave a deep impression. It’s heartening that a film of this scope – in all senses – can exist in the modern cinematic canon. However, as engaging and awe-inducing as it can be, the rush of sensory input distracts from the fact it has only a passing interest in engaging the audience’s critical faculties with its characters. DUNE: PART TWO resolves one of the major flaws with DUNE – its emotional dryness – but neglects to use that renewed zeal to meaningfully deepen any of the main ideas introduced across either part. One thing the two modern DUNE films show, if sparingly, is that one person’s Lisan al-Gaib is another’s oppressor in waiting. The film itself can also have dual identities, and how you resolve the balance between breathtaking extravaganza and frustratingly limited melange marks out whether you end up a true believer or a cinematic agnostic."
"Mar 15, 2024",positive," Clocking in at a substantial two hours and 46 minutes, the highly anticipated sequel to Dune proves to be a captivating and daring work that surpasses its predecessor. It stands as a pure marvel, leaving audiences speechless with cinematic qualities bound to linger long after the credits roll.  Directed with ferocity by Denis Villeneuve, the film pushes the envelope with its gripping dark atmosphere, suspenseful hunts and ambushes, intricate rituals and prophecies, psychedelic imagery, and exhilarating fights set against magnificent backdrops.  In this grandiose adaptation of Frank Herbert’s adventurous saga, Paul Atreides, portrayed with compelling depth by Timothée Chalamet, joins forces with the Fremen tribe, confirming his role as the prophesied leader they have been awaiting. His journey includes daunting challenges such as riding a giant sandworm - a scene described by the director as the most complex he has ever filmed - and facing off against the sadistic Baron Vladimir Hakkonen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his ambitious and ruthless nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Amidst these trials, Paul also finds love with the rebellious Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), but their relationship is threatened by the uncertain fate of the universe. While the film boasts elaborate storytelling, it never veers into indulgence. The incorporation of abstraction amidst its dense layers adds depth, while still delivering all the impact one would expect from a breathtaking sci-fi adventure. Hans Zimmer’s ominous gothic score further heightens the intensity of each scene, contributing to the film’s overall strength. Dune: Part 2 stands as the apotheosis of Villeneuve's directorial signature within the sci-fi genre - a tremendous display of full-throttle filmmaking that mesmerizes with its clever stylization, unwavering attention to detail, and grandiose visuals. Sit back, relax, and immerse yourself in this unmissable epic space opera."
"Mar 14, 2024",negative," Dune: Part Two is not a sequel but a continuation of Dune, so picks up exactly at the point you’d started to wonder if it would ever end. All I can remember from the first film is sand, sand, so much sand, and it must get everywhere, and into your sandwiches. But it is set in a massive desert so it goes without saying there would be a lot of sand. I don’t blame the sand especially. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and based on the series of books by Frank Herbert, this second outing has already been hailed as ‘thrilling’, ‘breathtaking’ and ‘a masterpiece’ by those who are too easily carried away and said the same of the Marvel films – although I’m glad to say they are coming round to my way of thinking. To summarise where we were when we were praying for the last film to end: we were on the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis which is famed for its rare and extremely valuable resource, ‘spice’. When the emperor shifted control of Arrakis from House Harkonnen to House Atreides it set off a conflict between the two families. After Duke Leto Atreides was murdered his heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Paul’s mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), fled into the desert where they found sanctuary with the planet’s indigenous people, the Fremen. Here, we now discover, Paul does not plan to become an aromatherapist and develop his own brand of oils, even if I’d like to see that. Instead, he plans to retake Arrakis and avenge the death of his father. It is a hero’s personal quest story even if we know from the get-go (there are prophecies) that Paul will survive and also that, even if he doesn’t comprehend his destiny yet, he is the ‘Kwisatz Haderach’: the saviour. (There are all sorts of allegories at play; I’m not paid enough to think about them.) The set pieces – the battle scenes, the stadium scenes, the ‘sandworms’ thrashing their way to the surface like the shark in Jaws – are swaggeringly spectacular but hardly suspenseful, as the victors are a foregone conclusion. The noise of it, meanwhile, is so ear-splitting that the sound travels up your legs and vibrates your coccyx. I am still throbbing. Overall, the good characters are insanely good while the bad characters are monstrously bad – and also bald, like Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). The cast is stacked with celebs. Aside from those already mentioned, we have Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, Anya Taylor-Joy, Zendaya and Javier Bardem. I find that I resent how excellent actors who could be doing interesting work get swallowed up by these films. (Chalamet was an interesting actor once.) There is little character development and it’s not for the literal-minded – or anyone who has, despite their best efforts, paid some attention. Weren’t we told that no non-Arrakan would survive without wearing a ‘still suit’ to recycle moisture? So why are they now doing without? Where have the Fremen’s bright blue eyes gone? Why, five hours into the franchise, have we never seen anyone take ‘spice’ so we may properly understand its psychotropic properties? How do you even imbibe it? Also, as Jessica is a member of the ‘Bene Gesserit’, a mysterious sisterhood, and has trained Paul in ‘The Voice’ (which, when used, will command others to do his bidding), why doesn’t he just command the Harkonnen to put down their arms? ‘Because,’ as my son, who is a fan, told me, ‘there would be no story then.’ It is purely about what it’s about, which is power. Who has it, who doesn’t, who wants it. I kept thinking things like: what do people eat around here? I can’t say. I can only say that if my family had ended up on Arrakis, my dad would be saying: ‘I want all that sand off you before you step foot in this car."
"Mar 14, 2024",positive,"Denis Villeneuve is the director of this massive undertaking... Also, on board here is composer Hans Zimmer with his unforgettable background music and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer who gets those gigantic sand worms into action."
"Mar 14, 2024",positive," Dune: Part Two is a towering achievement in almost every way that is quantifiable, joining the growing list of sci-fi epics where the sequel outpaces an already heralded original. The majority of this review will be the ways it accomplishes this with a few, but noteworthy amounts of criticisms that keep it from being perfect. But I didn’t want to bury the lead in stating how great the film itself is because I couldn’t really write this review without acknowledging the film’s release, thematic framing in our real world, and the behavior of its performers in recent months. I am a big Dune fan and I say that as a fan of the books that once believed them to be impossible to adapt faithfully. I enjoyed Denis Villeneuve’s initial entry (and all of his films, honestly) and really, really looked forward to how he would adapt the second half of the first book in the sequel. But I can’t, won’t pretend to ignore the world of Dune and the climate of the real world the movie’s sequel crystalized in. The largest controversy being Timothee Chalamet’s skit on SNL and which Hamas was used as a punchline in what was essentially the early days of this specific violent eruption that had already killed thousands and thousands of innocent Palestinians.  I have my skepticisms about the impact of celebrities role in global narratives in general and often feel that propaganda has more power to entrench people in their already established beliefs more often then it sways someone from one side to another. I know internet outrage machines usually depend on every action someone takes in the public eye as some huge factor in what happens all over the world, but I typically have a hard time getting on board with that. So in a vacuum, I think Chalamet’s joke (and the SNL writers) were in extremely bad taste and does demonstrate their lack of care and empathy they had for the Palestinian people (and let’s keep this a buck, probably for Brown and Black people all over), but I’m not mad at people for still wanting to watch a movie that said person stars in. Though, I don’t fault folks that will protest it either. What is, enduring to me, is the plot of Dune and how we often learn so little from the art we create. The elevator pitch for Dune is that in the far future, a once privileged son of noble birth has his family and house obliterated but finds refuge with the indigenous people of a planet foreign to him. Believing him to be their messiah, he manipulates that population to fighting their oppressors, not for their benefit, but for his. And knowing his actions will lead to the literal deaths of billions across the galaxy, he still follows through because of his primary short term and personal goal. There are much better analogies in film to the Gaza conflict, (The Last of Us 2, comes to mind, though I don’t love the portrayals in that one either) but the oppression of a population living on a desired land, often referred to rats in the film is a bit hard to ignore. Unless, you’re in film, and it’s a job, and you can treat art with themes based on real life like you don’t live in that real world too. Its dispiriting and numbing honestly to see separating the art from the artist not only as a mantra for people that want to ignore the politics of art, but for it to basically become the gospel. Maybe I am the parental figure of the movies I watch now. I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed. Anyways, Dune: Part Two, as a film, is a technical achievement on the levels of cinema that I’m not sure I’ve seen in live action. Every scene is jaw dropping to witness. Typically, big budget films have a signature action scene that will live in the zeitgeist for years to come. Dune: Part Two has about 4 that I can think of immediately. Emotionally impactful moments linger in close-up on characters that amplifies the weight of their decisions, their actions, their connections to one another. The scale is appropriate as well. The desert is a character in itself, stretching on forever in each shot, the camera often pulled well behind the characters to demonstrate the endlessness of the landscape. And anyone that sees the film will obviously point to the use of black and white when the movie arrives on the Geidi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld, and it not only makes the violence even more daunting and disturbing, but it gives a sense of that nuance here is lost and the agendas and goals of these people are straightforward. Often to the most ruthless ends. As for the plot, the movie takes place right after the events of the first film, with Paul Atreides and his Lady Jessica seeking refuge among the Fremen of Arrakis, but still being hunted Harkonnen who want to eradicate the Atreides House. As the film progresses, Paul (played by Chalamet) slowly embraces the false prophecies his mother and the Benet Jesuit have planted among the Fremen people, even if he was reluctant at first because of the death and destruction he knows it will bring. The pacing is well done (obviously easier to do in a film of this length) as there are plenty of victories, losses, tragedies, and revelations that guide Paul down this irreversible path. Because the first Dune book was written 60 years ago and because Paul’s story itself takes about 3 books to fully tell, I’ll make what may be an unpopular opinion in 2024: Paul Atreides is one of the most fascinating protagonists written in fiction. Period. He is no hero. Not by a long shot.  After the first film released, I know several people were just out on it because it looked like yet again another white savior leading the Brown folks to the promised land. And because the film only adapts the first half (if that) of the book, I don’t think that was a completely wrong assumption to make. But Paul is not a white savior. He’s actually the opposite, he’s a harbinger of doom. Evil is perhaps to flat a term to assign to him, but I think you can make a great case that for the early parts of the fiction, Paul is a villain opposing greater villains. Dune is about many things, but one was about the cautioning towards the grips of fanatic religious fervor and the danger of charismatic leaders. Paul being an outsider to these people and using their yearning of hope against them to help accomplish his goal of revenge are not supposed to make you root for Paul. And for those that checked out of the first film, I really hope you see the sequel because that specific vision becomes much more clear and on display. Admittedly, while the performances are all good, defaulting as great, the progression of the supporting characters is a bit more up and down for me. Zendaya as Chani is good, mostly, though the expansion of her character for the movie seems to be driven more by it being Zendaya in the role needing a foil to Paul as the fanaticism grows. I think many of the character missteps in the film are often to fill the void of an important character not being there (compared to the books), but asking Chani to be the love interest, the guide companion to Paul, the heart of the Fremen people and ultimately the foil and victim to Paul’s endgame machinations are just a bit too much to pack into one character. Especially for a character that didn’t do 20% of that in the book.  In a different way, Lady Jessica takes on a more nefarious role as the lead propagandist for Paul’s accension to Fremen Messiah. Jessica is already a polarizing figure, by design, so to see her only role in the film to be the carnival barker for Paul, even when he tells her how tragic this path will be, was a little disappointing. Plus, they got her using the voice on AYEBODY, like once per her 2 minutes of screen time, and it got to be a bit much. The other incredible, scene stealing performance belonged to Austin Butler as the absolutely psychotic Feyd-Rautha. He is essentially the mirror of Paul if he were raised in a brutal and homicidal environment that had no love or empathy in the social charter. Your boy really exorcised them Elvis demons. He is impossible not to gawk at on screen, and I often found myself thinking, ‘the most terrible thing possible that a character can do, he will absolutely do it before this scene is over.’ The very big omission from the film that was present in the book is Paul’s little sister Alia. In the book, she is already born and little more than a toddler by the book’s end. BUT because of Lady Jessica drinking the water of life while pregnant, that toddler Alia contains all the knowledge of her ancestors and is basically Reverend Mother in a three year-old’s body. For the film however, Alia is still in utero. While she is still a character, technically, talking to Lady Jessica and being involved in the plotting, she still doesn’t have the impact she had in the books. That puts pressure on characters like Jessica and even Chani in some respects to be either opposing forces to Paul or help set Paul higher on the overall morality scale of the Dune characters. Alia, via the books is just as cunning, but even more brutal and pragmatic than her brother, which is hinted at in the movie, but will most likely be explored fully in Dune: Messiah.  As a whole, the performances and plotting of the characters never relents and almost everything has a good logic system behind it. Only with Chani did I not always have a clear vision of what they wanted or have that feeling in movies where people do things because they haven’t had some basic conversations that would help them make better decisions. Dune: Part Two is a movie that feels like the culmination of everything that can make a big epic story like this great on the big screen. It is one of the most gorgeous films I’ve ever seen whether during the iconic action sequences or the unnerving rituals of the varying groups on the planet. The performances range from amazing to adequate, the latter never truly taking away from the spectacle we are witnessing. I have to imagine that Dune: Messiah will be the last film and if its done as well as Part Two was, gives it a chance at being one of the best sci-fi trilogies every made. “You don’t want the fourth book, Children of Dune, y’all. I’m trying to warn you. I love Dune…but you don’t want that shit, b.” Is the most factual thing you will read on the internet today. Horrendous. "
"Mar 14, 2024",neutral," It was nice being a Denis Villeneuve fan again for a few years, but with Dune: Part Two the inconsistent filmmaker is back to his misguided ways. The brief respite of Blade Runner 2049 and Dune: Part One suggested that he was meant for high-concept sci-fi after the pretentiousness of Arrival, Sicario, and Prisoners — solid genre entries undermined by empty quests for “importance” — sidelined him from the weird heights of Enemy and the gut-punch brilliance of Incendies. In the elevated surroundings of futuristic Los Angeles and the planets of Caladan, Giedi Prime, and Arrakis, Villeneuve’s lofty concepts thrillingly found a home. And while one might think the spectacle of Dune: Part One would increase on the way to a big climax in the continuation of his Frank Herbert adaptation, with the exception of a few slick sci-fi images, Part Two may as well take place in near-future Albuquerque. Tonally inconsistent, this second chapter rarely feels like a Villeneuve film — even the aforementioned visually sharp narrative misfires. Minimal distinguishable style is evident in the film’s excruciatingly long opening stretch with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) entrenched with the indigenous Fremen on the desert planet Arrakis. And the random point at which the narrative resumes makes the already awkward end of Part One feel doubly arbitrary. Though doubts remain among the native people regarding his and Jessica’s presence, Paul has suddenly been “accepted” by most of the Fremen, resulting in a cringey, folksy familiarity with them. And the way he and love interest Chani (Zendaya) wear each other down with their mutually long flirty looks grows old fast, especially with little evidence to support her attraction to him. The two actors have been stellar in plenty of other films, but it’s doubtful that any pair of performers could convincingly pull off this weak romantic material. The distinct change in narrative quality may or may not be due to Part One co-scribe Eric Roth being dropped from the screenwriting team as, in his absence, Villeneuve and collaborator Jon Spaihts spin their wheels with the Fremen and take forever — besides a brief introduction of Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) — to work in anyone else. When they do, it’s merely a minute of the pathetic Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) ‘roiding out over the Harkonnens’ inability to stifle the desert “rat” insurgents. Rather than continue Part One’s invigorating blend of stunning imagery and engaging, informative world- and myth-building, Part Two quickly devolves into Long Dramatic Stares: The Movie. With the filmmakers lacking faith in their storytelling after such a promising opening gambit, the continuation becomes almost Zack Snyder-like in its iconography — lazy solutions that Villeneuve has only occasionally flirted with in his worst films. Such cheap (well, not in a financial sense) tricks are perhaps to be expected when the storytellers wholly succumb to the saga’s fanatical religious elements, which quickly become one-note — particularly the laughable insistence of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) that Paul is fulfilling ancient prophecies and proving himself the messianic Kwisatz Haderach. Paul’s embrace of this role plays out somewhat clumsily as Chalamet proves ill-suited for the big emotional outbursts that accompany Paul’s rise to power. But again, the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis and Denzel Washington would probably struggle to be taken seriously in this role with filmmakers who seem in a rush to reach the end and continually brush past what feels like important information. Likewise running counter to the measured storytelling of Part One, this strangely zippy plotting appears primarily to set up a climactic showdown between Paul and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler, Elvis), a character not even mentioned in the previous film and whose introduction proves predictably forced.  Playing yet another famous performer with a weird voice, Butler is serviceable in the role memorably inhabited by Sting in David Lynch’s Dune, and elicits decent excitement in his birthday gladiator arena sequence as his insane uncle Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) looks on. But the decision to film this stretch primarily in B&W is a strange one and draws too much attention to itself with minimal underlying intent. Tossed around like an off-worlder attempting to ride a sand worm, one grows tired of practically everyone except Walken and Pugh, in part because they haven’t been given enough time to grow dull. However, such opportunities await as, like its predecessor, Part Two is mere prelude to further adventures with Paul & Co. It didn’t seem to be the case after the immense potential of Part One, but in all its awkwardness, the 40-year-old Lynch version remains the definitive big-screen adaptation of Dune."
"Mar 14, 2024",positive," One of the most enduring critiques of 2021’s Dune is of its perceived sparseness, labeling the once “unfilmable” adaptation as a gorgeously engineered juggling act of Frank Herbert’s lugubrious mythmaking that’s all setup and no payoff: a true “part one” if there ever was one. Nearly three years later, however, Denis Villeneuve’s staggering Dune: Part Two proves to land every spectacular, brutalist tableau thrown in the air in 2021. The first film’s meticulous - and at times exhausting - assembly of dynastic lore and tangled history kept its characters in the shadows of its sprawling grandeur, but Part Two completes a vision by colliding dense sci-fi imagemaking with Herbert’s heady and prescient themes: the gravity of manufactured destiny, the untamable tendrils of belief, and a harrowing subversion of the hero’s journey. Discarding the first film’s mysterious, undulating prelude for a new caption, Part Two lets us know it’s getting straight to business: “Power over spice is power over all.” Taking place precisely where 2021’s Dune left off, Part Two finds Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet in top form) and his mother Lady Jessica (a sinister Rebecca Ferguson) on the run with the planet’s native Fremen. With his father dead and House Atreides’ grip on Arakeen shattered by sadistic House Harkonnen rivals, Paul acclimates to his freedom fighter hosts while growing his romance with fellow rebel Chani (Zendaya). Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is eager to accept the prodigal Atreides as the prophesied “Lisan al gaib” to deliver his people from Harkonnen oppression, but unbeknownst to the indigenous faithful, Jessica - as a Bene Gesserit priestess - has carefully massaged eugenics and thousands of years of local myth to suit her son and her sect.  “The world has made choices for us.” Late in Dune: Part Two, Chani unearths its central tension as the two lovers try and resist the pull of destiny. Where Dune ends on an almost comically truncated cliffhanger, Villeneuve is now ready to detonate all the foundations conscientiously crafted three years ago. Catalyzing Herbert’s stark palace intrigue with the tragedy of inevitability, Part Two examines colonial conquest, messianic dangers, and the gravity of mass belief systems. The role of faith - and its meaning to different factions - is woven straight into the tapestry of the narrative: For the Fremen, “Lisan al gaib” is the savior foretold; for the Bene Gesserit, it’s a system of control and a tool of subjugation. And what of Paul himself? Hopped up on Arrakis’ otherworldly “spice” and the psychic powers it endows him, the young duke - channeled through Chalamet’s career-best performance - precariously wavers between his own horror at the tyrannical future he’s locked into and the intoxicating allure of empyrean power. Dune has had a long, pained history on the screen. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s version remains an abandoned production and a Hollywood relic, David Lynch’s ambitiously incomprehensible 1984 film resulted in a notorious flop, and the 2000 miniseries - the bloated and faithful-to-a-fault Frank Herbert’s Dune - has the dubious honor from TOR.com as the “most okay adaptation.” Dune - by sheer number of failed iterations - has been called “unfilmable,” but its reputation as an impenetrable, esoteric art object has been greatly exaggerated. Leafing through Herbert’s prose, it’s quite clear that there’s plenty of Dune that is inherently cinematic, and Villeneuve - whose staunchest critics find him cold and clinical - is the perfect choice to bring Arrakis and its galactic oppressors to life. Not to throw around the word lightly, but Part Two is rife with sure-to-be iconic sci-fi imagery borne from DP Greig Fraser’s stunning compositions: Harkonnen troopers in an anti-gravity assault through the sands of the spice planet, the black sun and inverted fireworks of Giedi Prime, the demented-yet-honorable Feyd-Rautha’s (a slithering, committed Austin Butler) gladiatorial showdowns. Part Two also has Villeneuve shoring up his kinetic bonafides; a mid-film guerilla takedown of an ornithopter had the audience in my theater hollering, and for those who spent three years patiently waiting for some real sandworm action, I’m happy to report that Dune’s most infamous cryptids make multiple jaw-dropping appearances.  Villeneuve, as a long time Dune-head, has called his adaptation the “project of his life.” Conveying an exuberant passion for the source material, his deep understanding of Herbert’s ideas shine through the surgical changes - some major, some subtle - required to bring the book to life. One such inspired choice is the translation of Alia - Paul’s sister - from insidious toddler to a sentient, psychic fetus; the change is made specifically for the screen, sidestepping the need for an awkward toddler actor while still preserving Herbert’s trademark peculiarities. However, not every reconfiguration of text is a good one: For a film so deft at upending white savior tropes and colonizer narratives, Dune’s lone, sore spot remains how eager it is to de-Islamize its Fremen people. Going so far as to hiring Game of Thrones conlanger David J. Peterson to create a fictional language to replace Herbert’s widespread use of Arabic, Part Two’s expected - but no less disappointing - brand of Hollywood cowardice aims to hobble its own themes.  Despite its missteps, Dune: Part Two remains a bracing achievement in science fiction imagemaking and the coalescence of a singular vision that started over three years ago. Transforming Herbert’s prose into a visual cauldron of weird mysticism, resistance warfare, and the tangle of resigned fates, Part Two dares to be an IP blockbuster that is knotty and bleak. As the final notes of Paul’s violent ascendency curdle from triumph to ominous portent, it all becomes crystal clear: Denis Villeneuve gets it. Bring on Messiah."
"Mar 14, 2024",negative," A warrior princess, a terrifying teddy bear, and giant sand worms… here’s the best and worst of the films the Pop Culture Planet writers have watched this week. In Damsel, Millie Bobby Brown plays Elodie who gets sworn into a life of royalty to help her people. This is no fairytale as the prince she’s marrying comes from an ancient kingdom that owes a centuries long debt. In order for the kingdom to live on, a sacrifice must be made. Brown is astounding as the sacrificial princess. Her performance keeps you engaged as she displays trepidation and determination to get out of her predicament. Brown does an excellent service to Elodie’s character as an endearing and witty young woman that felt authentic on screen.  Though there are CGI flaws, such as the glowing worms, the film does a very great job with the dragon voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Aghdashloo brings not only a haunting sense, but also a depth in vulnerability to her role. Taking what could’ve been a simple revenge story and adding a more sentimental aspect to her makes it enjoyable to unpack. The bond Elodie and the dragon create is an unexpected twist that adds to the tension towards the kingdom that lied to both of them. Compassion for the misunderstood is at the forefront of this film and makes for a compelling narrative.  In Dune: Part 2, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) unites with the Fremen while seeking revenge against those who destroyed his family. When he’s faced with a terrible future only he can foresee, he has a choice between love and the fate of the universe. Based on the sci-fi epic book series by Frank Herbert, Dune: Part Two wasn’t for me — and that’s okay. I found the film to be long and dragged out, while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed. The film is star-studded with actors like Christopher Walken that felt more like glorified cameos that don’t add much to the story. There is also a Blonde-level moment of cringe around Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that comes off as ridiculous. The highlights were the epic action with the sand worms and Florence Pugh’s gorgeous wardrobe as Princess Irulan. It’s been a great time for original horror in theaters, but Blumhouse hasn’t been getting it right. From lackluster entries like The Exorcist: Believer and Night Swim, Imaginary is another L on the list. The film follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who moves back into her childhood home with her family. The behavior of her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) becomes concerning when she finds a stuffed teddy bear named Chauncey that is much more that he seems. While Imaginary has surprising twists and turns, it’s ultimately cheesy and unserious. It is full of weak performances and even worse dialogue, including an awkward line from a therapist asking if Alice has taken on new hobbies like ventriloquism to explain Chauncey’s voice. Chauncey is more silly than scary — although under the right direction, he could’ve come across as more campy to win over audiences. My theater was laughing a lot but more from weak dialogue, which I don’t think was the intent. The stand outs in the film were the positive relationship that builds between Jessica and her stepdaughters, breaking the mold from typical stereotypes, and the unique practical set of the imaginary world of the Never Ever, which gave off Labyrinth energy.  A young woman, eager to earn some cash, arrives in a new town and secures a night shift at a sketchy motel managed by Teddy Miles (Lamorne Morris), who is friendly but slightly on edge and eager to leave. Miles assures Gwen (Phoebe Tonkin) that the place is harmless, despite all evidence to the contrary. When Miles leaves, Gwen is sure she is being watched by someone from her past, but as the night progresses… she becomes convinced the motel is haunted. Night Shift is a movie that offers a few jump scares, but takes too long to pick up. The plot falls very flat and, while the actors are good, the characters introduced along the way are underdeveloped and underutilized. While I thought the choice of committing to one location was just right for the film, it could have been stronger if the story had more moments of spontaneity. The story was pretty lackluster and predictable. Though the major plot twist was intriguing, it created a rushed ending that failed to add to the story.

"Mar 13, 2024",positive," On every technical level- this is a work of cinematic genius. The craft is expertly made, and it shows in every shot, every note of the music, and every scene that transports the audience to Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet continues his ascent from space prince to cult messiah, and he digs deep for his mesmerizing and powerful performance as Paul Atreides. Everyone in this stacked cast commits all they can to the film and helps it transcend from an ordinary movie to a sci-fi epic. If you loved the first movie, you'll love this one. And if you were bored by the long space opera, you'll still be bored here. It's nearly three hours long. So if you don't want to take the ride, don't. But if you do, you're in for a treat."

"Mar 12, 2024",positive," A desert landscape, magical spices, an occupying force, a native warrior community, and a handsome young hero, bred to liberate them—Dune: Part Two seems to have it all. But does it? While Frank Herbert’s original series was about the dangers of messianism, Denis Villeneuve’s rendition wields ambivalence like a secret weapon in its effort to avoid the tough questions. Dune: Part Two, the latest installment of Denis Villaneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s enduring (and supposedly unadaptable) science fiction series, carries a great weight on its shoulders. It must succeed as a continuation of the first movie without losing new viewers and while bearing the box office’s dreams for an industry that has flagged in comparison to last year. It must give the thrill of a big science fiction blockbuster, while seeming to undermine the transparent teenage fantasies that flourish throughout those stories. A desert landscape, spices with magical properties, an occupying force, a community of native warriors, and a handsome young hero, bred and trained to liberate them all—Dune: Part Two has all the right elements of success, including a star-studded cast. Timothée Chalamet transforms from waif to despot; Zendaya guides the audience’s perspective with her pensive eyes; Rebecca Ferguson giving us “Reverend Mother”; Javier Bardem is both affable mentor and zealot; and Austin Butler sheds the Elvis accent and all of his hair. Villeneuve streamlines the vast scope of Herbert’s story into a series of sweeping set pieces, more plentiful in this installment and meticulously executed. The film charts Paul Atreides’s swift rise while characterizing that rise as a cautionary tale too. For just as Paul needs to save his family and his adopted planet, Arrakis, from the occupying Harkonnens, Villeneuve must salvage knowing self-critique from the jaws of teenage fantasy clichés. When we first meet Paul and his family in Dune: Part One, the Atreides are part of the intergalactic aristocracy and are bequeathed Arrakis by imperial decree. Arrakis is a stark, unforgiving planet. But its deserts and deadly worms also produce “spice,” the most valuable substance in the galaxy. The Atreides hope to turn around the family’s fortunes with the power of the spice production in Arrakis. They exchange the comforts and oceans of their home world for it. Yet, little do they know they have walked into a trap set by a rival family with whom they have been feuding for centuries. In Dune: Part One, we follow Paul and the Atreides as they are stripped of all their advantages. Paul and his mother, Jessica, are left in the vast desert of Arrakis seeking safe haven with a group of Fremen, the people indigenous to the planet. Now, in Dune: Part Two, we return to Paul, who hopes to gather his strength against House Harkonnen—the villainous family that secured a planetary takeover with the emperor’s clandestine support. Paul’s prospects are as limited as the water supply in Arrakis, and his only potential allies are the Fremen, who are understandably suspicious of outsiders. But Paul proves his worth as a warrior and earns their hospitality. Meanwhile, Stilgar, a Fremen leader, takes Paul and his mother into the Fremen’s Sietch, the cave warren where they live out of view of Harkonnen eyes. There, Paul is greeted by rumblings among some Fremen that he might be their messiah. Paul says he doesn’t want to lead; he just wants to fight alongside them. The Harkonnens have the guns and technology, but at nearly every turn they are outmaneuvered by Paul and the Fremen. The Fremen are fierce fighters who have been hardened by desert life, and they know how to resist the Harkonnen occupation by interrupting spice extraction in every way possible. Led by the Baron (played by a grotesque Stellan Skarsgård), the Harkonnens are cartoonish villains, and, barring Skarsgård’s game performance, their depiction feels like a shortcut in Villaneuve’s imagination. The Harkonnens are bad guys who dress in black, kill their underlings on a whim, and assemble their armies in rigid formations reminiscent of Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda films. It’s not just that they are a cliché; it’s that caricatures are not that menacing. The real threat to the galaxy, then, is not in a war between good guys and bad guys but in how belief can turn into violence, and self-defense into a despotic bid for power. The Fremen’s religion preaches the hope of a savior, the “Lisan al Gaib,” and as the film goes on Paul seems to perfectly fit their prophecy. Paul knows too much to be fully taken in by the religious fervor, but even his mother has a messianic prophecy that she works to bring about: She is a sister of the Bene Gesserit, a mystic cabal of political operators who advise those in power but who are also engineering the rise of their own messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach. For most of the film, Paul resists these projected messianic narratives—until he succumbs to the temptation to wield the faith of thousands as his last resort. One of the reasons the Dune novels have been difficult to adapt is that Paul’s story is at the center of a vast scale of conspiracies and machinations. There are the Imperial House Corrino’s ambitions and their manipulation of the Atreides and Harkonnen for their own gains, and there is the Spacing Guild (left out of Villaneuve’s version altogether) that controls all interplanetary travel and depends entirely on spice. Computers have been replaced by highly trained humans, called Mentats. The Bene Gesserit have their own centuries-long eugenicist project, of which Paul is one of the most recent products. And in the novel, Paul’s story unfolds over a longer period of time. He becomes immersed in the ways of the Fremen. He spends years waging guerilla campaigns against the Harkonnen. He has a son with Chani. Villaneuve compacts the storyline for clarity, keeping the most essential portions, if losing some of its intricacies. Yet some important elements get lost in the cuts. The awe we might feel of a man both empowered and reduced in the face of galaxy-sized projects is replaced by the awe of vast landscapes. For a film invested in grand spectacle, the desert embodies the ambivalence of a world where nothing is ever just one thing: It is a source of wealth, but also a place of death, a hostile home, a visual splendor, and an impassive vastness. Villaneuve and cinematographer Greg Frasier capture the desert in its varieties, but their palette also limits the world to shades of bleakness. It can be striking to see a figure framed as an iconographic silhouette against a near-monochromatic backdrop, but too much of the same image weaken its profundity. There are only so many ways to look at the undulating waves of the sand against a broad beige sky, especially when the Fremen sartorial style is just as beige. Camouflage makes sense, of course, but even when we see inside the Fremen living quarters, the only pops of color are their watchful blue eyes. Blue eyes are a symptom of spice intake. For the Fremen, the spice is a part of life. It’s in the food they eat and the air they breathe. But for Paul there are some serious side effects, including prophetic visions out of his control. In Herbert’s novel, the effects of these visions are a more central and dramatic concern. They are fragmented and unclear, but they show Paul a religious war with an unfathomable cost and blood on his hands. Paul tries to find a way to avoid that future. But the prophecies don’t just elude his control; they fracture his sense of self. He struggles to keep his grasp on a reality that passes through his hands like a fistful of sand. In Villaneuve’s rendition, these visions are more discrete and less fragmentary. Rather than disorient viewers, the visions hardly compete with the excitement and set pieces that surround them. We lose the sense of the mystical that percolates throughout Herbert’s novels and the ability to see possible futures other than the one Paul sees. For the most part, we are stuck within Paul’s perspective, learning the world of Dune as he does. We like Paul. His heart is in a good place, and we want to see him win. We also know how this kind of story works. Our hero starts with nothing; he resists his calling, before inevitably gaining the power he deserves. The film’s very form is structured around Paul’s ascendance, and his harrowing visions are mere speed bumps on his path to victory. As Part Two unfolds, the film tries to distance us from our hero’s choices by foregrounding Chani’s point of view. Through Chani’s eyes, we see the costs of Paul’s rise and how Paul walks right into the choices in his visions. It is Chani’s face, her reactions, her pleading that offer a moral conscience to a world that, like its landscapes, gets bleaker and bleaker. She counsels him against the actions that lead to the end of the movie and make Paul’s nightmares a reality for everyone else. While the original series was all about the corrosive power of adulation and the wayward paths on which messianism can lead us, Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two is like so much film and television today: It wields its ambivalence like a secret weapon. It offers up set pieces and violent victories for viewers to revel in and draws Paul toward an apocalyptic end that becomes increasingly unavoidable. But the film doesn’t complicate our feelings as much as it performs ambivalence for us. The film warns us against the very thing it gives us. We watch from reclining chairs as Paul starts a holy war—our hands are clean. We get the heroic battles and the guilt on the side. Our hero is tortured so we don’t have to be. All we need to do is just sit back and put up our feet. We hope you enjoyed the story you just read.

"Mar 12, 2024",neutral," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters this weekend is Dune: Part Two, the incredible sci-fi epic that well surpasses the first part and achieves on every level. This might be the best sci-fi film we’ve had in many years and will likely be one of the best films of the year. Director Denis Villenueve masterfully guides this second part with exquisite cinematography, a striking score by Hans Zimmer, incredible costumes, groundbreaking effects, and a stellar cast in Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Christopher Walken, Stellan Skarsgard, and so many others. The action ramps up, the story goes deeper, the characters become more fleshed out, and the stakes are raised. Despite a running time of two hours and 45 minutes, it flies by and there isn’t really a unnecessary slab of time in there. It makes you want for the third and final chapter and surprisingly has you thinking you’ll want to see it again right away to see what you might have missed. That’s an achievement in this short attention span world. See it on the biggest screen possible. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK, AMFM Magazine, and RECRD."
"Mar 12, 2024",positive," No one cries in the desert. In a place where water is precious, nothing can be wasted. Dune feels without tears. Dune speaks without words.  Director Denis Villeneuve may be the greatest filmmaker of his generation. Author Frank Herbert may be the greatest science fiction writer of all time. By combining the two of them, they’ve created a fully realized universe of revenge and power in a way that’s utterly unique. It’s like nothing else you’ve seen or will see again. For those who haven’t read the books, much of Frank Herbert’s story takes place in the minds and inner thoughts of his characters. Because of that, Hollywood has shied away from turning this science fiction touchstone into a movie event for years. The last time someone tried, in the eighties, the result was a disaster. How do you film a movie where all your characters think and don’t emote or speak? You can’t. I can’t. Maybe no one else in the world can except Denis Villeneuve.  In the eyes of Villeneuve, dialogue is lazy. A true visual storyteller can communicate without speaking. And he does it. He does it over and over and over again and translates what was once thought to be an unfilmable narrative into one of the greatest movie masterpieces ever created. He does it by using images and sound and the nuanced faces of some of Hollywood’s most talented young actors. Mute the dialogue in Dune: Part Two, and you wouldn’t notice. Villeneuve tells a story beyond words. By the time Dune: Part Two is over, we know this world and these characters on a deeply intimate level. We understand what drives them and we feel the lesson they’ve learned. That lesson is this: When war is upon you, fight. "
"Mar 11, 2024",negative," The sand trembles and appears to harden, like goose bumps on the forearms of impressionable sci-fi geeks. We come to space operas to be transported, and few sights are as entrancing as the moment a giant sandworm, its circular mouth baring a fearsome set of sharp, needle-shaped chompers, rises to the surface.  “Dune: Part Two,” director Denis Villeneuve's return to the worlds created by author Frank Herbert, delivers the imposing spectacle with visual splendor and a deafening sound mix. We want to witness our brave and determined protagonist's first surfing expedition atop the cylindrical critters. The scene comes fairly early in this hefty continuation of the cinematic retelling of Herbert's dense, highly influential 1965 novel (don't you dare call it a sequel), and it does not disappoint.

What does come as a letdown is how this knotty exploration of lust for power, faith-based fervor and that snake-charmer's dance between fate and chance proceeds to get lost in the desert. Villeneuve, who struck such an adroit balance between storytelling and worldbuilding in 2021's square-jawed but satisfying “Dune: Part One,” is so intent in lending biblical weight to this star war that he drains the film of much of its pulp, and what starts out as engaging genre yarn turns into a bloated endurance test. He's made an otherworldly voyage that forgets to be a popcorn movie. Getting through all 166 minutes of it feels like homework. “Part Two” picks up minutes after “Part One” left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), heading off into the sands of Arrakis, the desert planet they initially landed on to oversee alongside Paul's dad, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, sorely missed), before the very ruler who appointed them there conspired to wipe out the Atreides kingdom, or, as Herbert coined it, House Atreides. Mother and son survived the extermination that claimed Leto's life and have joined the Fremen, Arrakis' native residents, and their chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem in the Anthony Quinn role), with whom Leto wanted to establish an alliance before it all went belly up. The problem that Paul and Jessica face is that the Fremen are split between those who remain wary of outsiders and want to banish the new arrivals into the desert, and those who revere the pair and regard Paul as a messianic figure and the fulfillment of a prophecy. Stilgar, a fierce believer in that prophecy, is on Paul and Jessica's corner, but they will have to prove their usefulness. More skeptical but curious about Paul is Chani (Zendaya), who proves to be a valuable ally to the young aristocrat. In turn, Paul insists he has no appetite for power and just wants to help the Fremen. Meanwhile, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) is weighing the consequences of his betrayal aimed at eliminating House Atreides, while his daughter, Princess Irulan Corrino (Florence Pugh) learns that Paul may be alive. They do not appear to stop their co-conspirator, the dastardly and freakishly blubbery Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew, Count Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), from searching for Paul. But scenes set outside Arrakis are few and far between in “Dune: Part Two.” By contrast, a considerable portion of “Part One” took place in the Atreides' home planet of Caladan, giving viewers a welcome change of scenery. But for the majority of its runtime, this latest chapter leaves us stuck in that big dust bowl, where Jessica uses her ties to the powerful and mysterious Bene Gesserit Order to help sway public opinion about her son. But the aesthetic sameness that engulfs the character makes her quest feel oppressive, and that extends to the way Villeneuve, working from a screenplay credited to him and Jon Spaihts, depicts religious devotion in stark, monochromatic terms. There are skeptics, believers, and the torn, brooding Paul stuck in the middle, haunted by disturbing visions. Noticeably missing are the shades of gray that would make his predicament more intriguing.

As for his friendship with Chani, it evolves into something more, at least on paper. Villeneuve may possess multiple strengths as a filmmaker, but conveying romance is not one of them. Chalamet and Zendaya fight a gallant but losing battle to make us believe their characters are an item, which may not seem like a big issue, but it becomes one when the movie hinges its dramatic payoff on their bond. More effective is the emergence of Feyd-Rautha, Baron Harkonnen's psychotic, bloodthirsty younger nephew. Austin Butler commands the role played by Sting in David Lynch's 1984 “Dune” adaptation. Before he joins the efforts to root out Paul, Feyd crosses paths with the enigmatic Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux, looking as if she stepped out of a perfume ad), who has her own motives for approaching the bald, obsidian-eyed sociopath. Butler and Seydoux share limited screen time together, but they set off considerably more sparks than Chalamet and Zendaya. By the time Villeneuve and Spaihts tie their narrative strands together, this ostensible middle chapter has become too much of a chore. Pugh, dressed like she's heading to a Renaissance fair, gives a rare stiff performance. She and the formidable Walken are given nothing to do beyond Greek chorus duties. Butler dives into the villainous Feyd-Rautha with rock-star abandon, but there's not enough of him to turn things around. And the film's strained attempts to portray the change in Paul's worldview feel imposed and mechanical rather than earned. It reduces the conflicted would-be leader to a barking politician with a God complex. The more confident the character appears, the less interesting he becomes. “Dune: Part Two” desperately wants you to take it seriously, which is kind of hard when it features spaceships that look like testicles and is awash in phallic imagery. Villeneuve pummels you with portent, diluting the movie's entertainment value in the process. He gets to indulge in his most heavy-handed instincts behind the camera, to the extent that what's in front of it resembles a fire-and-brimstone sermon. He's preaching the Gospel of Paul but neglected to accommodate the non-believers he won over the first time around. The spice doesn't flow here. The bloom is off this desert rose. It did leave me with a gift, but not one I wanted: a big, pounding headache. My temples throbbed, but my imagination stayed firmly planted on the shifting sands.

"Mar 11, 2024",positive,"Epic visually, but the story is still hard to follow if you have not read the book."
"Mar 11, 2024",positive," A combination of a journalism assignment at the Oregon Dunes and the recreational usage of psilocybin mushrooms led Frank Herbert to write “Dune,” a sprawling, five book saga. Beloved by many, they featured intergalactic warfare, giant worm-related destruction, and trenchant criticism of politics and religion. On the one hand, you’d expect that as a lifelong genre dweeb and sci-fi nerd, I would have been into these books. On the other hand, those are some seriously long-ass books. I put off reading them, and if you know anything about me, I have some god tier procrastination skills. Years passed. I did not give the spice-filled planet of Arrakis a second thought. Then, in conversation with my friend, Kristin, that changed. You see, she’s both an English major and a fellow geek. Kindly but firmly, she insisted I read just the first of Herbert’s books. “It’s good, trust me,” she said, or words to that effect. As it turns out, Kristin was right! I didn’t fall in love with the novel, but there was some weapons-grade strangeness at play amidst the political maneuverings and talk of jihad. It’s a classic, and I understand why that is. The book led me to Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 film adaptation Dune. That led me to Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve’s hotly anticipated sequel. Does it live up to the hype? You bet your Fedaykin ass it does. We pick up where Dune left off, and in a power move rivaling the MCU, there’s zero attempt to bring new viewers up to speed. So, at the risk of sounding like a stroke victim, let’s dive in! Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter of Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), dictates in her journal that Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) may yet survive.  That’s surprising, since the Atreides clan has largely been slaughtered by House Harkonnen. You see, the Harkonnen clan is led by the sluglike Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard) and his (for the moment) right hand Rabban (Dave Bautista). They are, not to put too fine a point on it, not nice people, and the Harkonnens are now concerning themselves with bringing the desert planet Arrakis to heel and controlling the flow of spice. The good news for Paul is that he’s actually alive. He’s hanging out with the Fremen, what the Arrakis locals call themselves. Half of the Fremen think that Paul and his space witch mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are more trouble than they’re worth. That includes Chani (Zendaya), a warrior who’s fifty percent sweet on Paul and fifty percent sure he’ll bring the Fremen to ruin. That’s because Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of this tribe of Fremen, is positive that Paul is an honest-to-God messiah. Maybe he is. Paul has dreams. He sees signs and portents, possible futures, disasters, and a narrow path to something he thinks of as victory. Can he achieve victory over Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), a Harkonnen psychopath and knife enthusiast? Again, it depends on how you define the concept of victory. First, let’s clear something up. These days, there’s a nasty habit amongst filmgoers that a movie is either an offensive assault or the greatest work of cinematic art ever. The fact is, most movies fall somewhere within the Pretty Good classification. You watch them, you have a nice time, then you live your life.  Bearing that in mind, Dune: Part Two is genuinely an epic in every sense of the word, one on the same tier as The Empire Strikes Back and Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lots of studio films feel as if they’ve been designed by committee and focus-grouped to within an inch of their lives. Not here. The sweep of the arid vistas, blood and thunder, and armies clashing are fully within service of Denis Villeneuve’s vision. The canvas he paints on is enormous. It spans between planets and takes us from the back of a massive sandworm to the cozy confines of a tent. All the technical aspects, from the effects work to the costuming and set design,* work in harmony to deliver specific people during a specific time. Part Two has a two hour, forty-six minute run time. Add that to the first film and you’ve got essentially a five hour adaptation of the first book. I think that’s necessary since Villeneuve needs to set up the world, the players, and their motivations. He does so efficiently, and there were only a few moments where I was aware of the passage of time. Is the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts as sparkling as the direction? Not quite. Everyone in House Harkonnen is essentially Team Evil, and their character motivations range from, “I love conquering people” to “I love stabbing people.” The nuance is saved for our protagonists. Without getting too deep into spoiler territory,** Paul walks a path that’s the polar opposite of the hero’s journey. The script does excellent work showing his hesitation, his struggle, and the decisions he makes. It also focuses on how others react to his potential Chosen Oneness. We see Jessica spreading tales about Paul’s godhood and slowly coming to believe it herself. Along with that are interesting questions raised about politics, fanaticism, and cultural appropriation. Instead of becoming annoyingly preachy, the characters wrestle with these complex issues, and that makes them fascinating. This is a prestige picture by Warner Brothers. Since no effort has been spared, the cast here is double-plus stacked. Everyone does strong work, but I have a life to live, so I’m not going to go into the eighteen dozen massive stars that appear in this film. Instead, let’s focus on three of them. As Stilgar, Javier Bardem plays a leader happy to cede his authority to Paul. He’ll be the rock upon which Paul builds his church, and he conducts himself with the serenity of a believer – or a fanatic. His opposite is Chani. Zendaya plays her as sensible, hard headed, exactly the wrong person to get involved in a burgeoning holy war. Their focus is Timothee Chalamet’s Paul, who has the charisma to be a leader of a movement and the intelligence to not screw it all up. We see him shift from a callow noble to a determined resistance fighter to a religious figure, and Chalamet allows us to see Paul’s struggle every step of the way. I wouldn’t count myself as a Dune superfan. I can’t recite the lore of the Bene Gesserit, tell you the average length of a sandworm, or explain why everyone in House Harkonnen is hairless. But as I said before, I get it now. Dune: Part Two is a singular vision painted on an enormous cinematic canvas. See it on the biggest screen you can."
"Mar 11, 2024",positive," Con la perspectiva que me da haber reposado 'Dune: Parte Dos' desde que la vi hace ya un par de semanas hasta el momento en el que estoy tecleando estas líneas, puedo afirmar sin caer en el exabrupto provocado por el calor del momento —que cantaban los Asia— que no sólo es el gran blockbuster que llegará a nuestras salas de cine este curso cinematográfico 2024; también se alza como el mayor espectáculo audiovisual en clave sci-fi que hayamos visto en mucho tiempo. Con su segunda aproximación al universo de Frank Herbert, Denis Villeneuve ha vuelto a moldear una apisonadora fílmica creada para ser vista en la pantalla más grande y escuchada a través del sistema de sonido más potente posible. Y es que el francocanadiense, aliado de nuevo con el genio de Greig Fraser —probablemente, uno de los 5 mejores directores de fotografía en activo, ha elevado la apuesta de 2021 a un nuevo nivel. Siguiendo las bases de su predecesora en términos de producción, y enriqueciendo con CGI de primerísimo nivel maquetas, efectos prácticos y unas localizaciones reales poco menos que sobrecogedoras, esta 'Parte Dos' cautiva a través de las retinas por igual en sus dosificados pasajes volcados en la acción y en sus fragmentos más tranquilos y contemplativos. Pero estamos frente a algo más que un envoltorio perfecto que, eso sí, adolece de un sorprendente mal. Del mismo modo que en lo que respecta a su factura y tratamiento técnicos, 'Dune 2' regresa a las claves narrativas de la original en cuanto a construcción de mundo y personajes se refiere para brindar un relato de ciencia ficción modélico, canónico e intensísimo. El particular juego de tronos galáctico entre Harkonnens, Atreides y demás piezas del tablero cumple su cometido de mantener al respetable pegado a la pantalla, alimentándolo con un acertado contraste entre épica desmedida y un tempo reposado. No obstante, si algo hace que lo último de Villeneuve no alcance la perfección es la duración de su metraje. Puede que esto suene disparatado tratándose de un largometraje que se extiende durante casi tres horas, pero la historia de Paul Atreides y su ascenso al poder pide a gritos, como mínimo, otros sesenta minutos que permitan a sus protagonistas y antagonistas apuntalar sus desarrollos, y a su fascinante mitología respirar en medio de un viaje vertiginoso hacia un clímax que se resuelve mucho más rápido de lo que debería. En cómputo global, y esto difiere mucho del desastroso montaje de 'Rebel Moon' y su nula capacidad de generar empatía, la cinta no tiene fallas que la impidan funcionar a nivel dramático; los personajes y sus conflictos quedan totalmente claros y evolucionan con coherencia, su progresión es evidente y lógica, y deja momentos y villanos nuevos para el recuerdo —mención especial para el Feyd Rautha de Austin Butler—. El problema es que la cadencia sosegada de la narrativa choca frontalmente con su celeridad argumental, dejándonos con la miel en los labios no sólo a la hora de conocer tanto al mencionado Rautha como al Emperador Shaddam IV o a su hija, la Princesa Irulan —por poner un par de ejemplos—, cuya presencia, determinante para la historia, termina reducida a lo simplemente anecdótico. También condensa su espectacular fin de fiesta en lo que vuelve a ser un coitus interruptus que poco tiene que ver con la necesidad de ver 'El mesías de Dune' trasladada a la gran pantalla."
"Mar 11, 2024",positive," Building on his excellent cinematic grammar of prophecy, Denis Villeneuve uses Dune: Part Two (2024), cowritten with Jon Spaihts, to examine the experience of being set before the prophecy, knowing you’re its intended subject. Not to take the whole messiah thing literally, but this narrative structure is famously hinted at in the Gospels. Jesus, good student that he was, knew the biblical prophets were most likely referring to someone of his genealogy and position. Jesus the Son of God was perfectly willing to fulfill the prophecy, but Jesus the son of Mary and Joseph ineluctably didn’t want to die. We see this in two brief episodes near his death: In the Garden of Gethsemane, he prays to God to shift the burden to someone else; and on the cross just before the moment of his death, he cries out to God, Job-like, asking why He has forsaken him. For obvious reasons, we don’t know much about that side of Jesus. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), good student that he is, knows the Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Haderach most likely refers to someone of his genealogy and position. Jessica the Bene Gesserit sister is perfectly willing, even a tad overeager, to fulfill the prophecy, but Jessica the mother of Paul ineluctably doesn’t want him to die, which he will if he fails to fulfill any single prophetic prediction. We saw this in Dune: Part One (2021) with the Gom Jabbar, and we see it here when he drinks the Water of Life, and when he fights Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). But unlike for Jesus, we know exactly what’s going on in Paul’s head. Just like Jesus, Paul has some supernatural abilities: the Voice by training (sound designed by Richard King and David Whitehead), clairvoyance by birth and spice. But he also knows that the prophecy was created not by God, but by Bene Gesserit manipulation, and that following it will lead to untold suffering—the suffering of others. He stands at a crossroads. At one point, Chani (Zendaya) says, “Decisions have been made for you,” but Paul can still choose differently, as many have noted, by simply foregoing revenge. The scene where he asks Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) what to do, and all three answers are to take the plunge, is thus unintentionally hilarious in how overdetermined it is. It’s also honest: Evil actualizes when he goes with the flow, and its momentum is unstoppable."
"Mar 10, 2024",positive,"The genius of the author, Herbert, and now the director, Villeneuve, is to weave all this complexity into an easily understood, and compelling story. It's been tried before, but this is the first time it has really worked."
"Mar 9, 2024",positive," Sure, we’re eight thousand years in the future, on planets far far away; Earth seems to have been all but forgotten. But our protagonist, Paul Atreides, is a young man with white skin, scion of a feudalistic, colonialistic lord, played by a white American actor of European extraction; the character is from a world that is distinctly Scottish-flavored. He inspires the Fremen — the oppressed indigenous, brown-skinned, Muslim-esque peoples of the desert *cough* Middle Eastern *cough* planet Arakis, and, as depicted here, more a collective mass than individual people — to rise up against their oppressors, the Harkonnens, who are other (literally) white-skinned feudalistic colonials. (Arakis is home to the “spice” that is required for interstellar navigation. The spice is this civilization’s oil. And unlike in our 20th/21st-century reality, the people sitting on the incredibly valuable, incredibly essential natural resource are not the ones who benefit from it. Dune is Lawrence of Arabia if good ol’ T.E. headed out there after WWII, when car culture started booming, instead of during WWI.) 
Whether the Prophecy [that helps install Paul in his white-savior role] is “real” or not is beside the point. White Western men, whether Herbert and Villeneuve, think it’s plausible that indigenous people would accept an outsider — who just happens to look more like a white Western man than he does like those indigenous people — as their salvation. Even if you want to take Dune as a critique of the idea of the white savior — and, again, there’s no hint of that in this movie — we can still question that critique being structured as it is.
 A far more potent critique of the white-savior narrative might center the Fremen, perhaps put someone like Zendaya’s Fremen warrior Chani in the protagonist role — why can’t she have a hero’s journey, rather than Paul? But that’s not the book that Herbert wrote, and if Villeneuve wants to adhere closely to the novel, Paul-as-savior is the story we are stuck with. (Dune is one of the biggest selling novels of all time — not just in the science-fiction genre, but of any stripe — with a devoted fanbase that would surely be cheesed off by too much divergence from the text. *sigh* Perhaps there will come a day when fanboys don’t rule. But it is not this day.) So now we have the back half of Villeneuve’s (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) adaptation of the first Dune novel. Does it offer any critique of the white-savior trope? I don’t see it. Paul is unquestionably a white savior. Most of the Fremen accept him as their savior. And while there is critique of cultural appropriation (more on that in a bit), it’s also arguably a problem that the primary Fremen characters here — Chani and Javier Bardem’s Stilgar — are not played by actors of MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) background. It’s not that Zendaya (Spider-Man: Homecoming) and Bardem (Everybody Knows, mother!) aren’t terrific; of course they are. And they look more the part than could have been the case. (There are white Westerners in these roles in David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation of the book, for instance.) But it’s a problem that a movie that purports to critique colonialism kinda looks like a good example of colonialism, even in the woke 2020s. That said, Paul is, appropriately, not a good guy in the eyes of anyone except, maybe, the Fremen. (This is in keeping with the books.) There are no genuine good guys here. (Maybe Chani could be considered such. She is at least clear-eyed about what is going on with Paul and the Fremen.) Dune: Part Two is a warning about demagoguery. About the use of religion as a tool to control the masses. This warning, as Villeneuve deploys it, is blatant, ridiculously over-the-top. But given the times we are living in, with populist fascism and fundamentalist religious bullshit springing up everywhere (and no, I’m not talking about anything Muslim), over-the-top feels like it might be necessary to get some thick-headed numbskulls to see it. Dune 2 is a genuinely terrifying movie, though it sneaks up on you, even if you are an openminded, politically aware soul already attuned to the horrific shit going down in our real 2020s world. Partly it’s terrifying because obviously so many people — including the artists making blockbuster movies — can see what’s happening to us all, and yet we seem to be collectively incapable of stopping it. Young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet: Don’t Look Up, Little Women), having survived the massacre of his House by House Harkonnen in the first movie, is now living among the Fremen in remote wastes of Arakis, trying to prove to them that he is more than a spoiled princeling and genuinely wants to promote their independence from galactic occupiers. (Why does he want this? Is it just revenge, justice for his father, Duke Leto? These questions are part of the thorniness that is Paul Atreides.) This means he has to contend with a prophecy that suggests that he may be the liberator long foretold who will release the Fremen from the shackles of those stealing the sweet spice from under their literal feet. Some of the Fremen, such as the older Stilgar, have fallen under Paul’s inadvertent spell. Others, including Chani and her young friends? Not so much. Villeneuve, who adapted Herbert’s book with screenwriter Jon Spaihts (Passengers, Doctor Strange), gives us a lot of truly lovely stuff as he depicts life among the Fremen. I found it beautiful how sand walking, the arhythmic movement that the Fremen use to avoid drawing the attention of the giant subterranean sandworms, looks like dancing, and how the patterns sand walking leaves in the sand looks like Arabic script. Fremen culture is much more elaborately depicted here than it was in the first film. (Which makes it much more frustrating that no Middle Eastern actors were cast in significant Fremen roles. The talent is there. C’mon.) We appreciate the immense tragedy when the Fremen culture is attacked again, in a renewed Harkonnen offensive to retake what they see as theirs. The political machinations are many here, and I don’t want to spoil them for those who haven’t read the book, which will be most of the movie’s viewers, because book bestsellership requires far smaller an audience than movie blockbustership. (The fantastic cast also features Christopher Walken [The Jungle Book, Eddie the Eagle] as the feckless emperor, and Léa Seydoux [No Time to Die, The Grand Budapest Hotel] as another Bene Gesserit wielding powers simultaneously awesome and pathetically prosaic; Josh Brolin [Avengers: Endgame, Deadpool 2] returns as Atreides soldier Gurney Halleck.) But this is very much a story about power as control, and about the politics that enable that control as religion. That Fremen prophecy foretelling the arrival of a liberator? Total fabrication of the Bene Gesserit religious order, from which women pull the galactic strings. They’ve been working on this for centuries. But even they, with their mystical powers and well-earned aura of menace, do not have the control they think they do. Dune 2 is ugly and outrageous and brutal and cynical, and it hits square in the social plexus of the horrifying real-world 2024 milieu in which we all exist… which slightly softens all the white-savior, cultural-appropriation stuff. This movie, while not perfect, has important shit to say, shit that must be heard. Again: Villeneuve’s hand with it all is an elegant sledgehammer, bashing us around the head about things we should already be able to see for ourselves but clearly can’t. Or won’t. It’s like this: As the cruel, sluglike* Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård: Borg vs McEnroe, Our Kind of Traitor) vies to regain his control of Arakis, he removes his Arakis lieutenantship from one nephew, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista: Knock at the Cabin, My Spy), and hands it to another, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler: Aliens in the Attic). When she hears of this, the emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh: Oppenheimer, Black Widow), is appalled: “But he’s psychotic,” she objects. And the first thing that sprang to mind for me was: But aren’t they all? Villeneuve’s depiction of the Harkonnen homeworld, Giedi Prime, will make your blood run cold. We meet Feyd-Rautha as his uncle grants him a gladiatorial battle in a brutalist stadium to prove his mettle before the populace — it’s fixed, of course; the other combatants are drugged — and it’s some real Leni Riefenstahl shit. Bad enough, but Giedi Prime basks in the sickening glow of a “black sun,” and cinematographer Greig Fraser shoots this not in a creamy, dreamy black-and-white but in a kind of infrared, which leaches color and is simply stomach-churningly wrong. The kind of wrong that screams: Human beings should not be living in this kind of natural environment, and no wonder the Harkonnens are such awful people. (Oh, and “black sun” is definitely a Nazi thing.) But it isn’t only the Harkonnens who are psychotic: Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson: Reminiscence, Doctor Sleep), by now aren’t much better. A Bene Gesserit priestess, she accepts the role of Reverend Mother among the Fremen, and she leans hard into the job; tattooing her face with Fremen symbols that represent the prophecy is the least of it. It’s more white-savior crap — why would the Fremen want an outsider as their spiritual leader? she doesn’t even understand their culture, has to be taught about it — but Villeneuve also leans hard into showing how deeply wrong what Jessica is doing is. In the first film, she seemed a sympathetic character, defying the Bene Gesserit leadership in the form of the calculating Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling: The Little Stranger, Red Sparrow) and throwing a spanner into their plan to manipulate the powerful men who rule the galaxy. (It’s complicated, but as part of the Bene Gesserit long game, she was supposed to have a daughter by Leto, not the son that Paul is; the sex of her child was under her control. Bene Gesserit workarounds for that come into play here.) Now, though? It seems that it wasn’t galactic fascism she objected to, merely the particular flavor of it that would have excluded Paul. With a path in sight to grab power for her son, she’s suddenly all for it. Are we, the audience, suddenly all for it as well? Dune 2 is a long movie, and it revels in that: it’s seductive; it sucks you in, gets you on Paul’s side, as in the sequence when he calls a sandworm to ride for the first time, to demonstrate his worthiness as a member of Fremen society. It is big, bold, grand mythmaking stuff. The film prompts us to cheer his success… and it’s tough not to. But I would like to think — and it’s not that much of a stretch, really — that Villeneuve is very desperately asking his audience to recognize the cognitive dissonance that many of us will come into this film with, and possibly leave with: Can we see that this young man whom we reflexively applaud is actually, you know, a tyrant in the making? And what do we do with that realization if we do come to it? Because one of the last images of Dune: Part Two is Paul rallying the Fremen for even bigger, bloodier battles to come (whether a presumed third film materializes or not), and while the visual details of it are quite different from the Nazi-esque rally on the Harkonnen homeworld — the colors are deceptively warm, for one — it is, at its root, exactly the same vile horror, about the power of personality and propaganda to move masses. Villeneuve is fucking with us in a way that I’m not sure mainstream audiences are ready to deal with. Because real “leaders” in the real world are pulling the same shit. The stakes are so very high. Are we up to the challenge? You are wrong.  Dune is not a savior narrative of any kind. Paul does not in fact save anyone from anything.  The reason you can’t see this, is the same as the ‘fanboys’ who only know how to say ‘woke’ as they have so embraced their own limitations and refuse to grow out of them.  You have such a strong and limited that to quote Paul: You see only what you want to see. He literally walks into a culture about which all he knows is what he’s read in a book and is acclaimed as their savior. And so far, so good. It’s not going to go well, but no one knows that yet. He is acclaimed as a savior by the Fremen BECAUSE Catholic’s have proselytized for Centuries to get poor people to wait for a savior to come.  Sound familiar????? In the process of turning dessert world Dune into a paradise – he destroys the dessert and the worms, damaging the ecology…. Again sound familiar. Dune is not a savior narrative.  It is a story of the Jihad Vs. the Crusades but set in space and it is a bitter critique of the hypocrisy of religion and the folly of messiah’s and heroes. I am reviewing THIS movie. I am not reviewing the books, and I am not reviewing whatever movie might come next, if any at all. However long it takes for these movies to get to making the points you are talking about, it isn’t there yet. And this movie exists in a history of Hollywood that has centered white people, and particularly white men, for far too long. That is also a context in which it must be understood. In the novels, Paul becomes more and more a “God Emperor” or “Dune Messiah.”
And after the first sequels, Herbert realizes that each new one gushes money and they become wispier and wispier as he pumps them out. Most of the people commenting on MaryAnn’s review were talking about the book instead of the movie, although you were presumably joking when you did it. Having read all the Dune books that Frank Herbert wrote (and none of the ones that his son and Kevin J. Anderson produced after his death), I have a hard time picturing Frank pumping out sequel after sequel because they gush money.  If I remember correctly, the Atreides are supposedly of Greek ancestry, so Mediterranean in origin (of course whether this is still relevant after more than 10000 years, is another question). Herbert famously said that Dune was intended as a warning against Messianic figures, so whether this defies your interpretation of Dune as a white-savior trope is something that I leave up to you.  It is Denis Villeneuve and his production team that picked the actor for Paul, so if anyone is to blame for the white savior it is them. I think Frank Herbert was just thinking in terms of “Led By The Outsider” as a trope, which is more generic that the “white-savior” trope. And while the Fremen can be seen as stand-ins for Middle-Eastern people, I don’t think that was Frank Herbert’s intention necessarily. By placing the story so far into the future he wanted the Fremen to be a people of nondescript ethnicity, a people uniquely shaped by Arrakis. I personally think that Paul is the villain of the story and not the hero, nor the white savior: After he drinks the Water of Life and achieves the ability to see future and past clearly (with the direction of the future being defined by the choices he has and will make), he consciously make the choice to pick the path to the future that leads to his and his mother’s (and unborn sister’s) survival, even if that means unleashing a religious war on the universe in which millions or even billions will die. And those people will both be on the Fremen and non-Fremen sides. BTW: Jessica, in the ceremony where she drinks the Water of Life, is gifted with the memory of the previous Reverend Mother that was part of the Fremen, who in turn acquired the memory of her predecessor. This way Jessica is immediately fully versed in the Fremen culture. Herbert famously said that Dune was intended as a warning against Messianic figures, so whether this defies your interpretation of Dune as a white-savior trope is something that I leave up to you. Authorial intent is just one part of the puzzle… and frankly, the least important one. Things can be present in stories that authors didn’t intend, and things they intended can be missing. But again, I am reviewing this movie, not the book. No, and a quick Google search doesn’t make me any wiser, apart from listing a number of “Ma and Pa Kettle go to …” movies from the 1950’s. Nothing about Arrakis though."
"Mar 9, 2024",positive," I see possible futures all at once, and in so many futures our enemies prevail, comments Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) while sounding like the Kwisatz Haderach. His Bene Gesserit mother, confidant, and best friend Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), pregnant with Paul’s psychic sister, waits for her son to fulfill his destiny while the sandworm-riding Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) see the young man as their Mahdi or savior. Like George Lucas and Ridley Scott, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve proves himself a visionary as Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. When teenage Villeneuve read Frank Herbert’s Dune for the first time 43 years ago, he was unaware of the implications of that moment. Only someone with such profound adoration for the 1965 novel could have delivered such an ambitious, masterful, and speculative adaptation of the sci-fi classic as Dune: Part Two. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts, forge their path as the duo loosen up for the second part of the saga. They bring a fresh perspective to the material by breaking away from the novel a few times, especially with the character of Chani played by Zendaya. It translates better for the screen while allowing the actress to shine by playing a multifaceted character with alternating emotions. She’s torn between her love for Paul and what she feels is blind faith exhibited by her people. They believe Paul renamed Maud’Dib after the smart Arrakis desert mouse, is their messiah. Chani, not so much. Zendaya is first-rate as the conflicted warrior who yells This prophecy is how they enslave us! while sending shivers to the audience. Dune: Part Two picks up where the first film left off. It moves at a faster pace, there is more action, greater special effects, and a fresh group of actors joining the cast including Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Anya Taylor-Joy, Souheila Yacoub, and the saga’s biggest surprise and best addition, Austin Butler as the villainous Feyd-Rautha. Gone is Butler’s Elvis accent (it took him a while to shake it) as the actor is transformed into the ambitious warrior nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Sting played the role in the 1984 version directed by David Lynch. Here, Butler is truly frightening. He moves like a tiger waiting for the right moment to pounce. The shaven head and pale complexion in contrast to the dark clothing give the actor the appearance of a cenobite forged from the mind of Clive Barker. The monochrome gladiator scene in the film stands out as Villeneuve removes the beauty of color and all visual distractions to focus on Butler’s first-rate performance. Timothée Chalamet’s portrayal as the film’s hero is better highlighted as the actor gets to take a deep dive into Paul who is torn in several directions before finally accepting his fate. The biblical overtones are omnipresent. I also enjoyed the performance by Rebecca Ferguson As Lady Jessica. Her tattooed face, incandescent eyes, and look of determination let the Swedish actress deliver a subtle performance that doesn’t require much dialogue to attain distinction. 2021’s Dune covered roughly 2/3 of Herbert’s novel setting up events for the climactic Part Two which shifts the balance in characters. Dave Bautista’s Glossu Rabban and Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother Mohiam are scaled back, while Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck comes in at the right moment to step up his role as the former House Atreides military leader proves to be Paul’s biggest supporter and friend. The VIP in the ensemble goes to Javier Bardem As Fremen Sietch Tab leader Stilgar. The Oscar-winning actor brings humor and bravado to the role. It’s a commanding performance on par with No Country for Old Men, Biutiful, and Being the Ricardos. The special effects are as expected, exhilarating and Hans Zimmer’s score which goes from haunting and ominous to a climax-building crescendo is majestic evoking a sense of awe especially when accompanied by Loire Cotler’s soul-stirring vocals. With Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and now Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s impact on science fiction is immeasurable. There are shades of his masterpiece Sicario throughout Dune: Part Two, from the way his camera follows the actors, to the overhead shots, and his use of the score to raise tension.

"Mar 9, 2024",positive,"Where it really comes into its own as a hugely satisfying Hollywood sci-fi epic is in the action-adventure material, which is also backloaded, so the very long film seems to keep getting bigger and richer as it goes along."
"Mar 9, 2024",positive," Faith and power clash at the core of Dune: Part Two. The film is the second of a trilogy adaptation of the beloved novels by Frank Herbert, a mystical tale of wars between noble families in the vastness of space and the rise of a messianic figure named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet).  This middle film picks up the story after a brutal massacre of Paul’s family line. Heir of a noble house and the subject of prophecies, Paul wrestles with his apparent destiny as savior and leader. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a clairvoyant priestess of the matriarchal religious order Bene Gesserit, tries to maneuver him toward that destiny. But his love, Chani (Zendaya), wants only a simple life together. Amid this relational drama, Paul leads a desert tribe in guerrilla warfare against brutal imperial forces who want to hoard his planet’s precious element called spice. Dune: Part Two is a lush adaptation of dense source material. It’s a busy 2 hours and 46 minutes, packed with plot and subplots and the constant threat of ravenous, man-eating sandworms. The space battles are an impressive mix of tension and spectacle, and the desert sand is almost its own character, functioning as both shield and weapon for the warriors Paul leads. Though combatants are armed with spacecraft and atomic weapons, many fights come down to hand-to-hand combat with swords, choreographed to be quick, powerful, and exciting. These elements make for a fun and engaging adaptation, with solid performances and beautiful cinematography. But Dune: Part Two owes its intellectual interest to Herbert’s books. Is faith merely another resource to be exploited in the quest for power? Is it another drug, like spice, that the powerful can claim, use, and abuse? Or is it real, tapping into a true well of knowledge and sustenance? The Dune series asks but doesn’t try to answer. A product of the early 1960s, Herbert’s work is deeply interested in the effects of psychedelic drugs. Spice is mildly psychedelic, opening minds to see visions and nightmares. Another substance, called the “Water of Life,” is deeply psychedelic, frequently fatal, and life-altering in its effects. The Dune stories treat these drugs as both beneficial and dangerous, a gift for those few strong enough to absorb and survive the visions they induce. That perspective feels like the product of a bygone era, strange to consider after six decades of change in our norms and laws around drug use. The book series’ take on drugs might have been provocative in 1965, but it feels dated and shallow in light of present conversations and concerns around drugs. Taking another cue from Herbert’s books, the movie’s universe is vaguely Islamic. The sand, the clothing, and even the language give it a Lawrence-of-Arabia-in-space feel. This is a Western interpretation, of course, not one originating from the Muslim world itself, and some elements, like the Bene Gesserit, are drawn more from Catholicism than anything in Islam. That kind of storytelling syncretism can be risky, but by taking elements of known faiths and throwing them into another world, Dune: Part Two raises sharp questions about religion and power. Just as in our world, there are many factions vying for control—even the factions have factions. Some are true believers, convinced that Paul Atreides is a messianic figure who will lead his people to paradise. Others, like Chani, believe in nothing but their own strength and swords. And while the believers are mocked for their ability to contort any event to become a “fulfillment” of prophecy, no one can deny the strength of their faith or the strength it gives them. Like the psychedelic spice, faith is powerful and difficult to control. The faithful become a force in themselves. That’s not to say faith always coincides with purity of heart. The Bene Gesserit priestesses, including Paul’s mother, both shape and exploit the faith of the masses. This second Dune film leaves open to interpretation whether the priestesses themselves believe what they teach or simply use it to gain power. They are both benevolent and sinister, unpredictable and ineffable. In some ways, they echo pagan gods in their selfishness and inscrutability: Their ends are their own, and the mere humans who cross them are easily sacrificed. Paul is different. He cares for the people. He eschews power—at least at first. Indeed, he fears his own power and its place in a faith he isn’t sure he shares, dreading his fundamentalist followers and the horrors they may embrace because of their belief in him. He can see the future, perhaps multiple possible futures, and his visions involve a devastating holy war waged in his name. This is repugnant to him—yet he is drawn inexorably into the fray. The parallels to Jesus are obvious and fascinating. Paul Atreides begins his journey seeming a lot like Christ: He is foretold, anticipated, believed in even before he is born. He cares for justice and peace. He is humble, loving, given to service. Like Jesus on the road to Calvary, Paul longs to avoid the dark future ahead of him.  But their paths diverge. Paul travels toward more earthly power, more control, more bloodshed. Jesus, of course, rejected that path, though his followers expected and encouraged it (Acts 1:6). He chose the cross. Paul Atreides does not. In some ways, Dune feels like an exploration of what might have been had Jesus told Peter to sharpen his sword instead of to sheathe it (Matt. 26:52–53). The lessons of Christianity are upside down in this universe: To gain your life, you do not lay it down—you take another’s life. The last do not become first. The least do not become greatest. In the end, the least are sacrificed. The meek inherit nothing. And yet here too, to gain the world, Paul Atreides must lose his soul."
"Mar 9, 2024",positive," These are uncertain times for big, ambitious science fiction films, but with the release of French Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve’s enveloping Dune: Part Two, the sandworm has turned. In bringing his thematically rich, visually stunning, formally bifurcated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 space opera to a finale, Villeneuve has solved a riddle that’s beguiled big-brain filmmakers from Alejandro Jodorowsky to Ridley Scott, to David Lynch, all of whom struggled to adapt Herbert’s doorstop of a novel. (Unlike the former two, Lynch actually did make his Dune, but that 1984 flop is a camp curiosity, and Lynch has disowned it, as have many devotees of Herbert’s book and its five sequels.) Villeneuve reportedly wants to a make a third entry adapting Herbert’s follow-up, Dune Messiah, but just the fact he got to finish this one feels miraculous given that its precursor, Part One, was one of the very pricey movies that Warner Bros. sent sent straight to the Streaming Service Formerly Known as HBO Max in 2021, concurrent with its theatrical release in the U.S. Urgent and compelling even to those who haven’t read or only vaguely recall Herbert’s dense far-future saga, Part Two runs a fleet 168 minutes, bringing the two halves’ combined run time to five hours, 23 minutes—none of them wasted! This latter part won’t prompt a reappraisal from anyone who complained that Part One was meandering or humorless, but this movie isn’t for them. It is largely humorless, save for a few sly line readings from Javier Bardem, and all the more absorbing for it. Bardem returns as a leader of the desert-dwelling Fremen of planet Arrakis, who are hunted by the brutal, colonizing, glabrous, and chalk-complected Harkonnen clan. The somber tone is actually a strength of the film—Villeneuve isn’t throwing in quips to try to make all this fantasy glib or palatable to civilians in the tiresome way so many superhero films of recent vintage have tried to do. Even Christopher Walken, in a handful of scenes as two-faced puppetmaster Emperor Shaddam IV, plays it straight. A world in which Game of Thrones becomes a spinoff-spawning hit is a world ready for a straight-arrow Dune, which is basically Game of Thrones meets The Godfather anyway, though the book predates both.  Anyway, that Bardem character, Stilgar, believes the prophecies claiming that Timothée Chalamet’s Byronesque Paul Atreides, who, with his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is among the last survivors of a clan sent to harvest Arrakis’ precious life-extending, consciousness-expanding substance “spice,” will become a savior to the Fremen. Younger generations of these desert dwellers—chief among them Zendaya’s Chani, whose romance with Paul adds melodramatic sweep to the movie’s abundant scope—dismiss these religious convictions as propaganda, as does Paul himself. (He’s also haunted by visions seeming to suggest he’ll become a despot—a troubling thing to learn about oneself.) Much of this ancient dogma, we learn, has been seeded over generations by the Bene Gesserit, a secretive sisterhood devoted to the enlightenment of the human species. But they play the long, long game, making their motives opaque if not sinister. (As a reminder, Paul’s own mom belongs to this intergalactic coven of maybe-good witches!) I don’t know why I’m indulging in the mortal critical sin of ladling on a plot summary here. Perhaps it’s to convince myself I actually understood a film I very much enjoyed. I think I got maybe 77 percent of it. Villeneuve (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts) is so adept at filling the frame with tension and mystery, and at slicing away the exposition Lynch left in, that you can just let the experience wash over you. Cinematographer Greig Fraser shot the movie in IMAX, and it warrants the maximalist format.  Like his fellow Canadian visionary James Cameron, Villeneuve upped his profile by making a superb sequel to a seminal, paradigm-shifting Ridley Scott classic—Aliens in Cameron’s case, Blade Runner 2049 in Villeneuve’s. But where Cameron has chosen to spend his remaining creative years on planet Pandora, manufacturing worlds out of whole digital cloth, Villeneuve is still shooting his movies in real places. Arrakis is played (mostly) by Jordan and Abu Dhabi, and that tactile mise-en-scene yields visceral dividends. You might actually feel the sand between your toes. Lady Jessica and Paul both spend parts of Part Two in conversation with the unborn child growing inside of Jessica—a being Villeneuve actually shows floating in the womb like the Star Child at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. “This world is beyond cruelty,” her big brother tells her. Why wait until she’s actually born to let her in on what a sandy bummer it all is? Taken in tandem, Villeneuve’s grand, enveloping Dune splits the difference between Stanley Kubrick’s chilly exploration of human evolution and the pulpy Star Wars flicks that George Lucas fashioned out of Herbert’s novels, Akira Kurosawa movies, and ’60s Marvel Comics. Butler, playing the sociopathic young nephew of corpulent Harkonnen in Chief Stellan Skarsgård, exhibits a heretofore unseen range, affecting an uncanny impression of the Swedish actor’s voice. For a guy who got famous playing the King, he makes a pretty good prince. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Mar 9, 2024",positive," Fanaticism is a closed circle, maddening because it’s impregnable, maddening because it destroys everything in the process of building itself. It’s a riddle without a solution, and once you’ve drunk deep the plasma spring, it’s a long way back–if you ever get there. There are people who “deprogram” cult members, but I don’t buy it, you guys. I’m of the belief that when you’re gone, you’re gone. You went by choice, after all. You denied your ears the beeswax but didn’t tie yourself to the mast. My mom bought into a cult for the last several years of her life. She held on to it tightly, and it gripped her right back. I suppose that’s one of the appealing things about cults: when you find the right one, you join the company of a great many people who agree with you. If you’re broken in some way, if your awareness of that has made you lonesome and alone, that must feel good. I take a little bit of the blame for her susceptibility to such things. I was a terrible son to her. Maybe she needed something to hold that would hold her back; I did, too. I found it in a wonderful wife and kids. She found it, some of it, in a cult that finally accepted her. I don’t know if I believe that. I don’t know what I believe. Maybe this is just narcissism–mine or hers, I don’t know either. But she’s dead now, and I’m the only one left to wonder about what happened between us. Throughout the entire extended running time of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Part Two, messianic rebel and Lawrence of Arabia orientalist leader Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) refuses to court the support of millions of “southern fundamentalist” fighters because he knows that once he does, he will become the colonialist monster his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), has hoped he will be. She’s part of a cult, you see, the Bene Gesserit, which has spread a story about the coming of a white god to the brown lands and brown people that has taken hold in the brutal southern hemisphere of a planet, Arrakis, treasured and vied over for its natural resources. The allegory, proximate and ultimate, isn’t subtle. Paul falls in love with an indigenous fighter, Chani (Zendaya), learns the language and the ways, and is given a name by his chief advocate, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), both secret (“Usul,” meaning the foundation of a column in the film’s made-up language) and known (“Muad’dib,” after a small desert mouse that is resourceful enough to survive the harshest elements). No matter what Paul does to try to convince Stilgar he is a man and not the Quetzalcoatl to Stilgar’s Montezuma, it’s more evidence in Stilgar’s mind that Paul is, in fact, the fulfillment of an implanted colonial prophecy designed to control his people and the resource–a psychotropic spice called “melange” that allows for instant space-travel in this universe–unique to his planet. That’s the nature of fanaticism, cults, religions: whatever evidence you provide to disprove it becomes proof of it. It is a closed, peristaltic circle. Ouroboros, the worm devouring itself. I think sometimes not about how the worm eats but how it is never sated. The worm is insatiable. Dune Part Two isn’t perfect. I’m not convinced by either of its young leads beyond that they look the part; I’m not convinced that one is the leader of men, and I’m not convinced the other has the depth and mystery to win his heart. Maybe I’ve aged out of being able to see these qualities in the very young. More fatally, in the pursuit of clarity, I’m not convinced the picture doesn’t fall over too often into oversimplification. But the overall effect–landing as the movie does while Gaza is martyred to the genocidal impulses of a Zionist colonization machine allied with an international cabal of white nationalists (note how fish-belly pale the villainous, 1930s-Berlin leather-daddy Harkonnen are, and how in this one, Paul says, “We are all Harkonnen,” and laughs a bitter kind of laughter)–is devastating. I wonder if the film doesn’t actually work better because its hero is swallowed whole by the monstrousness of his position. It is an epically-scaled tentpole from a major studio spending millions of dollars to tell the story of a messianic leader with vengeance on his lips who pulls his power from fundamentalists manipulated by his mother’s cult to bring about genocide, famine, death, and war. Plague? That, too, it’s suggested, via a series of visions Paul endures showing a man in his death throes as his mother glides past, beautiful and pure and not, as she is in the bulk of the film, a filthy Lady Macbeth hunched in secret war council with her unborn child, speaking to her in unsettling intravenous close-ups from inside her womb. Dune Part Two is almost more the companion piece to Alex Garland’s upcoming Civil War than its own first part–both films landing in the first third of 2024 like diving bells made brittle in the oceans of our fear and self-loathing this election year. How could we have painted ourselves into this humiliating moral corner? There’s no moral “out” left for us, not anymore, you mad fucking idiots. Best possible choice? The lesser of two evils? We don’t have choice. There isn’t a lesser evil. The worm is overfed and still insatiable."
"Mar 8, 2024",positive," 
In the wake of the superhero boom, it takes a lot to persuade me to see a big-budget epic in which the protagonist strolls away from explosions. But I read Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic Dune at a tender age and saw the David Lynch version on its 1984 release, so I couldn't stay away from the 2021 adaptation of the novel's first half by Québécois director Denis Villeneuve — or its sequel. Anyway, Dune: Part One ended on a cliff-hanger, so here we are.
 
Previously on Dune: It's the far future, but people still duel with swords. Everybody wants to control the planet Arrakis, source of the psychotropic substance called spice, which makes interstellar travel possible. The emperor (Christopher Walken) orders the Atreides family to take charge of the planet, only to double-cross them in concert with their enemy, the loathsome Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). With the head of the family dead, teenage heir Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mom, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), escape into the desert and find refuge with the Indigenous Fremen.
 
In the second film, our protagonists learn to survive in a hostile landscape inhabited by mammoth, hungry sandworms. Leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes in a prophecy that Paul will lead the Fremen to paradise, not knowing that said prophecy was seeded on Arrakis by the Bene Gesserit, the esoteric religious (and somewhat superpowered) order to which Jessica belongs. Stilgar strong-arms Jessica into drinking a brain-opening substance called the ""water of life"" and becoming the tribe's spiritual leader. Young warrior Chani (Zendaya) doesn't trust the outsiders who have always exploited her world, but Paul wins her over with boyish charm and humility.
 
Paul and the Fremen engage in guerrilla warfare against the ruling Harkonnens, causing shake-ups off-planet, where the emperor, the baron, the Bene Gesserit and others play high-stakes games of court politics. Everything is headed toward a showdown. But will Paul really lead the Fremen to paradise or only use them to start a bloody galactic revenge crusade?
 
As sword-wielding epics go, Dune is less like Star Wars than ""Game of Thrones."" There are bad guys — the Harkonnens are almost comically evil, portrayed here with liberal use of Nazi imagery — but there aren't many good guys. Or good girls, for that matter. Everybody who isn't bloodthirstily fighting is ruthlessly scheming, from the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) to the emperor's demure daughter (Florence Pugh). Even Paul, our supposed hero, struggles with a will to power that pushes him inexorably toward violent ends.
 
While the screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts takes great pains to lay out Paul's internal conflict, his character never comes fully to life on-screen. He's weighed down by enormous symbolic baggage, making this a thankless role to play. Herbert's stiff dialogue defeated Kyle MacLachlan in 1984, and Chalamet doesn't have much better luck with it. He comes off as more callow than committed to the role's solemnity, as if he might be tempted to break character and start giggling (and you can't always blame him).
 
The film's real center of gravity is its spectacle, the craft with which Villeneuve and his crew depict Herbert's stupendously complex worlds. The desert landscape of Arrakis has a delicacy and viscerality that recall the days of George Lucas' Tatooine. In aerial shots, it has a sculpted beauty; up close, the sand flying in our faces feels convincing. The sequence in which Paul first rides a sandworm is harrowing and exhilarating; regardless of how much CGI went into it, the stunt looks genuinely hard. The scene is dreamlike and fantastical, but it doesn't have the frustrating weightlessness of so many superhero films.
 
The dream becomes a nightmare in equally visually thrilling scenes set on Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. We meet the sociopathic counterpart to Paul, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), in a gladiatorial arena straight out of Spartacus. The whole world is captured in an eerie, airless black and white that suggests an '80s music video circle of hell, where people wear a lot of vinyl and chains — and kill for fun.
 
With alternatives like these, it's not hard to sympathize with the Fremen, even as they transform from scrappy survivors into fanatics. By the film's climax, both Paul and Jessica have been infected with galaxy brain — a phenomenon Herbert seems to have foreseen — and the audience may be worn out. A strategic change to the book's ending, however, promises juicy conflict to come.
 
Dune is a heady brew, but its overweening ambition and weirdness are antidotes to the four-quadrant calculation of so many modern blockbusters. I'll be back for more.
 
Dune (1984; Max, rentable): Lynch's compressed adaptation of the novel is lacking in many ways. But its steampunk-meets-punk-rock aesthetic clearly influenced Villeneuve's version, and as I watched Part Two, I found myself remembering moments in the earlier film that deserve to be called iconic. You can't beat Sting as Feyd-Rautha.
 
Arrival (2016; Paramount+, Peacock, Showtime, rentable): I'm a fan of Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, but this moody, thoughtful adaptation of a Ted Chiang story about extraterrestrial communication is still my favorite Villeneuve movie.

"Mar 8, 2024",positive,It's impressive filmmaking.
"Mar 8, 2024",positive," Director/writer Denis Villeneuve knows how to make a throw-down sci-fi epic. He proved that with his captivating production Dune (2021), which won six 2022 Oscars® for cinematography, production design, visual effects, sound, editing and score. As audiences contemplate this sequel, they’ll expect the visuals, sounds and pacing to be near perfect. But what about the storyline (script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts), will it be profound?  And how will he treat that heady mix of pageantry and action. Will he reach higher than before? For the first hour, that’s in doubt. Depth and exhilaration are missing. Trying to figure out who is who, who hates who and why the factions are so pissed off is a chore. But there’s a big payoff. Wait for it.  Sometime in the far future, after a climate disaster, water is scarce and sacred. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, Wonka), the son of a murdered duke, and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning) duck and hide among the sand dunes on the remote planet Arrakis. They’re being shepherded by a group of indigenous rebel fighters, the Fremen, led by the warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men). Meanwhile, Paul has a budding relationship with one of the tribe’s members, Chani (Zendaya, Spider-Man: No Way Home). They have love in their eyes, but she also has trust issues with the ambitious interloper.  At the one-hour mark, the protagonists, their idiosyncrasies and relationships are established. The Fremen’s suspicions of Paul wane, and he takes on an entirely different role in their hierarchy. Even more important, the brutality of the Harkonnen evolves. Viewers are taken to their netherworld. Away from the earth tones of Arrakis, to the stark black and white images of a futuristic land run by the venomously evil and very plump Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, Mamma Mia!). The ruthless Emperor badgers his chief lieutenant Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) to stop the Fremen from ruining his extraction of spice. Standing in the wings is the Baron’s scheming nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, Elvis), a heartless and conniving fiend who is so white, he looks like he doesn’t have blood in his veins. When the audience gets an extended view of the enemy, and its scheming palace intrigue, finally the clash between good and evil becomes fever pitch. The stakes in conflicts are clear. Action sequences intensify with arena fights, war combat and killings. On screen for all to view are impeccably choregraphed stunts and battle scenes. Enough to make any sci-fi head, with a lust for movement and mayhem, salivate.  All those important themes are side issues, subplots, background details. At the heart of the script are human feelings, impulses and passion. Young people in love. Family intrigue. Cunning Reverend Mothers. Good people fighting evildoers. Greed. Vengeance. Jealousy. Power grabs. Deep-seated animal instincts. Complex behaviors.  Villeneuve is a master at creating and controlling this futuristic world. Great tastes. A great sense of drama, passion and motion. This is adventure filmmaking at a very high level. Engaging, breathtaking, ambitious and filled with grandeur. It’s like he’s reaching for the sky.  In her interpretation of the courageous Chani, Zendaya finds the conflicting emotions and altruistic motivation that guide her. Baron is evil incarnate because Skarsgård makes him so. And it’s hard to believe that the blanched white evil nephew with the glistening bald head is Austin Butler. From the movie Elvis! What a 180-degree turn. If the devil was a man, this is what he’d look and act like. Butler masterfully creates this trickery, aided by the voodoo magic of a top-notch makeup department. "
"Mar 8, 2024",positive,"Whether you think you're interested in a sci-fi or not, this is a powerful and quite beautiful reminder of what a stunning medium cinema can still be, when enough ambition, intelligence, artistry – and money – all come together in the same place. Bravo."
"Mar 8, 2024",neutral," There is much to discuss about Part Two of Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” adaptation, including a deep dive on “worm juice” in spoiler talk. Plus, Rd. 2 matchups in ‘50s Madness. "
"Mar 8, 2024",positive," Dune: Part One was my favourite film of 2021. I was captivated by its visuals, its scope, its scale and the depth of its story. As someone who has not read Frank Herbert's seminal novel, I was not sure what to expect but the results blew me away. Now, three years later is the follow-up, or more succinctly, Part Two of the story. Director Denis Villeneuve has over the last few years firmly established himself as Hollywood's premier visual director delivering epic sci-fi films such as the aforementioned Dune, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival, and Dune: Part Two continues this trend with a grandeur that is nothing short of breathtaking. Somehow, Part Two manages to up the ante in every aspect, including performances, to deliver an unforgettable experience. In all honesty, I did not watch Dune: Part Two, I experienced it. From the beautiful majesty of its visuals to the awe-inspiring sound design and the fantastic production design, this film was an absolute joy to behold. The story this time around focuses on larger and deeper thematic strands, continuing the story of Part One and taking it to new and exciting (and also dark) places as we continue following our lead Paul Atreides, played with confident steel by Timothée Chalamet. The full, star-studded cast has a part to play and they play it with such enthusiasm and confidence, especially Zendaya as the warrior Chani, who is given far more to do this time around, and Austin Butler in an unrecognisable and memorable turn as the villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Though Villeneuve is absolutely a visual director, there are plenty of smaller character moments that pay off handsomely by the end of the movie. Though it could be argued that the final twenty minutes of the movie were rushed, and I can't disagree, the finale felt like a more than satisfying conclusion to this movie story and a tantalising follow-up to the next film in the saga, Dune Messiah. Without spoiling anything in this film, the messiah aspect of the third instalment will be key as Part Two deals with a messianic revolution bumping up against more grounded (see: less religious) principles and ideas, and the ramifications of every related decision which will prove significant going forward. Dune: Part Two is a thrilling, exciting, heavy, and intelligent science fiction film that should be celebrated for years to come. It will be hard for any other film this year to top the majesty, scale, and epicness of Dune: Part Two, and, yes, this could potentially become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made if Dune Messiah sticks its landing. Time will tell, but whatever the outcome, Dune: Part Two is a film that deserves to be remembered and lauded. Blumhouse's terrible recent output has included Night Swim and Five Nights at Freddy's (and many would happily include The Exorcist: Believer into the mix), and, cutting to the chase, Imaginary can be added to the list. In fact, Imaginary tops the list of Blumhouse's failures as this is simply a dreadful film. Imaginary is the type of bland, banal, uninspired and lazy horror film that is becoming common in the genre as a way of gaining a quick buck for minor output - but this could be a new low. How this received a 15 rating in the UK from the BBFC is beyond me as nothing happens. Literally. Chauncey - the bear in the marketing - does nothing, one person dies off-screen, and there are a few hokey jumpscares, but, other than that, it's a poorly acted slog about a new family wading through generic drama as Alice (Braun), the weird young kid, bonds and speaks to a teddy bear for about an hour. It then becomes a cheap-looking attempt to capture the magic of older, better horror flicks with a crazed, abysmal Betty Buckley gurning and shouting for the camera. In an attempt to...get Chauncey the bear over (?), they namecheck him so many times that it becomes a parody and they provide him with a warped version of Alice's voice which was nothing short of hilarious (a mid-movie therapy session provided a good belly laugh due to this). I felt for DeWanda Wise here as she tries, she really tries, to sell what she is asked to do and she is a likeable presence in the film as the stepmother who just wants to bond with her new family, but nothing is saving this. Not even Tom Payne's middle-class English rockstar (who plays the world's most oblivious father before he departs the entire movie to go on tour) adds anything. How this narrative ended the way it did is mind-boggling - who in their right mind would conjure this up and look proudly at it, smiling like a new parent, and declare it fit for humans to endure? Hopefully, Blumhouse can get back on track this year, though their next scheduled release is a remake of the excellent Speak No Evil so who knows what they'll do with that? Imaginary may work as a gateway horror, but even then it could traumatise people who then move on to stronger horror like Madame Web. There is nothing redeemable about this, and it's one of the worst horror films I've seen in years. I'm left imagining the utopia I lived in before seeing Imaginary, as it was an infinitely better time. Move over Valek, there’s a new nun in town. Sydney Sweeney’s Sister Cecilia is the latest ass-kicking agent of God ready to throw down with the worst that Hell can offer. Actually, no she isn’t. Michael Mohan’s Immaculate is a religious horror that is not in keeping with recent offerings, such as The Nun films and Prey for the Devil, in that our lead is not fighting demons or the possessed.  Instead, she is dealing with a miracle - an immaculate conception - following her transfer from her closed parish in the States to a secluded convent in picturesque Italy -and as the story progresses, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems in the sprawling, echo-filled convent lit mainly by candles and atmosphere. Immaculate is a solid slow-burn horror until it takes a turn in the final fifteen minutes where it leans fully into its gonzo nature, channelling the New French Extremity subgenre of years past and delivering a finale that feels bolder than most in recent years. Sydney Sweeney continues her recent dabbling in different genres and delivers a strong overall performance despite an admittedly rocky opening act, leading to an all-in virtuoso final one-take sequence. It should be said that, narratively, Immaculate isn’t necessarily providing anything original, however, its dedication to atmosphere, scares and impressive gore keeps this entertaining for the entirety of its brisk runtime. That was my main takeaway from the film, for a story dealing with heavy subjects and imagery, I found myself simply enjoying what I was watching. The filmmakers were able to move between moods deftly and I never felt an imbalance in tone - though I do believe an extra ten minutes (or so) in the final third would have eased its slightly frantic feel, or maybe the chaotic nature was just what the film needed to end on. Either way, Immaculate was an unexpected curveball given the major recent genre and subgenre outputs. Effectively crafted with an unnerving score from Will Bates, it felt bold at times, and patient at others leading to its gonzo finale. Sweeney is impressive here, and, though it may not be perfect, it was nuntheless a lot of fun - surprisingly, too. For the majority of my life, bustin’ has made me feel good. Great, in fact. I’ve been a fan of Ghostbusters since I was a kid way back when, and it has been so good to see the franchise back on the big screen again following 2016’s Answer the Call and 2021’s wonderful Afterlife. While 1984’s original classic was a snarky satire on small businesses and the supernatural horror genre, that hasn’t stopped Sony from expanding on its humble roots. Now, in 2024, we have Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Directed by Gil Kenan, this is the first film in the main continuity not directed by a Reitman - though Jason remains on board as a writer - and finds the whole gang from Afterlife, OGs included, back in New York City to bust a chilly ancient villain, Garakka, who is hellbent on claiming the city (and the world) as his frozen empire. The trailers promised something bigger than before and Frozen Empire is certainly bigger, but unfortunately, it is not better. It is absolutely an enjoyable romp, but one that is overstuffed and a world away from 1984’s original in terms of tone, vibe, and attempts at a grounded feel (yes, ghosts, walking statues and marshmallow men exist, hear me out). Where that film, and Ghostbusters II, succeeded was in keeping things focused on our crew, the schlubs who were just like us, but everyone involved worked with the tools they had - Frozen Empire takes wild detours that explicitly bring the supernatural to the human characters, and it is to the detriment of the story. The story itself is bursting at the seams from the beginning, with too many characters and too much happening. There are new villains, old characters, a focus on Phoebe's emotional arc, a new ghost-busting laboratory, and much more. As a result of trying to give every member of the cast something to work with, no character has a chance to stand out fully, and the story suffers. The characters and performances are all fine enough, Grace is again very good as Phoebe - though her main subplot (featuring a solid Lind) was horribly disappointing - and Rudd, Aykroyd, and Nanjiani provide strong supporting performances but the sheer volume of characters means no one has a chance to stand out fully. Murray, Oswalt, Hudson, Kim, Coon - all get fun moments but it becomes a mess by the time the big Marvel-esque showdown arrives complete with a fully CGI villain. Gozer and Vigo worked so well because they were played by actors on set, they felt authentic, but here the fear factor was lost despite Garakka’s great visual look. Now, there were plenty of great gags and quips throughout - Murray and Nanjiani were having a blast - alongside some fun scenes of bustin’ ghosts (including some cool new ghosts) and smaller character moments, so Frozen Empire isn’t a flop or a write-off. Far from it, it is very watchable and enjoyable but it is unfocused. The franchise seems geared firmly towards families now as its key demographic, which is fine as my daughter loved it, and this felt like the true start of passing the torch along. The supernatural horror parody is gone, and the snarky satire of politics and upstart business is gone, replaced by a direction that feels more blockbuster-focused. Kenan and co. aimed for something different, a risk which should be commended, but it didn’t entirely work leaving Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire as a fun but highly flawed effort."
"Mar 8, 2024",negative," When Dune: Part Two (2024) opens with the commandment “Power over Spice is power over all”, for one brief moment, there is an unexpected synergy between Dune creator and science-fiction legend Frank Herbert, writer-director Denis Villeneuve, and the Indian grandmama who is the custodian of heirloom masala recipes. After all, if there is anyone who will agree about the importance of spice, it is she who has mastered Indian cuisine and knows how food can be used to nudge others to do your bidding (which is precisely the point of The Voice in the Dune universe). Ironically what Dune: Part Two goes on to falter at are two things that stereotypically grandmothers (particularly desi ones) have been excellent at: Storytelling and adding drama to any situation. The sequel to Dune: Part One (2021) mostly follows Herbert’s recipe — there are only a few deliberate and significant changes — to serve us a dish that is grand, lavish and made with the finest ingredients, but is just a little bland. (Ok fine, no more food or cooking metaphors. Grandmama, exit left.) Dune: Part Two begins strongly, trusting the audience to remember where the first film ended and taking us into the desert planet Arrakis which is once again under House Harkonnen since the fall of House Atreides.  Much like at the start of Dune: Part One, this time too the Harkonnen spice-mining mission is plagued by guerrilla attacks carried out by the indigenous Fremen of Arrakis. Only now, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his pregnant mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are with the Fremen, strengthening their ranks. Some Fremen, like the endearing Stilgar (Javier Bardem), believe Paul is their messiah. Others, like Chani (Zendaya), acknowledge Paul is a gifted warrior, but the idea of him being a creature of prophecy is something Chani chafes against. She dreams of Fremen being led by one of their own rather than an outsider. For Paul, the idea of being the Kwisatz Haderach — a super-being born as a result of the careful breeding programmes carried out by the religious order of the Bene Gesserit — also feels uncomfortable. Yet the boy who told his father he didn’t want the burden of being the future of House Atreides in Dune: Part One now wrestles with a harder, more mature desire for revenge. To be able to command an army of hardy Fremen is a temptation that’s hard to resist when you want to take on an emperor (even if that emperor is a rather lost-looking Christopher Walken). Meanwhile, growing inside Jessica is a sinister, magical baby girl who talks to Jessica and is actively plotting Paul’s ascent to power.  None of this should feel boring, especially when it’s being brought to life by a director as gifted as Villeneuve and a cast that has the luxury of squandering talented actors like Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux in minor roles. To Villeneuve’s credit, there are strands of Dune: Part Two that are fascinating, like Jessica’s conversations with her unborn daughter. Fans of the books will perhaps miss the chance to see the “Abomination” — we do get a glimpse of Ana Taylor Joy as Alia. However, she doesn’t get any real action in this film — but Ferguson is magnificent as the manic and determined Reverend Mother, especially when she has whispered conversations with the foetus whose ancestral memories are sparked into being after Jessica drinks the magical (and poisonous) Water of Life. Zendaya as the proud and stubbornly rational Chani is also a joy to watch in a role that has been considerably expanded by Villeneuve’s screenplay. The way she grapples with her love for Paul and the politics she believes in, makes Chani all the more charismatic. Unfortunately, Zendaya and Ferguson are only supporting characters in this saga. The burden of this epic rests on Paul and the spectacles that Villeneuve conjures as he realises Herbert’s imaginings onto the big screen. In visual terms, the imagery of Dune: Part Two is often stunning, but it doesn’t feel as impactful as what cinematographer Greig Fraser and the special effects team were able to achieve in the first film. Chalamet, though luminous in moments, doesn’t consistently seem up to the challenge of helming this space opera. Part of the problem is that there are no credible stumbling blocks on Paul’s path to greatness. It’s too obvious that Paul is the story’s overarching hero and in an effort to make a credible messianic leader out of the slight and baby-faced Chalamet, all the challenges that Paul faces are rendered toothless. There’s never any doubt that the Fremen who are initially sceptical about Paul will become fans or that Paul is going to win every duel. Even when all the Great Houses come to vanquish him and the Emperor himself shows up, the climax feels like an obvious setup to showcase Paul’s awesomeness. Obstacles are tackled easily, challenges take little effort to neutralise, and nothing feels powerful enough to truly challenge Paul. Villeneuve throws gigantic sandworms at us, takes us to the Harkonnen’s monochrome planet, brings in visions of a terrible war, and has Chalamet and Zendaya canoodle, but it’s not enough to make Dune: Part Two feel gripping. Considering Villeneuve’s love for complex and unnerving subjects, it’s ironic that Dune: Part Two feels like a straightforward story about a hero coming into his own, rather than a saga of entangled ambitions and thwarted stratagems. It’s tempting to wonder how much more interesting Dune: Part Two would have felt if Villeneuve had let Bene Gesserit hold on to its air of matriarchal menace and the film had spent more time exploring the possibilities hinted at when the Bene Gesserit disclose Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is part of the order’s elaborate breeding plan. Despite Butler’s billing, Villeneuve doesn’t let Feyd-Rautha grow into a credible threat and even though there are obvious parallels between Feyd-Rautha and Paul, the film isn’t able to establish a strong enough connection between the two characters. A contest between Chalamet and Butler could have been a mesmerising watch, but even though there are scenes that allow Butler to play a flamboyant villain and Chalamet to present himself as a ruthless man, neither actor is able to make enough of an impact. In the books, we’re told that the religious order’s original plan was that the Kwisatz Haderach would manifest in the child born to an Atreides daughter, fathered by none other than Feyd-Rautha. (Jessica’s decision to have a son and train him in the Bene Gesserit ways disrupts these plans, as we were told in Dune: Part One.) Paul and Feyd-Rautha’s duel is a contest between two possible futures, two men who are simultaneously drawn to and repelled by one another. None of this comes through in Dune: Part Two, which presents Feyd-Rautha only as the Bene Gesserit’s back-up plan if Paul doesn’t step up to the role they’ve assigned to him. When the two finally come face to face, the most dramatic part of Paul and Feyd-Rautha’s fight is the bald pate versus an enviable head of curls. Sinister, hairless and eyebrow-less, Butler flares quivering nostrils and grits his impressive jaw to impress upon us how much he’s acting, but like Chalamet’s attempts at roaring, the effect is limited. "
"Mar 7, 2024",positive," The second part of director Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's landmark sci-fi novel is simply awe-inspiring. It begins with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), hiding out in the desert of Arrakis. The spice-rich planet is coveted by their vicious Harkonnen enemies and Christopher Walken's scheming galactic Emperor. The story follows Paul's odyssey from guerrilla fighter to a reluctant messiah plagued by dreams of a destiny that could ignite a holy war. Once again, Chalamet impresses. He shares affecting romantic scenes with warrior Chani (Zendaya), and convinces as a steely leader ready to wreak vengeance on Stellan Skarsgard's brutal Baron. Fresh faces in the cast include Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux, plus Austin Butler as a formidable new adversary, who's introduced in a mesmerising monochrome sequence. As with the Oscar-winning first instalment, Villeneuve shows mastery of scale and scope, with stunning cinematography and a thumping score from Hans Zimmer. There are also excellent special effects and stirring action, not least Paul wrangling an enormous sandworm in a breathtaking rush through the dunes."
"Mar 7, 2024",positive," Dune: Part One completely blew me away in 2021. I loved every second of it. As a fan of the wider book series, I was left awestruck by how director Denis Villeneuve brought the hostile yet beautiful world of Arrakis to life, and how deftly he handled the complex and generation-spanning story.  But Dune also left me with a lot of fear. Yes, I know, fear is the mind-killer--however it was justified. The second half of Frank Herbert's original 1965 novel is where things really kick into overdrive. Paul Atreides buries himself in the sandy world of the Fremen and quickly ascends to become their messiah, well and truly kicking off the fight for Dune.

Not only that, but Limitless members also get access to screenings for unreleased movies as well as 10% off food and drink! Picking up from the instant its predecessor left off, Dune: Part Two brings viewers back into the shoes of Paul (played by Timothée Chalamet) shortly after he defeated Jamis in a fight to the death.  Over the ensuing 2 hours 20 minutes (or thereabouts), viewers are welcomed - like Paul - into the world of the Fremen. How they live, how they survive, and what living on Arrakis really means to them. Along this journey, Paul's position as the Kwisatz Haderach, the Lisan al Gaib (a messianic figure with the gift of foresight and limited prescience) becomes better known in the wider community. Religious fanatics fight for him, while non-believers shun his existence. Throughout this plot thread, Chalamet delivers a perfect rendition of a boy with - quite literally - the fate of the entire galaxy on his shoulders. he is constantly tortured by the acts of hatred and prejudice being carried out on his people, the Fremen, while also being overcome with the terror of the impending holy crusade those same people will carry out in his name. Chalamet was glorious in Dune: Part One - but he left the movie and carried out the work all franchise actors ought to. He thought about his character's arc and changed his performance in Part Two as a result. Everything he does has more weight, more angst, more dedication; watching him is a joy. Chalamet is magnetic as Paul, and I cannot wait to see his story continue to unfold in Dune: Messiah. Beside Paul along this excruciating journey is Chani, his lover and confidant, played by Zendaya. The Spider-Man star was marketed as a major part of Dune: Part One, but ultimately ended up as the focus of various flashbacks, flashforwards, and a lot of tension-building. With an Odeon Limitless membership, you can watch every film as often as you like for a flat monthly fee. Not only that, but Limitless members also get access to screenings for unreleased movies as well as 10% off food and drink! In Dune: Part Two, she is a major part of the story - and the film is all the better for it. During the picture, Chani witnesses the rise of this new messiah firsthand, and as it snowballs out of control, her fear is palpable. She stoically, heavily, and with visible pain tells Paul how dangerous his path is, and how he ought to stray from it - but it seems his fate has already been set in stone. Zendaya does a beautiful job of demonstrating Chani's battle between her head and heart across the picture.  As a result, Zendaya delivers a powerful performance; a bout of simmering anger, desperation, and forlorn hope as the man she loves struggles with things she can't fully comprehend. This is easily Zendaya's best on-screen performance to date, and her future in the series will no doubt expand into further joy. There are several new characters introduced into the politics of Dune: Part Two, as well. Florence Pugh plays the universe's politically-charged Princess Irulan; Léa Seydoux is the scheming Lady Margot Fenring; but none make quite the impact that Austin Butler does. A lot of hype - on and offscreen - surrounded the new antagonist, Feyd-Rautha, played by the Elvis Presley doppelgänger. Before the villain is even seen on screen, other characters describe him as a madman, vicious, more. When he finally enters stage right, he lives up to these rumours - but not much else. Butler is legitimately scary as Feyd-Rautha; a monstrous evildoer with nothing but hatred on his to-do list. So then, perhaps his performance is ultimately successful, but there isn't much else to latch on to with Butler. Feyd-Rautha carries out heinous and awful actions for the sake of it, struggling to create a well-rounded and compelling villain. Perhaps I need another watch (or four), but Butler was the only part of Dune: Part Two I doubted as the credits rolled. Director Denis Villeneuve has, once again, built a world that not only feels viscerally realistic, but also looks beautiful, stark, and begs to be explored further. When the Canadian maestro finally brings the series' third movie (Dune: Messiah) to the big screen, Dune: Part Two will no doubt be considered one of the best films of the trilogy, and indeed one of the most incredible pieces of cinema in recent memory. It is this generation's rival for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It trumps Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back as the king of modern science-fiction. Dune: Part Two is not only one of the greatest science-fiction pictures of all time, it is one of the best films ever made. Dune: Part Two is the new gold standard for sci-fi movies, and an exciting new direction for Villeneuve, Chalamet, Zendaya, and everyone involved.

"Mar 7, 2024",positive," Dirigido por Denis Villeneuve. Roteiro de Denis Villeneuve e Jon Spaihts. Com: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Dave Bautista, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, Babs Olusanmokun, Souheila Yacoub, Roger Yuan, Giusi Merli, Alison Halstead, Anya Taylor-Joy, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling e Christopher Walken.  “Você quer controlar um povo? Diga a ele que um messias virá e eles esperarão”, diz Chani em certo momento de Duna: Parte 2. Ciente de que o próprio amado é uma figura messiânica em potencial que adia a própria ascensão por temer o resultado que esta traria, a jovem não permite que seus sentimentos obscureçam a consciência de que as “profecias” sobre um “salvador” fazem parte de uma estratégia de dominação colocada em prática pela mãe do protagonista, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), e que mesmo as possíveis consequências positivas da liderança de Paul Atreides (Chalamet) empalideceriam diante do fato de que um estrangeiro assumiu este papel em vez de algum nativo. Sem a obrigação de ter que apresentar o universo criado por Frank Herbert em seu livro original, já que este trabalho já havia sido feito na ótima Parte 1, o cineasta Denis Villeneuve e seu co-roteirista Jon Spaihts podem concentrar esta continuação no desenvolvimento da dinâmica entre os personagens e seus interesses, abordando as intrigas políticas palacianas, os diversos planos concebidos por cada Casa (Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino) e pelo culto Bene Gesserit, os conflitos internos destes grupos e, ainda mais importante, a instrumentalização das crenças religiosas em prol de uma causa. Demonstrando como a Fé é uma motivadora poderosa, Duna sabe que é muito mais fácil mover um povo convencendo-o de que é o “escolhido” e que, portanto, uma disputa geográfica não é uma simples luta por terra, mas por algo infinitamente maior. Esta é uma percepção que a Princesa Irulan (Pugh), filha do Imperador (Walken), detém com clareza e que a move a aconselhar o pai a lidar com os conflitos no planeta Arrakis com cautela em vez de com força bruta, já que só há uma coisa mais perigosa que um líder religioso: um mártir. Pupila da Reverenda Madre Mohiam (Rampling), Irulan aos poucos se dá conta da dimensão da manipulação da líder das Bene Gesserit, cujos desígnios encontram como obstáculo os interesses particulares de uma de suas representantes, Lady Jessica, que se mostra determinada a convencer os Fremen (habitantes nativos de Arrakis) de que Paul – ou Muad´Dib ou Mahdi ou Usul ou Lisan al Gaib ou Kwisatz Haderach – é o Messias, um projeto que inicia de modo calculista ao focar a princípio naqueles que demonstram medo ou uma personalidade fragilizada. O curioso é como o mais resistente a esta ideia é o próprio Paul, que insiste em negar este papel – o que, evidentemente, os crentes enxergam como sendo uma demonstração de humildade que serviria como mais uma prova de que ele é um enviado divino. Neste sentido, por sinal, a performance de Javier Bardem é fundamental para que percebamos este processo, já que a natureza calorosa e forte do sujeito aos poucos é substituída por uma postura de adoração que o transforma em um seguidor passivo e fanático disposto a morrer pelo “Lisan al Gaib” – e é assustador constatar como alguém antes tão disposto a questionar figuras de poder pode se tornar tão subserviente e acrítico. Em contrapartida, a Chani vivida por Zendaya compreende plenamente este risco, não hesitando em virar-lhe as costas ao vê-lo abraçar um papel tão maniqueísta. Já Timothée Chalamet, apesar das críticas de alguns à sua aparente inexpressividade, comprova como o tom monocórdio de sua voz e o olhar vazio funcionam como contraponto eficaz ao volume elevado e à modulação raivosa com que se expressa após beber a Água da Vida e aceitar a condição de Messias (por falar nisso, aproveito para mencionar a imitação impecável que Austin Butler faz de Stellan Skarsgård em sua composição vocal, o que se revela uma escolha divertida e eficiente). Contando com uma direção de arte assinada por Patrice Vermette que faz jus à complexidade daquele universo, Duna: Parte 2 é hábil ao estabelecer visuais radicalmente diferentes para cada planeta e até ao retratar regiões diferentes de um mesmo mundo: se o norte de Arrakis é repleto de ambientes que surgem como imensas cavernas adaptadas aos propósitos dos Fremen, por exemplo, o sul é apresentado como uma região com edificações, remetendo a cidades projetadas mais tradicionalmente (ainda que sem abandonar a estética rochosa) – e o templo colossal no qual Paul se dirige aos fiéis no final do segundo ato é marcante ao trazer aberturas que permitem que diversos fachos de luz se projetem sobre sua arena central como uma confirmação divina do que vemos ali. Enquanto isso, o planeta dos Harkonnen aparece como uma imagem em negativo em seus ambientes externos, como se o sol que o ilumina sugasse todas as cores, convertendo todos em estátuas de mármore, sendo especialmente fascinante notar como os fogos de artifício se tornam explosões de tinta preta contra o céu branco. (E mesmo que espaços escuros e opressivos não sejam exatamente originais como lar de vilões, não há como negar sua eficácia narrativa.) Para completar, os equipamentos construídos e utilizados pelos personagens soam orgânicos às suas culturas (como as naves que remetem a insetos) e adequadamente envelhecidos pelo uso, sendo também interessante observar, por exemplo, como o conceito de um papiro como mídia para envio de mensagens é adaptado para se apresentar como um tubo de metal com as palavras gravadas em sua superfície, mantendo uma natureza que remete a algo medieval e futurista ao mesmo tempo. Já a fotografia de Greig Fraser reforça a beleza e o caráter mutável de Arrakis ao oscilar entre tons agradavelmente quentes, alaranjados, e passagens nas quais a superexposição da imagem sugere um calor sufocante e hostil. Aliás, um dos maiores méritos da Parte 2 é permitir que a narrativa invista tempo em sequências mais contemplativas que exploram a beleza do planeta e nas quais os personagens se dão ao luxo de esquecer por alguns minutos de todas as dificuldades que experimentam, entregando-se apenas ao prazer da companhia uns dos outros – algo que é refletido também no desenho de som, que em diversos momentos descarta qualquer ruído além do vento e do ruído da areia se deslocando, o que confere um naturalismo sólido ao que vemos (neste sentido, a cena em que vemos vários guerreiros Harkonnen levitando próximos à superfície vertical de uma montanha de pedra é também memorável). E se as sequências de ação contam com uma mise-en-scène bem estabelecida que permite que o espectador compreenda sem problemas a lógica do que ocorre na tela (a estratégia adotada na batalha final, por exemplo, jamais gera confusão), o destaque é sem dúvida aquela que retrata a primeira vez em que o protagonista monta sozinho em um gigantesco verme da areia, quando Villeneuve revela a dimensão da criatura ao longe e mais tarde, sem sacrificar a noção de escala, acompanha Paul enquanto corre, desliza pela areia, prende seus arpões no animal e finalmente sai da nuvem de poeira, surgindo imponente de pé sobre este e guiando seus movimentos. (Dito isso, em nenhum instante o longa explica como eles descem quando chegam ao seu destino.) Um outro elemento importante da Parte 2 reside, como na anterior, na influência das culturas e signos árabes sobre a concepção de Arrakis e seus habitantes, o que inclui suas vestes, seus costumes (como o lamento feminino alto e em grupo diante de um cadáver), seu vocabulário (como a referência a djinns) e sua religião (como ao se prostarem em uma mesma direção, como se voltados a Meca). Do mesmo modo, não é à toa que Villeneuve, ao encenar um ataque dos Harkonnen aos Fremen, inclui vários planos que parecem a tela de controle de um drone, remetendo às imagens que já vimos inúmeras vezes de árabes (guerrilheiros ou civis) sendo massacrados por mísseis disparados pelo exército norte-americano ou, mais recentemente, israelense (poucos dias antes do lançamento do filme, por exemplo, registros quase idênticos mostraram civis palestinos sendo mortos enquanto tentavam receber alimentos em um ponto de distribuição). E se o fato de os Harkonnen se referirem frequentemente aos Fremen como “ratos” soa familiar, basta pesquisar a regularidade com que os palestinos são tratados de forma idêntica pela extrema-direita sionista ao redor do mundo, incluindo no Brasil (algo que os nazistas também faziam com relação aos judeus). Aliás, é também importante reconhecer como Villeneuve não ignora o Orientalismo descrito por Edward Said em sua própria abordagem e como isto influencia a percepção do espectador sobre os personagens por mais que o filme tente evitar suas armadilhas: em certo instante, por exemplo, Paul diz que os Harkonnen foram ao deserto para caçá-lo – uma postura arrogante que o coloca como centro de todos os acontecimentos e relega os Fremen a meros seguidores, como se incapazes de autodeterminação (algo que Stilgar imediatamente aponta). Por outro lado, é impossível negar como o longa repete o velho equívoco ao realmente situar Paul como uma espécie de T.E. Lawrence “guiando” os árabes na revolta de 1916 mesmo que Chani critique esta situação diversas vezes. Brilhante em seu esforço para ilustrar como o processo de conversão/catequização frequentemente tem início em tons benignos até encontrar espaço para uma radicalização que se retroalimenta, corrompendo o fiel e levando-o a crer que suas ações mais reprováveis têm um “propósito” maior (como disse o físico Steven Weinberg, “com ou sem religião, sempre haverá pessoas boas fazendo coisas boas e pessoas más fazendo coisas más. No entanto, para que uma pessoa boa faça uma coisa má, é preciso religião”), Duna: Parte 2 tem plena consciência de que não está contando a história de um jovem que se converte em herói, mas sim em ameaça – e a cena que traz Paul abraçando esta posição é concebida não como um momento inspirador, mas de horror, carregando nas sombras, na trilha com tons angustiantes e nos primeiros planos que expõem a reação apreensiva de alguns e de fanatismo de outros. (Aliás, neste aspecto é mais do que apropriado que a Princesa Irulan surja no clímax da narrativa vestindo uma malha de aço que remete à figura de Joana D´Arc, já que esta também era movida pela crença de ser um instrumento divino.) Reagindo à recusa das demais Casas em aceitar sua posição de poder com a determinação imediata de que seus inimigos sejam “conduzidos ao Paraíso”, Paul/Lisan al Gaib inicia uma Guerra Santa que sua mãe vê como a concretização de seu destino, encarando a inevitável destruição de milhões de vidas como algo necessário para que alcancem um objetivo maior e “divino”. O que em nada difere da crença dos evangélicos de que o retorno de todos os judeus a Israel e a ocorrência de um amplo conflito na região é algo essencial para que Jesus retorne para o Juízo Final.

"Mar 7, 2024",positive," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzAfter directing the original Dune in 2021, the Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”/”Enemy”) returns to magnificently direct and write the follow-up for the epic sci-fi film with co-writer Jon Spaihts. It’s based on the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert.The dazzling CGI visuals are so good they deserve to be seen on the big screen to get its full impact.Part Two picks up after Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) won in the original film a sword-fight with a hostile Fremen warrior in the desert wastes of Arrakis. Paul’s nobleman father after assigned by Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken) to govern the planet of Arrakis, had been killed by the evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), who with the Emperor’s approval, takes over again the guardianship of the important planet with the sole source of the invaluable Spice. The fascist-like Baron schemes to eliminate the House of Atreides for good by having its only survivors, Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), left in the desert to die. He’s helped in this wicked endeavor by his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler).To survive, Paul and his mom must take shelter with the nomadic rebel Fremen tribe. Paul is given the name Muad’Dib, and promises the skeptical tribe to be their “messiah” or “chosen one,” and also to lead them to paradise with military victory. Two intertwining stories are now followed.In one story, there’s the fight against the Harkonnens with the Fremen tribe and Paul. The ruthless ones crave to control the invaluable “spices” on the planet Arrakis, that allows them to make space travel happen. The weapons used in the colorful battle scenes range from swords to missiles.In the other story, Paul, as an outsider, transforms himself into a wise military and political leader who must gain the confidence of the doubting Fremen to follow his leadership if there’s any chance of winning the war. Paul is helped in these efforts by the support of the religious Fremen believer and leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and by the intimate love relationship he develops with his mentor, the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya).By the time we reach the climax, Paul has earned his right to be the leader of the Fremen.There are many in supporting roles who do fine jobs, including Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s daughter; James Brolin as Paul’s childhood mentor Gurney; and, Dave Bautisa as the Beast Rabban.This follow-up action-packed spectacle version surpasses even the first-rate original (no dull spots here). The filmmaker’s story-telling smartly captures the ill-effects of living under a dictatorship who are carrying out a government colonial policy and a corrupt capitalist system."
"Mar 6, 2024",positive," Despite the presence of giant worms and talking space fetuses and numerous flashy fight scenes, “Dune: Part Two” is an adult sci-fi epic that takes its deep and very complex themes seriously throughout its long runtime. Other tellings of this story wouldn’t wrestle so fervently with identity, class, religion, and more the way that they are being tackled in director Denis Villeneuve’s film. The movie stands as an earnest testament to Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel that even further interrogates prickly discourses about saviors, the powerful, and the dispossessed thanks to the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. But it’s not all heady conversations and musings on these heavy topics, as there’s plenty of amazing imagery and exciting action to fully flesh out the world and keep it entertaining. There are some parts where that 166-minutes length is felt, and some redundancy could’ve been cut down for the sake of streamlining. But mostly “Dune: Part Two” delivers on the promise of the first installment to deliver a genuinely fantastic sci-fi masterpiece. “Part Two” picks up immediately where the first one ended, with Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) now hiding with the Fremen on Arrakis. With the help of Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul learns their desert ways and how to survive in the harsh environments. Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) has tasked his nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista), with squeezing as much spice from Arrakis as possible to avoid a similar fate as the House Atreides if the Emperor (Christopher Walken) isn’t pleased with production. Paul is reluctant to embrace and use the prophecies seeded on Dune by the Bene-Gesserit, while his mother is all too happy to employ them to promote her son amongst their new people (and keep him safe). Paul wants revenge against all Harkonnens — including newcomer Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) — but doesn’t want to use the Fremen simply for his own purposes, and therefore be another outsider that manipulates them. Villeneuve’s sequel both has a lot going on and very little. Firstly, it is entirely necessary to have seen the first part to know what is going on at any given time. This isn’t a detriment—it was always going to be told in two parts—but it is important to note in this age where installments try to hide that they are sequels or further entries in a larger story, even going so far as obscuring the number in the series. Viewers are immediately plunged into the story and there is never any catch up to acclimate folks to the events of “Dune.” But, at almost three hours long, that exposition isn’t missed as deeper themes are discussed. It would be easy for this to be the tale of a white savior showing up non-white people in their own customs to become an intergalactic hero. And that’s certainly one interpretation of Paul’s story—but the script is painfully aware of that (as was the book), and goes to great lengths to show how the prophecy was actually a source of control and that Paul’s great reluctance at taking the helm of the leader stems from not wanting to usurp the Fremen’s own agency. As the voice of the Fremen, the one who is distrusting of the religiosity and outsiders, Chani excels at being fiery independence and tender partner to Paul, helping soothe that storm that rages within him—which is all aided by an excellent performance by Zendaya. All the performances are great across the board, with no actor in “Dune: Part Two” lapsing into a one-note character. Bardem is hilarious and intoxicating as the true-believer Stilgar that wishes Paul would be the figure of prophecy that he has been raised to believe in. Bautista’s Rabban is a rageful monster but ultimately ineffectual papier-mâché Mephistopheles that grants his ogre persona with a touch of sadness because of his inabilities. Ferguson and Chalamet find even more layers to their characters from the first movie as Jessica and Paul change but stay akin to the people we met in the previous installment. And newcomers (to “Dune”) like Butler, Léa Seydoux, and Florence Pugh (as Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s daughter) bring their own flavors into the mix that help further expand the universe and deepen the intrigue of the moving parts at work. It is a truly fascinating world that Villeneuve has built from Herbert’s universe. Beautifully captured by DP Greig Fraser, the vast desert can look cruel in one scene and wondrously inviting in the next, depending on what is called for. The production design and costuming, with its many extras and settings, is unparalleled in most modern filmmaking—at least not since “Fury Road.” “Dune: Part Two” is a fully realized existence with amazing ideas at work in design that create something alien yet fundamentally human at the same time. It is our far future, and so has remnants of our DNA sprinkled throughout while still revealing new and daring visuals constantly. This is all greatly aided by Hans Zimmer’s amazing bombastic score with its intense percussion, desert sounds, and vocal exchanges to create a space that feels Othered but still familiar and home-like. These visuals and audio are born from our pasts but are fully realized in this remarkable film’s vision of tomorrow. If there is a flaw to “Dune: Part Two” is that around the 2/3 mark, it can feel like that beautifully rendered internal conflict of Paul’s has been underlined enough. And that some of those scenes of anguish and grappling can go on too long. But what to cut? I don’t know. There’s a famous scene in “Amadeus” where the Emperor says that Mozart’s music is full of “too many notes.” When Mozart asks which to cut, the Emperor has nothing to say to it. That’s how it feels with “Dune: Part Two”—it’s probable that every moment is needed to paint this beautiful masterpiece, but one can’t help but feel that at times it is going a bit long and slow over material already covered. This thankfully minor issue is usually quickly resolved by moving on to a new plot development or location with its own dazzling imagery and engaging performances. All told, “Dune: Part Two” is the real deal in terms of sci-fi epics, and will probably end up being one of the most defining films of the genre for the next decade to come. It’s a tremendous work and stunning sequel that is simply unparalleled. You can find our full content archive

"Mar 6, 2024",positive," Slotting into the subgenre of cute/traumatizing animated movies for kids, Robot Dreams is best watched immediately before your next therapy session. Realized with bright, hand-drawn images that have greater dimension than an ocean of CGI, Pablo Berger’s dialogue-free film stars Dog, a lonely pooch whose only comforts are TV dinners and staring longingly at the jubilant family across the street. Desperate for companionship, Dog purchases Robot, a smiling android who becomes his roommate and dance partner, opening our canine protagonist’s eyes to the wonderment of pre-9/11 New York (the Twin Towers are visible in several shots). If the film ended there, it would have been the cinematic treat of the winter, but Berger, adapting a comic book by Sara Varon, splits Dog and Robot apart in a manner both arbitrary and horrific. For all its playful flourishes, watching Robot Dreams is like watching a feature-length version of the Inside Out scene where Bing Bong vanishes in a cloud of dust. The mix of adorableness and brutality is enough to make you wail, “How can a movie with a cephalopod playing percussion in the subway hurt me like this?!” Robot Dreams is too wise and tender to deny, but for better or worse, there’s a touch of sadism behind its sweetness. NR. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Cinema 21, Living Room. Wednesday, March 6. Every dawn, Hirayama (Koji Yakusho) awakens without an alarm. His neighbor’s sidewalk sweeping initiates the handsome 60-year-old’s daily consciousness, and a routine begins. Mustache trim, coveralls, canned coffee, cassette in the van stereo (Patti Smith or Lou Reed) as Hirayama commutes into Shibuya City to dutifully clean Tokyo’s public toilets. From what we can tell—because Hirayama says maybe five sentences in Perfect Days’ first half—the dirty job is just a job to him. The work remains in balance with Hirayama’s passion for music, his voracious reading, and his lunchtime nature photography. It’s no mystery why directing legend Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Wings of Desire) would be interested in rendering such a life. What 78-year-old capital-A artist wouldn’t be? This is idealistic working-class poetry (à la Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson) about a man who accepts life as a series of days that can be pleasurable if porcelain scrubbing and creative ruminating are treated with equal care. As the Cannes jury decided when they gave him Best Actor in 2023, Yakusho makes all this mundanity incredibly watchable. The Japanese star’s shifting micro-expressions reveal a character who can be bashful, boyish or imposing when his constancy is interrupted by his co-worker, his niece, or a fateful stranger. We may wonder why Hirayama chooses solitude, but his ability to be present is as comforting as it is aspirational. Wenders taps into a precious cinematic paradox: We viewers escape our lives to be mindful inside someone else’s. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Bridgeport, Cinema 21, Laurelhurst, Progress Ridge. The first act of Drive-Away Dolls, Ethan Coen’s pre-Y2K lesbian screwball comedy, is pure cringe. It’s 1999 and two friends, Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) and Jamie (Margaret Qualley), are driving a rented sedan from Philadelphia to Tallahassee—and acting more like caricatures than characters. Marian is a bookish romantic; Jamie just wants to get laid, dude! The film is so dependent on stock characterizations that Ethan initially seems to be flailing without his filmmaker brother Joel (like Joel’s gorgeously austere The Tragedy of Macbeth, Drive-Away Dolls is a Coen brother movie, singular). Yet when Marian and Jamie get ensnared in a scheme involving a seething senator (Matt Damon) and a murdered dildo collector (Pedro Pascal), Drive-Away Dolls emerges as a cleverly comedic and romantic provocation. Despite being set after Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, the film imagines the ‘90s as an age when bigoted politicians were more ridiculous than dangerous and even Florida church ladies could be prevailed upon to support gay marriage. Kinky lovemaking abounds, but the evolution of Marian and Jamie’s bond—from friendship to far more—carries a whiff of Jane Austen, with Qualley playing a boisterous Elizabeth Bennet to Viswanathan’s disdainful Mr. Darcy. Is it any wonder that Coen wrote this jubilant lark of a movie with his wife, the film editor Tricia Cooke? The couple that plays together stays together. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Fox Tower, Hollywood, Lake Theater, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Progress Ridge, St. Johns Twin, Studio One. As tonally and stylistically consistent with its predecessor as any sequel you’ll encounter, Dune: Part Two—which adapts the back half of Frank Herbert’s landmark novel—is an escalation. We catch up with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) deep in the northern deserts of Arrakis, learning the ways of the indigenous Fremen, who debate among themselves whether Paul is the prophesied savior Muad’Dib. Falling for his fellow guerrilla fighter Chani (Zendaya), Paul seeks revenge on the invaders who destroyed House Atreides and whose ranks are now bolstered by sociopathic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). With production design that would make a pharaoh blush and sonics that touch bone marrow, director Denis Villeneuve outdoes himself in the realms of scale and sensory impact (any sequence involving sandworms is a guaranteed jaw-dropper). Yet no amount of mind-expanding spice could convince an audience that Chalamet and Zendaya have romantic chemistry or can quite explain Villeneuve’s overly slick habit of resolving hard-earned confrontations with swift, barely visible violence. Part Two also complicates the first film’s coldness by actualizing how cryptic storytelling can become when every major character is basically drunk on fate, unsure whether they are pawns, gods or kingmakers…or if convincing onlookers of that status simply makes it so, a philosophical dilemma destined to be resolved in a planned third film. It’s curious to say that a two-hour, 45-minute epic of this tonnage is holding something back, but Villeneuve is (once again) just as interested in prophesying the next film as he is in cementing the current one.

Academy, Bagdad, Cedar Hills, Cinema 21, Cinemagic, City Center, Empirical, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Pioneer Place, St. Johns, St. Johns Twin, Studio One. Like most 16-year-olds, Seydou (Seydou Starr) wants more out of life. His family home in Dakar, Senegal, is cramped, his construction job is menial, and his small world is more or less run by his mother and his sisters. This is the launch pad of a classically masculine quest, as Seydou and his cousin Moussa (Moustapha Fall) undertake a bruising odyssey across North Africa in hopes of reaching Italy, starting music careers, and sending money home. Once the journey begins, Io Capitano is a standard yet affecting drama about the carceral horrors experienced by undocumented immigrants—the kind of drama that (with respect) is tailor-made to get nominated for Best International Feature at the Oscars, as Io Capitano is. In a struggle defined by dirty cops, human traffickers, and broken dreams, Italian director Matteo Garrone (Gomorrah, Dogman) has assembled an empathy check for anti-immigration Europeans, perhaps even the far-right prime minister of his home country, Giorgia Meloni. The folk-tale framing gives the movie its narrative grip, though that conceit doesn’t always sit easily next to the process-driven indignities endured by Seydou and Moussa. Some interludes seem almost to punish the boys for their dreams of grandeur, but that may also be the point. Broadly speaking, the fantasies they harbor are near-universal among teenagers, only these two are met with nativism and machine guns. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. Nico Parker gives a breakout performance as Doris in Suncoast, the directorial debut from Laura Chinn, who based the film on her experience watching her brother die of brain cancer. In the movie, the brother is Max (Cree Kawa), who grows up with Doris in Florida. Even in the face of death, life goes on. The siblings’ mother, Kristine (Laura Linney), watches over Max at a hospice, while Doris befriends Paul (Woody Harrelson), an activist campaigning for Terry Schiavo to be kept on life support (the time is the mid-2000s). Suncoast is a deeply felt coming-of-age film that mostly works, despite stepping into familiar territory (anytime a film features driving lessons and a prom, clichés are guaranteed). Linney and Harrelson have their roles down pat, but it is Parker who breathes life into Suncoast. She takes Chinn’s sincere writing and runs with it in beautiful ways, turning Doris into a relatable teen who believably grapples with the awkwardness of friendship and the grief of her brother’s deterioration. It’s a performance that makes Suncoast a rarity: a film that evokes a specific moment in time without getting too heavy-handed with the nostalgia. R. DANIEL RESTER. Hulu. “Sometimes,” Rita Marley (Lashawna Lynch) says to her husband Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), “the messenger must become the message.” Her affirmation illuminates the thesis of Bob Marley: One Love, that the reggae superstar must learn to accept the consequences and dangers that come with being an activist and not let them impede his mission. It’s a noble sentiment that makes for a compelling arc, but it is undercut by the screenplay’s version of Marley and his beliefs, which are sanitized to the point of sterility. The story—which kicks off with the attempted assassination of Marley in 1976, prompting an exile to London where he recovers from the trauma while writing his landmark ninth studio album, Exodus—rarely rises above artist-biopic clichés, despite occasional flashes of brilliance from director Reinaldo Marcus Greene (King Richard) and the compelling combo of Ben-Adir and Lynch (whose performance is a reminder that after supporting roles in No Time to Die and The Woman King, she’s overdue for a starring vehicle of her own). Perhaps One Love’s greatest disappointment is that it’s so thoroughly average; a man like Marley deserves a mightier film. Devotees may find some enjoyment in hearing hits from the singer’s back catalog in surround sound, but anyone hoping One Love will do justice to an icon will find that the cinematic message lacks the conviction of the messenger.

"Mar 6, 2024",positive," The second half of the science fiction movie (yes, it's annoying to only get part of a movie) is huge and hugely entertaining. It's also a series of gigantic setpieces, including gladiators fighting in front of possibly the most enormous (digital) crowd I've ever seen in the movies, battles featuring thousands of warriors in outsized spacecraft and palace hallways that appear to go on into infinity. I emphasize the movie's bigness because it's so integral to its appeal. There's a lot going on, so much that, even if you do remember ""Part One,"" you may occasionally get lost. But what Denis Villeneuve's movie lacks in narrative clarity it makes up in sheer visual spectacle. Most of ""Part Two"" must have been created with special effects but, somehow, Villeneuve and his team give it a natural quality, so it never conveys the feeling that you're basically watching an animated film. What we're seeing in ""Part Two"" — which opens in theaters Feb. 29 — can't be real but it always looks like it is. That's accomplished by reuniting the creative team that won six Oscars two years ago for the first half of ""Dune."" Take Jacqueline West's costumes, which are appropriately futuristic but which also appear to be handmade (West was nominated for ""Part One"" but did not win). As in all of these sci-fi epics, there are plenty of scenes in which computer-generated characters drive computer-generated vehicles past computer-generated backdrops but, in ""Dune,"" it feels human, slightly messy and organic. That comes through most strongly in a couple of scenes in which characters demonstrate their strength during sandstorms, in which it almost feels like we, too, can feel the punishing enormity of the desert winds. As in ""Part One,"" the story is simple: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is trying to restore his family, the House of Atreides, to power and save his peoples' future. He has help from fierce Chani (Zendaya), warrior Gurney (Josh Brolin) and man of faith Stilgar (Javier Bardem) but it's not always clear where the loyalties of other characters lie, including his own mother (Rebecca Ferguson). ""Part Two"" introduces new foes including — here's that word again — a spectacular Austin Butler (""Elvis""), as Feyd-Rautha, a sadistic killing machine who makes up in menace what he lacks in eyebrows. ""Part Two"" is meant to further explore the perils of something Chani says early on: ""You want to control people? You tell them a messiah will come. They will wait for centuries."" It's a provocative idea but ""Part Two"" loses it in the midst of all the hugeness. I'd also like more of the complicated romance of Paul and Chani; both Chalamet and Zendaya are powerful performers who can do a lot with a little. But every time it seems ""Part Two"" is about to explore the difficulty of maintaining a relationship when you're both destined for greatness, we cut to somebody blowing up something. A lot of that has to do with the difficulty of finishing a movie that most moviegoers began back in October 2021, when ""Part One"" hit theaters. An emotional reunion between Brolin and Chalamet, for instance, will only register if you remember how they parted in the last movie. There are also things from the very beginning of ""Part One"" that don't pay off until the end of ""Part Two."" I guess what I'm saying is that you'd be wise to re-watch the first movie, if you haven't done so recently, and then I'd recommend seeing ""Part Two"" on the loudest, biggest screen you can find."

"Mar 6, 2024",negative," ""It has been (accepted) by all Muslims in every epoch, that at the end of time, a man from the family (of the Prophet) will without fail make his appearance, one who will strengthen Islam and make justice triumph,"" wrote Ibn Khaldun in The Muqqadamiah. ""Muslims will follow him, and he will gain domination over the Muslim realm. He will be called the Mahdî."" In the Tunisian-born sociologist, philosopher, and historian's exhaustive 14th-century introduction to the Islamic world of theology, philosophy, ecology, economics, power and politics, there is no escaping just how influential it was on Frank Herbert's original Dune novel series. From desert life versus sedentary culture, the rise and fall of dynasties and the diversity of religious practice, Herbert weaved these weighty historical concepts and themes into a sweeping narrative that delivers an epic critique of the Messiah Complex. Now entering Part Two of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation, co-written by Jon Spaihts, Paul's journey towards embracing his manufactured fate comes into keen focus; as does the overwhelming MENA and Islamic influence on the desert planet of Arrakis and the Fremen, its indigenous habitants. Having survived the devastating attack on House Atreides by rivals the Harkonnens in Dune — Part One, and the betrayal of Emperor Shaddam IV who supported the overthrow, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are forced into the desert and taken in by Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). This is after Paul won a fatal duel against the Fremen Jamis and much of the 2hr 48 minute runtime is dedicated to his and Lady Jessica's assimilation into and ultimate leadership over this nomadic warrior people. As well as lead a revolt against the usurping Harkonnens and the Emperor to claim control over the planet's spice production – the most valuable substance in the universe. One of Dune Part Two's successes is how acutely it wrestles with the scheming efforts of the Bene Gesserit and the false idolatry they've for centuries laid the groundwork for. Jessica's superpowered matriarchal order has spent many generations manipulating the Fremen tribes into believing their invented prophecy of the Kwisatz Haderach (AKA the Mahdi/Lisan Al-Gaib) – an off-worlder who will lead them to their salvation. Aware of dynastical changes of rule, the Bene Gesserit secure bloodlines of Houses to maintain power in the universe but Jessica's self-serving plans for her first child by the fallen Duke Leto I have positioned Paul into that messianic role; a move that creates friction between mother and son as their paths diverge then realign in the third act. Ferguson injects some of that Doctor Sleep/Rose the Hat eeriness into her performance; there's an increasingly disturbing glint in Jessica's eye as she becomes Reverand Mother and goes on a holy conversion mission to the South of Arrakis. The ominous conversations she has with her pre-born daughter (growing in her womb) intensify the weirdness that Ferguson revels in. Searing visions, conversations about faith and divination with the Fremen and arguments with Jessica, lay the groundwork for the tumultuous voyage of the mind, body and soul Paul goes through under the influence of spice that shimmers across the vast desert dunes. There's a rich interiority of these particular characters and Chalamet compellingly charts Paul's emotional evolution from unwilling saviour to pragmatic leader. However, the biggest motivating factor for accepting this destiny is oddly underexpressed. His relationship with Chani (Zendaya) also comes into clearer focus and the sweet-looking pair suits the somewhat basic YA romance filter applied to it; Paul's attempt to mansplain sand-walking to the Arrakis native raises a smile. But changes from the book mean there isn't an equal exchange of knowledge between the two that truly cements their affections or the genuine depth of their bond to each other – save for an ambiguous headband that might hint at a key plot point that has been erased from this part of the story. There's a dearth of character development as to who Chani is beyond a member of the Fedeykin (the Fremen's fearsome guerrilla fighter group), devout to her nation but sceptical of their faith. In the novel, Liet Kynes is her father with Sharon Duncan-Brewster playing a gender-swapped version of that character; here, there's zero acknowledgement of that relationship. Chani is no damsel-in-distress but Zendaya's ability to connect us to her journey is restrained to a typical strong female characterisation throwing a romantic spanner in the works for the male lead. That superficiality is more widespread in the Fremen cast. Little time is spent in establishing these people and their culture beyond fighting, survival and religious fanaticism. The casting of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souhelia Yacoub is a win for Arab representation in a film that restricts actors of MENA heritage to background players. A nonsensical joke about Stilgar's accent coming from ""the South"" is a reminder that Bardem is cosplaying as a Bedouin Arab. Bardem offers a warm, frequently humorous performance but mostly at the expense of Stilgar's faith. A faith that makes mentions of Jinn and is depicted through costumes including abayas, hijabs and keffiyehs. Ferguson's Imazighen facial tattoos and headdresses hit home not just the cultural appropriation of Jessica once she becomes Reverend Mother but the film too. That we are not privy to the secret histories and traditions she has inherited (robbed!) through this ritual is another way the film denies the Fremen a more vigorous depiction. A visit to the brutalist, monochrome world of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) introduces his sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha, who wouldn't look out of place at Berlin's infamous Berghain nightclub. Austin Butler does a decent enough Stellan Skarsgard impression and throws himself into the vicious role. In the Medival England-inspired pastures of Kaitain, Florence Pugh offers a restrained turn as Princess Irulan while Christopher Walken's Emperor offers none of the playfulness we've long been accustomed to. There are too many characters to do them justice in a film more focused on the grandiose than the granular motivations of its side players or a more fervent exploration of imperialism and colonialism beyond ""good vs bad"" and cultural aesthetics. Still, Villeneuve, with cinematographer Greig Fraser, renders an awe-inspiring cinematic space for the battle to continue. There's an almost oil painting-like texture to the Arrakis CGI, from the majestic sandworms to the ships and freighters attacking the native warriors. Han Zimmer's earthy score of heavy drums and ululating is once again oppressive. Some action sequences are thrilling and stylish; an early Fremen ambush on Harkonnen soldiers is gripping. A later Fremen attack on a spice harvester in wide shots and intense close-ups is riveting. But the final battle between the Fremen and Outworlders, not to mention between Feyd-Rautha and Paul, feels rushed and anticlimactic. Sure the main conflict of this book is somewhat resolved but a true resolution is not sufficiently achieved. After spending nearly six hours on Dune Part One and Part Two, I can say I had a better time with the latter. But as a whole, audiences deserve a far more satisfying return on their investment."

"Mar 5, 2024",positive," Am I the chosen one and if so, does that lead me on a path of destruction? Also, what does my girlfriend think of all this? Denis Villenueve’s sequel, Dune: Part Two, doesn’t waste any time, lighting the fires with a nice catch-me-up from the lovely Florence Pugh, playing the calculating daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken, having a ball) who may or may not carry bigger stakes late in the film. It kicks the tires with a breathtaking Fremen hijacking sequence, as they aim to deflate the spice plants all around Arrakis.  Now, if you heard that last line and got a headache, let me relieve the pain. In the first film, Paul watched his father and his mighty empire perish shortly after they came to Arrakis, the desert DUNE-filled planet that generates and stores “spice,” the diamond-shining substance that can extend life, offer premonitions, and other enhancements. In taking down House Atreides, Stellan Skarsgard’s House Harkonnen claimed ownership to the spice factories. The sequel unfolds with the Fremen, aka the rebels and original owners of the planet and its “gifts,” shaking the trees of their new dictators.  It all comes back to poor young Paul, who isn’t afforded the normal good young times of the run-of-the-mill heir to a throne. He lost nearly everything, and is slowly gaining it back with Chani, Stigard, and his new family. But his mother still has power and sway with him, and Harkonnen has a big weapon (Dave Bautista), and a shiny new dagger in Austin Butler’s Feyd-Reutha. All of it will be coming Paul’s way, as he figures out if he’s just another guy… or potentially a very powerful being.  This relationship also fails to generate a lot of heat, at least from my corner of the theater space. Both actors are good and do create some chemistry, but their lack of faith in each other extends to the audience not feeling unwavering in their support of the on screen couple. At one point, I felt like screaming, “commit, or just fight alongside each other.” A big part of the film’s finale centers around the idea of committing to each other in unconventional ways, and I felt more tired with these two being a unified front than I did with the film’s other plot. Maybe the third film will bring it, and them, more together. The chances of Dune: Messiah getting made have to be solid, because the end of this film is anticlimactic. Don’t get me wrong, it’s thrilling and well-filmed--but it’s a building block to a third movie that won’t be here for at least three or four years. Things happen in the end, but much is left to the next chapter or a future conflict of interests.  I’m not thrilled about that. If you’re reading this review and wondering if I love this material, the answer should be as clear as my addiction to the local baseball team. I like and admire the material and its execution *far* more than I love it. So, when we’re two movies and six hours in with only a couple of knots tied, the angst in me is real. How much more do we have to go? Will there be a Fremen spin-off? An origin film about Bardem’s character. Gosh, he’s good here. The Spanish pro can terrify easily in other roles, but his veteran leader, one who believes firmer than anyone that Paul is indeed special, offers a poetic nobility to the actor’s resume. But I don’t want a movie about his younger self.  After Dune: Part One concluded, I was left wanting more Josh Brolin and Bautista, preferably kicking each other’s ass. Bautista’s pale evil Harkonnen soldier does cross paths with the Atreides soldier. Brolin’s refugee, Gurney, has ties to Paul and his late dad, and wants to avenge the latter. In the end of Part Two, he does get that shot and crosses weapons with Bautista’s Rabban.  And it lasts all of ten seconds. A few exchanges, and done. The victor is for the viewer to discover, but it was disappointing. I compare it to one of Mike Tyson’s shortest bouts. On the other hand, the climactic fight between Chalamet and Butler is much better. On the whole, it’s not great because it does seem to get itself in a hurry. But the actors commit and the choreography is solid. How it wraps up is initially covered in doubt, and that’s due to the ability of the actors and stunt coordinators to get it all right. Kudos there, but not on the Brolin-Bautista face-off. While I would hand the acting prize to either Ferguson (let’s just say I can’t and don’t want to discuss her arc) or Bardem, the sound is the electrifying element at play in Villenueve’s epic sequel. Zimmer knows how to inject poignant energy into the loudest and biggest action spectacles, something he has done with the Pirates films and the Dark Knight movies. Here, like his work in Mad Max: Fury Road, the score throttles and instantly connects the viewer.  The best part of the movie is the first 45 minutes, which is a modest amount of action and storytelling thrown together in an athletic yet elegant jam by the master composer. If there’s a lingering thing from watching this one, it’s the score sticking inside my head. It gets you going when the film lags in the middle.  I will maintain and strengthen my front that Chalamet may not be the second coming of cheesecake, but he’s a very fine actor who handles the role’s progression well. Am I blown away by him like most? No, at least not yet. He’s still very young, but his (deeper) voice and athletic ability is growing and getting stronger. A couple scenes near the end cemented the fact that he did make for a sage choice to inhabit the world of Paul Atreides, who is NOT the most fortunate son. He goes toe-to-toe with Butler with the blades, but exchanges a key and very incendiary scene with Walken’s Emperor as well. The kid can act, and these two films showcase that growth. Here’s the thing, my friends. I still don’t love the material or the movies-but I recommend the sequel based on its kinetic first act, overall cast potency, thrilling sound, and overall satisfying qualities. Any scene involving the gigantic “worms” that pop up out of the desert ground will throw a jolt through your system.  While I would have craved more closure and wanted the relationship between Paul and Chani to find some resolution or identity, Villenueve does a good job with what is seemingly holy grail material. It’s not easy stepping into this world and dealing like he does with this size and scope of ambition and cast, but two films in he is does at least make you consider the desire for a third one. I just don’t sit here dying for its existence, even if the ending left a few unanswered questions and details. The similarities to Star Wars is real, and that connects to my overall liking but not adoring takeaway from these movies.  I agree with you. While I enjoyed the movie, I felt a bit cheated at the ending which just set up future movies that I may not be that interested in. A bit like Yellowstone; I weary of the long delay."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," I didn’t read author Frank Herbert’s Dune books. The 1984 version of the film by David Lynch is decent, but I never want to watch it again. I’ve watched Dune: Part One twice and still feel like it’s boring. Dune is this massive sci-fi epic that has consistently been cursed thanks to its dense lore. Despite its incredible cast and fantastic special effects, the sand-ridden world of Dune feels too vast to completely comprehend – and I think it’s funny that current Dune director Denis Villeneuve recently stated that he hates dialogue when Dune: Part One is two-and-a-half-hours of nothing but dialogue and set up for its sequel. And yet, for all my disinterest in the preceding entry and series overall, I still plugged in my stillsuit for a trip to see Dune: Part Two. Dune: Part Two picks up almost immediately after the ending of Dune: Part One. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are still trying to convince the Fremen that they belong among them.  Stilgar (Javier Bardem) has many Fremen believing that Paul is some prophetic savior, while the rest of the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), believe that the outsiders are spies. Things aren’t helped by the fact that Paul’s intentions are questionable from the start, as he claims he’s no messiah but rather just a man looking to learn the ways of the Fremen in order to get revenge for the death of his father.  As for Jessica, in service of easing these tensions, when the opportunity arises, she ascends to the role of the Fremen’s Reverend Mother and proceeds to use her status to help convince her followers of Paul’s holy status – all the while being pregnant with Paul’s baby sister, with whom she has full-on, one-sided conversations throughout the film. Meanwhile, as spice production under his watch continues to be interrupted by Fremen attacks, Rabban is demoted from his post as the ruler of Arrakis by The Baron, who in turn replaces him with his younger, bloodthirsty, and psychopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). While I may not be a fan of the Dune series itself, I’ve always found Villeneuve’s other works (Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival) to be phenomenal enough to keep me coming back for more. Same goes for the impressive filmography of Dune: Part Two‘s cinematographer Greg Fraiser (The Creator, The Batman, Rogue One, Killing Them Softly), whose films are always beautifully shot. The introduction of Feyd-Rautha on Giedi Prime is a particular triumph, as the scenes on the planet take place entirely in black-and-white, which provides an intriguing contrast to how sand scenes are often entirely white, Harkonnen sequences are heavy on black, and full-on action takes place in total color. Further, Dune: Part Two is far most action-packed than its predecessor. The Harkonnen now utilize the Ornithopters while the Fremen travel and fight using sandworms, and while most hand-to-hand combat involves blades, the film features countless awe-inspiring explosions. The worm-riding sequence will give you legitimate goosebumps, especially if you see the film in IMAX.  The second half of Dune: Part Two has far worse pacing than the first, it’s run time overwhelmed with sandy worm worshippers having their heads way too far up their asses. Not only is Timothee Chalamet a stronger actor when he has less to work with, but Paul is also a more attractive as a character when he’s humbly learning the ways of the Fremen rather than shouting about how great he is. Chalamet’s weight as a believable prophet also falters in his weak delivery of louder lines. And while Dune: Part Two may be a visual splendor, its plot feels like it doesn’t make a lick of sense. The Harkonnen material, particularly on Geidi Prime and with scenes involving Lea Seydoux, gives the film an atmosphere akin to that of Death Stranding – the magnificently bizarre video game that is both gloriously unique and yet probably the dumbest thing to describe out loud. Dune: Part Two leads towards a holy war, but you don’t understand half of the stuff people discuss in the film. The storytelling of Dune feels so elongated and convoluted, as between the two films released thus far, it shouldn’t take nearly six hours to get to yet another cliffhanger ending for what will likely be the most savage film of the entire trilogy, especially when the wait between Dune films is almost as unbearable as a ten-minute conversation revolving around the Atreides bloodline. Impeccably shot, filled with superb visual effects, and dripping with mostly strong performances from its entire cast, Villnueve’s latest will have you almost entirely invested in the dry, twisty, and monochromatic sci-fi drama for nearly all of its three hours."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," If you’ve felt guilty you never read “Dune,” take heart. The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s epic tells you everything you need to know – and entertains. Sure, there are more subtitles than a foreign language film and enough sand to make the folks in “Mad Max” a bit jealous, but this is grand storytelling on an understandable scale that doesn’t look down on its audience. Villeneuve, in fact, makes you feel like it’s time to jump on board, ride the wave and enjoy what hundreds of craftsmen have wrought. It’s a stunning, gorgeous film that pulls you in (far better than the first film) and makes you wonder who’s betraying who. Clearly, our sympathies are with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the son of a duke who’s expected to lead his people and others out of the line of fire and into a place of freedom. He’s abetted by members of the Fremen tribe, Chani (Zendaya), and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who want him to be more than he really is. Stilgar is all-in on the concept of “messiah”; Chani has her doubts. Chalamet and Zendaya play the relationship for all its worth and become a team of sorts that doesn’t appear to have cracks. Then, another group – House Harkonnen – turns up and looks to hail from a professional wrestling world. Their savior is a creepy fighter named Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, in a great performance) who isn’t afraid to take on anyone. Key to Paul’s intermittent success, however, is his ability to harness sandworms and ride them to glory. Think: Charlton Heston in “Ben-Hur” and you’ll get the picture. Much of “Dune, Part Two,” in fact, resembles old swords-and-sorcerers’ films. Massive crowds cheer on questionable behavior while individuals play out the skullduggery. If anything, it’s a look at cult behavior and how it can manifest. Most of the characters are very superficial (and understandable), but Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) manages to intrigue throughout. She’s the product of others' choices, a climber who wouldn’t mind crafting her own legacy. Villeneuve conjures memories of “Lawrence of Arabia” more than once and gets some gorgeous visuals just holding on untouched sand dunes. When he introduces those worms, the action heats up and Chalamet gets to ride to glory. “Part Two,” however, hardly seems like the end of this franchise. There’s a questionable move at the end and enough Frank Herbert story to launch a “Star Wars”-level empire. More “Dune”? We’re in, particularly if Zendaya gets the kind of trajectory this suggests. Like Chalamet, she’s the industry’s hope – a talent who can hold the attention an IMAX screen demands. Movie critic Bruce Miller says ""Dune"" makes you think plenty of action is about to unfold. It's a big, sprawling film that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible. It’s so interested in setting a tone, this “Dune” never really tells a story. Now, as technically fine as it is, Part Two needed to be waiting in the wings, ready to unfold at Christmas. “Godzilla x Kong” doesn’t have a strong script and its work for the humans is marginal at best. Still, if you're craving popcorn, this is your movie."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," ¿Estás preparado para volver a las arenas de Arrakis? Tras el éxito de Dune en 2021, Denis Villeneuve estrena Dune: Parte Dos, el filme con el que concluye su adaptación de la novela de Frank Herbert a base de espectacularidad, reparto de lujo (Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgârd y Florence Pugh, entre otros) y muchos gusanos de arena.  Publicada por primera vez en 1965, la saga de Paul Atreides es un hito de la ciencia ficción que ha dejado huella en múltiples ámbitos, desde la literatura hasta los videojuegos, pasando por esos intentos de llevarla al cine que, bien acabaron hundiéndose en el desierto, bien resultaron de aquella manera. Así pues, Villeneuve se enfrenta a un desafío enorme con este colofón. ¿Justificarán sus resultados esa tercera parte que planea rodar en el futuro? Denis Villeneuve ya no tenía excusa. Tras haber dedicado la primera entrega de Dune a exponer las premisas de una historia, su segundo largo acerca del planeta desierto afrontaba la obligación de sacar dicha historia adelante, un trabajo duro para aquellos fans de la ciencia ficción que, como él mismo, se vienen arriba con la construcción de mundos. Al canadiense, además, le rodeaba el aura de jugador de ventaja al contar con tres horas para un colofón que David Lynch tuvo que resumir en veinte minutos.  Y si recordamos además las flaquezas de su filme de 2021 (ese que a veces se quedaba a las puertas de ser una Barry Lyndon de las galaxias para después ceder a las necesidades de una narrativa reseca y ultracondensada), resultará lógico que algunos esperásemos su regreso con el cuchillo a punto. Así pues, ahora sorprende que esa hostilidad se haya convertido en reconocimiento ante un trabajo que no dejará en el género una huella tan profunda como algunos afirman, y que tampoco habrá provocado pesadillas entre los ejecutivos de Warner, pero al que se le nota el esfuerzo por ser fiel a su materia prima y, lo más importante, también a sí mismo. Más allá de la socorrida referencia a Lawrence y los beduinos, la historia de Dune también arrastra ecos de El gatopardo: un aristócrata que renuncia a las virtudes de su clase (verdaderas o no, esa es otra) a cambio de la conservación de sus privilegios. Y hete aquí que esa componenda, a falta de un Alain Delon con destiltraje, se encarna de forma más que notable en Timothée Chalamet.  La metamorfosis del actor a lo largo de esta película volverá obsoletos muchos chistes sobre melocotones al enfrentarle a la disyuntiva entre un sistema putrefacto (representado por esos Harkonnen que, en parte gracias a la llegada de Austin Butler, dan por fin la grima necesaria) y la barbarie del nuevo orden espoleado por Rebecca Ferguson, mamá terrible donde las haya, y sus artimañas religiosas.  El corazón de la cinta, eso sí, reside en Zendaya y en Javier Bardem: la primera, habitando un personaje que se eleva por encima del interés romántico para enunciar las verdades del barquero (¿del gusanero?) acerca de la manipulación y la explotación; el segundo, pasando de entrañable mentor a esbirro fanatizado y mostrándonos en ese tránsito la caída de toda una cultura en el abismo. En su conjunto, ¿es la Dune de Villeneuve una adaptación impecable? En absoluto, y tampoco una película libre de tachas. Pero sí una que solventa sus dificultades (visuales y narrativas) con finura, y que destaca cuando se resiste a ceder ante la épica fácil o a consolarnos mediante grandes apoteosis, no obstante la espectacularidad que la envuelve de la primera a la última escena.  Más allá de su especia y sus profecías, la novela de Frank Herbert sigue siendo una advertencia sobre el caudillismo, sobre el mito del salvador blanco y sobre lo fácilmente que cualquiera (ya sea un habitante de un desierto alienígena o un lector que se emociona al pasar las páginas) puede abandonar su humanidad al servicio de una figura carismática. Esta película dividida en dos pone esa idea en imágenes de manera sugerente y, a veces, también visceral: no es poco logro. El duque Paul Atreides se une a los Fremen y comienza su camino hasta convertirse en su líder mientras trata de evitar el terrible futuro que ha previsto: una guerra santa en su nombre, esparciéndose por todo el universo conocido.

"Mar 5, 2024",positive," Director/co-screenwriter (with Jon Spaihts) Denis Villeneuve displays first-rate epic chops with DUNE: PART TWO. Frank Herbert’s sprawling 1965 novel has been adapted for film and television before, but it is widely believed that Villeneuve’s 2021 DUNE: PART ONE has been the most successful effort. Part of that success arguably lay in the fact that the source material was separated into two films, allowing enough screen time to tell the story without hacking out crucial bits. DUNE: PART TWO begins more or less where DUNE: PART ONE left off. The Harkonnen dynasty has wiped out the Atreides dynasty in order to control the desert planet Arrakis. Arrakis is the only place in the universe that produces the “spice” that allows interstellar travel, extreme longevity, and psychic voyaging. Unbeknownst to the Harkonnens, Atreides heir Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have both escaped and taken shelter with the Arrakis natives the Fremen, whose own name for their planet is Dune. Paul impresses the Fremen with his fighting skills. Despite her profound suspicion of outsiders, Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) is attracted to Paul, who is also drawn to her. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) begins to believe that Paul may be the planet’s prophesied messiah. Paul and Chani are both horrified by this, for different reasons. Paul has nightmares about causing intergalactic war; Chani believes that a Fremen leader should be Dune-born and raised and is also afraid that becoming a religious icon will irretrievably change the man she loves. Jessica, meanwhile, is a member (albeit a rebellious one) of the secret all-female magic-using society the Bene Gesserit. Jessica agrees with Stilgar about the prophecy, and sets about getting the loyalty of the Fremen. As for Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), he’s got nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) trying to quell the populace on Arrakis. Harkonnen would like to see his other nephew, psychotic but capable Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), take the throne from the current Emperor (Christopher Walken). That’s just the basic set-up. There is no denying Villeneuve’s skill at creating visual impact. The varied spacecraft are fully-realized, intricately detailed replicas of what is described and suggested by the science-fiction cover art of Herbert’s day. So are the costumes and props, though they are more intricate than anything conjured in the two-dimensional graphics of the ‘60s.The battles are ferocious and move in breathtaking waves. The one-on-one fights are superbly choreographed and fluidly executed. Furthermore, there are flights of imagination in both color and design. The Harkonnen home planet, under a black sun, is shown wholly in blacks, whites, and grays. Combined with the shapes of its trappings, it truly comes off as another world. Most of the cast is also right on pitch. First among equals here is Zendaya, who can convey profound heartbreak or fury without a word. Ferguson has both wonder and power as Jessica. Bardem is filled with conviction and joy as Stilgar. Butler gives dimension to the predatory Feyd-Rautha. Other notable performances come from Florence Pugh as the Emperor’s daughter and Charlotte Rampling as the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. It’s not that Chalamet isn’t a good actor overall – his choices make sense – but he’s simply not on the same pseudo-Shakespearean wavelength as most of his colleagues. This kind of material, with characters who know that their actions are shaping the cosmos, and who sometimes express themselves in dialogue that doesn’t always flow naturally, calls for a particular style. Chalamet is doing something different, which isn’t exactly wrong, but it’s noticeable. Something that audiences in 2024 are likely to notice more than either Herbert’s readers or viewers of earlier dramatizations were is DUNE’s great white savior plotline. While the characters discuss things in terms of families, outsiders, and Fremen, what we see is the brown and Black people of Dune rallying round the white Paul and Jessica. In this, Chani is the main voice of opposition. Granted, this is not set on our world, but still, we either have to roll with it for the purposes of this film or get off-board. DUNE: PART TWO is undeniably spectacular. Whether and how much one is moved by that spectacle depends on large part on what else, if anything, the viewer wants from it."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," Picking up where the first film left off, Dune: Part Two is a visual and sonic feast akin to the first that will enthrall the audience’s senses. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), remain with the Fremen. Led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem),  Paul and Jessica are newcomers to the Fremen society and are not trusted. While some believe Paul to be the “chosen one,” other Fremen, like Chani (Zendaya), are skeptical. They do not believe that a Messiah is coming, and they certainly don’t believe it to be Paul.  The Harkonnens continue to pillage their way across Arrakis in an attempt to take control of the planet while Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) is promoting the fall of House Atreides. His daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), secretly believes that Paul may still be alive, but at this point, she has nothing to solidify this thought. Even a conversation with Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) does not dissuade Irulan from her theories.  As Paul delves further into Fremen society, including learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter and riding a sandworm, Stilgar continues to fill his people with hope that Paul is the one they’ve all been waiting for. However, while Paul doesn’t believe in this himself, his mother is set on spreading the word of the prophecy to the fundamentalists in Northern Arrakis. The best thing about Dune: Part Two are the performances. Zendaya’s Chani is the heart of the film, and she is given much more to do this time than she does in the previous film. Her chemistry with Chalamet’s Paul is palpable, and the short-lived honeymoon phase between the pair makes for some of the film’s best understated moments. Chalamet commands the screen, particularly in the film’s third act, as he leans into the power he previously claimed he did not want to entangle himself with. Every line delivery is concise, and it’s easy to see the goodwill that Paul may have gained in the first film and the beginning of Part Two slowly slipping away. This could not have been done with such believability if Chalamet didn’t turn in a pitch-perfect performance.  However, the best of the returning cast is Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica. Ferguson has a charisma about her that is palpable in any film she’s acted in, and it’s not different in the two Dune movies. In Part Two, Ferguson does a lot of heavy lifting as her character is most important in moving the film’s narrative forward. Every look, every line delivery commands your attention and Ferguson is astonishing in every moment she’s on-screen in Dune: Part Two. Her character is one of the ones to watch most intently as her ambition grows and the her dangerousness builds from scene to scene. Newcomers to the franchise are Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, Léa Seydoux as the Bene Gesserit Lady Margot Fenring, and Florence Pugh as Irulan. The trio is excellent as their respective characters, Butler and Seydoux, are menacing, each portraying their powerful characters with a gravitas that cements their formidability and lets the audience know from the moment their characters appear on-screen to pay close attention to them both. While Butler has more screen time compared to Pugh and Seydoux, the actresses make the most of their screen time, and it will be intriguing to see their storylines expand with the next installment.  Of course, we cannot discuss Dune: Part Two without discussing the film’s visuals and music. A treat to both the eyes and ears, this film is somehow even better than the first in how it brings Frank Herbert’s novels to life. From the moment the movie begins, it is clear that no expense was spared regarding the visual effects. Not one interplanetary vessel, sandworm or explosion was out of place, and in seeing new worlds, the monochromatic home of the Harkonnens with the black sun was one of the most visually interesting moments in the movie. Yet again, the incomparable Hans Zimmer brings his A-game for the film’s score. The music ebbs and flows easily with whatever is occurring on-screen. In heartfelt moments, you have a song like “A Time of Quiet Between the Storms” or the aggressive percussion and synth beats of the “Harkonnen Arena” – which leaves a feeling of unease throughout that particular segment. Of course, the bombastic and otherworldly are coming to the forefront in “Worm Army.” Zimmer’s score is impactful throughout the movie’s entirety. Zimmer’s music elevates each and every pivotal scene to new heights. That said, there are some negatives for the positives in Dune: Part Two. The film’s pacing wasn’t the best, with some sequences stretching on for too long, while others seemed over too quickly. However, the most glaring negative is the same one carried over from the previous film: the lack of SWANA (Southwest Asian/North African) actors in key roles, aside from Souheila Yacoub, who portrays Shishakli. There was also a level of discomfort that came with this, particularly when the House of Harkonnen (which is primarily white) was attacking and laying waste to Arrakis, a planet populated by the Fremen, who are mostly Black and brown citizens.  With Dune: Part Two showing more of Fremen society, it is even more glaring than in the first film. It is shown in their clothing, the way they depict them praying, and the language they speak (which has very distinct Arabic influences). In addition to the “white saviour” trope partly continued from the first film (although once you get to the film’s third act, you’ll see this narrative change), this is Dune: Part Two’s biggest problem (for me). Whether it’s a film based on the 1989 Montréal massacre with Polytechnique or following a father trying to find his missing child in Prisoners or “Time to meet God” in Sicario, Denis Villeneuve continues to show moviegoers why he is such a thrilling director. Villeneuve knows how to bring a broad range of stories to life, and working alongside cinematographer Greig Fraser for both Dune films, the pair truly capture a sci-fi spectacle.  With an unforgettable score, vivid visuals, and powerful performances, Dune: Part Two is what a sci-fi epic should be. However, that doesn’t mean it is above criticism – even if the film, for the most part, was good."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive,"In Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve is less subtle with his choices, being aggressively vocal about the film’s intent, leaving very little room for ambiguity."
"Mar 5, 2024",positive," Dune: Part Two continues the sci-fi adaptation established by Denis Villeneuve’s original Dune. The novel adaptation is not the first time the story has made its way to the big screen. But after Dune: Part Two, it’s become the definite version in my mind, with almost every aspect of the movie hitting so hard that it leaves you in awe. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Read on for my Dune: Part Two review.  Dune is Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi franchise, that began with one book and has spawned into a multimedia empire with sequels galore. Villeneuve’s Dune is not the first big-screen adaptation, with the controversial David Lynch movie being the first mainstream one. However, Villeneuve does the impossible by easing audiences into the world of the franchise with the first film, and immerses them in its story to completion with Dune: Part Two.  The story picks up directly after the events of Dune, with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) the sole remaining survivor of House Atreides. Joining with the Fremen, he begins his journey for revenge. But at the same time, the political machinations of the Bene Gesseritt, via Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have more elaborate plans in mind. The film is a culmination of what I thought was all set up in the first Dune. Which is what didn’t work for me in the first film. But here, Villeneuve closes out the story bringing every plot thread to a satisfying and explosive conclusion.  The entire Dune franchise, and even visually what Villeneuve has set up from the first film, seems like an epic sci-fi masterpiece. Which it absolutely is that. But with Dune: Part Two, we see how it’s so much more than that. While set in a futuristic sci-fi world, the core story is essentially a revenge thriller; Paul is out to avenge the death of his father and House.  But along the way, he becomes entangled in the politics of this universe, religious fervor, and his destiny amongst it all. The prophecy of one rising up and being the messiah of the Fremen people adds a more abstract fantasy element to this sci-fi property. But how complex that turns out, and where it takes the story is truly captivating and thoroughly engaging.  I was thrown off by how Dune: Part Two is also this epic love story full of some incredibly shot sequences that would feel out of place in any other movie about giant sandworms and hallucinogenic spice. But the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya lights up the screen. Their love story, along with the impact it has on the larger story is just one small subplot of the movie, that enhances and intensifies Paul’s journey so much more.  I cannot end this Dune: Part Two review without discussing the more technical elements of the film. It’s shot beautifully, with steady cams, frantic zooms, and pans that really put audiences into the POV of these rebel Fremen fighting for their future within the sands and stones of a desert planet. The movie starts with his low-angle shot, as Paul and the Fremen crouch in a sand dune. The panning as perspective changes, remains low, creating an almost claustrophobic feel for audiences. But just enough to work within the scene, not enough to pull audiences out of it.  Greig Fraser’s cinematography is gorgeous and astonishingly breathtaking. The establishing shots alone are works of art, but then when the story is added and the frame fills with characters, VFX, and music, it all becomes something so tangible and awe-inducing. There are frames from Dune: Part Two that could be murals or wall art, but will also carry the weight of the story behind them, even in a still frame.  Not to mention the Hans Zimmer score that will leave you breathless, and in awe of what a collaborative medium filmmaking really is. A frame of film or note from the score will immerse you back in that world, at the moment you originally heard it, with all the emotional responses that come with it.  Dune: Part Two works as an epic conclusion to an introduction in the first Dune. Part Two works better as the conclusion, experiencing as one cohesive story rather than two parts of one whole. The criticisms of the first film become void if experienced one after the other. It’s a story of epic proportions told by an insanely talented filmmaker, who knows how to play every moment with the maximum impact on audiences. And the ability to pull career-nest performances from its insanely massive cast.  Chalamet shines in a role that I think pulls him out of the coming-of-age films he’s made his career on. And into a more mature actor stepping into a new era of his career. Ferguson is sublime as the over-protective mother who is adding to her son’s legacy in her own problematic ways. Zendaya is intense and loving and has an amazing story arc of her own. Austin Butler impresses as Paul’s antagonist, Feyd Rautha, in a role that is as cerebral as it is physically demanding. Every performance in Dune: Part Two works, along with absolutely every other thing about it.   Follow the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, Paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. "
"Mar 5, 2024",negative," Can we talk about 4DX? Where the seats do a roller coaster thing; swerving and jostling throughout movie, causing motion sickness for those who have it. (I don’t, but my subconscious was in a constant state of wanting to turn around and catch the teenager(s) kicking my seat.) Then there’s the puffs of wind in your ears when you least expect it, and 4DX also sprays water on you. I’m not a fan of this. You don’t know where that water’s been! Especially in New York City. Anyway, with or without 4DX, I didn’t really care for “Dune: Part Two.” “Part One” was a made-for-IMAX science-fiction epic featuring a massive sense of scale. The desert planet Arrakis featured gargantuan hovering machines and football-field-long sandworms looking like monolithic elephant trunks with vacuum-cleaner-dust-brush-attachment mouths. They utterly dwarfed the tiny humans. It was fun the first time out. While the sense of scale and spectacle still outstrips most special-effects blockbuster cinema offerings, including “Avatar,” this time around there’s a ponderous sense of “been there done that.” Unfortunately, if you’ve seen one monster-worm rodeo, you’ve seen ‘em all. (“Worm rodeo” is my term using a sand-thumper gizmo to attract a big sand worm with vibrations, await it’s inevitable underground tsunami-like arrival, swing some grappling hooks, and then go worm-back-riding, or worm-surfing in the desert.) Overthrowing the Empire can only be accomplished by Paul becoming the foretold warrior-prophet of the Fremen. Paul must become a sort of sand-Neo (Keanu Reeve’s messianic character from the “Matrix” series). This requires some propaganda. Paul’s mom Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) reluctantly supports the concept, along with Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a Fremen zealot who’s convinced Paul will return Arrakis to the oasis of abundantly watered green vegetation of eons long past. Paul is not ethically 100 percent onboard with this wholesale con job, and neither, obviously is Chani, until Paul’s convinced there really is no other way. Once fully committed, and especially after imbibing a viscous blue liquid that’s extracted via syringe from drowned juvenile sand worms, he commits atrocities and betrays those closest to him with a merciless belief in the end justifying the means. Quite a bit of “Dune: Part Two” is shot in black and white, and some of the depictions of the colosseum carnage and the giant, bombastic, fascistic rallies of said evil fat man are more than a little reminiscent of Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will.” Zendaya and Chalamet don’t have a chemistry that burns up the screen. The film needed some relationship juiciness, what with all that dry, dry sand. Director Villeneuve’s definitely got style and a genuine specificity of vision—I’ll give him that. But this dark world and universe, with it’s alabaster-white evil humans is, for my taste, too eerily (and suspiciously) similar to Ridley Scott’s “Prometheus” world, with its evil alabaster-white humanoids, and its direct links to those face-hugging, acid-veined, chest-exploding aliens that have taken up permanent residence in our collective imagination since 1979. I’ve grown a little tired of the endless darkness and tales of moral compromise."
"Mar 4, 2024",positive,"Finally, DUNE takes proper cinematic shape as the glorious sci-fi soap opera metaphor intended by Frank Herbert in Villeneuve's continuation, although its most potent offerings exist in the periphery."
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," Villeneuve escenifica un conflicto interplanetario al borde de una guerra santa, con un inmenso elenco de personajes nuevos y viejos, para narrar una épica oscura sobre el camino del héroe. Retomando el hilo narrativo meros momentos luego del cierre de la anterior película, Duna: Parte Dos (Dune: Part Two, 2024) descubre a Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) refugiado entre los nativos Fremen tras la masacre de su gente a manos de los Harkonnen. La tribu del planeta desértico tiene a los Atreides y a los Harkonnen por colonizadores oportunistas, interesados en su metáfora-para-el-petróleo y nada más, pero resulta que Paul en particular da la talla del legendario mesías que los Fremen aguardan hace siglos. Esta incógnita sobre la naturaleza profetizada de Paul se vuelve el núcleo central del conflicto en una trama que enroca varias urdimbres políticas (como los sanguinarios Harkonnen en su papel de imperio romano en decadencia y la logia femenina de las Bene Gesserit, que trafica y sentencia linajes cuales moiras griegas) con el fervor religioso de los Fremen, increpado por el fanático Stilgar (Javier Bardem) y aún más por la madre y recalcitrante svengali de Paul, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Si Paul quiere pelear junto a los Fremen, debe aprender su cultura; si quiere unirlos contra un enemigo en común, debe convertirse en su líder; si quiere liderar a un pueblo religioso, debe hacer de mesías; y en las cuidadas palabras del escritor Kurt Vonnegut, “Somos quienes pretendemos ser. Así que debemos tener cuidado quiénes pretendemos ser”. El camino de este joven héroe en particular es uno de incertidumbre y artificio, y por más arcaicos que el esoterismo y la ciencia ficción de “Duna” hayan quedado en comparación con sus imitadores pop, sus meditaciones sobre problemática religiosa, la mística e instrumentalización de la fe, y el resbaloso atractivo del poder son infinitamente más convincentes que el maniqueísmo del “Star Wars” que ha llegado al siglo XXI. La segunda parte también se anima aunque sea un poco más a deshelar la humanidad de Paul y el círculo que lo rodea a través del humor (Bardem, Josh Brolin) y el casto romance Young Adult con la guerrera Chani (Zendaya), cuyo escepticismo sobre la divinidad de Paul lo mantiene en jaque. En el otro extremo, los otrora formidables Harkonnen han caído en la incompetencia - se matan principalmente entre sí - y el Barón (Stellan Skarsgard) parece no haber planeado más allá del golpe que le dio poder sobre Arrakis. En el momento clave que la película necesita su segundo aliento se introduce al sádico y violento Feyd (Austin Butler), autoproclamado némesis de Paul. Filmada por Greig Fraser con especial énfasis en las impactantes dimensiones de despliegues de fuerza; de las naves, los ejércitos, coliseos, desiertos y las criaturas que lo habitan, y musicalizada con la típica pompa atronadora de Hans Zimmer, la película flexiona una contextura titánica digna de una épica religiosa o mitológica. Donde Villeneuve quizás enflaquece es al filmar escenas de guerra: el director de Sicario (2015) claramente está más cómodo filmando duelos, emboscadas y guerrillas, los cuales suplen la primera mitad de la película de una acción magnífica que la segunda mitad nunca equipara del todo. En materia de saldar las varias cuentas pendientes de la primera parte, así como introducir y resolver las propias la segunda, la película rinde satisfactoriamente más allá de algún que otro anticlímax que parece ser más que nada víctima de la edición. Pero si bien el final alcanza una catarsis trágica de manera definitiva también no puede dejar de sugerir que Villeneuve adaptará aunque sea una novela más en la serie (¿Como la coda de una trilogía? ¿O de nuevo dividiendo al libro en dos?). De todas formas Duna: Parte Dos es tanto un gran medio como una gran conclusión."
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," La imaginación te llevará a todas partes, dijo un genio una vez. Y aunque de por sí la imaginación muchas veces puede ser un reflejo disfrazado de lo que somos, nuestra capacidad de plasmarla y hacerla realidad es el acto de mayor catarsis a la que nos podemos someter. Imaginar algo y crearlo, resulta ser, no solo la satisfacción más enorme del ser humano, sino por momentos su única razón de vivir. “Dune: Part Two” es el más reciente resultado de la imaginación humana, plasmada hace más de 50 años en las letras de Frank Herbert, y hoy trasladada al arte más complejo de nuestra existencia, el cine. Muchos pensamientos llegan a la vez a la hora de visualizar esta película, muchos más a la hora de pensarla. Pero a la hora de resumirlo, creo que existe una dualidad sorpresiva en la experiencia de verla. La primera es la más evidente, una historia que grita a todo pulmón su bagaje cultural humano, que conectamos con nuestra propia historia, y hacemos conexiones espirituales, religiosas, históricas y narrativas a patrones que vemos repetidos muchas veces en el comportamiento humano. Pero la segunda no es tan tangible, y es la realización personal del punto preciso en el que nos encontramos como humanidad en el que somos capaces de crear un producto de entretenimiento que rompa sus propias fronteras entre una pieza artística, una historia contada, un logro cinematográfico y una adaptación de una de las novelas más celebradas de la historia del género. Pues para llegar ahí no solo existe un responsable, sino un esfuerzo colectivo, creativo, administrativo y económico, que pudiera ponerse a la par con el conflicto entre los Atreides y los Harkonnen. Su genialidad inicia en aquel primer punto, como la película utiliza la ciencia ficción a su favor para alejarse de los patrones humanos en el primer nivel de conciencia a la hora de verla, ¿qué logra esto? Que nos distanciemos, que pongamos una barrera entre nuestra experiencia humana y la que vemos en pantalla, y así convencernos de que aunque muy bien esto puede ser real, es totalmente ficticio y es producto de nuestra imaginación. Pero siempre con el debido respeto y seriedad que, irónicamente, nuestra imaginación merece. Una vez creada esta distancia entre el espectador y lo contado en la película, su historia es lo suficientemente inteligente y capaz como para mostrarnos los patrones que tanto conocemos al ser tan nuestros, la colonización, la codicia, los conflictos familiares, lo autoritario, la brutalidad, la consciencia política, la religión, la pobreza, la venganza, la mentalidad popular o de rebaño, la esperanza, y así, con una singularidad infrecuente en el cine, mantiene una sincronía en las decisiones de los personajes como para que su audiencia los comprenda, o aun más allá, se vea en ellos. Ya no somos ellos, pero nos entendemos, pues sus problemas son mis problemas y sus deseos son mis deseos, en contextos solamente separados por la imaginación. Y con eso paso a aquel segundo punto de la dualidad sorpresiva. ¿Qué se necesita para crear una distancia y/o una barrera entre lo que vemos en pantalla y mi audiencia? Pues un equipo creativo con la capacidad y los medios para dejar volar una imaginación atenta a los detalles, pensada desde las palabras de un idioma irreconocible pero cercano, hasta la más mínima presencia tecnológica distinta a lo que hoy conocemos como real. Frank Herbert, al escribir “Dune”, seguro pensó que lo estaba dejando todo en el papel, como es de costumbre cuando dejamos volar nuestra imaginación sin fronteras. Y en una labor titánica de conocimiento del material original y de resumir, para contar en tres horas, cientos de páginas de contexto, lo más importante es la capacidad subestimada de imaginarse algo visual y sonoro que sirva como la nueva norma para las millones de personas que verán esta película. Pues cuando leemos, la experiencia es individual, pero en el esfuerzo colectivo de realizar una película, pensamos en el recibimiento colectivo de esta. Hacer cine no es un ejercicio solitario, así como verlo y experimentarlo tampoco lo es, una vez presentamos algo en pantalla, audiovisual, nuestra mente inmediatamente lo toma como la nueva realidad, y para millones de fanáticos de esta saga, “Dune” ahora es lo que Denis Villeneuve ha creado para ellos. Así ocurrió con “The Lord of the Rings”, “Harry Potter”, “Game of Thrones”, y cientos de otras adaptaciones audiovisuales que terminan siendo la norma colectiva de estos reflejos imaginativos de lo que somos, o lo que podemos ser. ¿Cómo se inicia a crear algo como “Dune: Part Two”? No tengo idea, me imagino que con una primera entrega tan buena como aquella lo fue. Capaz de mostrarnos una experiencia cinematográfica que reviva aquel género venerado hace muchos años en el cine, LO ÉPICO, resumir una historia que solo promete más y más, y darnos una de las secuelas más impresionantes de la historia del cine, revitalizando el género de la ciencia ficción. Por más creadores que se tomen tan en serio nuestra imaginación. Viva el cine carajo."
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," Dune: Part Two is a triumphant and visionary science fiction film. It builds on what worked in the first film, and firmly establishes that it has been constructed out of not only an affection for the source material, but also a profound understanding of the tragedy at the heart of Herbert’s work. This is a story in which a boy becomes a hero and wins. It is a story of why that story is a tragedy. It paints gorgeous visuals in motion, not just of sci-fi combat and explosions, but of a world away from ours in all the small details. The rattling suck of air through tubes in the sand, the dance of walking without rhythm across dunes, the gaping maw of a black-toothed enemy, the skittering glitter of spice blown across the land, the crystal clarity of hidden waters, the smooth tumble of sand through fingers. There’s a mesmerizing fullness to the imagery, of it being glimpses of a real world that resonates with texture and smell and taste rather than just the hollow glitz of sci-fi visuals. And it embraces the sheer weirdness of the world. Not as acid trippy as the Lynch movie, but still reveling in the bizarreness. For instance, when ink bubble fireworks burst like a celebrating squid above a stadium of alabaster hordes stomping and swaying like an albino Nazi rally. Balloons drop metal monsters the size of apartment buildings into the desert, sand worms erupt like Cthulhu’s fingers out of oceans of sand. Even with the weirdness on display, it feels more grounded as the characters are more fully realized than in the first film. Chani in particular is given a lot more character, more complexity, than is present in the novel in which she tends to be a motivator and plot device, but not necessarily a person. That’s true of many of the characters, to be true. Herbert, for all his brilliance, was also a product of his times in science fiction and he wrote in a period where characters were secondary to plots. Villeneuve deserves great credit for teasing out the emotion of characters without compromising the ideas, of making their passions and dreams as important as their moves on the chessboard of power. It’s teasing out that emotion that leads to the greatest success of the movie: capturing the sadness at the heart of the story. It calls back at times to Paul’s conversation with his father in the first film, in which he expresses such doubts about wanting anything to do with power. At a first viewing, it read as the cliché of the reluctant hero. Yes, yes, you just want a simple life, but we know you’ll rise to be a hero because that’s what the story says should happen. But what makes this story so powerful, what so many have seen between the lines over the decades in Herbert’s novels, is that the hero’s journey is not glory, it’s a trap. But it’s not so naïve as to simply argue that heroes are bad, or that fighting evil makes you evil. No, it argues the sadness that victory always destroys what you are fighting to save. The only way to defeat an empire is to be an empire, the only way to save the Fremen way of life is to unleash them. “Lead them to paradise,” Chalamet says at the moment of triumph and to the shouts of elation with such infinite sadness.  But with all that said, the film feels rushed even at nearly three hours of run time. There is no real passage of time, and despite cataloging a whirlwind of events, a mere six months or so pass. We can’t pretend otherwise because of the biological clock that starts early in the movie. Book readers will know that it’s timing forced by deciding that Alia will not be in this film, which is probably a good editorial decision, but traps the story in a constrained timeline. As with the first film, I cannot for the life of me understand how someone who hasn’t read the book can follow half of what’s going on. Not just in terms of easter eggs, or hidden longer term meanings of events, but on a basic level of understanding the basics of what is going on from moment to moment. The best I can say to someone who enjoyed the first movie but has not read the book is to trust that the plot does make sense if you look up the answers after the fact. And also to tell you to read the damned book already."
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," Dennis Villeneuve’s Dune sequel is a sombre science-fiction spectacle that insists on the scale of cinema: erupting sandworms are Cecil B. DeMille colossal, the sound design centred on Hans Zimmer’s score thunderously enveloping. In a genre once jokingly called space opera, its grand aristocratic dynasties and passions justify the term. It also treats its 1965 Frank Herbert source as a classic novel, teasing out abiding themes from its proto-hippie era. Vietnam-style aerial gunships hover, and atomic warfare, religious faith and extremism, ecology and colonialism give the narrative sinew. We last saw boyish hero Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his ferociously loyal mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) on the desert planet Arrakis, in the company of its indigenous, Bedouin-like nomad warriors the Fremen. The house of Atreides has been otherwise massacred in a sneak attack by the forces of slug-like, bloated Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), with the secret blessing of Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken). Arrakis is the source of the Spice trade the Empire relies on, now mined by the Harkonnens under threat from mammoth sandworms and Fremen guerillas. Paul riding a sandworm deserves a giant screen for its roaring sound and vision, and he’s accepted by some Fremen as a promised messiah, a faith Jessica cynically encourages with her own new psychic powers. Paul and his Fremen beloved Chani (Zendaya) meanwhile waltz in the dunes at dusk like Astaire and Rogers, but nightmare visions of holy war slaughter in his name make Paul resist his calling, till it consumes him. Javier Bardem ekes rare humour from his Fremen leader Stilgar’s credulous faith in this kid messiah. Levity isn’t, though, Villeneuve’s gig. From the punishing child kidnap hit Prisoners (2013) to the philosophical, moving sf of Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), he increasingly rivals Christopher Nolan in serious ideas at epic scale. His imagery has more fluid poetry than Nolan’s sometimes clunky grandeur, and there’s a sense here of moving through shifting dunes on a planet where all is dust, bar bone-white caverns where ice-blue liquids transmute souls. Haddoken colonists meanwhile deploy squat, gun-metal black, Gigeresque machines. Tight close-ups of actors filmed in the fabled magic hour add warmly human elements to the digital splendour and intricate, thrusting narrative. Elsewhere, the Emperor’s daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) plots her own survival, and Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother pits her machinations against Jessica’s, each ruthlessly deploying acolytes resembling Christians and Muslims. This Dune’s female balance includes Zendaya’s rough-edged Fremen heroine and Lea Séydoux’s Lady Margot, effortless seductress of new villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’s unrecognisable Austin Butler, pictured above left with Seydoux), a psychopathic pawn in bigger games. Seen together, Séydoux and Butler could be Eros and Thanatos. Only Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings compares as a saga, and at 5½ hours to date (more is planned), Dune has the virtue of relative brevity – a climactic battle Jackson would wallow in is swiftly tactical here. You can debate Villeneuve’s po-faced, unfashionably reverent attitude, and mourn Jodorowsky’s madly impossible, abandoned Seventies Dune dream (David Lynch’s 1984 version meanwhile remains serviceably strange). This Dune doesn’t lodge long in the heart. Villeneuve has though built a remarkable world filled with timely ideas. Prophecy devastatingly shadows pageantry, in the grimly triumphal end."

"Mar 4, 2024",positive," The review embargo is up. I can now talk about Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part II” which is a much more entertaining film than the first one. The scores, so far, are 79 on Metacritic and 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. I was told by Warner Bros not to mention too much of the plot, so I won’t really discuss the story at length here. All of this to say that ‘Dune 2’ is pure spectacle filmmaking. It’s as ambitious a studio film as I’ve seen in quite a bit of time. If the first one was all about building character and worlds, this one just goes straight for the jugular. It’s partly a road movie as Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) hide in the mountains of Arakkis with the Fremen. Paul is starting to be seen as this messianic figure, and word is quickly spreading, that he might be “The One.” Meanwhile, Villeneuve manages to tackle multiple storylines in the process. The Harkonnen, who mass murdered Paul’s family and the Atreides, have retaken hold of the spice fields. The scenes that take place in House of Harkonnen are shot in color, but photographed in this nightmaresque grey and black. The third storyline involves the Bene Gesserit Order and the Emperor (Christopher Walken) who purposely set up House of Atreides’ fall at the hands of the Harkonnen. Florence Pugh plays Princess Irulan, the only person wise enough to realize that her people’s demise might be near. What we have here is a revenge story. Paul wants to seek revenge on the Harkonnen and the Bene Gesserit, and to do so he’ll have to convince the millions of Fremen that he is their messiah. It’s a meaty and involving story that involves 166 minutes of tactical planning and constant chess pieces being moved left, right and center. The cast assembled here helps hide some of the flaws — particularly the overlength. Chalamet is great. Zendaya expertly nails Chani’s inner demons. There are also these muscular effective performances from Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin and, best of all, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen. Herbert’s novel, and the movies, tackle religion, war, revenge, and romance. These topics are ageless. Paul’s reluctance to accept his fate comes from the fact that he knows that the only way to “win” and get the revenge he seeks is to also fully inhabit fascist tendencies. The only way to conquer evil is to be evil. How’s that for topical relevance? Technically speaking, ‘Dune 2’ is a marvel, the sand worm sequences have never been more visceral, and the breathless scope of the sets are mesmerizingly realized. And yet, Villeneuve doesn’t lose sight of the the intimacy of his characters. Amidst the chaos, Paul and Chani are falling in love, but it’s always tackled in subdued fashion. Never overbearing to the story at hand.  The result is a staggering statement of near biblical approach — a risk-taking endeavor to storytelling that threatens to derail at any minute, but is kept whole by Villeneuve’s smartly conceived narrative. The ending is a bit of a mess, but by that point you really don’t care as you’re fully invested in the stakes at hand.  Yes, there are some dated tropes in “Dune.” The book, first published in 1965, was one of the blueprints that George Lucas used to make “Star Wars,” and the fact that Lucas’ films have been copied to death by other sci-fi films doesn’t help Dune’s case for 2024 freshness. "
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," The inevitable analogy of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two as The Empire Strikes Back to Dune: Part One’s Star Wars was recently highlighted by Christopher Nolan. The Empire Strikes Back has become the paradigmatic genre sequel that surpasses the original, and the standard by which every ambitious second film in a series is measured. And the debt of George Lucas’s Star Wars mythos to Frank Herbert’s Dune novels (a corrupt galactic empire, a quasi-religious order with mind-control powers, etc.) is substantial enough to make comparisons unavoidable. When the sequel depicts the young protagonist going into hiding, undergoing intense training and visionary trials, and eventually confronting a terrible revelation about his ancestry — all visualized on an overwhelming scale, with images of staggering power and utterly persuasive visual effects — the comparison becomes almost redundant. Yet it would be equally true, if not truer, to call Villeneuve’s Dune movies a kind of anti–Star Wars. I’m tempted to call them the definitive anti–Star Wars movies, and Dune: Part Two the anti–Empire Strikes Back. Indeed, to speak as I did above of the “Star Wars mythos” suggests the characterization of the Dune saga as an anti-myth. For all that Lucas drew from Dune in crafting his galaxy far, far away, the whole outlook and tone of Star Wars owes more to inspirations celebrating the triumph of good over evil, from conventional Westerns and serialized sci-fi swashbucklers to J.R.R. Tolkien’s implicitly Catholic The Lord of the Rings. By the end of Dune: Part Two, it’s clear that while the idea of “the triumph of good over evil” is popular in some regions of the Dune universe, that idea is a cruel lie in a harsh cosmos with no lack of overwhelmingly evil forces and Machiavellian power players, but a dearth of powers worth rooting for. Villeneuve’s two-part story offers a “Hero’s Journey” story that throws a deeply skeptical light on the very idea of heroism; an instance of what anthropologist Manvir Singh dubbed the “Sympathetic Plot” with a protagonist who is in some ways strikingly unsympathetic. And while the Jedi mysticism of Star Wars could be called, if not pro-religious, at least “spirituality-positive,” the Dune saga offers a mixed critique of Abrahamic-style faith. In Star Wars, skeptical characters who mock “sad devotion” or “hokey religions” sooner or later learn the error of their cynicism. In Dune: Part Two, warnings like “If you want to control people, you tell them a messiah will come…they’ll wait for centuries” and “This prophecy is how they enslave us!” come from the most sympathetic and grounded character, the young Fremen woman Chani, played by Zendaya. At the same time, perhaps reflecting the director’s mixed feelings about his Catholic upbringing, faith in Villeneuve’s Dune films is double-edged. While religion can function as a tool of manipulation and oppression, it can also enable people to do the otherwise impossible, such as survive in the harshest regions of the desert planet of Arrakis. It’s no coincidence that it’s the “uninhabitable” south that we find the most devout Fremen, the ones waiting for a messiah figure. Faith can even be a force of resistance, as Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulen points out to her father, Christopher Walken’s Emperor, warning him against using military force against devout opponents: “You underestimate the power of faith.” In my reviews of Dune: Part One and now Dune: Part Two (filed and pending publication; stay tuned!) I’ve written a bit comparing and contrasting Dune with Star Wars. Here I’d like to consider Star Wars in relation to The Lord of the Rings and J.R.R. Tolkien’s larger legendarium."

"Mar 4, 2024",positive," En el año 2021 ocurrieron muchas cosas en el mundo del cine. Y pocas fueron buenas. El parón obligatorio de la emergencia sanitaria de la pandemia retrasó proyectos, llevó a otros directamente a la cancelación y reformuló el panorama. Sin embargo, uno de los grandes eventos memorables fue la llegada al cine de la segunda adaptación de “Dune” de Frank Herbert.  Esta vez, la obra tenía una solidez elegante y fría, más cercana al relato mitológico que a la épica. También era una exploración cuidadosa en las preocupaciones y tensiones de la novela original de la saga literaria, conocida por su densidad. Con docenas de libros que relatan y añaden información a la historia central, “Dune” se consideró inadaptable por más de treinta años. Desde los intentos de Alejandro Jodorowsky de abarcar todo el trasfondo a la inesperada pobreza narrativa de David Lynch. Lo cierto es que el relato fundacional de la ciencia ficción contemporánea atravesó docenas de manos y de bocetos. Finalmente, vio luz en una puesta en escena sobria, que el director Denis Villeneuve utilizó con un objetivo en particular: brindar contexto a la obra en general a costa de la espectacularidad de la obra en pantalla. Fue, desde luego, una decisión arriesgada. “Dune” llegó a los cines con la potencia de una narración que contenía a otras tantas. Después de todo, la novela de Herbert es el origen de varias de las aventuras en la galaxia más conocidas: “Star Wars”, la más obvia. De modo que cualquier cosa que Denis Villeneuve intentara parecería visto, trillado o al menos repetido. El realizador entonces tomó la decisión suicida con una premisa de semejante envergadura. Ir en sentido contrario y atenerse a lo simple, muscular y primitivo de todas las inquietudes del escritor y la forma en que el conjunto de novelas, las exploró con cuidado. El resultado fue, entonces, una cinta que anunciaba una franquicia, al menos una trilogía. No de la forma tramposa, levemente ridícula y forzada de las películas de Marvel, con sus argumentos incompletos y escenas poscréditos utilitarias. El guion de Denis Villeneuve, Eric Roth y Jon Spaihts, tomó los mitos imaginados por Herbert y los depuró hasta hacerlos más digeribles y mucho más compactos que la narración literaria. “Dune” mostró las raíces de lo que vendría después, su utilidad y la forma en que la narración inicial acerca de Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) podría funcionar a futuro. Incluso, se tomó el atrevimiento de no mostrar a las criaturas temibles, centro de toda la trama. Los gusanos de arena apenas brotaron de Arrakis en dos ocasiones como una imagen movediza en la tempestad. Lo que dejó claro que “Dune”, con todo y su elegancia metódica, sólo era la preparación para algo más en lenta sucesión. Esa “otra cosa”, llega y sobradamente con “Dune: parte dos”, que deja clara la ambición central de la película anterior y del universo entero, ahora sí, mostrado en todo su esplendor. La cinta de Denis Villeneuve podría ser la mejor película de ciencia ficción de la década, no sólo a escala, sino en su cuidadosa planeación. Sin perder el tiempo en detalles que ya planteó su predecesora, la trama va directo al grano. La derrota (aparente) de los Atreides tuvo repercusiones inmediatas. Por lo que en un giro de habilidad sorprendente, el cineasta hace imprescindible la primera película, sin que sea necesaria para sostener la actual. El leve matiz puede parecer contradictorio, pero no lo es. Se trata de que “Dune”, en su carácter de elemento fundacional para entender todo lo que se cuenta en el presente del mundo que plantea, hace más rica la experiencia, pero no anula la que llega ahora a la pantalla grande. Villeneuve analiza la historia en su naturaleza de rompecabezas. Saber acerca del origen de la revolución que emerge de la arena ardiente hace doblemente satisfactorio su existencia. Pero no saberlo, no disminuye el placer de ver “Dune: parte dos”. De modo que la cinta empieza sin preámbulos. De las palabras en Fremen que abren la acción y que recuerdan la importancia de la especia Melange, siguen las palabras de la princesa Irulan (Florence Pugh). La hija del emperador explica los detalles de la carnicería en primer plano. Los Harkonnen, amparados bajo el músculo del soberano del Universo Conocido (Christopher Walken) están decididos a convertir a Arrakis en un feudo particular. La cámara transforma los espacios pálidos bajo el sol en un genocidio total que apunta a un solo culpable: el Barón (Stellan Skarsgård), que ahora es uno de los hombres más importantes de la galaxia. Eso después de arrasar por completo con los Atreides. Con esa simple escena, Villeneuve se aleja de otras tantas sagas intergalácticas y hace de la suya un lugar lóbrego, temible, retorcido. Lo interesante de “Dune: parte dos” es el hecho de conseguir que una narración que parece contada en docenas de ocasiones y de formas más vistosas, tenga algo de original. También de sofisticado y de poderoso, en especial a medida que el entrenamiento de Paul (más sombrío, enfurecido, puro propósito concentrado), llena la pantalla y conduce la acción. A su lado, Chani (Zendaya, magnífica y silenciosa, la encarnación de los pueblos del desierto), es la representación viva de los desterrados al extrarradio. Así que su relación con este Mesías que podría no serlo, abre un puente entre el resto del universo y los que dominan la portentosa especia, moneda de cambio en la obra de Herbert.  Gradualmente, la batalla entre ambas facciones se hará total y letal. Tan violenta como para volverse un elemento casi orgánico que la película asume como escenario central. Mientras todo ocurre, Paul intenta comprender cuál es su lugar en esta historia, vengándose, pero a la vez consciente de que su naturaleza como líder bien podría ser impostada. Villeneuve juega con la idea de lo ético que tanto atormentó al personaje en el libro, para convertirlo en una madurez oscura que le arrebata sus últimas trazas de inocencia y quizás, de nobleza. La guerra santa espera en el futuro. Pero ahora mismo, Paul (y su madre Jessica, interpretada por Rebecca Ferguson, con un tono espectral y psicótico) forjan las alianzas para cimentar su triunfo. Es entonces cuando Villeneuve se juega el todo por el todo, para llevar a la cinta a un terreno que deslumbra por ser una osadía en tiempos de imágenes sin arte, destinadas a sorprender sin profundizar. Pero el director va en un sentido por completo nuevo. Con los gusanos de arena emergiendo del desierto como bestias imparables, la película roza lo colosal sin renunciar a su mensaje en el trasfondo. ¿Qué es lo que logrará Paul, venciendo a sus enemigos, alcanzando el poder en una coyuntura que le obligará a actuar según una profecía? La película no lo responde, tampoco es su interés. Uno de los grandes triunfos de esta épica majestuosa es no ser sencilla, ni en planteamiento o desarrollo. Antes que eso, Villeneuve va a lo complejo, a la cuestión del triunfo justiciero, como la llama que está a punto de encender por completo el Universo Conocido, escenario del libro y película. A la luz de “Dune: parte dos” una buena cantidad de épicas espaciales parecen infantiles, menores, simples, mal construidas. La cinta, que alcanza su tope máximo y se vuelve impredecible para sus últimos treinta minutos, demuestra que es mucho más que una cuidadosa adaptación. Es un mundo en expansión, tan elaborado como para dejar sin aliento a sus héroes, que pasan casi a un panteón Olímpico privado. Al público, en la butaca, tomado por sorpresa por esta obra de arte construida con mimo hasta el más mínimo detalle.  Entre ambas cosas, Villeneuve muestra su visión y da un paso al vacío. Solo que a diferencia de sus personajes, le eleva el coraje de acometer un riesgo y triunfar. Terminada la película — que bien podría ser la conclusión de la historia en pantalla — los cabos sueltos, sostienen el entramado. Las preguntas sin responder no importan tanto como el prodigio de un relato semejante, en una época de cine simple. Una herencia para la posteridad. "
"Mar 4, 2024",positive," “Duna: Parte 2” es la continuación de su predecesora en el más puro sentido de la palabra. Lo que Denis Villeneuve ha hecho con el filme es terminar de adaptar la primera novela de la saga de Frank Herbert de la manera más respetuosa posible, continuando con el estilo establecido en la primera película, y cambiando y acortado y alargado elementos narrativos y de personajes cuando lo creía necesario, sin ir en contra del espíritu de la obra original. El resultado, por supuesto, es excelente; un “blockbuster” de gran magnitud que mucho nos dice sobre la colonización, la apropiación cultural, el fervor religioso, y la forma en que percibimos a nuestros líderes. “Duna: Parte 2” me gustó incluso más que su predecesora. Al comenzar la película, vemos como Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet) y su madre, la embarazada Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), viven relativamente tranquilos en el planeta desértico Arrakis con los Fremen, liderados por Stilgar (Javier Bardem), quien cree sin reparos en la venida de un nuevo mesías llamado Lisan al Gaib. Jessica, siguiendo el trabajo de las Bene Gesseret, sigue difundiendo las historias sobre su hijo, para hacerle creer a todos los Fremen que ÉL eventualmente se convertirá en Lisan al Gaib, mientras que Paul se concentra en aprender las costumbres de su nueva gente, enamorándose de la aguerrida Chani (Zendaya) quien, a diferencia de Stilgar, no cree en las profecías para nada. Pero tal y como Paul había estado viendo en sus visiones, la Guerra Santa se avecina. En su propio planeta, el Emperador del Universo Conocido Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken, a quien da gusto ver en el cine después de tiempo) se preocupa por los rumores sobre Lisan al Gaib, mientras su hija la Princesa Irulan (Florence Pugh) conversa con las Bene Gesseret sobre la venida del mesías. Mientras tanto, el Barón Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) decide mandar a su psicótico sobrino, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) a Arrakis para que lo ayude a controlar las reservas de Especia, y con algo de suerte, acabar con Paul. Todas estas historias (y hasta un par más) eventualmente se cruzan, resultando en el potencial cumplimiento del destino de Paul. A diferencia de otras películas fantásticas sobre héroes valientes, “Duna: Parte 2” no tiene miedo de adaptar con precisión los elementos más oscuros de la novela de Frank Herbert. Por ende, uno se va dando cuenta gradualmente del camino que Paul está tomando —por más de que al inicio no lo quiera—, el cual acabará en guerra y destrucción. Después de todo, se trata de un mesías que no ha llegado “orgánicamente”, si no más bien después de siglos de manipulación por parte de las Bene Gesseret, las maestras titiriteras de la galaxia que trabajan siempre en las sombras. Evidentemente, Paul tiene sus propias motivaciones y al final del día toma decisiones claras en relación a su destino, pero uno no puede evitar sentir que se trata de un muñeco que está siendo controlado por fuerzas incluso superiores a él. Consideren, si no, a Lady Jessica, quien como personaje es una excelente representación del concepto de apropiación cultural. Es una mujer que se convierte en una figura religiosa importante prácticamente a la fuerza, y que comienza a utilizar la ropa y las costumbres de la gente que la ha recibido para cumplir con los deseos de las Bene Gesseret. O también consideren a Chani, quien como parte del proceso de adaptación, tiene un rol un poco distinto al que tiene en la novela original. Aquí, es la contraparte de Paul: lo ama y confía en él, pero a la vez, no cree e la profecía, y mientras él se va convirtiendo en una figura mesiánica, ella se va alejando más, dándose cuenta de que su pareja no es más que un instrumento de control: un líder que busca “llevar al paraíso” a los Fremen, pero potencialmente a cambio de su libertad. Es así, pues, que “Duna: Parte 2” logra esquivar cualquier comparación a las estereotípicas historias tipo “salvador blanco” que hemos visto ya varias veces en el cine, porque precisamente eso es lo que critica. Nos presenta a personajes aparentemente heroicos o valerosos, que al final del día llegan a un planeta ajeno para convertirse en sus salvadores, agarrando sus costumbres y aparentemente cumpliendo con sus historias, mientras son manipulados por fuerzas más poderosas. Obviamente el espectador empatiza con Paul y Chani y Stligar (quien es caracterizado como un fundamentalista religioso, completamente convencido de la naturaleza mesiánica de Paul), pero también logra entender que la transformación del primero no es algo que debe ser celebrado. De hecho, Villeneuve lo presenta, hacia el final de la película, casi como una secuencia de terror, y no como un hecho heroico. Como se deben imaginar, y al igual que la primera cinta, “Duna: Parte 2” es una maravilla técnica. Pocas veces se ve hoy en día un “blockbuster” que cuente con efectos visuales prácticamente perfectos, pero eso es precisamente lo que tiene esta producción. Los diferentes mundos presentados, desde Arrakis hasta el planeta de los Harkonnen (que luce espectacular gracias a una fotografía en blanco y negro con un “look” similar al de la luz ultravioleta) son completamente convincentes, y las secuencias de acción son de una escala impresionante. Hasta me atrevería a decir que “Duna: Parte 2” luce mejor que su predecesora, la cual ya de por sí carecía de defectos visuales. De las actuaciones tampoco hay quejas. Timotheé Chalamet nos otorga la actuación más madura de su carrera, desarrollado de forma creíble la transformación gradual de Paul, quien pasa de ser un chico gentil y fuerte a presentarse como un Salvador violento y vengativo. Por su parte, Zendaya es como la voz de la razón en la historia; uno nunca duda que Chani está enamorada de Paul, pero a la vez entiende lo mucho que se opone a buena parte de sus acciones. Es un romance complejo, entonces, casi como un “jala y empuja” entre los dos chicos: ella trata de jalarlo a una realidad más inmediata, mientras que él la empuja para tomar el camino de su destino mesiánico. El hecho de que la película termine de la forma en que termina, nos dice mucho sobre Chani, y sobre lo que pasará (o podría pasar) en la tercera entrega. Como Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson está espectacular; le otorga suficiente ambigüedad como para dejarlo a uno con varias preguntas sobre “sus planes dentro de planes”. Javier Bardem, por su parte, tiene algunas de las mejores líneas de diálogo de la película (y incluso le extrajo algunas risas al público en mi sala); Austin Butler es suficientemente intimidante como el psicopático Feyd-Rautha, y Christopher Walken hace bastante con el breve rol del Emperador Shaddam IV. Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux y Anya Taylor-Joy tienen roles pequeños pero importantes, que seguramente se expandirán en la siguiente película, “Duna: Mesías”. “Duna: Parte 2” sirve como el perfecto ejemplo de lo que Denis Villeneuve es capaz de hacer con un gran presupuesto, un excelente reparto, y una ambiciosa fuente de inspiración. Se trata de un “blockbuster” espectacular, de increíbles efectos visuales, secuencias de acción de gran escala, y personajes de nombres complicados. Pero a la vez, se trata, también, de una historia reflexiva sobre el poder del fanatismo religioso, el peligro que representan los líderes con demasiado poder, y las consecuencias del colonialismo. Es una película potente que debería calar en el público incluso más que su predecesora, y que espero sea lo suficientemente exitosa como para garantizar la realización de “Duna: Mesías”. Villeneuve merece completar la trilogía, especialmente si logra mantener este altísimo nivel de calidad. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

"Mar 4, 2024",negative," In “Dune: Part Two” the prophecy of al Gaib comes to life, Muad’Dib carves the path from boy to prophet, and Villeneuve sets up a grandiose vision that seems to be focused on the second novel, “Dune: Messiah.” Unfortunately, the film has baffling decisions in nearly every battle sequence during its runtime. With stilted fight choreography, awful CGI explosions, terrible overhead structure rendering (particularly in the final portion of the film), and inept ground-tearing visual effects during its sandworm ride sequences. It’s a wonder that the film isn’t more polished in its post-production visual effects after being delayed from November 3rd, 2023. Villeneuve capably and reliably convinces when his images are blocked from the knee down, but when the vision expands, his choices and quite likely his budget limitations keep him from successfully delivering his vision. “Dune: Part Two” is a bit oddity, its frames are composed in a thoughtful way leading the audience through some of the broader beats of the novel, but the characters don’t linger, their moments fade quickly, and the nuances of relationships so important on the page fade and end up mostly seeming immaterial during the film. Chalamet and Zendaya can share a look that satisfies but their actual moments and the content of their speech fail to resonate. It’s like viewing an impression of a human relationship you can see it, but you can’t feel it. Javier Bardem’s Stilgar is the most resounding success that Villeneuve makes as he builds toward “Dune: Messiah.” Stilgar, the Naib of Sietch Tabr in the film is a slight departure from the Stilgar of the books, with Villeneuve’s interpretation separating the Northern and Southern Fremen from one another by casting the Southern Fremen as fundamentalist believers in the Bene Gesserit prophecy sewn on Arrakis. Bardem’s devout interpretation of the character throughout the film is an effective choice that Villeneuve makes in his somewhat altered vision of the first Dune novel and accomplishes a significant amount of heavy lifting for a third film should there be one. The first “Dune” film from David Lynch while flawed in many ways did have an element of humanity to it, a quirkiness, an aliveness that is absent from Villeneuve’s adaption. For all his formal competence I can’t say that I find this rendition to be any better than the 1984 adaption. Sometimes campiness can be a feature, not a bug, and the sterility of this interpretation has me longing for that seemingly more human and jovial interpretation of the text than this mathematical and distant one.  Despite the film’s various faults, Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul is effective, his performance conveys the journey from boy to Kwizatz Haderach as well as anyone could imagine. When the film centers on real locations and real structures and props Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Villeneuve’s vision come through clearly. Unfortunately, the film is heavily reliant on visual effects that often look poor at best."
"Mar 3, 2024",positive," It may only be March 1, but this feels like this could be the most anticipated film of 2024. Dune: Part Two is finally here and playing constantly at a theater near you. As visually and technically impressive as any film you have ever seen. This is true cinematic craftsmanship and everyone is working at the top of their game. It is hard to believe Dune devotees will not absolutely love this. The early reactions have been insanely positive and there are so many moments that people will be talking about for a long time. I’ll quietly wait my turn and ask, “Are we not being seduced by the expansive vision and presentation of Dune and giving a pass to the delivery of the actual story? Do we even care about the story all that much?” If the 2021 Dune was not your jam, Dune: Part Two may impress you more from a cinematic standpoint, but there isn’t much here to change one’s opinion. I’m not alone in believing the big barrier for a lot of people to conquer with Dune is that the characters and inherit connection to said characters remains at an arms length. Though Villeneuve gets strong performances from an impressive cast, some find it hard to retain, remember, and invest in the Paul Atreides story.  The Northern Lights. The Great Pyramid. Machu Picchu. The Eiffel Tower. The Statue of Liberty. Dune: Part Two. Having spent a few days on #FilmTwitter and watching the film side of TikTok, here is what I can surmise when it comes to reactions to Dune: Part Two: This movie is among the greatest visual sights that a human eye can witness. Also, this is apparently the greatest sequel of all time. And as one X user and movie reviewer tweeted, “(Dune: Part Two is)...the most visually impressive movie I’ve seen - an assault on all the senses.” To be fair, the already infamous popcorn bucket to promote the film may be an assault on all the senses…but I digress.Seems that people have lost their ever-loving minds over Denis Villenueve’s sequel to 2021’s ambitious, expansive, six-time Oscar winner. In completing the rest of Frank Herbert’s substantial 1965 science-fiction novel, Dune: Part Two is the latest example of a film that someone cannot love enough. I know this firsthand - I heaped praise on it for a good three or four minutes with someone who has also seen the film…only to then be asked why I did not like it. Some of us have been down this road before with 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, a cinematic juggernaut that has developed a cult-like (and rather cutthroat) fanbase. Apparently that film and Dune: Part Two are perfect movies. In that case, I suppose our work here is done. Once you encounter the perfect version of something, there is really nothing left to discuss or analyze, right?At the risk of committing blasphemy or some form of cinematic treason, I would suggest to #FilmTwitter and FilmTok and everyone else within earshot, that Dune: Part Two is not perfect. Yet, I recognize that the hyperbolic reactions come from an understandable place. Villenueve’s sequel is cinematic excellence, staggering and breathtaking to watch on a big screen. In this installment, the story is not bogged down as much by the need for incessant world-building. Dune: Part Two is more accessible, less convoluted, and full of performances which may define careers. Timothée Chalamet, for example, may henceforth become synonymous with the name Paul Atreides, as Mark Hamill is with Luke Skywalker and a young Harrison Ford with Indiana Jones. A groundbreaking work of art, the craftsmanship, the technical aspects, the vision and scope is all exceptional. Dune: Part Two is an embodiment of filmmakers, in nearly every capacity, functioning at the top of their game.Who knows - it might even be possible that the 2025 Oscars may have already found its next Best Picture winner before 2024’s winner is even announced. When you dig deeper and delve into the execution around the storytelling, that’s where gaffes and blemishes start to surface. I will humbly ask this: “Do we really care about the story or are we just blown away at a really amazing exhibit of images, sounds, and spectacle?” To me, though a more engaging and impressive achievement than the 2021 opener, Part Two still feels like a film trying to find the emotional ties it needs to truly embed within our hearts and minds.Herbert’s book, by the end, evolves into a story of religious fanaticism and, honestly, to me, can be largely reduced down to the old cliché that absolute power corrupts absolutely. In Paul, we have a character who continues to be shown a darker path, seduced by a more nefarious approach to help solve the perceived ills of his kingdom. As the dust jacket closes on Herbert’s novel, Paul has embraced a bleak, somewhat shocking path, and here we see his moves partially guided by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Forgive me if I wonder out loud whether her story might be the most interesting story being told in Dune: Part One and Two. Silly me… there I go questioning perfection again.

Forgive me if I wonder out loud whether her story might be the most interesting story being told in Dune: Part One and Two. Silly me… there I go questioning perfection again. Chalamet is dynamic this time around, more comfortable standing front and center in the middle of an epic science-fiction adventure. Alongside Zendaya’s warrior Chani, they present a hope and romanticism to the potential good that can come from Paul aligning himself with the Fremen, people native to the planet Arrakis. Inevitably, the Fremen are on a collision course with the tyranny of the Harkonnen clan, led by the slovenly Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), his bumbling nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) and eventually aided by a second, younger nephew, the menacing Feyd-Rautha, portrayed by a terrifying Austin Butler.While spice is always the harbinger for conflict and war in this world, malevolence shapes the decisions of many this time around. Paul’s mother, upset that he has chosen an alliance with the Fremen, wriggles her way not only into the Fremen’s world, but finds herself steered into the occult-like command of the Bene Gesserit, a coven of women with psychic abilities. Working in shadows, they have a unique control over manipulating power dynamics in the “Duniverse.” As battles break out, tensions amplify, and the Harkonnen House attempts to take control of Arrakis and eradicate the Fremen once and for all, the Bene Gesserit are always watching.With Dune, in full disclosure, I struggle with an apathy that clouds my retention of lots and lots of details from Herbert’s and Villenueve’s visions for this story. I feel constantly in “catch-up” mode here. Another struggle commonplace in adapting “Dune” from page to screen is the notion of less is more. I love how Villenueve and his team have built Arrakis in these two films. The seemingly endless desert landscapes, the intermittent rocky terrain, and the cold, impersonal internal set design by Oscar winners Patrice Vermette, Zsuzsanna Sipos and Shane Vieau is exactly what it needs to be. That simplicity fails to carry over in the story being told. And again, that’s where Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts seem to struggle the most.Villenueve can craft exciting moments. Dune: Part Two offers several: Feyd-Rautha’s entrance into the film is stunning, a gladiator fight he participates in is constructed exceptionally well, as is Paul’s important early encounter with a sandworm. The emergence of Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh as Emperor Shaddam and his daughter, Princess Irulan, is important, offering a diabolical level of psychological manipulation to the story that forces Paul to reconsider everything he stands for and has fought for up to this point.There is so much to admire and praise here, Dune: Part Two is too big to ignore and a major cinematic event. Though even with Chalamet quite convincing and Zendaya terrific in creating a character of depth, hesitant to trust and love while retaining a protective armor with her well-being, I remain at an arms length. While I love so much of what happens here, I remain a window shopper, unable to commit to any emotional investment in the gorgeous visuals placed before me.

"Mar 3, 2024",positive," There is perhaps nothing more exhilarating than nearly three hours trapped in a chaotic, futuristic universe. I might be in the minority on this one, but I could spend a solid hour staring at sand when writer-director Denis Villeneuve is behind the camera. It helps that, in this case, the story he develops is complex in imagery, with worlds, creatures, and evolved humans that require extensive time in the make-up chair and post-production. There is so much food for fodder, and, in this metaphor, Villeneuve is a Michelin-star chef. But the story is also universal in its themes of good triumphing over evil and fate versus free will. There is something for nearly everyone. A complex political landscape filled with ancient royal families from different planets? Yes, please. Epic, sweeping shots of a desert planet guarded by omnivorous, gargantuan worm monsters? Oh yeah. A true-love-doomed storyline harkening straight back to Shakespeare? Swoon. Top it off with a hairless, eyebrow-less, ink-toothed Austin Butler, and you can sign me right up! For my fellow sci-fi, world-building juggernauts, ""Dune: Part Two"" is pretty darn perfect.  The first installment was a favorite of ours back in 2021. ""Part Two"" is the sequel of all sequels. With a nearly three-hour runtime, the film simply cannot give us enough Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the prophesied messiah of the Freman people. His journey to accepting his pre-determined fate is a tale nearly as old as time. Though it will feel like a familiar plight, ""Dune"" was written by Tacoma-born Frank Herbert some 10 years before ""Star Wars"" and 30 years before ""Harry Potter."" Paul Atreides is, therefore, the OG of young white male saviors preordained for greatness. In Chalamet's hands (and perfectly coifed curls), I've become a ""Dune"" convert. In case you forgot, the young Atreides has been forced out into the brutal desert landscape of Arrakis, a planet highly desirable for its natural resource known as Spice. It's a highly addictive substance that has become essential to life 20,000 years from now. It can only be harvested in the conditions on that planet, which means various political families are vying for the privilege of overseeing the mining efforts. But the foreign powers are hit with resistance by the Fremen, a subculture of humans who have adapted to live on Arrakis' most uninhabitable regions, surviving on little water and moving within the sand as easily as a bird in the sky. They are self-appointed guardians of the planet, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Their bright blue irises are acquired by their long exposure to spice, and their belief system revolves around the imminent arrival of the Lisan al Gaib, the son of a Bene Gesserit, an ancient society of powerful women who have harnessed supernatural mental and physical abilities. As the myth goes, the Lisan al Gaib will one day appear on Arrakis and lead them to freedom and paradise. Paul Atreides - or, as I like to call him for all my fellow Potterheads, the boy who Lisan al Gaib - sits precariously at the center of the action. He is the sole heir to one of the most powerful family dynasties in the solar system. He is believed to be dead by all except the Fremen, who have taken him under their wing. And he has the immeasurable powers inherited from his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to lead the Fremen in revolt against the status quo. He alone is ready to contend with the corruption of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his greedy underling Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), the leader of the house assigned to usurp Paul's family as Arrakis' slave driver. Of all the characters receiving fuller arcs in this film, Jessica is by and far the most wild metamorphosis. She transforms from a relatively shy and insecure mother and wife to a conniving, omniscient and authoritative Reverend Mother of the Fremen. This process requires drinking the poison pulled from a sandworm and experiencing ""spice agony,"" thereby awakening her ""Other Memory"" to see the future. Ferguson has proven her versatility throughout her career, but this role really shows audiences her fierce control of every scene she's in and the emotional manipulation she commits without letting anyone in on the ruse.  That could be said of much of the cast, as well. There isn't a weak performance or unsteady singular moment in the film. Austin Butler makes his appearance halfway through as Feyd-Rautha, Baron Harkonnen's nephew. We saw and heard Butler mutate into Elvis last year, and, in this film, his voice pitches to impeccably imitate Skarsgård's Swedish accent. At times, it's hard to forget he isn't one of the Skarsgård brothers we see frequently in similar evil roles. Aided by facial prosthetics and movie magic, Butler terrorizes every time he's on screen. Despite its many side stories and intricate family trees, the plot of ""Dune"" is as straightforward as it comes. There are very obvious good guys (the oppressed Fremen seeking liberation) and even more conventional bad guys (the fear-inducing Harkonnen, whose hairless bodies look to have never seen the sun and whose merciless and cruel tendencies make them feel like distant cousins to Voldemort). The forbidden love between Chalamet’s Paul and Zendaya’s Chani is a nice touch to round out the story. As much I enjoy Zendaya, her role here is more as a dissenting viewpoint to the other Fremen's fawning adoration over their messiah. She's also a combative romantic interest who challenges Paul. If he weren't so focused on, I don't know, saving an entire population of living souls, this could almost be a happy love story. But alas, it's not a rom-com. This is as high fantasy-science fiction as they come, and, thankfully, in the hands of visionary Villeneuve, this continuation film is told with spectacular special effects, an epic setting, solid performances and a script that steadily develops these larger-than-life characters until viewers will feel like they are eyewitnesses to the future. It would be helpful to have seen the first part, but even without the context, ""Part Two"" is a breathtaking trip to another world, a fever dream from which we never want to wake."
"Mar 3, 2024",negative," Dune: Part Two hits the ground running. Well, make that walking. Paul Atredies (Timothée Chalamet) and his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are in the hands of Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) as he shepherds them to safety across the northern desert of Arrakis. There’s nothing in the way of a recap, but I’m not certain one is required. Paul and Jessica are on the run from the Harkonnen, and winning the trust of the Fremen is the key to their survival. That’s basically it. Of course, Frank Herbert’s sprawling source material is far more complex than that, and much like they did with 2021’s Academy Award–winning Dune, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts have gone out of their way to transfer as many of the author’s themes and subplots to the screen as they can. This adaptation of the second half of the book is a sprawling, visually dynamic affair, and it overflows in outstanding moments and with sequences of auditory brilliance. However, much like its predecessor, I found this sequel frequently cold and emotionally barren at the most inopportune times. The second half is particularly monotonous as Paul trudges toward a destiny he does not want and presciently believes will be his damnation — and by extension the universe’s. Villeneuve stages several eye-popping set pieces but then all too often resolves them with abrupt suddenness. The film is all exhilarating buildup leading to an unsatisfactory, and even somewhat perfunctory, payoff. While I was impressed with the director’s cinematic gusto, I was equally disappointed by how little I cared about the majority of the characters or their plights. Not that I thought any of this during the picture’s opening half. It is during this section that Paul settles in with the Fremen and starts becoming a valuable asset in their fight against the Harkonnen. Chalamet is at his best here, and whether it’s bantering back and forth with a surprisingly relaxed (and often very, very funny) Bardem or working toward a thorny romantic entanglement with Zendaya (returning as the respected Fremen warrior Chani), the foundation he fabricates for Paul’s eventual transformation into the fabled Kwisatz Haderach is a solid one. Everything builds to the moment when Paul — now known by the Fremen as “Muad’Dib” — must pass a final test of manhood and ride a sandworm. It’s also the most noticeable instance in which Villeneuve uncorks a sequence of jaw-dropping kinetic magnificence — only for things to conclude with an unfinished thud. Paul calls the worm, composer Hans Zimmer (The Creator) conducts his intensely confrontational score with vitriolic urgency, cinematographer Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty) crafts one awe-inspiring image after another, and the line between practical and computer-generated visual effects vanishes entirely. But while all of this looks and sounds stunning, there is no emotional payoff. Villeneuve quickly moves events along to focus on other characters and additional subplots. Considering there’s so much story to be told, this isn’t shocking. In the same breath, keeping things in such an unfinished state robs Paul of the necessary interior nuances that make him such a troubled and fascinating protagonist. This is a man who wants no part of the prophecy he is at the center of, fearing that becoming a messianic leader will only lead to ruination for everyone he cares about. It drove me nuts to have so many bits where Paul fulfills an aspect of said prophecy for a momentary need, only for them to gloss over the long-term ramifications. It’s not just Paul who falls victim to this form of narrative shorthand. With the Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) failing miserably to control the Fremen on Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) turns to another nephew, the bloodthirsty Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), to turn the tide back into their favor. Butler is suitably psychotic in the role, and from the first second he monochromatically steps into the frame, I found it impossible to take my eyes off of him. But the gladiatorial combat he’s introduced in is a major letdown, while a later assault he leads on a Fremen stronghold happens because the story needs it to (it’s the catalyst to get Paul moving from north to south) and does nothing to develop the villain beyond the plainly obvious. The same goes for Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (a game, if miscast, Christopher Walken) and his Bene Gesserit daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). The sections involving them rely heavily on voiceovers from Pugh as she recaps events in her diary, and these scenes have about the same impact on the proceedings as Virginia Madsen (portraying the same narrator) did on David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation, i.e., practically none. There are exceptions to all of this, and that is part of what makes Dune: Part Two so monumentally vexing. Irulan has a heated tête-à-tête with Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), and Pugh and Rampling bounce off one another with masterfully modulated subtlety. There’s another bit between Butler and Léa Seydoux that is dazzling, the latter’s seduction of the former having an arachnid virtuosity that’s unlike anything I’ve seen in ages. Finally, and maybe most important of all, the scene in which Paul finally takes charge of the Fremen during a giant meeting of the clans is well worth the wait, and the full magnitude of what he is doing is portrayed with a noticeable undercurrent of tragic inevitability that mirrors Herbert’s source material nicely. Then there is Zendaya. She’s superb. Chani sees what is happening and knows she should not be falling in love with Paul, and yet no matter the danger, she cannot help but do so anyhow. The actor’s eyes are always probing, consistently questioning. Zendaya has an uncontrolled fire kindling within her lithe, athletic frame, and it’s a constant guessing game as to whether she’ll be able to keep it from exploding. This is the best performance of her young career so far. Villeneuve has guts. He does not shy away from the darker aspects of Herbert’s prose, and while I could have done without the blatant cliffhanger setting up the next chapter of this saga (which will undoubtedly be pulled from the author’s Dune Messiah), I respect that the director delivers a downer of a climax. If I felt more of an attachment to anyone other than Chani, I probably would have applauded this ending, as some in my small screening audience did. But that wasn’t the case. While I’ll journey back to Arrakis with Villeneuve for a third time when the opportunity presents itself, I’m no longer nearly as excited about making the trek, and that’s too bad.

"Mar 3, 2024",positive," Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Discovery have a blockbuster hit on their hands, as Dune: Part Two debuts to more than $80 million at the domestic box office and rave reviews from critics and audiences. Which is understandable and expected, as writer-director Denis Villeneuve’s and cowriter Jon Spaihts’ sequel to the acclaimed 2021 Dune is a thrilling, glorious sci-fi masterpiece. Financially this one isn’t too hard to call at this point. While there are a couple of million of dollars worth of variance, Dune: Part Two will end the weekend with about $82 million domestic — overperforming slightly, as I’d expected — and up to $90 million internationally (but we’ll have better numbers for that tomorrow), with major foreign markets to come including China and Japan. The final freshman bow total should be somewhere around $165 million, but could go as high as $170 million. Update: International box office is indeed coming in on the highest end of predictions, near $100 million and likely to finish at least north of $95 million. Even if Dune: Part Two has the same modest final multiplier as the first film at 2.6x, despite lacking a recent Covid pandemic surge from a new variant and the simultaneous streaming release of the film on [HBO] Max after leaking online a week prior to theatrical, that would put the sequel north of $200 million domestic by the end of its theatrical run. Since Part Two has superior audience scores and critical reviews, and with even more premium screen at higher ticket prices (somewhat offset by a slightly longer runtime and thus less daily screenings in some venues), I expect at least a 3x multiplier in the end, for at least $234 million in North America. International markets are good for $80 million minimum and possibly $90 million or more. At a 2.6x multiplier, foreign sales would add around $221 million, but that jumps to $255-270 million if the film performs at better levels based on audience scores and pricing. Remember, this is without China or Japan, which will add tens of millions more to Dune: Part Two’s global haul as well — the two nations combined for $46 million for Dune. But even without them, we’re still already talking about potentially $489-500 million or more. So let’s call it $545 million. This is just an easy and modest calculation of Dune: Part Two’s potential. While we can’t dismiss the chance it might generate less longterm positive word of mouth, thus hold less strongly week to week, and wind up less popular overseas, which is all to say it could be a nice blockbuster level hit but at the lower level of about $500 million. That’s different from a huge breakout hit that gets within shooting distance of $1 billion territory, though. It’s good for WBD and a testament to the filmmaking that it’s probably going to perform at least in the $500 million range and start the year off well, but what Warner wants is something that blows the doors off the box office, and that depends on just how good Dune: Part Two really is. If it’s great enough, we could be talking about box office results far higher for the franchise. Lucky for everyone involved, Dune: Part Two is spectacular and likely to become one of the year’s most talked-about, successful, and acclaimed releases. I cannot fathom any other film this year could possibly compare to the cinematography and visual effects in Part Two, which are beyond even the monumental accomplishments of the first film. This is what movie theaters exist for, this type of visual and complete story immersion. Christopher Nolan is among those who’ve compared Dune: Part Two to Star Wars films, particularly The Empire Strikes Back, but I think it’s far more comparable to The Lord of the Rings trilogy in terms of tone, style, and the vision behind it. I actually find the first Dune film to be more akin to The Empire Strikes Back, since it ended on more of a cliffhanger note and didn’t quite feel like a complete contained story of its own, whereas Dune: Part Two works even if there is no follow-up. This story has been told now, though we know there is inevitably more to come in the world of Dune, whether we wind up seeing it or not. But of course we’ll see it, the only question is how soon. With the excellent box office results, we can expect to see it sooner than later, I’d bet. This film is all Villeneuve’s vision, and in experiencing it we can more fully and clearly see the vision and intentions within the first Dune, which I gave a mixed-positive review at the time as feeling like only the setup, part of a story that we weren’t even sure we’d see finished and not for at least a few years. Character arcs and interactions felt incomplete and frustratingly narrowly drawn within the context of plot points as opposed to relationships. But Dune is a film that rewards repeat viewings, and once you know the story — and know you’ll finally see the rest of the story imminently — you can watch it and let the film flow over and through you, let the visuals carry you and stop trying to recall every name and term and reference. My high hopes and expectations based on the first film’s trailers were an obstacle to my ability to fully embrace and enjoy that movie. But now, with Dune: Part Two, the storytelling embraces us, we are drawn in and surround by it, we are not immersed but rather consumed by the richness and depth and undeniability of it all. Scale and scope are not merely visual and auditory in Part Two, although indeed the visuals and commitment to relying on imagery and action are of mythical godlike scale. Within that sense of enormity and endless sand, desert, and sky, Villeneuve and brilliant cinematographer Greig Fraser also find that sense of the personal scale, of humanity trying to survive in the vast expanse of this world they’ve created. We are awed, mesmerized by the sight of mountainous spacecraft descending over a city, of gargantuan alien worms rising and towering over us, but inevitably our attention is always drawn to the people confronting the scale — the ships, the creatures, the planet, the universe, the political equations and deadly wars, they dwarf us yet are beholden to the choices and demands of these characters who bend reality to their will. That is Dune: Part Two, a tale of humanity surviving, resisting, prevailing, against impossible odds and a natural world/universe full of extremes and threats that wear and batter us down, from the cold indifference of space to the inferno of Arrakis. My only quibbles are minor in the grand context of Dune: Part Two’s amazing visionary success. The spice and its impact, the surrealist sensibility of how spice is used for space travel, gets little attention here. Control of spice is used as a framing device yet only pops up as a notable plot-point or topic of discussion occasionally, giving way to the more personal and political elements, and of course the religious themes dominate. I’d like to have seen a little more effort to work in the uses of spice and how obsessed with it the political situation is. There are also many moments where the dialogue — which I know is of generally lower interest to Villeneuve — is very formal even in casual settings and moments of tension or urgency, so it sounds more like reading from a page than someone speaking naturally. This also makes a few jokes (of which there aren’t many, to be sure, as it wouldn’t feel remotely appropriate in this type of story and filmmaking) feel tonally incongruent with the rest of the storytelling approach. But I also realize some dialogue choices are affectations related to the tonal impression of the film and its foundation in theocracy and formalized rituals, I just think there are several scenes that would’ve played more smoothly with rewording of the dialogue — and frankly some of these moments could’ve just done with even less dialogue, or none at all. When I rewatch the first Dune film from 2021, all of its flaws seem minor now, while its best elements stand out and define it. It improves with age, and it’s only been three years. I’m grateful to be able to watch it now with new eyes, and even happier that I can now consider and appreciate it alongside its second half, to form a whole. Dune: Part Two is a testament to the power of cinema as transformative, immersive storytelling. See it on the biggest screen possible (but please wear a mask, we are still in a pandemic, as well as suffering from RSV, flu, and other illnesses still spreading), sit close, open your mind, and be transported to Dune, desert planet."
"Mar 3, 2024",positive,"Character, you may think, is not the point of a story like this one – it’s myth-making, allegory – but without real people to care about, there’s a ceiling on how invested we can become."
"Mar 3, 2024",positive," ‘Dune: Part Two’ continues the science fiction saga that follows a young duke on his path to lead a rebellion and regain his family’s position. Frank Herbert’s Dune is an award-winning, classic sci-fi saga with so many moving parts, it’s impossible to capture all of the nuances in a standard two-hour film. Thus, it’s been adapted into miniseries and multi-part movies in an attempt to incorporate as much of Herbert’s universe as possible. Some of the details that make it so difficult to portray on screen are the complex political, scientific and social models that compel almost every action in the narrative. So, filmmakers can either get bogged down in trying to explain it all or opt for a high-level overview supplemented by new character arcs. In Dune: Part Two, director Denis Villeneuve chooses the latter. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), successfully embedded themselves amongst the Fremen, mostly thanks to Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who believes they could be the manifestation of a long-held prophecy, and Chani (Zendaya), who teaches him the way of her people. As the pair reluctantly accept their roles as messiah and Reverend Mother respectively, the war for the spice and control of Arrakis rages on. Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) is struggling to maintain the Baron’s (Stellan Skarsgård) support as his ability to harvest the spice is repeatedly frustrated by Fremen attacks led by the newly named, Muad’Dib. So, his uncle redistributes the planet’s control to his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), who has a much colder approach to ending the conflict, which will force Paul’s hand and possibly bring forth the devastating Holy War he’s foreseen in his dreams. This film is clearly influenced by the 1962 epic adventure drama, Lawrence of Arabia, which told the real-life story of a British soldier that played a significant role in the Arab Revolt. There are scenes in Villeneuve’s movie that strongly resemble those in its predecessor from Paul’s overwhelming reception by the Fremen to him leading them into battle against the occupying House Harkonnen. Moreover, though Herbert wrote the original story in 1965, it’s not surprising to see parallels between the movie and current world conflicts, pitting indigenous peoples against invading forces. The first installment of this series attempted to establish the various houses and the reasons for tensions between them, losing some viewers as it conveyed the complexities of their relationships and the significance of their conflicts within the big picture. This second part disregards most of the story’s nuances in favour of stunning action sequences that engulf the screen with battles and explosions, and feature the mightiness of the monstrous worms that inhabit the planet. The sound rumbles through the IMAX seats and immerses audiences in the cinematic spectacle. For anyone not familiar with the source material, the movie will seem less confusing and more enjoyable. Conversely, fans will be disappointed by all that’s glossed over, altered or omitted completely. Yet, the most upsetting change is made to Chani’s character and her relationship with Paul. In Herbert’s book, she’s supportive of Paul’s cause and they openly discuss the hard decisions he will have to make if he continues down this path. In the film, Chani explicitly opposes Paul’s actions and he behaves very uncharacteristically towards her, fostering trust issues between them. While there are many changes to the narrative, including a much briefer timeline that modifies the entire existence of some characters, driving a wedge between Paul and Chani is the most egregious. In their attempt to give Chani more agency and strengthen her character, they lose one of Paul’s foundations and most important confidante. Villeneuve has mentioned making a third film based on Herbert’s second book, Dune Messiah, but so much that is at the centre of that narrative has been removed from this story, it’s difficult to imagine how the two could be reconciled.

"Mar 3, 2024",positive," If there’s another blockbuster this year that matches the visual impact of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two, I’ll eat my desert boots. The second Dune instalment is jaw-on-the-floor spectacular. It elegantly weaves together top-tier special effects and arresting cinematography; it layers muscle, sinew and savagery on to the bones of Part One. It’s an inhospitable, brutal kind of beauty that Villeneuve has created – there’s not enough lip balm in the universe to make a visit to the sandblasted wilderness planet of Arrakis look appealing. But this epic action picture, which follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) from a cheeky whippersnapper who’s a bit handy with a sword, to a feared warrior, to the prophesied leader of the Fremen tribe of Arrakis, is realised with a retina-searing intensity. So how is it that Villeneuve has been able to succeed – and make no mistake, Dune: Part Two is an emphatic success – in adapting a book that was long considered to be unfilmable? The breadth and scope of Dune, Frank Herbert’s 1965 far-future saga of interstellar feudal conflict, proved a daunting prospect to previous prospective film-makers. The generous budget available to Villeneuve’s pictures certainly helps – the lack of funds was the factor that sank Alejandro Jodorowsky’s proposed 14-hour film adaptation of the book in the early 1970s. And studio support is another – while Warner Brothers hasn’t exactly covered itself in glory recently, as anyone who has been following the Coyote vs Acme debacle will know, it has at least given Villeneuve the space and freedom to achieve his creative vision (compare this with David Lynch’s less happy experience with his version of Dune, originally intended to run at three hours, then unceremoniously hacked down by nearly 40 minutes). But a crucial element in Villeneuve’s approach, a creative ethos that gels particularly effectively with the material, is his firm commitment to showing rather than telling. A chunk of exposition at the very start of the film, delivered as an entry into the “Imperial Diary’’ and narrated by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), neatly proves how futile it is to attempt to unpick the intricacies of this densely plotted chronicle. In this case, too much dialogue and plot explanation drain the energy from the picture; it’s far more effective to employ Villeneuve’s preferred tactic of exploring the story visually. This technique occasionally misfires, with some of the transitions between vividly created scenes and set pieces feeling a little cursory and disjointed. But on the whole, it does no harm at all to bathe the audience in heady, colour-saturated atmosphere rather than to spoon-feed them with easily digestible gobbets of plot. Although Paul is the main focus of the story, this instalment allows other characters to come to the fore, most notably Fremen warrior Chani (an impressive, physically committed performance from the always magnetic Zendaya). But a standout in a supporting role is Austin Butler, playing Feyd-Rautha, the psychopathic nephew of Stellan Skarsgård’s levitating despot, Baron Harkonnen. A vast, seat-shuddering spectacle like this movie is no place for subtlety, and Butler evidently got that particular memo. From the moment he tests the calibre of a freshly sharpened blade with his extended tongue, before trying it on the throat of one of his slaves, he is phenomenal. It’s a gleefully over-the-top performance fuelled by malice and channelled through axe-blade cheekbones and a smile that could strip the skin from your face. Equally impressive and only slightly less disturbing is Rebecca Ferguson, reprising her role of Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother. Driven by her ambition for her son, and twisted by the gruelling ritual that transforms her into the Reverend Mother of the Fremen, Jessica takes on a chilling ruthlessness, something that Ferguson manages to convey almost entirely through an icily inscrutable gaze and a collection of facial tattoos. The immense, breathtaking visuals and the grandstanding performances are more than matched by Hans Zimmer’s behemoth of a score. There are passages so thunderous, it sounds as though he somehow harnessed the noise of colliding planets in place of percussion. It’s a fittingly ominous accompaniment to a story that lurches away from passionate idealism, truth and romance, and towards political machinations, betrayals, zealotry, the weaponisation of fear and the looming threat of a devastating religious war. There are moments when Dune: Part Two feels uncomfortably timely."
"Mar 3, 2024",positive," Coming out of the first Dune, anyone familiar with the novel – or David Lynch’s uneven but underrated 1984 adaptation – had a few questions about what Dune Part Two would hold. For one, the first film had used up most of the plot, leaving little more than an escalating series of battles and the growing misgivings of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) to fill the back half. How would director Denis Villeneuve turn that thin gruel into an epic worthy of the name? Rather than simply pad things out with fresh subplots or new characters (though Dune Part Two does feature both), Villeneuve doubles down on going big. Call it a vibes-based approach to storytelling: overwhelming visuals and a pummelling score work hard to give this a constant bone-deep sense of profundity and meaning even where the story itself is just a series of rebel attacks on farm trucks. As for the story: now hiding out with a band of Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) Paul and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) – the last survivors of House Atreides, sent to rule the economically vital planet Arrakis as part of what turns out to have been a murderous trap laid by the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and rival House Harkonnen – gradually come to be accepted by them and are initiated into their desert ways. Lady Jessica becomes a Reverend Mother, a figure of much power, while Paul grows into the role of warrior and leader (he also gets to ride around on giant sand worms, who move like fast-swimming whales barely breaching the surface). Some see him as the foretold messiah, a mantel he struggles against – mostly because he knows the belief’s origins in manipulative propaganda spread by the Bene Gesserit, the secretive and powerful sisterhood his mother is a member of. While the Harkonnens, now back in charge of the planet, alternate between sending out raiding parties and killing their own underlings, under Paul’s leadership the Fremen’s attacks on Spice production grow bolder and more effective. The call grows for Paul to travel south and drink the Water of Life, a potion that usually kills men but may – if the prophecy is true – give him the visions he needs to free the planet. Already Paul knows going south will lead to a galaxy-wide war that will kill billions. When the Harkonnens bring in the even more ruthless Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to crush the resistance, he may no longer have a choice. Despite the desert setting there’s not a whole lot of warmth in the performances (Bardem being a notable exception). Even the return of Josh Brolin’s Gurney doesn’t add much of a human dimension to what is increasingly a series of galaxy-shattering power plays. To be fair, that’s to be expected: the arc across the two films is a journey from the (relatively) small and intimate to an up-front clash of massive armies and centuries-spanning schemes. Even the growing romance between Paul and Fremen Chani (Zendaya) is more of a friendship (with benefits) than any epic passion. But as young lovers together against the galaxy they’re a good team… at least until Paul takes the first steps towards godhood and her doubts see her shunted to the sidelines. Any further ambiguity about Paul having been bred to be a human Weapon of Mass Destruction is snuffed out by the black-and-white nature of his struggle against the Harkonnens. They’re even shown in literal monochrome during an epic celebration of arena slaughter and military might (complete with ink blot fireworks) that introduces Feyd-Rautha. But while the story could be told in half the time and half the performances fail to register (even Christopher Walken isn’t all he could be), the images are more than twice as grand. The calls to see this on the biggest screen you can are correct; the central appeal of this film is the thrill of being overwhelmed by the spectacle, and Villeneuve delivers time and time again. This doesn’t quite reach the epic heights of weirdness seen in Lynch’s version (the more physically transformative aspects of Spice use remain unseen here), but there’s more than enough moments of the uncanny and unsettling to break the 40 year stranglehold Star Wars has had on the visual language of space opera. Spaceships and alien worlds and bizarre creatures should be stunning and awe-inspiring and weird, not just beat-up and worn out; this is a future with an edge to it. While there’s a spin-off TV series in the works, this may or may not be the end of Dune on the big screen. The smart money’s on a third film being announced once the box office numbers are in; this ends on a note that works as an ending and as a beginning. The story may not demand a third instalment, but this is a franchise built on excess. When the fate of the galaxy is at stake, too much is never enough.

"Mar 3, 2024",positive," In a desert far, far away is Dune: Part Two. The second installment of the sandy saga of a young warrior named Paul, wandering the gritty grounds of his futuristic planet in search of the spice of life. He encounters old and new foes as he seeks revenge for his fallen family while trying to stave off a holy war. If you haven’t read the Dune book series from author Frank Herbert, seen the original 1984 film or even Dune: Part One just a few years ago, what’s a matter wit you?! Have you had your head in the sand? This sprawling, blockbuster was green lit for a sequel seconds after Part One hit the big screen in 2021. The sci-fi romantic adventure of warring families is The Ten Commandments meets Star Wars. Timothee Chalamet is the Moses of Arrakis riding sand worms in pursuit of a better life for his chosen people. Denis Villeneuve reprises his roles as writer, director, and producer of Dune and Part Two is just as big and breathtakingly beautiful to look at as Part One. It’s IMAXimum satisfaction. If you are a fan of this story and genre, it’s worth the extra bucks to see Dune: Part Two in IMAX. It kept my husband Ricky awake…that and a giant Pepsi. The film clocks in at just under three hours, but it moves fast…like the sand in an hourglass.  The majority of the Part One cast is back along with Chalamet including Zendaya as love interest and battle babe Chani, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson and scene stealer and comic relief, Javier Bardem. New family foes have been added including Christopher Walken as the Emperor, Florence Pugh as his Princess daughter and Austin Butler as Paul’s most formidable spice traitor. Butler gained 25 pounds of muscle and lost all his hair and fortunately his Elvis accent for the role of Feyd-Rautha.  This sequel is more egotistical than its predecessor. It has more swagger since its initial success. It’s also more ambitious and complicated technically. Personally, I’m not a huge science fiction fan so the story, like the first, is still somewhat hard to follow for me and the dialogue is sometimes unintelligible, but Dune: Part Two is why we go to the movies. Read up on the legend beforehand, especially if you haven’t seen Part One, settle in with some popcorn and marvel at what masterful filmmaking is all about.

"Mar 2, 2024",positive," From popcorn buckets sure to be misused in cosmically terrifying ways to what seems like an unprecedented social media blitz, Dune: Part Two is casting a pop culture shadow the size of an obese sandworm. One promo clip forced most of the performers to say the word “epic” when describing the film, as though they had spontaneously conjured up that adjective. It was maybe Austin Butler’s best Dune-related acting. Just kidding, Hound Dog, you’re worth a dozen Chalamets. Writer/director Denis Villeneuve and cowriter Jon Spaihts fundamentally do not understand what makes the intergalactic desert drama’s story compelling. To be fair, having never read Frank Herbert’s source material, I don’t really either… But I do know that people love the shit out of it. And it has to be for reasons beyond what we’ve seen in the story to this point in the cinematic adaptation, now more than five-plus hours in. Because, thus far, the only surprising element has been how unintentionally hilarious Timothée Chalamet’s line delivery is. From “I’ve been having dreams” to multiple rage tantrums, his outer space messiah feels more like a sentient Reddit comment. Every story beat is explicitly foreshadowed and then happens exactly as described, with everyone acting shocked by it. To be clear, I am the biggest sucker on this planet for space opera shenanigans and a proud giver-of-an-A-grade to Jupiter Ascending. With this kind of budget and Villeneuve’s visual flare, the worst this could possibly be is a mostly good time. Dune 2: The Dunening is a mostly good time. Picking up immediately after part one, which more sorta stopped than “had an actual ending,” we see Paul Atreides (Chalamet) acclimating to his new role as the somewhat-reluctant Jesus Christ of the desert-dwelling Fremen. The movie’s first hour is its best, weirdly, as watching Space Paul fall in love with Chani (Zendaya) and learn from his replacement daddy, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), feels somehow less gross than most “special white boy gets accepted by a native tribe he’ll later lead” movies. But don’t get fooled, Space Paul is a very special white boy who gets accepted by a native tribe he’ll later lead. He also has dreams. See the aforementioned Chalamet quote. Those dreams say that his inevitable clash with the Emperor of the Universe (Christopher Walken) will be costly and bad. While Space Paul and his mom, Space Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), grapple with their intergalactic religious destinies, the evil Feyd-Rautha (Butler) licks a lot of knives on a planet full of bald people. Florence Pugh spends most of the movie dictating notes into a space tape recorder. I don’t know, man. It’s all joyless and serious. The only humor is accidental, as Space Paul keeps collecting complicated names to make up for the fact that his birth name is Paul. He is also called Usul and Maud’Dib, and then a few other things that I’m too tired to Google. Josh Brolin comes back out of nowhere. There are nuclear weapons, so apparently this is also set in the Oppenheimer cinematic universe. Other than visually stunning, which it inarguably and unquestionably is, the movie series is likely a victim of the book’s influence. That is to say, Herbert’s book so greatly affected all science fiction that followed it to the point where it feels redundant and obvious…because we’ve spent so much time with stuff that ripped it off. And all of that would probably be fine, if the lead didn’t make me want to gnaw my own arm off every time he spoke. He is anti-charismatic, and watching his tiny little elfin body do combat is so silly. I wouldn’t believe him as a department store manager leading employees in a battle against Black Friday shoppers, let alone as the savior of the entire galaxy. Again, I somehow still liked this movie, I want to stress that. But I equally want to stress that we need to stop it with this Chalamet business as soon as possible. And yet, will I be there for Dune 3: Dune It to Me One More Time? Yes. NOTE: Please read this review: Siddhant Adlakha at JoySauce.com says “These changes, while seemingly minor in the grand scheme of things, are emblematic of the film’s overarching narrative point of view, one which takes Herbert’s re-imagining of an Islamic galactic power structure (with mostly Shia influences) and further re-imagines it as a patronizing tale of saviorism.” Ian Thomas Malone at ianthomasmalone.com says “Paul’s weaknesses as a messiah somewhat reflect the reality that our society has moved beyond some of the confines of Herbert’s sandbox. Villeneuve has crafted a beautiful film that will likely go down as the definitive take on the franchise, while also exposing many of the flaws that demonstrate why it took so long to get made in the first place.” DarkSkyLady at LatinaMedia.co says “Dune: Part Two is a stunning film to behold. But it’s almost three hours long, and its lead cannot shoulder the weight of its thematic ambitions.”"

"Mar 2, 2024",positive," Timothee Chalamet achieves something here that has eluded him to this point. There is a moment in “Dune: Part Two” where the charismatic, handsome actor disappears and all that remains is the character he has become. If “Dune” from 2021 was a preface, an introduction, breaking us gently into the dense universe of author Frank Herbert, then “Dune: Part Two” is an acceleration. With each of his films, director — now auteur — Denis Villeneuve hones his craft, carving at the heels of brilliance seen in Christopher Nolan films. While there are not as many small, intimate moments here, the scale is gargantuan. The Oscar-winning cinematography of the 2021 film is easily one-upped. Early in the film, we see Harkonnen scouts jump floating to evade an oncoming sandworm. Greig Fraser’s wide shot of individually aligned figures ascending a massive rock in the middle of a vast desert is a stunning example of the visual language used here. After joining with the Fremen in the northern part of Arrakis, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) continue to learn the ways of the desert. As one of the last surviving members of House Atreides, Paul begins to embrace his future as one of the Freman people, rejecting both his role as a duke and resisting against disturbing visions of a power that calls to him. For her part, Jessica, with child, continues to stoke the religious flames that her son is the promised legend, Muad’Dib. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) sees all the signs that Paul is the messiah. The Harkonnen leaders now fully back in control of Arrakis and spice production, squeeze hard on eradicating the planet from anyone who stands in their way. Internet forum rules ...
