Apr 8 2024,neutral,by the time the credits roll on imaginary you will have mixed feelings there are a few good ideas here and there but the characterization needed a bit more work and the scares needed to be polished a tad more
Apr 3 2024,neutral, the imagination can be a hell of a scary place where the worst fears  about the world about others and about the self  can manifest and compound but what happens when the worst parts of ones imagination not only fester but materialize and give chase the latest blumhouse horror missterpiece attempts to explore these themes with very mixed results directed and cowritten by wadlow imaginary tells the story of jessica dewanda wise a childrens book author and illustrator who moves back into her childhood home with her husband max tom payne and two stepdaughters taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun jessicas dreams and memories are haunted by her own creations but they subside once the family moves into her old house when alice finds a teddy bear named chauncey in the crawlspace of the house she begins talking to him developing a strong bond with her new imaginary friend chauncey starts to have an overwhelming and dangerous influence over alice and when she starts behaving erratically it becomes apparent that there is a malevolent force hidden in the guise of this cute teddy with the help of taylor alices therapist dr soto veronica falcón and neighbour and former babysitter gloria betty buckley jessica must unravel the secrets of her traumatic childhood and solve the mystery of chauncey before its too late for alice although the film wastes no time in the im gonna scare you department starting off with a nightmarish chase through jessica and maxs apartment it quickly dips in energy and takes too long to amp up and start telling an interesting story it spends too much time establishing the familial dynamics many of which are redundant and should have been excised max is especially superfluous disappearing at the start of the second act to go on tour even though we havent been given any indication that hes a musician until his unceremonious exit fortunately when the film does get interesting midway through it makes some surprisingly effective storytelling choices and its central conceit  the fate of abandoned imaginary friends and their response to this rejection  is sinister and well developed as the latest film from production powerhouse blumhouse imaginary is essentially a goreless affair relying on mood tone and atmosphere rather than body count while it uses the requisite jump scares mostly to unremarkable effect it also makes ample use of the terrors that lurk in the darkened corners of our homes and our minds the scary things that move in the shadows and go bump in the night or day although moments of bloodletting are very few and far between when they do happen they feel uninspired even obsequious appealing to the lowest common horror fan denominator its obvious when the film is trying to frighten yet when it wants to disturb and unsettle it actually succeeds thanks in no small part to pyper brauns superb performance as alice braun is a performer with enviable skills putting to shame not only other child actors but also most of her adult costars shes frightening and sympathetic cold and terrified amused and distraught and she explores these contradictions with the talent and power of someone far beyond her years or experience putting kids in peril has become de rigeur for blumhouse productions brauns tour de force turn as alice is a case where the cliché works what the film does have going for it apart from brauns performance are the practical effects which are surprisingly well done the imaginary world is chaotic and disorienting even if it does ape a bit too much from the works of m c escher while many of the creature effects are practical and have a disturbing and welcome weight to them chaunceys indifferent eyes coupled with some welltimed repositions are particularly effective as are the startling appearances of a humanoid shape throughout the house early in the film when chauncey is being cuddled by alice he turns to face her which makes for a disconcerting visual its a small almost insignificant turn but its this kind of unexpected shift by an inanimate object that helps give him both life and power  and thats actually scary these moments and manifestations force us to ask who or what chauncey is exactly which the writers gleefully withhold until the third act of course blumhouse films love exposition and imaginary is bursting with explanations and unexpected recollections theres the requisite creepy lore section where a character who has been researching andor documenting the villainous entitycreature  in this case gloria who has been chastised and called crazy for her beliefs  finally gets to explain to the other characters ie the audience the true nature of the evil theyve encountered unfortunately the film gets confused by and even lost in some of its own lore there are a number of plot holes and it introduces elements that are completely unnecessary for our understanding of chauncey simply because the writers feel its necessary for the creep factor the film also tries to explore some incredibly complex social and personal issues  mental health trauma abuse neglect  yet it often does so flippantly introducing these elements with little to no resolution its treatment of individuals suffering from mental health issues is particularly unfortunate even irresponsible the girls institutionalized mother is vilified in both of the scenes shes featured in while a sideplot with jessicas similarly institutionalized father is horribly underdeveloped adding insult to injury a cruel and entirely unnecessary twist late in the film dashes any hope for an onscreen reconciliation or vindication for her father overall imaginary offers a somewhat unique take on the blumhouse formula it relies on the production houses substandard approach to psychological horror but mixes it with a creature feature eschewing violence for something more fantastical although the film has a surprisingly effective emotional core it gets diluted by exposition and opportunistic reveals as well as its creators insistence on twists and false endings all of which feel manipulative and underwhelming tonally imaginary tries to present itself as looser and more accessible compared to some of its dour and nihilistic blumhouse siblings yet it still ends up taking itself and its premise way too seriously there are some poorly structured gotcha moments that are insincere and meanspirited the ending is beyond cynical and these make for some of the films laziest moments there are some creative scenes and setups including a frantic climactic search for a missing character through the imaginary realm but imaginary ultimately ends up feeling dull and understuffed its flimsy cheap and easily forgotten  much like an unloved stuffy decaying in the darkness of some dusty box that will never be opened again
Mar 29 2024,negative, some vague discussions about the power of imagination but nothing concrete or meaningful communication among family members proves valuable but this happens late in the movie and rather suddenly no clear role models here only people trying to survive family members a stepmom and two daughters do learn to communicate better with one another but it happens rather suddenly this is a womanled story black stepmom jessica dewanda wise and her two white stepdaughters taegen burns and pyper braun are at the center betty buckley plays a wise neighbor who knows a little about whats going on mexicanborn veronica falcón plays a child therapist in a key scene and black actor samuel salary plays jessicas father in several scenes sympathetic portrayal of relationships in a blended

drinking parents need to know that imaginary is a horror movie about a young girl who finds a mysterious teddy bear named chauncey and starts behaving strangely events that may be connected to her stepmother jessicas dewanda wise past violence includes jump scares children and others in peril blood characters being attacked by monsters and mysterious figures stabbing with scissors some creepygross imagery and more infrequent language includes one use of fk plus ahole and a few uses of st goddamn bitchy oh my god psycho idiot etc one teen tries to get another to try molly but the

kissing and cuddling to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails in imaginary childrens author jessica dewanda wise is having trouble with nightmares shes preparing to move with her new familyhusband max tom payne and his two girls from a previous marriage teen taylor taegen burns and young alice pyper brauninto her childhood house once theyre there the nightmares stop but other strange things start to happen alice finds a teddy bear called chauncey and makes it her imaginary friend she begins to play a scavenger hunt game with him that requires her to do odd things like hurt herself a child therapist veronica falcón is called in but the more they dig they more they discover that chauncey is somehow connected to jessica this mostly terrible horror movie relies on chunks of ideas recycled from older movies several predictable jump scares and monster lore that wobbles all over the place and makes little sense directed by jeff wadlow imaginary begins with a cheat of an opener a sequence involving a giant spider attack thatsguess whatonly a dream once it really gets going the movie has trouble establishing exactly what the characters are facing it could be the teddy bear or the creepylooking blurry figures that leer at people and bare their teeth in the dark backgrounds or the spider or a giant demonic version of the bear or even another monster that incorporates the collected imaginations of millions of children this movie doesnt know what it wants and in the end cant summon up much more than a handful of dumb jump scares half of them fake ones intended to make viewers jump and then laugh neither of which is likely to happen audiences will spend at least several minutes recalling earlier movies that did all of this better at least the family dynamicwith stepmom jessica trying to relate to and communicate with her new stepdaughtersfeels fairly close but imaginary is overall an opportunistic movie that didnt bother with creating a solid story before it went in front of the cameras families can talk about imaginarys violence how did it make you feel was it exciting shocking what did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect why is that important what is the relationship between the sisters and their stepmom like what are their struggles how well do they communicate how does this

Mar 27 2024,negative, imaginary is the latest horror movie to join the blumhouse catalogue following in the footsteps of recent scary titles like m3gan five nights at freddys and the black phone but it doesnt quite stand out from some of its predecessors the movie directed by kickass 2s jeff wadlow follows jessica dawanda wise a woman who moves back into her childhood home with her family soon after arriving her youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named chauncey that she finds in the basement  from there alice starts playing games with chauncey the bear that begin playful and harmless but soon become increasingly sinister jessica intervenes and realizes that chauncey is not just a stuffed bear and it becomes a race against time to protect the family from this malevolent presence on paper this is a strong concept plenty of horror movies have tapped into the idea of creepy dolls or toys like annabelle in the conjuring series chucky in childs play and billy the puppet in saw who while isnt sentient himself does serve as a freaky disguise for his creator jigsaw so the idea of a scary teddy bear is a strong one to take something that is meant to bring comfort to children and often adults and make it horrifying is an intriguing basis for a horror movie and its a shame it didnt quite hit the heights it could have there is a disappointing lack of chauncey in a movie about a sinister teddy bear and the movie seems to focus more on the familys drama than the main antagonist while theres nothing wrong with setup and some tension building the filmmakers could have done more to utilize him a la poltergeist where things are moving when they really shouldnt be the few instances where we do see chauncey are creepy and there are some decent visuals even if some of the special effects arent great its also very repetitive once youve seen the same creepy shadow technique a few times it starts to get a little old all of this is very disappointing considering they had such a fun idea to play with despite an unnatural script with some strange dialogue choices the actors involved did their best to give their all especially dawanda wise who plays the concerned stepmother trying to figure out whats going on performancewise none could really be faulted even if it does feel like a family drama with background horror rather than the other way around aesthetically its good with decent sound design and an atmosphere that mirrors some oldschool horror movies but the style over substance approach is disappointing when the movie couldve gone a lot harder than it did the third act takes a very interesting turn and without giving too much away mirrors insidious in taking characters and viewers to a strange new place while it attempts to provide some answers about why chauncey is acting like this its a little jarring in places there are also a few questions youll never get answers to so dont go into this expecting things to be tied up in a neat little bow it leaves things frustratingly ambiguous and the ending itself is a cliffhanger doing that classic horror tactic of will there be a sequel wait and see which has certainly had mixed results over the years ultimately imaginary is fine and its not the worst horror offering out there but when its competing with recent smash hits like talk to me it doesnt bring anything new to the table but if you fancy seeing a teddy bear terrorizing a family for two hours you could do worse and it beats a chaotic visit to buildabear on a busy saturday afternoon just about lucy joined the whattowatchcom team in 2021 where she writes series guides for mustwatch programmes reviews and the latest tv news originally from northumberland she graduated from oxford brookes university with a degree in film studies and moved to london to begin a career writing about entertainment she is a rotten tomatoes approved film critic and has a huge passion for cinema she especially loves horror thriller and anything crimerelated her favourite tv programmes include inside no 9 american horror story stranger things and black mirror but she is also partial to a quiz show or a bit of say yes to the dress 
Mar 26 2024,negative,the concept couldve led to some interesting blends of fantasy and horror unfortunately what it actually led to is another lifeless quick buck effort from blumhouse its cheap its unoriginal its boring and yetit probably still made a profit
Mar 25 2024,negative, blumhouse returns to familiar stomping grounds with imaginary a story about a malevolent entity who latches onto a small child in this case pyper braun determined to snatch them away to their secret realm  the further sorry no the never ever its called this time its a formula that has worked well for the studio scoring them five insidious films plus a less wellreceived one about a haunted swimming pool in night swim and now its the turn of the imaginary friend to get scary save your bing bong jokes  imaginary is well ahead of you and makes plenty of them itself but chauncey bear is no cuddly pink elephant an unsettling stuffed toy with a lopsided face and spooky button eyes sinister shapeshifter chauncey is a great design and in the right hands we could have been looking at the next pennywise or freddy krueger sadly these are the hands of truth or dare and fantasy island director jeff wadlow and chauncey doesnt get much chance to cut loose save for a scene between cb alice braun and a therapist veronica falcón hes fairly hopeless and less intimidating than one would hope while the final act plays with chaunceys form a little including some genuinely good practical effects this supernatural horror story is disappointingly crayonbynumbers  snatching wholesale from poltergeist insidious and coraline visually and structurally its unimpressive too and features reams of dialogue which shouldnt have made it past the first draft star dewanda wise gamely gives it her all but is illserved by the writing and clumsy character work meanwhile braun and screen sister taegan burns give spirited performances but wind up on the wrong side of grating likewise a onenote betty buckley and the walking dead star tom payne whose stupid hat garnered the only reaction a derisive laugh from this theatre audience
Mar 24 2024,negative, directed by jeff wadlow imaginary follows dewanda wises jessica as she becomes increasingly convinced that her stepdaughters pyper brauns alice imaginary friend is actually real and malevolent its a stirring premise thats employed to progressively unwatchable effect by wadlow as the filmmaker armed with a script written alongside greg erb and jason oremland offers up a deliberate and often astonishingly sluggish misfire that contains little in the way of compelling attentiongrabbing attributes  with the armslength atmosphere compounded by an almost total lack of scares a distressingly low body count and several laughably inept periphery performances and while the early part of the picture contains a very small handful of engaging sequences including an effective scene wherein the teen next door is menaced by the central antagonist although the lack of a satisfying payoff diminishes the impact of this interlude imaginary which admittedly does boast a decent twist at around the halfway point builds towards an absolutely endless third act that ensures the whole thing peters out to a fairly stunning degree  with the end result a hopelessly underwhelming and uninvolving disaster that squanders its promising setup
Mar 24 2024,positive, in imaginary 2023 jessica dewanda wise an author and illustrator of childrens  books her husband burning cats guitarist max tom payne and his daughters teen taylor taegan burns and younger alice pyper braun move to jessicas childhood home in a louisiana suburb jessicas bad dreams stop once she returns to her home the real nightmare begins when alice makes an imaginary friend chauncey a worn teddy bear alice starts talking in a weird voice and goes on a scavenger hunt that becomes increasingly disturbing gloria betty buckley jessicas former babysitter and neighbor has a theory which may spark jessica into recalling her memories imaginary is mid there is a good story in there but writers greg erb jason oremland and director jeff wadlow missed it there is a central strong theme the inability to rely on or trust your loved ones or yourself ultimately the writers were unwilling to tackle the theme of family members who lose their mind the fear of this trait passing down to the children and the idea that someone could be loved but not worthy of trust the film builds up the idea that chauncey feels that jessica betrayed him the story constantly alludes to the fact that chauncey is sad not evil which is spun as a lie to lure her in but was an emotionally resonant concept which results in the most emotionally resonant scene jessica reassures and apologizes to alice but the bear is lying in the bed under the covers i wanted a bittersweet scene where chauncey is still a threat but somehow jessica remembering and addressing the situation would have resolved or ameliorated the issue somehow instead a lot of the cleverness goes out the door and chauncey just becomes the traditional monster all teeth and claws shrug the writers prioritize the story where jessica and her stepdaughters become a family here is an idea fellas if you are going to write about girls and women maybe throw one in the writers room watch tiktok or read aita would any woman in a shaky relationship with her child charges be eager to spend alone time with them or beg her husband to postpone his trip neither his older daughter nor his wife ever had a moment where they looked at him to pick a side how is he getting off scott free with a harmonious marriage also my cynical radar did the calculation max is a gold digger looking for a bang nanny he saw a hot woman with property and a successful career snagged her and leaves her with all the responsibilities while he follows his dreams he spent zero time with her and the kids except in bed what does he bring to the table except problems because the writers are not the best each girl takes turns being interesting dominating the first two acts braun steals the show with a line delivery that mixes sweetness with sarcasm she is a great little actor who nailed every scene without her performance chauncey is not even remotely frightening and her brief breakup scene was devastating and felt realistic burns dominates the final act when taylor gets invested in her sisters wellbeing and starts to work with jessica instead of just play the standard issue resentful teenager once she lightens up the chemistry between her and wise suggests that if they had subverted the tropes or decided to make the two bond over having mentally ill parents imaginary could have moved up a notch even though parentification is discouraged jessica is constantly trying to protect taylor but taylor feels a sense of ownership over jessicas wellbeing that is an unearned transformation yet works because of the performances maybe alice should have been leerier of jessica because of her moms issues which would echoed the relationship with chauncey and jessica and taylor should have appreciated jessica because she is the older kid who knows what happened when taylor got physical the threat felt more palpable instead the films foundation is the bond between alice and jessica wise is a gorgeous woman who gives me angela bassett vibes she looks like she could be a superhero and it only helps that her wardrobe makes her look like wonder woman as a civilian imaginary spent good money when they hired her because without her the movie would be less watchable i loved when she finally gets a cathartic moment and tells people about themselves the most unrealistic part of this film is the idea that anyone could disrespect a black woman in her own house and not get read to complete filth buckley commands attention every time that she is on screen wadlow was good at making scenes unsettling when shadowy figures lurk in the background hugging the edges which is how chauncey his real entity self and gloria get introduced matthew sato who plays a neighbor and taylors date prospect gets the best scenes with chauncey otherwise chauncey was a letdown as a pure monster the writers gave away too much during the opening oneiric sequence then any scene in which a character read jesssicas stories it gets so spelled out that somehow the denouement feels anticlimactic the monsters liminal space should have been populated with more people since it is a place where other kids would be the director referenced labyrinth as inspiration but failed to mention scenes that felt derivative like stephen kings it specifically pennywise and the deadlights most people complained about the mythology the mythology would have hung better if the framework of the story was strong enough to handle it but gloria was a glorified prose dumper who over explains everything to make sure that no one gets left behind in the audience dr alana soto veronica falcon was the best in her m night shyamalan role that reveals the whole twist which i did not expect but should have seen coming please do not revoke my jaded moviegoer card it is a dumb detail to get hung up on but when dr soto leaves the family instead of either calling dcf or finding a responsible adult to intervene and help it was the part of imaginary that did not work for me especially since she was otherwise so savvy it feels like a waste that the film is set in louisiana there is a supernatural explanation but the environment and history are never considered imaginary has a problematic element within this universe any parent who suffers a mental illness cannot be trusted with their wellbeing of their child but when it is a mother she is just mad whereas the man is noble and sympathetic the flick deserves kudos for having the message that real friends want the best for us and do not want to inflict any pain  if you are expecting the same eerie commercials featured in the trailers let me save you some disappointment people do not watch television in imaginary except to watch movies like warm bodies 2013 the final scene was hilarious and leaves room for a sequel which no one wants lets just put dewise in better movies
Mar 20 2024,neutral,  if youre foolish or stubborn enough or in my case both to still spend time in the contemptuous wasteland formerly known as twitter you may be aware that late night with the devil has come under fire for its use of aigenerated images for its interstitials this is a regrettable turn of events not only because the filmmakers denied actual artists work in favor of a cheap facsimile but because this one unforced error distracts from the fact that the movie is actually an effective lowbudget thriller that uses the familiarity of a retro aesthetic to deliver some potent

Mar 19 2024,neutral, if theres anything ive learned from blumhouse pictures movie imaginary its that we dont talk enough the horror genre is full of so much mystery around the evil being faced theres also a lot of denial but what if we actually talk to each other what if when that serial killer thats coming after us we sit down and try to figure out who it is or that demon that has haunted us what if we tell our loved ones what we saw things would be solved way faster and the movie would be over but what if it wasnt over what if talking to each other to solve whats going on with the big bad leads to new ways of storytelling thats what i feel with imaginary to be crystal clear i dont think that imaginary is reinventing horror its a pretty basic film that kind of reads like a book while watching i couldnt help but think that i would totally devour this kind of book after all the most powerful thing when it comes to horror is how we imagine the monsters within these books and this movie is pretty cookiecutter and predictable from start to finish keeping that all in mind it does push into uncharted territory where the people in the movie talk about what they saw confront the monster and dont end up having a sad ending where they sacrifice themselves for the rest of the family they themselves are rescued by said family and get to live happily ever after and i want to see more movies like that because im sick and tired of the plot twist where the bad thing got them now that is predictable happy endings arent besides imaginary making me realize that 100 of horror movies could be solved by talking i really enjoyed having dewanda wise as the lead i have personally never heard of this actress and now i will be thoroughly going through her imdb to see what shes up to or what she has done but just like my post the other day about breathe we are in desperate need of horror movies with black leads because if theres anything that hollywood likes to do when it comes to showcasing any minority story is by leaning into stereotypes often harmful ones and the horror genre is absolutely guilty of that if we look back to the running gag that if youre a black character in horror the chances of you dying skyrocket which if youre looking for a movie that looks at that stereotype right in the face and flips it the bird i would suggest watching the blackening imaginary went and fleshed out jessicas story in welcome and unexpected ways it made her a mom to an interracial marriage and the children that came with it we also got to see jessicas career and how art had always been such a pivotal thing in her life that it led her to a career making childrens books we also got to see her and a white picket fence kind of neighborhood that horror movies have statistically only made a residence for its white stereotypical leads jessica was just living her life everything wasnt perfect when it came to jessicas storyline though we got to see her as a child have joyous moments with her mom and the aftermath of confronting that monster when it destroyed her dad and it would have been great if there were more black characters along for the ride with jessica contrary to popular belief more than one minority can be the central focus of a story and im saying this as someone who isnt black but who is sick and tired of watching movies with latinas where there cant be more than one of us there can be i cant finish this review without talking about the special effects of this movie i think that imaginary found a really good balance between letting our imagination set the tone of how malicious chauncey was the bear was simple and something any kid would own and i like the buildup to whatever this demon was i do think though that the giant bear monster was something straight out of a nightmare so a for making that fever dream come alive but there were some things like the spider eyes and that ghostlike face that almost got jessica that just didnt work for me it was a little too cheesy and it made it seem like the demon could transform into multiple things so i wasnt sure if it was a teddy bear or a spider or maybe it was just everything because of imagination ultimately imaginary was cookiecutter with a dash of making me contemplate something fresh for the horror genre and that last bit having me think about what i love and what this genre can do better makes it more worthwhile than plenty of horror movies that ive seen lately and thats saying a lot
Mar 18 2024,neutral,wise does the best to elevate the material but imaginary is yet another mediocre addition to the blumhouse canon from director jeff wadlow
Mar 15 2024,neutral,steals from m3gan without having any idea what it was that made that film enjoyable
Mar 14 2024,negative,imaginary is a nearridiculous mishmash of the usual trope of the doll doomed by dark forces full review in spanish 
Mar 14 2024,negative,in the last act in this movie when the point rears its ugly head i actually had fun with that its just not worth the slog dredging through this borefest to get to that point
Mar 14 2024,negative, a warrior princess a terrifying teddy bear and giant sand worms heres the best and worst of the films the pop culture planet writers have watched this week in damsel millie bobby brown plays elodie who gets sworn into a life of royalty to help her people this is no fairytale as the prince shes marrying comes from an ancient kingdom that owes a centuries long debt in order for the kingdom to live on a sacrifice must be made brown is astounding as the sacrificial princess her performance keeps you engaged as she displays trepidation and determination to get out of her predicament brown does an excellent service to elodies character as an endearing and witty young woman that felt authentic on screen  though there are cgi flaws such as the glowing worms the film does a very great job with the dragon voiced by shohreh aghdashloo aghdashloo brings not only a haunting sense but also a depth in vulnerability to her role taking what couldve been a simple revenge story and adding a more sentimental aspect to her makes it enjoyable to unpack the bond elodie and the dragon create is an unexpected twist that adds to the tension towards the kingdom that lied to both of them compassion for the misunderstood is at the forefront of this film and makes for a compelling narrative  in dune part 2 paul atreides timothée chalamet unites with the fremen while seeking revenge against those who destroyed his family when hes faced with a terrible future only he can foresee he has a choice between love and the fate of the universe based on the scifi epic book series by frank herbert dune part two wasnt for me  and thats okay i found the film to be long and dragged out while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed the film is starstudded with actors like christopher walken that felt more like glorified cameos that dont add much to the story there is also a blondelevel moment of cringe around lady jessica rebecca ferguson that comes off as ridiculous the highlights were the epic action with the sand worms and florence pughs gorgeous wardrobe as princess irulan its been a great time for original horror in theaters but blumhouse hasnt been getting it right from lackluster entries like the exorcist believer and night swim imaginary is another l on the list the film follows jessica dewanda wise who moves back into her childhood home with her family the behavior of her youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun becomes concerning when she finds a stuffed teddy bear named chauncey that is much more that he seems while imaginary has surprising twists and turns its ultimately cheesy and unserious it is full of weak performances and even worse dialogue including an awkward line from a therapist asking if alice has taken on new hobbies like ventriloquism to explain chaunceys voice chauncey is more silly than scary  although under the right direction he couldve come across as more campy to win over audiences my theater was laughing a lot but more from weak dialogue which i dont think was the intent the stand outs in the film were the positive relationship that builds between jessica and her stepdaughters breaking the mold from typical stereotypes and the unique practical set of the imaginary world of the never ever which gave off labyrinth energy  a young woman eager to earn some cash arrives in a new town and secures a night shift at a sketchy motel managed by teddy miles lamorne morris who is friendly but slightly on edge and eager to leave miles assures gwen phoebe tonkin that the place is harmless despite all evidence to the contrary when miles leaves gwen is sure she is being watched by someone from her past but as the night progresses she becomes convinced the motel is haunted night shift is a movie that offers a few jump scares but takes too long to pick up the plot falls very flat and while the actors are good the characters introduced along the way are underdeveloped and underutilized while i thought the choice of committing to one location was just right for the film it could have been stronger if the story had more moments of spontaneity the story was pretty lackluster and predictable though the major plot twist was intriguing it created a rushed ending that failed to add to the story kristen maldonado is an entertainment journalist critic and oncamera host she is the founder of the outlet pop culture planet and hosts its inclusionfocused video podcast of the same name you can find her bingewatching your next favorite tv show interviewing talent and championing representation in all forms she is a rotten tomatoesapproved critic a member of the critics choice association latino entertainment journalists association and the television academy and a 2x shorty award winner shes also been featured on new york live ny1 the list tv den of geek good morning america insider mtv and glamour
Mar 13 2024,negative,though there are many lowimpact scares to be found in imaginary too few pack the kind of aftershock needed to truly creep out a seasoned horror fan 
Mar 13 2024,negative, were in between hollywoods biggest night and another nostalgia take from hollywood they aint afraid of no ghosts this week still here we are with a new set of smaller and streaming features this set of writeups includes a blumhouse horror flick a medieval action movie a hitman drama a comingofage story an la comedy a scifi drama and a farrelly brother comedy the following features reviews for imaginary damsel knox goes away uproar first time female director the animal kingdom and ricky stanicky the setup when jessica dewanda wise moves back into her childhood home with her family her youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun finds a stuffed bear named chauncey as alices behavior becomes more and more concerning jessica intervenes only to realize that chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be review theres a decent idea for a horror movie here and theres even an attempt to go pretty big for a blumhouse film in the third act that involves the results of a deadly imaginary friend and yet this is a pretty whatever sort of thriller where the scares are never that effective the rules surrounding this supernatural being are thin at best and the child performances arent very good wise is good enough as the films lead reckoning with a traumatic past the younger daughter played by braun eventually gets more to work with thanks to how chauncey influences her with that in mind betty buckley pops in here to scream exposition at the characters and its jarring to the point that i wish this film was campier as it stands any visual choices from director jeff wadlow are undone by the selfseriousness of this ordeal combined with the lowkey nature of how certain actions take place better than the killer pool movie but not by much the setup a young woman millie bobby brown agrees to marry a handsome prince nick robinson  only to discover it was all a trap she is thrown into a cave with a firebreathing dragon and must rely solely on her wits and will to survive review in the realm of fantastical netflix films i had more fun with this than rebel moon much of that comes down to how purposefully stripped down everything felt in terms of story on the one hand it leads to a couple redundant action scenes characters literally escape areas only to return to them again but it also reminded me of oldschool dungeoncrawler games with that in mind this has the feel of a video game i would play the setup diagnosed with a rapidly evolving form of dementia a contract killer michael keaton gets the chance to redeem himself by saving the life of his estranged son james marsden review its been 15 years since keatons directorial debut the merry gentleman but now hes returned with another sad hitman movie i guess this is just the type of character he can connect with most as a filmmaker regardless the film is decent at least from an acting front keaton works well with his actors marsden in particular and even imposes a quirky subplot involving the detectives trying to piece together some of the murders that have taken place in roles that feel like small favors al pacino and marcia gay harden show up to add a bit more esteem to the cast with the latter doing a lot with very little while pacino does a lot with his hair and sure pacino is still having fun here given the nature of keatons character theres enough to admire in watching him portray a man trying to settle his affairs before his mind goes im not sure how personal this may be for him but as a loose way to reflect on his public career theres enough to intrigue a bit on the slow side at nearly two hours knox goes away eventually gets away to an end and i felt positive enough about it the setup set in 1981 new zealand a 17yearold julian dennison is forced to make some choices about his life and stand up for himself his whānau and his future review what a joy this film was uproar may have a familiar arc but theres little to scoff at when its done right dennison who impressed myself and plenty of others thoroughly in taika waititis hunt for the wilderpeople gets to show off even more range here as a teenager going through a true push and pull as far as where he fits in watching his progression which involves figuring out his interests sorting out his family life and realizing what it means to be māori at this time in new zealand provides a real emotional ride it is only made better by this supporting cast that includes rhys darby underplaying it as a thoughtful teacher minnie driver as the mom and james rolleston from waititis boy as the older brother directors paul middleditch and hamish bennett provide many specific details that serve the story well and even manage to bring in more rugby than i can remember seeing at this level in a film made to find a balance between brighter moments and dramatic ones uproar is quite affecting for a comingofage story and a real winner the setup in a world hit by a wave of mutations transforming humans into animals françois romain duris does everything he can to save his wife as some creatures disappear into a nearby forest he and their son paul kircher embark on a quest that will change their lives review this film reminded me a bit of the 2018 swedish film border a best makeup  hairstyling nominee for how it built a fantastical plotline into a story clearly built around social commentary naturally one could also call something like xmen to mind when considering what directorcowriter thomas cailley is going for here this fits thanks to the approachable way this story plays out working as body horror a comingofage tale a father and son story and a scifi parable theres enough material here to feel as though it actually was a comic adaptation and yet its all presented in a relatively grounded way to the benefit of the film strong performances throughout including adéle exarchopoulos showing up in a more minor role theres just the right amount of imagination and wonder to balance the saddening side of how the public and those in charge would respond to this sort of phenomenon the setup a writer chelsea peretti steps in as a firsttime director to avoid putting the play shes written in jeopardy barely surviving rehearsals sam vents to her therapist amy poehler and tries unconventional tactics to wrangle her eclectic cast and make her play successful review so this is a shame peretti is a very funny comedian who can easily be a scenestealer in any movie or tv show shes appeared in sadly her directorial debut is not entirely up to snuff structured very similarly to christopher guests waiting for guffman sans the mockumentary approach this film lacks more consistent comedy let alone attempts at humor extending beyond the cringe brand emphasizing how seemingly doomed the eventual big show just may be first time female director is not devoid of humor as there are too many funny people from various corners of the modern comedy world to not land some jokes max greenfield has a good running gag about his attempts to attain more stardom poehler is always a guarantee of fun still first time or not its not the most auspicious attempt and theres a lack of finesse that shows the setup twenty years after creating the imaginary ricky stanicky three childhood friends zac efron andrew santino and jermain fowler still use the nonexistent pal as a handy alibi for their immature behavior when their spouses and partners get suspicious and demand to finally meet him the guilty trio hires washedup actor rod john cena to bring him to life however when rod takes his role of a lifetime a little too far they begin to wish they never invented ricky in the first place review following two oscar wins and a downthemiddle war comedy peter farrelly is back in fullon comedy mode even if hes missing his brother bobby perhaps pete needed him to better round out what we get here he was pretty good on his own last year with champions fortunately ricky stanicky isnt the worst the farrellys have offered up its actually one of their best pure comedies in over a decade however its still just not all there typical for the filmmaker the balance of raunchy gags heart and a display of respect by involving mentally challenged and disabled individuals are all there but not strong enough to support this premise the chief issue is efron who was so good in the iron claw but again shows how much support he needs to headline these comedies surrounded by a weak script hes forced to flounder next to him while some zingers are fun santino and fowler just arent bringing whats needed either however holding this entire movie on his back is cena who is having so much fun embodying the role of rodstanicky his timing is excellent and he once again shows how much better at riffing he is than his onetime enemy dwayne johnson on top of that william h macy also pops in to score some laughs the overall plot is too slapdash and sitcomy to stand up to farrelly greats like kingpin or theres something about mary so its not really a film id call good however if youre a cena fan you could do worse than good ol ricky
Mar 13 2024,negative, blumhouses theatrical endeavors have taken somewhat of a nosedive in recent months with a triple threat of certified stinkers the exorcist believer which foolishly assumed it could imitate its historic ancestor five nights at freddys which was more concerned with emptycalorie fan service than being a movie and night swim which suffered from a wickedly weak foundation more than anything all of them seemingly doing all they can to drag the name of a great filmmaking house down imaginary doesnt suffer for any of the reasons that plagued its production brethren but unfortunately it decided to utilize its own imagination to dream up new ways to manifest as an absolute misfire okay so maybe a distressingly weak script and acting that said script frankly deserves arent exactly brand new ways to gut a movie but imaginary also boasts the unique weakness of having picked the wrong genre with which to tell this story this genre misfire is a testament to both the potential of its premise and how severely it fails as a horror film imaginary follows jessica dewanda wise a childrens book author whos looking after her two stepdaughters  the teenage taylor taegan burns and small child alice pyper braun  while their father max tom payne is away on a tour the family have recently moved into jessicas childhood house where alice discovers an adorable stuffed bear named chauncey she bonds with the toy sweetly at first but when the games they play become increasingly hazardous and disturbing jessica is forced to confront her past in order to protect her new family now theres not a single good performance in sight here although the young braun shows an ability to render emotions thats quite impressive for her age but not even dionysus greek god of theatre nor any of his disciples would have been able pull off anything engaging in the face of imaginarys excruciatingly poor writing  and further still its not entirely clear whether such a weakness manifests by way of the script itself the cutting room or some combination of the two on the one hand the films dialogue is industriously flat and unnatural with the secondgreatest offender well get to the biggest one later being betty buckleys character gloria who can be most aptly characterized as madame exposition but on the other hand the movement both within and between each scene is just as inorganic giving the impression that if the script ever had a grasp on the concept of telling a story with therefore rather than and then  a crucially important skill to have for this craft  that grasp loosened in its translation to the screen though its also not insincere to assume that the aforementioned dialogue was an isolated flaw to the latter point of its jarringly stilted flow imaginary doesnt seem to understand how to be a horror movie which is different than being a film that isnt scary thats not to say that imaginary is scary because it isnt still horror films are more than capable of being great movies without necessarily being scary scary of course has such a mercurial threshold across humanity that its pretty fruitless to judge a film based on raw fear factor but imaginary again is not either of these indeed anyone familiar with the genre has a shared understanding whether theyre conscious of it or not of a certain language thats effectively native to horror movies a language that most recognizably takes the form of those secondtosecond beats and camera movements that prelude jumpscares and faux jumpscares the problem with imaginary is that while it seems to be aware of this language  at least based on how it frames the meat of its scary scenes  the clumsy rush that permeates the whole movie destabilizes that horror language therefore causing it to fall apart as a horror movie on a mechanical level and its not any better on a cerebral level either especially considering that theres a wealth of solidtoexcellent ideas one could conceptually pull out of imaginary a teddy bear as the main villain plenty of space to play around with the real and incanon psychology built into a symbol of a safe and happy childhood suddenly turning into this malicious presence an imaginary friend whose violence stems from the pain of abandonment with a stepmom protagonist trying to win over her stepkids no less go all in on exploring the darker nuances of love the unrequited breed the grief which by definition is love that has nowhere to go the paradox of the fact that real love is given without expecting anything in return despite all of us needing to be loved on some level in order to survive  imaginary has vague impressions of that second thread here and there but any piece of the plot that even suggests the possibility of an arc or a theme is quickly buried under another round of cumbersome writing before it even has a chance of a chance to take shape and nothing captures this frustrating faceplant better than the films ending which is the scripts biggest offender that i alluded to earlier after anticlimactically resolving what appears to be its final tension the film kicks off a new scene where jessica is reading her new book to her ill father only to pull a fast one and effectively repeat the same pseudoending we just watched after which the film actually does end the thing is  and im not just saying this to be grossly hyperbolic this is straightfaced dispassionate observation  the ending of that fake childrens book that we only heard the ending of is thematically a better ending than the one we got in this movie and i dont even know what else to say about that which is perhaps all that needs to be said anyway in closing imaginary shouldnt have rolled the dice on being a horror movie the sheer amount of lore implied in the world of this film which does actually pique genuine curiosity tells me it would have been better suited as a fullblown urban fantasy feature that imaginary wouldnt have been burdened by the dark weight that an outandout horror movie more or less requires and so could have thrown itself to the winds of a unique more upbeat adventure  one whose writing even if it was just as poor as that of the film we got at least wouldnt have been felt as harshly as audiences got sucked away in imaginative reverie but imaginary is in fact a horror movie as well as a dissonant canvas depicting just about everything you shouldnt do if you hope to tell a good story indeed considering he had to sit helplessly through roughly two months of that particular filming i dont blame chauncey one bit for being so pissed off
Mar 13 2024,negative, unfortunately most everything that precedes that overlong climaxtoanticlimax and onward ending is just as drawn out this jeff wadlow truth or darefantasy island thriller grabs a simple concept and overthinks it into a dumb and rather dull 90 minutes surrounding maybe a dozen minutes of delivering chills dewanda wise of the harder they fall and jurassic world dominion stars as jessica a childrens book author and illustrator happy to escape the nightmares of a city apartment and move with her new musician husband tom payne and his teen taegen burns and preschool pyper braun daughters back to the house she grew up in somewhere in louisiana  her books are about molly the millepede and her struggles with simon the spider mildmannered scary material aimed at the very young might they somehow tie into her past and that prologue that saw a black family struggling with something demonic hidden behind a crawlspace door jess overhears this chatter and is charmed and amused by it some of it even inspires her next story about that millipede a real help to an illustrator with a deadline and its a welcome break from the drama of the rebellious teen whose criticism of her various stepmom moves is not a help  the performances are mostly competently indifferent  although young miss braun packs a punch as a mouthy child who isnt shy about asserting herself to an imaginary friend who seems bent on causing her harm  the narrative steps on familiar touchstones of the genre  irresponsible fifteen yearold not taking care of her sister because theres a cute teen boy next door chauncey testing ally and making jess anxious the tunedout husband who has to go back on the road and the chatterbox neighbor buckley who seems to know all about jesss past and what might be going on with ally none of its handled with much pace humor suspense or style until our third act journey into the neverever and even that derivative as it is misses the mark in terms of real frights  explaining is almost always overexplaining in horror because the best jolts come from the shock of the unknown and unknowable the imaginary is always lot spookier than the explained
Mar 13 2024,neutral, reviewed by dennis schwartzthis is the first film writerdirector jeff wadlow kickass 2never back down has made for the blumhouse franchise wadlow cowrites it with greg erb and jason oremland they provide the usual horror pic scares and tropes for a silly film that is not good but might be strangely watchable if youre an adult who never grew up that is it might be watchable to some horror pic fans who can relate to its supernatural thrills even with the films bad acting undeveloped story and putrid dialogueimaginary is an unimaginative creepy horror pic about an imaginary evil friend a childrens doll found in a suburban household that was left behind by the child who possessed it and grew up and moved on without taking him alongjessica dewanda wise and her new husband max tom payne brit actor and his two children from a former marriage taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun move into jessicas childhood home hoping for a fresh startboth of them have experienced some prior grieffor her there was no father at home as a child for him he had to deal with the mental problems of his exwifewhen the youngest daughter alice finds an old teddy bear in the house she calls it chauncey and refers to it as her new friend well the doll turns nasty and real and becomes a problem thereby the couple have a problem as the doll ingrains himself into the household and has no intention this time of allowing the family to move on without himas it plays demented games to make sure of this which i guess proves you should never expect to safely retrieve a childhood doll you abandoned 
Mar 13 2024,negative,i respect the movie for using practical effects but you have to put some more money into this
Mar 12 2024,negative, blumhouse is a horror force to be reckoned with its unique industrydisrupting business model  give upandcoming horror directors a shot at the big time keep the budgets modest profit  has been hugely successful and its proved to be an important launchpad for filmmakers like jordan peele rob savage mike flanagan nikyatu jusu nahnatchka khan christopher landon and more but with that model perhaps comes a certain expectation of volume imaginary is the studios eighth film to be released in the past 12 months and while it is not a complete nightmare lately its hard not to feel quantity being favoured over quality directed by blumhouse alumnus jeff wadlow 2018s truth or dare imaginary seems at first glance to be one of those horrors attempting to introduce some spooky iconography chauncey the teddy bear is presented as a kind of cross between two pixar characters toy storys evil lotsohuggin bear and inside outs imaginary friend bing bong the latter is in fact frequently referenced throughout but the film doesnt quite have the sense of how to make chauncey feel iconic or portentous enough  ending up more like fozzie from the muppets than billy the puppet from saw instead what follows is rote horror tropes a creepy kid a spooky old house a dingy basement with flickering lights and trauma the thing that all modern horrors must apparently be underpinned by indeed theres more trauma here than the film knows what to do with illustrator and author jessica dewanda wise is haunted by the memory of her mothers death from cancer her father has been institutionalised and appears in her dreams with spooky spiders she is insecure about stepchildren learning to accept her as a parental figure and their biological mother is also dangerously disturbed so with a vague theme of parental anxiety jessica frets and worries as youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun spends a little bit too much time with chauncey the teddy and eventually some supernatural secrets begin to emerge some of the these secrets come from one of the worlds worst child psychologists who breaks patient confidentiality in order to forward the plot some come from an eyerolling twist if you can even call it that and some come from jessicas neighbour an elderly woman named gloria betty buckley who might as well be called basil exposition with lines of dialogue like every culture has a name for it the spanish call it el coco nothing here is especially awful and the cast wise especially are not really to blame everything just feels a bit flat its not particularly long but it moves at a tedious pace dialogue is tired and thoughtless the visuals are dull and repetitive some impressive mc escherinspired production design does come through in the more fantastical final act but even this feels too little and too late most crushingly the imaginary friends the evil spirits the things that the spanish call el coco  theyre simply not that scary they never quite land it all feels like something weve seen before executed so much better theres much talk of superhero fatigue at the moment but at this rate maybe we need to start worrying about horror fatigue too
Mar 12 2024,negative,the film suffers from a lack of  imagination bless dewanda wise for doing what she can with this bland retread of other better horror films but everything is so formulaic a few decent set pieces but not enough to recommend on the whole
Mar 12 2024,negative, hes not imaginary and hes not your friend alice says a line that resonates all the way to the tagline on the poster for wadlows underpowered film soon chauncey the bear is organising jumpscare packed scavenger hunts and helping jessica with her creepyass illustrations in a scenario almost identical to the equally insipid nightswim these projections from the spirit world are eager to see off any interlopers who might disrupt the family unit interruptions like taylors dorky boyfriend hes keen to pass off his moms allergy medicine as some kind of molly that will help her see 12 seconds into the future a line that gave this critic unwanted flashbacks to my own repressed memories of watching madame web imaginary isnt going great by the time we take a cognitive break from reality and jessica gloria taylor and alice conjure up a blue door that leads them to a world of pure imagination called the never ever to confront the spirit thats messing with their heads sometimes we create by tearing things apart says jessica  but wadlows film doesnt do enough ripping up of rules or offering original or creative thinking this feels very lowrent even for blumhouse and one wonders how the director of such one star fare as kickass 2 and fantasy island is getting gigs like this in the first place theres no flavour here but the blumhouse house style and thats wearing very thin these days the only thing thats imaginary here is the entertainment value its weak weak sauce even for the easily pleased this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are copyrighted to their respective owners all content cited is derived from their respective sources
Mar 12 2024,negative,ironically any actual exploration of imagination in the ultimately infantile imaginary has been sterilized with secondhand ideas and schlocky characterization 
Mar 11 2024,negative, despite some fun performances this comedy about socioeconomic class and human connection is driven by quirks and contrivances that undermine any authentic emotional grounding phil peter dinklage is a misanthropic finance professor whose elusive dream of home ownership prompts him to accept an unusual offer from an eccentric widow shirley maclaine to buy her estate for cheap  if only she can live there until she dies the resulting consequences send phil into an existential crisis down a personal and professional spiral favoring broad slapstick over edgy satire the film produces scattered laughs to offset its gaping logical inconsistencies the cast includes matt dillon and danny glover rated r 98 minutes the aesthetically pleasing sights and sounds can only partially compensate for the meandering nature of the multicultural queer romance at the center of this earnest tribute to 1990s indie rockers indigo girls their music provides the backdrop for the whirlwind summer of love involving a circus performer alex diaz and a struggling musician alan cammish as their relationship deepens however realities and uncertainties about the future threaten to tear them apart despite some nostalgic appeal and accompanying heartfelt intentions weaving the songs together with a coherent narrative resonates intermittently but lacks a deeper emotional hook the supporting cast includes tig notaro missi pyle and mingna wen not rated 116 minutes the best parts of the latest biographical documentary from director kevin macdonald the last king of scotland have little to do with the titular fashion designers bold visions or couture collections the conventional first half gives way to a dissection of gallianos fall from grace after a series of embarrassing drunken taunts and antisemitic rhetoric made him an outcast for more than a decade although too eager to embrace his redemption the film is a moderately intriguing exploration of celebrity ego cancel culture remorse and selfawareness its an illuminating portrait for fashion aficionados and also an indictment of the morally ambivalent industry that supports him not rated 117 minutes the lack of imagination is what sinks this hackneyed thriller from director jeff wadlow fantasy island that functions mostly as a parade of cheap thrills and genre cliches  it follows jessica dewanda wise who moves her family back into her childhood home where her young stepdaughter pyper braun becomes attached to a stuffed bear she finds in the basement while their interactions are initially playful things turn sinister for the girl forcing jessica to confront her troubled past along the way beneath the jump scares film lacks the consistent suspense to tap into juvenile paranoia and fractured families with any meaningful level of provocation rated pg13 104 minutes you might want to reconsider your childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut after watching this moderately insightful documentary which examines the psychological toll of extended space missions it centers on a nasa psychologist tasked with preparing potential candidates for a threeyear voyage to mars sometime in the next decade the film tracks families impacted by emotional challenges on past missions and research that has helped to develop to artificial intelligence and other tools to help combat anxieties from being in close quarters so far from home the result is enlightening but not especially cinematic considering its subject matter however it raises worthwhile questions without easy answers not rated 87 minutes
Mar 11 2024,negative, when horror nerds describe jason blums approach to the filmmakers he recruits for projects at blumhouse theyre likely to compare him to the big dawg roger corman in the way that he similarly to the king of new world pictures has an eye for good talent that can deliver him a solid 90minute release underbudget and ontime to be fair theres plenty of support for that claim  the guys nurtured some fantastic filmmakers through their first projects damien chazelle jordan peele etc and helped the old guard give their smallerscale works a decent home blackkklansman  but blums at his funniest when hes actively imitating menahem golan and yoran globus the men behind cannon films who were hucksters supreme and brought gloriously trashy and entertaining concepts to life with a fair amount of hollywoodadjacent skullduggery along the way the historical parallels arent there as often as they should be for a consistent comparison but theyre hilarious when they line up as they do with jeff wadlows imaginary another pg13 horror flick from the man who brought you truth or dare and the featurelength fantasy island remake its dumb too long and oftentimes deliriously funny in unintentional ways still if viewed as a massive troll job meant to directly fuck up a competitors forthcoming release it becomes kind of brilliant the subject of that troll job is of course john krasinskis if which will hit theaters in a few months and is a similar take with a significantly larger budget on the concept within imaginary  imaginary friends need kids to hang out with if theres no more room in fosters the specters will walk the earth hoping to latch themselves on to some poor child needing a pal and get the free room and board that comes along with it if i  a dude who has to keep up with the comingandgoings of the multiplex release calendar so that i can make 2000word dick jokes every friday  got confused between the two for months i imagine that theres gonna be a lot of parents who take their kids out to the theater this weekend thinking that theyll get fuzzy steve carrell creatures and ryan reynolds adlibs for a few hours instead theyll get chauncy bear and at least you could visibly tell the difference between chuck norris and the missing in action crew when sized up next to stallone and the rambo first blood part ii gang i dont know if krasinskis script was floating around hollywood for long enough to have a cheaper project like imaginary get fasttracked and 360 noscope schedulesnipe it but the similarities between the two are enough for me to believe it imaginary works best when viewed in that albeit selflimiting light  it is a hilarious prank pulled on a dude whod much rather youd saved your money for some of his good news when you get past all that though youre not really left with too much  even if if sucks this will likely still be the illusionist to krasinskis the prestige  even if wadlow and company got to the better title first the film is so stuffed with the cliches of modern blumhouse that youd assume they were making their own variation of the scavengerhunt checklist that chauncy bear  a plain teddy bear in a little red vest  asks little alice pyper braun who is a shockingly good actor for her age to make for him see alice found chauncy in the basement of her new house during a game of hideandseek with her stepmom jessica dewanda wise and the two have slowly become inseparable at first jessica and her partner max tom payne assume that its a cute new way for the girl to adjust to her new environment after suffering a great deal at the hands of her birth mom jessica assumes shell grow out of it especially in the security of what was once jessicas own childhood home though that has its own dark secrets to go with it  her father snapped one night when she was a girl and he was never quite the same the scars he left on his nightoframpage reminding her each day of what terror can be around every corner she privately doubts her ability to be a good mom especially when her other stepdaughter 15yearold taylor taegan burns is sending her evaluations in the form of some bitchy text messages whenever jessica does something she doesnt like but chauncy has other plans for the girl and his scavenger hunt might be a little more mystical than a childhood makepretend quest  and jessica an artist with an overactive imagination might be essential to this monsters plans than it may seem at first blush now wadlows budget hampers what he can do with his nightmares and dreamscapes  this of course goes to the same type of mystical fantasy land that insidious the red door and night swim goes to  and its kind of funny that wadlow gets outcompeted in this department by a disney channel original movie dont look under the bed which is probably the single best thing that company ever put on cable and it also doesnt help that chauncy spends the movie meanmugging his expression going from mild to glowering in a way that involves the dolls model being substituted instead of just lit in strange ways you dont need to manipulate an object as much to make it that scary  the stillness and the dark contrast between its innocence and its evil works is the spooky thing it gets particularly funny at certain points especially in a postted world maybe if he had a dispensary down the street chauncy would have been a little cooler and more relaxed but we get the chauncy we deserve and not the one that we want  and this one is unintentionally hilarious rather than intentionally so  its beyond wadlows powers to make this bear scary and a thirdact reveal about him is especially silly given that it throws the entire conceit into disarray and justifies the name  imaginary friends arent usually objects imaginary is more boring than anything else  the film moves forward at a creep going through the motions of your standard nongory teenfriendly horror march release and ends ultimately in a dull poltergeist reference that might make you wish you were at home watching that instead but as a way for jason blum and company to rain on office jims parade its transcendent so who knows  if you really hate the

Mar 11 2024,positive,a reasonably entertaining mashup of horror ideas
Mar 11 2024,positive,  writer and director jeff wadlow has a storied history crafting creepy tales for blumhouse the modern mogul of horror features for his latest hes taken on the creepy kids and surrogate parents subgenre to tell the tale of a spooky friend named chauncy who terrorizes jessica dewanda wise and her new husbands children alice pyper braun and taylor taegen burns his version starts off as a less exciting version of its flood of cohorts but it later commits so hard to its own bit that it becomes the zany halloween treat that aged fans of marykate and ashley spooky movies might beg for jessica isnt a reluctant surrogate mother shes a zealous one taking on her husbands children whove been left behind by their mentally ill mother is a challenge for the childrens author who is excited by the idea of having a happy family something she lost out on in her own childhood but its not easy being a stepmom especially with a brand tarnished by fairy tales and jessica butts heads with the older daughter taylor and has a hard time managing the specific needs of the younger allison a playful and warm child scarred by the experience of her mother after struggling with nightmares in their shared apartment jessica and the gang move into her childhood home which has become available since her ill father had to move into a place with fulltime care her husband insists he knows its her happy place and that she will be happy there even though she left there at age five after some trauma she cant really remember this is the first of the storys unfortunate disconnects from logic that signal a lot of it was made without a reliance on crafting a quality script but it doesnt matter much after some runtime stretching beats by way of a troublemaker neighbor an eccentric old lady and something about childrens illustrations and deadlines the story takes a turn when the imaginary friend allison has latched onto pushes her to some dangerous acts a visit from alices therapist turns sour and new secrets are revealed which sets the story off from another in a long line of same old and into a zany tale of occultism for kids at the risk of doing my usual listing of cohorts this feature has more in common with the recent terrible five nights at freddys than it does with mama and the babadook its easier to compare it to the criminally underseen z though that one is much more grim despite following the same premise of a shared experience with an invisible pal imaginary could have so easily been relegated to being the next boring take on creepy kid bologna and its first half full of nonsense filler and ridiculous conversations made me think thats where it would live but the moment after its best scare youll know it when you see it its not so different from what you might see in the conjuring 2 the story flips from being a daylight the boogeyman into a wacky fright that exploits dare i say it liminal spaces theres a temptation to scrutinize ratings for horror movies us recently experiencing what happened to black christmas and the complaints splashed all over the bloodless m3gan but maybe not all scary movies are made for those of us comforted by sharp weapons piercing skin and releasing gallons of crimson fluid i cant guess why imaginary is pg13 but it thrills me that younger audiences might see this as a bridge from phantom of the megaplex to malignant imaginary is the kind of stupid movie thats played with such earnestness that it begs to be accepted into camp or cult standing though it probably wont be its not going to break the internet the way other new zaniness did but for younger audiences looking to wade into terrorizing features chauncy is like a predator holding a nut trying to pull a squirrel into a horrific space
Mar 11 2024,neutral, the premise of imaginary is a rather good one and writers jeff wadlow who also directed greg erb and jason oremland deserve that much but the execution especially as it pertains to a convoluted narrative couldve used some i dunno imagination rather than lean into the scripts strongest elementa teddy bear comes to life and stalks an unsuspecting householdimaginary falls back on lame horror troupes laughable dialogue halfbaked side characters and a bewildering finale that creates an experience far from wondrous aside from some decent practical effects and commendable camera movements in the latter half theres not much creative flair  the story involves strange family dynamics from the start it follows childrens author jessica dewanda wise who desperately wants to connect with her stepchildren taylor and alice taegen burns and pyper braun after their biological mother was hospitalized for mental health issues that crucial plot detail isnt used in any meaningful way and is casually thrown into the movie for the sake of a juicy argument rather than an enhancingteachable story development the patriarch of the house max tom payne is also pretty useless leaving about midway through to pursue his musical career while jessica babysits its almost as if the writers needed to come up with a quick way to get rid of him  their family has moved into jessicas childhood home and with it comes a handful of memories though shes conveniently replaced the traumatic memories with those of happy ones because if we knew about the bad ones then imaginary would have no place to go and that journey begins when alice stumbles upon a stuffed bear in the basement named chauncey of course what starts as a seemingly harmless childs relationship with their stuffed animal predictably veers into sinister territory as the imaginary friend sends the young alice on among other things a scavenger hunt from hell and the family is left to pick up the pieces  theres no way you could guess where imaginary takes its third act but without revealing too many details lets say its production design resembles a sadistic funhouse with various supernatural elements with a tighter script characters we cared about and less investment in trying to conjure silly twists this imaginary realm could have set the stage for a grand climax but alas it merely suggests ideas more than acting on them wadlow tries combating these problems by having characters especially a wild betty buckey playing the neighborhood snoop gloria overexplain scenarios beyond the point of satire but as the credits roll all youre really left with is to imagine there was probably a more fulfilling way to use your time
Mar 10 2024,positive, in the crammed video aisle of supernatural horror films the introduction of a villainous teddy bear in imaginary might initially raise more eyebrows than pulse rates directed with a keen eye for the absurd by jeff wadlow director of nofs fave crywolf and penned by the trio of wadlow greg erb and jason oremland this latest offering from blumhouse productions  the powerhouse behind a slew of commodified villains  might seem like its scraping the bottom of the horror trope barrel the film stars dewanda wise tom payne and the delightful betty buckley in a narrative that threads the familiar needle of haunted playthings and the unseen horrors they sneak under our beds the premise of imaginary tiptoes around the edge of being all too familiar jessica dewanda wise and her family including the youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun move back to her childhood home only for alice to unearth a seemingly innocuous stuffed bear chauncey from the basement as expected chauncey is no ordinary bear and alices attachment to it heralds a series of increasingly sinister events herein lies the films first stumble the wellworn path of imaginary friends and malevolent childhood relics feels somewhat exhausted any anticipation for innovation is met with a premise that feels as if its been pulled from an already dogeared page of the horror genres playbook however imaginary manages to swerve unexpectedly from eyerollworthy to surprisingly delightful its as if the film looked into the abyss of its own absurdity and decided to embrace it with open arms chauncey with his adorably menacing facial expressions becomes an unlikely anchor for the films charm the campy special effects  including the memorable though hardly frightening teddy bear eyes on human characters  contribute to a sense of gleeful selfaware absurdity imaginary leans into its silliness with such enthusiasm that its hard not to be swept along for the ride despite a small echo of coralines vibes in its approach the extended horror sequences highlighted by a suspenseful game of cat and mouse involving nothing but a teddy bear and its ripcord are executed with a finesse that contrasts the films otherwise fluffy antagonist here imaginary excels ramping up tension without resorting to cheap thrills or redundant scares a strategy reminiscent of james wans most celebrated works like insidious the film commendably refrains from undercutting its own suspense choosing instead to maintain the integrity of its frights even with a 2foot antagonist at its helm among the performances dewanda wises portrayal of jessica shines brightly even if her relentlessly positive vibe sometimes feels out of step with the films darker turns taegen burns shines as the quintessentially sullen stepdaughter and betty buckley delivers a memorable turn as the nosy neighbor with a librarys worth of crucial exposition as imaginary careens into its finale it throws in everything but the kitchen sink  a notsobeloved hallmark of the genre the films endgame while brimming with the kind of overthetop campy energy that marks its best parts feels like a somewhat disjointed conclusion to its dual ambitions to tell a profound story of family and trauma and to revel in its identity as a cheeseball movie about an evil bear its in its unapologetic embrace of the latter that imaginary finds its sweet spot despite flirting with some of horrors more overdone clichés imaginary manages to carve out a niche for itself with its embrace of the absurd it proves that all a good horror flick might need is a dash of creativity and a willingness to lean into the madness so if youre game for a movie that doesnt skimp on the cheese or the thrills imaginary might just be the teddy bearthemed horror movie you didnt know you needed welcome to nightmare on film street  the best horror movie podcast for those who love a side of humor with their scares ever wish you could keep the conversation going after a great horror movie join horror hosts kimmi and jon every thursday as they explore the horror genre in a way thats engaging humorous and refreshingly candid forget the indepth analyses and pull up a seat for lively friendly banter that feels just like a postmovie chat with your best pals at a local bar
Mar 10 2024,positive, there can be a very thin line between cute and creepy just look at chucky m3gan or the cabbage patch kids not all of these are killer toys but all of them could be believably beloved by children while giving grownups the heebiejeebies coming to join their perturbing plaything ranks is chauncey bear in imaginary  plus like blumhouses other recent killer toy offerings m3gan and five nights at freddys imaginary is pg13 allowing budding horror fans to get in on the freaky fun  written by a quartet of scribes  greg erb bryce mcguire jason oremland and director jeff wadlow  the plot line to imaginary is a bit convoluted sure at its creepy core its the tale of a girl and the teddy bear who might just kill her but the framing has flourishes maybe too many  dewanda wise who is the best part of bad movies poolman and jurassic world dominion stars as jessica a celebrated childrens book author tackling a new challenge stepmom moving into her childhood home with her husband max tom payne his surly teen daughter taylor taegen burns and his sugary youngest alice pyper braun wise has the chance to be the mother she never had but she must also face the dark secrets of a past shes long forgotten also shell deal with her musician husband going on tour her elderly father suffering from some form of dementia a nosy neighbor and finding inspiration for her next book all of those threads will tie back to alices new imaginary friend chauncey bear who loves scavenger hunts is always hungry and demands obedience as jessica begins to realize something is definitely wrong in her home notsosweet home she must bond with her daughters to conquer a ravenous evil  wadlow whos helmed such twisted slashers as cry wolf truth or dare and fantasy island isnt breaking new ground with imaginary scare setups rely on the old classics like an outoffocus figure lurking in the background of a dark basement a creepy toy appears out of nowhere and moves inexplicably but these oldies are still goodies executed with terrific timing so a bump in the night leads to our horror heroine peeking under the bed for a jolting jump scare  plotwise there are similarities with mama the andy muschietti horror treat where a reluctant foster mom must protect two young girls from a mysterious vicious force but imaginary is less haunting and more playful in its approach inviting in younger audiences exploring their personal fear factors  creepy kid stuff makes its way in as alice is influenced by chauncey leading to tense scenes of therapy and slight bloodshed but much of the violence is offscreen or implied  a scream there a pool of blood there the pg13 rating keeps gore at bay still the creatures make this feature frightful fun  the design of the bear is smart its cuddly but rattylooking and its features sometimes contort slightly to suggest something sinister at play but in nightmares and a labyrinthian climax bigger badder beasties come out and while a grownups eye might see a man in a terrific costume perhaps with some cgi enhancements its still delightfully devilish unnatural silhouettes gaping maws protruding claws and hissing warnings paired with kids fare like a music box and a twisted scavenger hunt offer a spooky twist on playtime  the plotline gets cluttered with characters who feel more like plot points than people a cocky teen boy shows up to be awful then terrified the requisite husband is sidelined comically early so hell be no help to the girls or hindrance to the plot moving along even a creepy neighbor played by carries betty buckley feels awkwardly wedged in dampening the surprise of her thirdact involvement  despite the clunky story wise and braun ground their characters making the movie undeniably compelling to her credit burns as the older daughter is earnest but saddled with lots of clichéd dialogue dripping in teen angst her character is wincingly onenote wise weaves her way through exposition dumps to create heartfelt emotion whether jessica is hit by a shock from her past or a crisis in her present in scenes where she fears her own failure the very real terror of being a parent brings chills but braun is the show stealer  as alice braun is chipper and cheerful with rosy cheeks and a smile that wont be denied whatever it requests a paintbrush a toy some payback but  as seen in the trailers  when chauncey talks he talks with her voice there braun spits out the kind of scary voice you might expect from a kid low and grumbly enhanced with audio effects it becomes an ungodly echo that bellows horrid things making for a tantrum that is terrifyingly nextlevel  overall imaginary is overstuffed with plot points constructing not only a story of a fractured family but also a growing lore clearly intended to spark a new franchise that can appeal to a broad demographic and yes the pg13 rating means imaginary is fairly soft for horror its scares are more spooky than harrowing however wadlow has a solid sense of timing his tension wise grounds the emotional stakes while braun gives us a child to worry over and a monster to shiver over so while a bit unwieldy imaginary is a playfully deranged movie thats sure to be a hit at slumber parties but grownups can enjoy its spirited scares too  kristy puchko is the film editor at mashable based in new york city shes an established film critic and

Mar 10 2024,negative, directed by jeff wadlow starring dewanda wise tom payne veronica falcón betty buckley taegen burns pyper braun dane diliegro alix angelis cecilia leal and matthew sato a woman returns to her childhood home to discover that the imaginary friend she left behind is very real and unhappy that she abandoned him imaginary comes across like a halfway decent story that another writer got a hold of and retooled into something much more stupid and reliant on typical modern mainstream horror clichés rather than the well imaginative ideas at the center of the narrative noticing on the credits that cowriterdirector jeff wadlow collaborated with multiple screenwriters greg erb and jason oremland reinforces that gut feeling regardless the biggest cinematic sin here is how much of a drag the experience is before even attempting to do something scary even when it does there is only a halfhearted commitment that doesnt elicit much reaction the storys center involves some tumultuous family dynamics at the expense of siblings taylor and alice taegen burns and pyper braun who are not sold on their stepmom jessica dewanda wise for forced reasons that never felt clear of course its natural for teenagers and young children to push back against such change but imaginary wants that friction just for the story briefly showing their biological mother as a woman still struggling with some unexplained substance abuse the less said about their musician father max tom payne the better he is so little of a character that his profession seems to have been a choice just to put him on tour and get him away from these characters 30 minutes into the movie as for jessica she is a successful writer and illustrator of childrens books with the family moving back into her childhood home for again reasons that dont entirely make sense its a home filled with happy memories for her but also a place where serious trauma occurred involving her father she has also conveniently forgotten a good chunk of what happened because otherwise there would be no movie its just another embarrassment in this script nevertheless the film desperately tries to say something about the sacrificial nature of parenting but never amounts to anything interesting despite a serviceable ensemble while the more angsty and defiant taylor tries to hang out with an older neighboring boy who has no good intentions alice finds a stuffed bear in the basement that quickly becomes her imaginary friend and named chauncey the one bright spot here is that young pyper braun is actually quite convincing here at selling the friendship especially when the scavenger hunt chauncey puts her on increasingly becomes dangerous and cruel however the film maintains the obviousness that something is off about this imaginary friendship for too long this is a 105minute film that sometimes feels like its never going to end especially during a finale that is stretched out to the point of exhaustion and no longer caring about anything happening without diving too much into spoiler territory especially since some of these thirdact ideas could have made for a potentially solid horror film the setting shifts into an imaginary spiritual realm haunted by a demonic entity unfortunately imaginary still chooses to spend its time on excessive side characters mindnumbing betrayals and overexplaining the situation when seeing and taking advantage of film as a visual medium would be far more compelling instead some therapists show up and overstay their welcome dropping terminology that feels hilariously fake and dumb even for a horror movie imagine the better movie that could have been
Mar 10 2024,negative, when i was a kid i had a menagerie of imaginary friends that followed me wherever i went we had madeup languages and customs an entire world that just existed in my head and was acted out as a strange onechild show that surely looked like utter madness to even my parents in short i had a very active imagination that imagination was my refuge in a strange childhood navigating divorced parents and mixing families so it comes as no surprise that jeff wadlows new blumhouse film imaginary piqued my interest and despite his best efforts wadlows latest shows only faint glimmers of what could have been hiding behind a confused traumaobsessed plot that never quite sticks the landing the cold open shows promise as dewanda wises jess runs from a man covered in blood and a spider demon she jolts awake from her nightmare in bed with her new husband max tom payne in their small apartment trying to cheer her up max says they should just move into their new house now a fresh start for everyone importantly this is jesss family home bequeathed to her after her father was placed in assisted living this house is meant to be a beacon of hope a new chapter not just for jess and max but for his daughters taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun as well all have undergone unspoken traumas that lurk at the surface of their subconscious making them cautious of everything as they navigate this literal and figurative space  quickly max leaves to go on tour and jess is left with the kids excited for muchneeded bonding time however things start getting weird fast with alices new teddy bear chauncey which she found in the dank basement something about chauncey is sadly endearing an abandoned stuffed animal thats been loved a little too hard but when the game he tells alice to play gets physically violent jess realizes theres something very wrong with her old house but only with the help of her old babysitter gloria betty buckley and the girls can she unlock her past and traverse the never ever  for a blumhouse release imaginary is a surprisingly matriarchal film where several generations of women work together and form a sort of micro society when it comes to battling the supernatural this isnt investigated that deeply though outside of following jesss own journey navigating her new role as a mother wise throws herself into the role and really pulls what she can from a script full of stiff dialogue that never quite conveys enough warmth to feel authentic  sloppy writing aside one of the films biggest strengths is its dedication to practical effects when the monsters grace the screen its genuinely exciting to see their haunting forms scitter across the screen even chauncey as the sweet teddy bear is perfectly designed to seem innocent yet uncanny hes not as obviously scary as annabelle or chucky but thats the power of chauncey he has the potential to be the next big cutesy horror villain he just needs a stronger story always glued to chaunceys side is braun in a truly impressive performance as a new actor she taps into an incredible emotional range that elevates her character from creepy child to empathetic kid its refreshing to see a kid have such depth and be more than an object to convey fear  perhaps a sequel that leans more into fun and practical effects will elevate chauncey to the next level theres a nugget of an interesting idea here especially when it comes to the fantastical creature and world design but the fun is concealed by a massive curtain of confused lore and murky trauma that misses the mark in creating a thoughtful commentary of the power of imagination chauncey needs to be a campy creature that speaks to the more dastardly sides of imagination rather than a shallow commentary on healing justice for chauncey
Mar 9 2024,negative,its weighed down by murky cinematography jumbled editing and the kind of screenplay where characters constantly just say whatevers on their mind no matter how inappropriate their timing is
Mar 9 2024,positive, lets get this out of the way up top imaginary is pretty bad its full of nonsensical line readings characters with inexplicable motivations characters who overexplain their motivations jump scares that barely count as startles and some of the most obvious foreshadowing ive seen since a character looked at the wall while talking about their son whos still with us at the beginning of creepydoll movie the boy after the twist is revealed though theres still a significant chunk of the movie left imaginary goes completely and gleefully off the rails taking a hard left turn into some delightfully imaginative stupidity what begins as boring and predictable becomes something far sillier and there are lots of pleasures to be found in this movies third act for those willing to wait for them at the beginning of the film we meet a childrens book artist named jessica dewanda wise and her new husband max tom payne jessicas been having nightmares that seem to be set in her childhood home so to help her sleep better jessica and max decide to move into their new home  jessicas childhood home after all it was her happy place how will moving into her childhood home stop the nightmares about her childhood home you ask its unclear jessica has two new stepdaughters taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun little alice is sweet but the teenage taylor is a brat who doesnt like her new stepmom the house is full of reminders of jessicas childhood like scribbles on the walls and boxes of art in the basement the basement is also where alice finds a nondescript teddy bear named chauncey sitting alone behind a hidden door she starts to carry him everywhere talking to him always and sometimes he seems to talk back
Mar 9 2024,negative,such a dull missed opportunity
Mar 9 2024,negative, imaginary is the newest chapter of the blumhouse lineup directed by truth or dare producer jeff wadlow blumhouse has a hitormiss roster and imaginary feels like another chapter in the list of filler films it suffers from the plague of overly convoluted plots that are executed by overly simplistic means flat expositional dialogue car commercial visual style and a seemingly first draft creative concept that never irons out the wrinkles  jessica dewanda wise is a childrens book author and illustrator who is working to form bonds with her stepdaughters the angry and angsty teen taylor taegen burns and the younger more open alice pyper braun when jessica and her husband max tom payne move the family into her childhood home alice latches on to an imaginary friend chauncey that exacerbates the already fragile domestic situation and awakens dormant memories from jessicas past what seems like an innocuous childhood rite of passage becomes more sinister as alices bear demands increasingly alarming actions from alice to prove their friendship before he takes her on a trip within the domestic drama of jessicas feelings of displacement in the family unit is a secondary plot line that hints at outoffocus childhood traumas and a fractured relationship with her father jessicas escape is her imagination the creation of her childrens books likewise taylor and alices mother is committed due to mental health struggles and as alice looks to find her footing her imagination opens the door to chaunceys influence while the psychic tether between alice and jessica becomes more clear throughout the film the rest of the story diverges onto a path of confoundment introducing new laws worldbuilding and histories that throw the previous narrative into oblivion  when an old neighbor and jessicas childhood babysitter gloria betty buckley comes into the picture imaginary teeters off the thin ledge of horror and into very shallow waters of mythic science fiction gone are the conventions of a possessed bearspiritdemon and in is a coralinestyle hidden door that leads to a labyrinthine underworld of imagination inhabited by long lost children stolen by bugeyed imaginary friends its a cg landscape somewhere between the haunted mansion and thirteen ghosts but without the fun levity of either  while it desires itself to be a horror film what ensues over the course of its runtime feels more like a confused study of tropes that never pay off for its genre aspirations imaginary has a pointed lack of scares and gore relying more on the mere idea of what its concept could be rather than what the film actually is theres no carnage candy or heart pounding suspense to relieve the film from its droning pace and instead it gets caught in a cycle of disappointments as the suggestion of bloodshed or tension fizzles into yet another fakeout the script written by wadlow jason oremland and greg erb is painfully plain doing no favors to equally vapid performances by the cast every line is incredibly obvious and unnatural uttered only to progress a theme or provide context to the next scene imaginary never seems dug into the facets of its potential it couldve been a campy bloodsoaked version of ted or an absurd selfaware horrorcomedy like m3gan or childs play but instead it floats somewhere else in the ether detached from any feelings of intention or thoughtfulness it doesnt need to be a carbon copy of any of its somewhat similar predecessors but what it neglects is the identity that the other movies possess imaginary is utterly forgettable bland and directionless ironically so as for a film that lauds the power of imagination it shockingly neglects the very element of its own ethos
Mar 9 2024,negative, imaginary is blumhouse throughandthrough once in a while jason blums template results in an honesttogod inventive horror experience but more often than not his cheaplymade throwway films belong buried six feet under with the various killers creeps ghosts and demons that populate them imaginary has all the requisite hallmarks a cast of unknowns a screenplay that feels halffinished a familiar director a small budget and a teenfriendly pg13 rating to be fair imaginary tries to be a little different playing with warped perceptions of reality but the need to include too many horror tropes results in a confused and at times confusing storyline the trailer also sells a different movie but thats the fault of the marketing department not the filmmakers the movie opens by introducing the main character jessica dewanda wise who has decided to move back to her childhood house with her new family husband max tom payne teenage stepdaughter taylor taegen burns and 8year old stepdaughter alice pyper braun while rooting through boxes in disused parts of the house alice discovers jessicas teddybear chauncey an immediate bond forms between alice and her imaginary friend initially jessica sees this as a positive development and focuses her attention on becoming more of a motherfigure to taylor who is in a rebellious phase but chauncey is no benign inanimate object and alices fixation on accompanying the supernatural entity to some never ever place alarms jessica  especially since it echoes aspects of her own dimlyremembered childhood the gap between what imaginary wants to be and what it achieves is vast director jeff wadlow may have had grand ideas for the production but what reaches the screen is a collage of partially realized ideas  some good some bad  that are undermined by plastic acting wooden dialogue and an embarrassment of an ending allusions to a nightmare on elm street and other better movies that play with the boundaries between imaginationfantasy and reality are intentional but feel almost insulting by their inclusion  the childindanger trope is commonplace in modern horror but it needs to be approached with care in this case its more disturbing than effective in large part because the screenplay only plays at having empathy with alice a scene in which she nearly impales her hand on a rusty nail may cause some viewers distress  just ask a parent of any young child not to be repulsed in terms of the more conventional horror aspects even though the monster is given the jaws treatment kept mostly in the shadows and rarely fully shown its cheesiness is inescapable hearkening back to the maninarubbersuit era  this is wadlows third outing for blumhouse although a terrible film its the best of the three  the others were onestar stinkers truth or dare and fantasy island wadlows love of pg13 horror is part of the problem  all his movies represented rrated material ruthlessly neutered to make them available to younger viewers for blum this is just another in a seeminglyendless stream of titles it doesnt need to do more than break even a low bar considering the minimal production costs and given the current horror zeitgeist it will likely achieve that level of success business considerations aside however theres nothing imaginary about how bad a misfire this movie is even for the blumhouse base
Mar 9 2024,negative, dune part one was my favourite film of 2021 i was captivated by its visuals its scope its scale and the depth of its story as someone who has not read frank herberts seminal novel i was not sure what to expect but the results blew me away now three years later is the followup or more succinctly part two of the story director denis villeneuve has over the last few years firmly established himself as hollywoods premier visual director delivering epic scifi films such as the aforementioned dune blade runner 2049 and arrival and dune part two continues this trend with a grandeur that is nothing short of breathtaking somehow part two manages to up the ante in every aspect including performances to deliver an unforgettable experience in all honesty i did not watch dune part two i experienced it from the beautiful majesty of its visuals to the aweinspiring sound design and the fantastic production design this film was an absolute joy to behold the story this time around focuses on larger and deeper thematic strands continuing the story of part one and taking it to new and exciting and also dark places as we continue following our lead paul atreides played with confident steel by timothée chalamet the full starstudded cast has a part to play and they play it with such enthusiasm and confidence especially zendaya as the warrior chani who is given far more to do this time around and austin butler in an unrecognisable and memorable turn as the villain feydrautha harkonnen though villeneuve is absolutely a visual director there are plenty of smaller character moments that pay off handsomely by the end of the movie though it could be argued that the final twenty minutes of the movie were rushed and i cant disagree the finale felt like a more than satisfying conclusion to this movie story and a tantalising followup to the next film in the saga dune messiah without spoiling anything in this film the messiah aspect of the third instalment will be key as part two deals with a messianic revolution bumping up against more grounded see less religious principles and ideas and the ramifications of every related decision which will prove significant going forward dune part two is a thrilling exciting heavy and intelligent science fiction film that should be celebrated for years to come it will be hard for any other film this year to top the majesty scale and epicness of dune part two and yes this could potentially become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made if dune messiah sticks its landing time will tell but whatever the outcome dune part two is a film that deserves to be remembered and lauded blumhouses terrible recent output has included night swim and five nights at freddys and many would happily include the exorcist believer into the mix and cutting to the chase imaginary can be added to the list in fact imaginary tops the list of blumhouses failures as this is simply a dreadful film imaginary is the type of bland banal uninspired and lazy horror film that is becoming common in the genre as a way of gaining a quick buck for minor output  but this could be a new low how this received a 15 rating in the uk from the bbfc is beyond me as nothing happens literally chauncey  the bear in the marketing  does nothing one person dies offscreen and there are a few hokey jumpscares but other than that its a poorly acted slog about a new family wading through generic drama as alice braun the weird young kid bonds and speaks to a teddy bear for about an hour it then becomes a cheaplooking attempt to capture the magic of older better horror flicks with a crazed abysmal betty buckley gurning and shouting for the camera in an attempt toget chauncey the bear over  they namecheck him so many times that it becomes a parody and they provide him with a warped version of alices voice which was nothing short of hilarious a midmovie therapy session provided a good belly laugh due to this i felt for dewanda wise here as she tries she really tries to sell what she is asked to do and she is a likeable presence in the film as the stepmother who just wants to bond with her new family but nothing is saving this not even tom paynes middleclass english rockstar who plays the worlds most oblivious father before he departs the entire movie to go on tour adds anything how this narrative ended the way it did is mindboggling  who in their right mind would conjure this up and look proudly at it smiling like a new parent and declare it fit for humans to endure hopefully blumhouse can get back on track this year though their next scheduled release is a remake of the excellent speak no evil so who knows what theyll do with that imaginary may work as a gateway horror but even then it could traumatise people who then move on to stronger horror like madame web there is nothing redeemable about this and its one of the worst horror films ive seen in years im left imagining the utopia i lived in before seeing imaginary as it was an infinitely better time move over valek theres a new nun in town sydney sweeneys sister cecilia is the latest asskicking agent of god ready to throw down with the worst that hell can offer actually no she isnt michael mohans immaculate is a religious horror that is not in keeping with recent offerings such as the nun films and prey for the devil in that our lead is not fighting demons or the possessed  instead she is dealing with a miracle  an immaculate conception  following her transfer from her closed parish in the states to a secluded convent in picturesque italy and as the story progresses it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems in the sprawling echofilled convent lit mainly by candles and atmosphere immaculate is a solid slowburn horror until it takes a turn in the final fifteen minutes where it leans fully into its gonzo nature channelling the new french extremity subgenre of years past and delivering a finale that feels bolder than most in recent years sydney sweeney continues her recent dabbling in different genres and delivers a strong overall performance despite an admittedly rocky opening act leading to an allin virtuoso final onetake sequence it should be said that narratively immaculate isnt necessarily providing anything original however its dedication to atmosphere scares and impressive gore keeps this entertaining for the entirety of its brisk runtime that was my main takeaway from the film for a story dealing with heavy subjects and imagery i found myself simply enjoying what i was watching the filmmakers were able to move between moods deftly and i never felt an imbalance in tone  though i do believe an extra ten minutes or so in the final third would have eased its slightly frantic feel or maybe the chaotic nature was just what the film needed to end on either way immaculate was an unexpected curveball given the major recent genre and subgenre outputs effectively crafted with an unnerving score from will bates it felt bold at times and patient at others leading to its gonzo finale sweeney is impressive here and though it may not be perfect it was nuntheless a lot of fun  surprisingly too for the majority of my life bustin has made me feel good great in fact ive been a fan of ghostbusters since i was a kid way back when and it has been so good to see the franchise back on the big screen again following 2016s answer the call and 2021s wonderful afterlife while 1984s original classic was a snarky satire on small businesses and the supernatural horror genre that hasnt stopped sony from expanding on its humble roots now in 2024 we have ghostbusters frozen empire directed by gil kenan this is the first film in the main continuity not directed by a reitman  though jason remains on board as a writer  and finds the whole gang from afterlife ogs included back in new york city to bust a chilly ancient villain garakka who is hellbent on claiming the city and the world as his frozen empire the trailers promised something bigger than before and frozen empire is certainly bigger but unfortunately it is not better it is absolutely an enjoyable romp but one that is overstuffed and a world away from 1984s original in terms of tone vibe and attempts at a grounded feel yes ghosts walking statues and marshmallow men exist hear me out where that film and ghostbusters ii succeeded was in keeping things focused on our crew the schlubs who were just like us but everyone involved worked with the tools they had  frozen empire takes wild detours that explicitly bring the supernatural to the human characters and it is to the detriment of the story the story itself is bursting at the seams from the beginning with too many characters and too much happening there are new villains old characters a focus on phoebes emotional arc a new ghostbusting laboratory and much more as a result of trying to give every member of the cast something to work with no character has a chance to stand out fully and the story suffers the characters and performances are all fine enough grace is again very good as phoebe  though her main subplot featuring a solid lind was horribly disappointing  and rudd aykroyd and nanjiani provide strong supporting performances but the sheer volume of characters means no one has a chance to stand out fully murray oswalt hudson kim coon  all get fun moments but it becomes a mess by the time the big marvelesque showdown arrives complete with a fully cgi villain gozer and vigo worked so well because they were played by actors on set they felt authentic but here the fear factor was lost despite garakkas great visual look now there were plenty of great gags and quips throughout  murray and nanjiani were having a blast  alongside some fun scenes of bustin ghosts including some cool new ghosts and smaller character moments so frozen empire isnt a flop or a writeoff far from it it is very watchable and enjoyable but it is unfocused the franchise seems geared firmly towards families now as its key demographic which is fine as my daughter loved it and this felt like the true start of passing the torch along the supernatural horror parody is gone and the snarky satire of politics and upstart business is gone replaced by a direction that feels more blockbusterfocused kenan and co aimed for something different a risk which should be commended but it didnt entirely work leaving ghostbusters frozen empire as a fun but highly flawed effort
Mar 9 2024,neutral, imaginary tells the story of jessica dewanda wise an acclaimed author who returns to her childhood home amidst recurring nightmares that may reflect her past and her burgeoning imagination she moves back with her husbandsinger max tom payne and their two stepdaughters angsty taylor taegan burns and the spritely alice pyper braun both girls are estranged to jessica due to their mother who was taken to the mental institution while jessica tries bonding with her stepdaughters alice grows increasingly attached to her childhood teddy bear chauncey the stronger the attachment the more concerned jessica is about alice jessica realises it may have something to do with chauncey that nillywilly silly old bear imaginary is director jeff wadlows latest film he is best known for genre pieces that specialise in the horror genre and a few diversions into action and comedy while he may seem like a versatile filmmaker it is unfortunate his films have not been warmly received within his snug home at the blumhouse studio he developed two other films truth or dare date and fantasy island date which both inherited horrible reviews will wadlows imaginary prove three times lucky imaginary may lack imagination in its storytelling but at least it knows its lane it remains unpretentious even when delving into themes of trauma grief and loss the film aims to deliver scares fun and even a dash of whimsy its commercial ambitions ensure it is a watchable effort it is also nowhere near as incoherent as truth or dare and fantasy island its narrative remains straightforward and it spends very little time on unnecessary diversions or subplots the straightforward approach also applies to the acting which fares from good to fine wise fares best as jessica she manages to be endearing and convincingly distraught as she juggles family strife the demands of her work and of course saving her family from the horrors of the imagination braun manages to balance precociousness and emotional intelligence quite well while burns is quite amusing with her cynicism despite her character being written as annoyingly contrived speaking of contrivances imaginarys horror elements are cobbled from superior horror films and fantasy flicks for example there are elements of the pit 1981 such as the bear telling her what to do by speaking with a childs voice meanwhile the imaginary settings and monsters look remarkably similar to those in beetlejuice 1988 and monsters inc 2001 inside out 2015 is also mentioned many times and insidious 2010 is echoed the latter is derivative of poltergeist 1982 as it ventures into eerie fantasy worlds one cannot help but feel it would be better to watch these films instead having a derivative storyline is not a dealbreaker the conventional use of innocuous wholesome imagery in horror is also amusing for example the bears progression from protector to instigator and eventually perpetrator is highly effective however wadlow and his screenwriters greg erb and jason oremland who both specialise in family films including the princess and the frog 2009 lack ambition and resort to tired tropes and cliches one is obvious enough it spells out the films title and another is so blatant the film references it through its mentions of the animated film inside out and its characters ad nauseum worst of all is the use of the character of jessicas babysitter played by betty buckley buckley is certainly no stranger to horror thanks to her recent appearances in m night shyamalan films and the horror classic carrie 1976 her presence is always welcome however her characters presence in the narrative is a huge signpost that it makes her screentime feel laboured and unintentionally funny in how she pops up and the payoff feel meaningless as to her motives while it may sound like faint praise imaginary is the best film wadlow has made within in the blumhouse studio it displays a keener sense of filmmaking confidence a more assured handling of tone that switches between horror and comedy and sharper editing that negates the prevalent throwaway feel that plagued wadlows early work regretfully after all the positives imaginary succumbs to blatantly derivative woefully predictable storytelling and with a sense of irony a lack of imagination summary this is the best film wadlow has made within in the blumhouse studio however it still succumbs to predictable storytelling and with a sense of irony a lack of imagination
Mar 9 2024,negative,blumhouse productions hackneyed horror flick is a clichéd tale of childhood trauma caused by supernatural events presented in an ironically unimaginative and budgetconscious manner  
Mar 9 2024,negative, imagine a liveaction version of coraline with special effects purchased at the spirit halloween store and dialogue so nutty that blumhouse has outdone themselves by delivering a horror film that is worse than the exorcist believer and night swim those films arent mentioned in the imaginary trailer instead the studio drags m3gan through the mud to promote the evil teddy bear tale that accuses its 8yearold protagonist of being a ventriloquist directed by jeff wadlow truth or dare who cowrote the screenplay with greg erb and jason oremland imaginary begins on a creepy note then quickly descends into an abc after school special about kids adjusting to a new stepmom in this case jessica played by dewanda wise netflixs shes gotta have it who marries max tom payne a musician and father to teenage daughter taylor taegen burns and her younger sister alice pyper braun the girls mother remains institutionalized after abusing alice  when the family moves into jessicas childhood home alice discovers an old teddy bear in the basement she names chauncey soon the stuffed toy begins telling alice to do things like go on a scavenger hunt and stay away from jessica chauncey says youre not allowed to play with us because you left him the remark goes over jessicas head with max out of the picture hes left to go on tour shes too busy working on a new childrens novel and keeping an eye on taylor who is the typical bratty teen jessica is both the illustrator and writer of a series of books featuring molly millipede and her antagonist simon the spider the artwork is cool and in the films opening we discover the books were inspired by jessicas night terrors involving spiders the nightmare scene looks promising but its the only scary part in imaginary which fails to deliver any more frights when alice attempts to impale herself with a rusty nail bad chauncey a therapist verónica falcón visits the house to speak with her does that seem like a game a good friend would want to play this leads to the little girl screaming maybe we shouldnt be friends to chauncey while bawling her eyes out and storming away ive got to hand it to pyper braun whos put through the ringer by holding conversations with chauncey by herself speaking in a gravelly voice when shes impersonating the stuffed bear as the film becomes unintentionally campy the dialogue in imaginary is clunky and ridiculous when the therapist asks jessica if her 8yearold stepdaughter has taken up ventriloquism it signifies the film has officially gone off the rails then tonywinning actress betty buckley eight is enough and 1976s carrie shows up as jessicas elderly neighbor from her childhood who has spent the last few decades becoming an expert on children being influenced by evil entities aka imaginary friends think of her as a wacky version of lin shayes elise rainier from insidious as she helps jessica rescue alice from a realm called the never ever which resembles a funhouse version of the further i have always been a proponent of practical effects but in this case they look so bad that im inclined to think that wadlow went shopping at the spirit halloween store where he got a good deal on bug eyes and a bear costume imaginary tries to get imaginative in the finale as it attempts to morph into a liveaction coraline but fails as the story gets entangled in a web of implausibility leaving the viewer confused while wondering what just happened mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email hellofortworthreportorgour missionwe pledge to produce highquality objective local journalism that informs public decisionmaking addresses the quality of life of our communitys citizens holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood in all that we do earning the trust and respect of our audience is paramount our reporting will be free to all who access our primary digital channels
Mar 9 2024,positive,  blumhouse productions  the studio that has become synonymous with franchises such as paranormal activity insidious david gordon greens halloween trilogy and oneoff projects like damien chazelles whiplash and spike lees blackkklansman  has often padded its output with lowerbudget horror fare that requires looking at imdb to make heads or tails of whats what for every potential franchise or awards nominee some films beguile and baffle in equal measure dollarbin movies requiring a savvy spelunker to find the real treasures for all of their interchangeable homogeneity these smaller projects can still and often offer the stumbledupon detail that sticks to the ribs   jeff wadlows imaginary is the latest theatrical release to bear the blumhouse name in partnership with lionsgate its box office success will likely dictate potential offshoots of which there is a prerequisite asscovering in the films finale should there be more in the imaginaryverse as for the movies ribsticking qualities only time will tell if it has enough traction among viewers to outlive its theatrical release however i believe we have a cult classic in the making something to be embraced with cocktails and friends or for the younger crowd a bowl of popcorn and slumber party attire   imaginary takes us to a world not unlike our own were introduced to jessica dewanda wise a childrens book writerartist who has a bit of a problem on her hands beyond her absolutely abysmal artwork the older of her two stepdaughters taylor taegen burns doesnt respect her fathers decision to remarry still holding out hope for her mothers rehabilitation taylor resents the fact that her father has moved on with his life and even moved into jessicas childhood home on the other hand jessicas younger stepdaughter alice pyper braun is at that malleable young age where her impressions are subject to change at a moments notice and it doesnt take much to distract her the latest headlong obsession is jessicas childhood teddy bear chauncey whom alice finds during a basement excursion to whom she takes an immediate shine boy are we in for it   soon enough alice has tea parties and absorbing conversations with chauncey  odd for an inanimate object to be the source of such great repartee yet here we are besides the first scene detailing jessicas last time playing with chauncey the audience already knows something else is at work beyond the realworld reasons why a child would have an imaginary friend however for jessica taylor and jessicas husband max tom payne alice is just a kid being a kid and doing kid things and sometimes that means playing games with a stuffed animal where are her friends before long alice is off on a seemingly benign scavenger hunt collecting objects at chaunceys behest its only a matter of time before the screw turns   the movies premise which is simple enough is the fecund setup of horror of which an endless array of films have found room to invent homage reinvent and appropriate wholesale alice the young girl who provides the movies unintentional menace engages in familiar activities that horror fans especially those of the blumhouse strain will appreciate theres an ominously selfbouncing ball a bit of ominous hideandseek and a music machine with an absurdly long string attached that teases passersby to trace its source rote though they may be these are some of the triedandtrue staples of horror  the latticework that provides any director the opportunity to bring something new to the table   wadlow along with the relatively freshfaced cast brings something more uncannily offputting than even the most gratuitous jumpscares awkwardness imaginary has the impressive ability to turn even the most mundane conversations into something that strikes aslant placing us the viewers on unsteady terrain led by dewanda wise who brings fullbodied conviction to the role the characters walk talk and act like theyre in a soap opera soaked in portent each conversation treats a casual comment like a grand reveal and when a twist is finally revealed its so bafflingly telegraphed that it lands like a fart in church   the other actors who imbue the world with odd nuances include tom payne the father of the two girls who before the movie really takes off puts on about eight different bracelets and a fedora and abandons the family to go on tour in the few scenes in which he does appear he serves as the unflappably cool dad whose tattoos illustrate that he knows that kids especially those whose mothers are sick will eventually outgrow their imaginary friends then theres the older daughter taylor who catches the eye of the pillpopping neighbor liam matthew sato a dudebro who just wants to hang out fool around and raid the liquor cabinet somewhere under a pile of papers is a handwritten memo that urges filmmakers to stop giving any screen time to teenagers   other more interesting characters figure into the narrative theres jessicas father ben samuel salary who is spending his days in an assisted living facility where on his bedside table a stack of jessicas childrens books sits unread the reason for bens indefinite stay is due to the previous chauncey encounter in which he was both blinded and driven to the very threshold of what the human mind can handle   and then somewhere along the way were introduced to one of the best horror side characters to come along since winnie the pooh blood  honeys piglet  a character who horny teen liam describes as old bag patterson portrayed by betty buckley gloria patterson is the garrulous busybody who offers unsolicited insight into the troubles befalling jessicas family formerly jessicas babysitter back in the day gloria is a standin for writerly explication and an exuberantly weird maker of small talk each line she utters like a prophecy foretold and each lingering pause lasts long enough to start wondering if youve left the oven on suffice it to say these interactions along with the other conversational combinations are the stuff of a surprisingly invigorating moviegoing experience   when we eventually get to the sordid business of chaunceys true purpose and all that it entails imaginary has taken us on a whirlwind tour through just about every genre imaginable by just about any measure save for the impulse that draws one inexorably toward the uncanny imaginary isnt great but who really cares if any movie were to justify a stringer that zoomed out into the universe toward a supernatural being who revealed itself as the puppetmaster the cast its mere playthings then imaginary would be a prime candidate   in the age of elevated horror dominated by studios like a24 and neon too many scares hinge upon gory oneupmanship and an invariably somber grand finale that almost always points to a purgatorial nonending for the main character imaginary for all that it pinches from it a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors the conjuring and just about every other horror film that preceded it is still something that  arguably unintentionally  has a fascinating texture to the scenes inbetween the cheap thrills sure plenty will perceive this clunky movie as a failure and plenty more will dogpile on just by needing something to do for an hour but imaginarys faults are its greatest recommendation   nowadays you can reserve your seat at a movie theater and be served a threecourse meal abutted by copious amounts of drinks to that you should absolutely make an event out of seeing imaginary go with a friend  heck even ask a stranger on the street to accompany you for 104 minutes you can gorge and lose yourself in a realm that isnt entirely unlike ours  a liminal space in which rod serling would have a field day if you approach imaginary appropriately headlong and without reserve youll be treated to otherworldly pleasures  a woman returns to her childhood home to discover that the imaginary friend she left behind is very real and unhappy that she abandoned him tom hanks has had many famous roles in dozens of iconic movies but from big to toy story what are some of the best movies hes been in
Mar 8 2024,negative, culture representation taking place in new orleans the horror film imaginary features a predominantly white cast of characters with a few african americans and latin people representing the workingclass and middleclass culture clash a childrens book authorillustrator with a traumatic past moves back into her childhood home where one of her underage stepdaughters finds a mysterious teddy bear makes it her imaginary friend and unwittingly unleashes terror in the house  imaginary couldve been a campy horror classic about a menacing toy that unleashes terror but this idiotic junk goes downhill quickly and becomes a boring mess with tackylooking monsters for a movie that uses the characters imagination as a crucial part of its plot imaginary lacks imagination for that plot which becomes worse as the movie stumbles along to its very weak ending directed by jeff wadlow imaginary was cowritten by wadlow greg erb and jason oremland the movie takes place and was filmed in new orleans but everything is so genericlooking about the locations in the movie it really couldve been filmed in many other cities and it wouldnt have made a difference to the story imaginary starts off as a basic horror movie but the plot and dialogue get increasingly stupid to the point where viewers will either laugh or get angry or do both at all the ridiculousness imaginary begins by showing childrens book authorillustrator jessica played by wanda dewise bursting through a minature door in the wall of the house she looks terrified and says im sorry we couldnt finish our game shes soon grabbed by a large burly man who has blood on him and whose eyes are all white from damage or because hes possessed he mumbles something about being afraid that jessica is never coming back its later revealed that the man chasing jessica is her father ben barnes played by samuel salary who is a widower but surprise this scene is nothing but a nightmare experienced by jessica who has been having several nightmares lately about her past jessica is newly married to a britishborn musician named max played by tom payne who has full custody of his two daughters from his previous marriage 15yearold sulky taylor played by taegen burns and playful alice played by pyper braun whos about 7 or 8 years old taylor doesnt like jessica very much while alice is much more accepting and friendlier to stepmother jessica jessicas father ben is currently at an assisted living community called azalea acres jessicas childhood home is currently vacant and so jessica and taylor decide that they will get a fresh start by moving the family from their small apartment into this house and you know what that means in a horror movie where someone in the house is having nightmares about her past it doesnt take long for alice to find a teddy bear in the basement she names the bear chauncey this toy bear becomes alices constant companion and her imaginary friend jessica and max often hear alice talking to chauncey with the bear talking back in a voice that sounds a lot like alices voice jessica and max think all of this is adorable the family has a nosy neighbor named gloria played by betty buckley who likes to lurk outside to see whats going on in the house when jessica introduces herself to gloria jessca is surprised when gloria says that she used to be jessicas babysitter when jessica lived in the house as a child jessica doesnt remember gloria at all jessica also doesnt remember that she had a teddy bear that looked exactly like chauncey imaginary has several flashbacks to jessicas childhood with rhythm hurd in the role of jessica as a 5yearold girl the story of jessicas past is eventually revealed in bits and pieces there are clues such as the illustrations she used to draw on the house wall as a child the phrase never ever is also repeated in the movie because it has a certain meaning jessica has had a turbulent relationship with her father who had a mental breakdown shortly after jessicas mother died when jessica was 5 years old jessica has a burn scar on her arm from an incident in her childhood where her father was accused of attacking her ben lost custody of jessica and she was raised by her grandmother alice also has a burn scar on her arm it was caused by her mother samantha dooley played by alix angelis who is currently in a lockdown facility for mental health and addiction issues samantha appears in the movie for some cheap jump scares although max doesnt really talk about what happened in the marriage its implied that the problems with samantha are what caused their divorce samantha and max got divorced long before he and jessica got involved with each other it should come as no surprise that theres something very sinister about chauncey as people who are in the house eventually find out one of them is a drugusing teenage neighbor named liam played by matthew sato who has an immediate mutual attraction to taylor jessica has a rule that taylor and alice cant let strangers into the house when jessica and max arent there but taylor breaks this rule to have liam over for a visit when max is away on tour and jessica leaves the house for a few hours chauncey is quite the demanding companion alice insists that when she is served meals chauncey should get a serving too because chauncey is always hungry alice says that chauncey also gave her a list of things that alice must find on a scavenger hunt alice carries the list with her but she tells jessica that whats on the list is a secret  alice later tells taylor dont tell dad or jess but chauncey will take me to a special place after i finish my list one of the things that jessica knows is on the list is something happy which alice requests from jessica who gives her a small blue rubber ball that jessica paints with a smiley face later jessica finds the list and sees other items that need to be found include something that burns a bowl and a paintbrush alices attachment to chauncey becomes alarming enough for her to get a visit from  therapist named dr soto played by veronica falcón who tells jessica about a boy patient who had similar issues with a stuffed animal that was an imaginary friend the boy ended mutilating his thumb and then he disappeared dr soto shows jessica a video that she recorded of one of dr sotos sessions with the boy jessica has a book series about an insect named molly the millipede whose nemesis is simon the spider there are several references to jessicas book series in imaginary but the movie does a very poor job of making effective horror out of it imaginary has a laughable part of the movie where jessica tells max that alices weirdness with chauncey has helped jessica with her writers block imaginary lead actress wise puts in a committed performance as jessica while braun brings a lot of enthusiasm to the role of alice even with these admirable efforts imaginary still has mediocretobad acting in too many parts of the filmespecially near the end of the movie which becomes an exposition dump where characters overexplain all the ludicrous things that are obvious the movie becomes more convoluted when it doesnt need to be puppets were used for some of the monstersincluding the monster version of chauncey called bear beastbut they look like something you would see in an amateur haunted house there are scarierlooking costumes at any given comiccon imaginary has a combination of computergenerated and practical visual effects there are some creepy images in the movie but nothing in imaginary is truly terrifying  theres also a fakeout ending which is slightly better than the atrociously limp real ending which hints at the possibility of a sequel or spinoff the teddy bear in imaginary which has a different name for every person who owns the bear is nowhere close to being as iconic as the toy dolls chucky and m3gan which are the center of their respectively successful horrors franchises the stuffing of a real teddy bear has more substance than what disappointing dreck such as imaginary has to offer

Mar 8 2024,positive, every child has an imaginary friend  someone you trust and confide in when no one else seems to understand  for some it is a prized possession in the form of a doll or stuffed animal and like all children we grow up  with that growth comes going away to college and moving away from those items that gave us comfort  but what do you think happens when we come back home only to discover that favorite imaginary friend is none too thrilled that we left them behind produced by blumhouse productions imaginary is one of the few horrorthriller films where the plot is totally driven by the women characters making it right on time with womens international day and womens month 2024 i was raised by strong women my mother emily couric was a virginia state senator and the head of the democratic party my aunt former today show cohost and cbs news anchor katie couric is an accomplished journalist i love writing characters that evoke the women who helped shape me  stated director jeff wadlow dewanda wise inhabits the epitome of strong woman as we have seen her in role after role show up and show out  as jessica  we meet her experiencing a harrowing nightmare while learning a shocking connection between her young stepdaughters new imaginary friend and own troubled childhood  this film gives a whole new meaning to daddys little girl and will have you looking at those stuffed teddy bears with an over the shoulder sideeye  wise isnt the only one exuding strength and tenacity  broadway legend betty buckley who takes on the role of gloria started her career in horror with carrie a film that arguably launched the modern horror genre as well as turn in m night shylamalans the happening and split  gloria felt such wonder through the eyes of that child it set her on a quest says buckley it gave gloria a career she thought oh theres something more than this and through her own desire to understand and connect with that other dimension gloria began to research spirituality magic and occult worlds she realizes theres this occult tradition of young peoples relationships to imaginary friends and has made herself an authority about that because of the influence of this significant time in her life as young jessicas babysitter butnobody has taken gloria or her work seriously so shes eager to prove that its real  for gloria its a last chance at a kind of redemption last and certainly not least taegen burns taylor give bratty teenager a whole new vibe  her performance is so rooted you wonder how jessica maintains the restraint not to snatch a knot in that behind for being so fresh and disrespectful however it is pyper braun as alice steals the show with the same range that a young linda blair displayed in the exorcist  baby between her and chauncey audiences will be have a grand old time with imaginary which is delivered with insane photographical tricks making this film unusual fun with a few jump moments here and there
Mar 8 2024,negative, a critical assessment of the merits of a subject such as art film music television food and literature reviews are based on the writers informedexpert opinion  the haunted teddy bear flick imaginary the derivative and toothless new release from the blumhouse fright factory has been made on the cheap and with ideas filched from better films the haunted teddy bear flick imaginary the derivative and toothless new release from the blumhouse fright factory has been made on the cheap and with ideas filched from better films the pathetic chauncey bear is a tedious teddy voiced by alice pyper braun the impressionable kid chauncey has in his evil thrall in imaginary writes peter howell voiced by seth macfarlane of course and maybe accompanied by his bff mark wahlberg to share snacks and their communal bong anything really to liven up this sad excuse for a horror movie instead we get the pathetic chauncey bear a tedious teddy voiced by alice pyper braun the impressionable kid chauncey has in his evil thrall this bear is so dull the killer dolls chucky annabelle and m3gan from superior fright flicks would kick sand or worse in his face as would ted thats too bad because the clever marketing for imaginary suggested we were in for something good if not all that original from journeyman writerdirector jeff wadlow kickass 2 and fright factory blumhouse productions a teaser trailer last fall which ran in theatres before blumhouses five nights at freddys used sound more than images to stimulate interest close your eyes and use your imagination the teaser began yet imaginary abandons that cerebral approach it goes instead for jump scares the lowest form of horror and for a barrage of random phantasms thats like staring at a haunted house pinball machine call it the exploding crypt phenomenon its a hallmark of the insidious franchise another blumhouse property and one that imaginary shamelessly steals from working with a production budget that seems low even by blumhouses thrifty standards most of the action in imaginary takes place in a modest suburban dwelling the childhood home of overworked and anxious jessica played by dewanda wise of netflixs shes gotta have it newly married to rocker dude max tom payne the walking dead shes trying hard to be a good stepmom to the precocious alice and to the girls older sister perpetually peeved teen taylor taegen burns jessica writes and illustrates insectthemed childrens books molly millipede is her crawly classic she has an active imagination which figures into the films scattershot plot this may account in part for jessicas violent night terrors glimpsed in the prologue she also has painful childhood memories that continue to stalk her as does the camera jessica must also contend with stressful situations involving samantha alix angelis the biological mother of alice and taylor who suffers from mental illness and addiction and who was committed to a facility for care after harming alice all the more reason for max and jessica to want to leave their current abode and move into jessicas happy place from her earlier life her childhood home seems very much as she left it decades ago so much so that alice discovers jessicas old teddy bear chauncey left behind when the family departed a scruffy little bruin with a red vest and gold ribbon he was waiting in the basement all that time supposedly seething with resentment over being abandoned his blank eyes make it hard to tell alice soon bonds with him and takes him everywhere she talks to him and also speaks for him everybody calls chauncey alices imaginary friend cue spooky music its a promising setup for scares one weve been primed for by the trailer and tag line hes not imaginary and hes not your friend alas the haunted teddy is neither threatening nor interesting the budget for imaginary apparently wasnt enough to hire a proper voice actor for chauncey who is so innocuous he makes yogi bear seem like ghostface from scream in comparison chauncey at least doesnt have to worry about being upstaged by the human actors who arent much livelier wadlow marks time with distractions that include a dubious scavenger hunt and visits from a nosy neighbour gloria played by horror vet betty buckley of carrie gloria a fellow author who knew jessicas family long ago and who wants to bond with her now offers her theories about childhood occult possession or whatever it is thats happening to alice it all leads to a place called the neverever a skeletal realm thats a lofi imitation of the spooky grand central station known as the further in the insidious series with its cheap trap doors gaudy flashing lights and goofy man in a bear suit  yes there actually is one  the neverever is like one of those charity haunted houses you find at fall fairs which cant be too scary so as not to frighten small children when jessica dewanda wise moves back into her childhood home with her family her youngest stepdaughter alice pyper braun develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named chauncey she finds in the basement alice starts playing games with chauncey that begin playful and become

Mar 8 2024,positive, childrens book illustrator jessica dewanda wise faces the daunting challenge of blending her new family into her childhood home in upcoming blumhouse horror imaginary the struggle to connect with her stepdaughters is amplified by the resistance of teenage alex who refuses to accept jessica while her real mother is suspiciously absent alex keeps a watchful eye on her younger sister alice played by a brilliant pyper braun coercing her not to take to the invasion of a new matriarch desperate for companionship and security alice ventures into the basement of the new house and is called to a raggedy teddy bear she names chauncey forming a bond with the bear as a new imaginary friend chaunceys influence takes a dark turn transforming innocent childhood games into something far more sinister acutely aware of the unnerving and perplexing behaviour of alice jessica finds herself forced to confront unpleasant and repressed memories from her own childhood realising that she has her own connection with chauncey the house with its shadowy corners and obligatory bumps in the night becomes a claustrophobic backdrop for a developing psychological drama and the pairing of wise and braun provides a wellearned anchor to the emotional core of the movie while the third act might not be to everyones taste with a tonal shift into something oddly reminiscent of labyrinth the gear change certainly injects a more playful element into the story the malevolent teddy strikes a good balance between unnerving wrongness and childlike appeal its broken features appear sweet but are smartly unsettling exuding a deeper malevolence behind them his appearance is a potent symbol of the darkness that lurks in the recesses of childhood memory though it lacks some of the finesse of toptier blumhouse imaginary is a fun slightly silly horror that holds an enjoyment in watching the story play out with more psychological twists than you would expect
Mar 8 2024,positive, when jessica dewanda wise decides to return to her childhood home she soon uncovers that chauncey a bear she left behind called is really not happy with that decision as it feeds on the mind of her daughter alice and many others around it the movie dives into a hellish ride through the endless possibilities of imagination with a big lean on practical effects writerdirector jeff wadlow fantasy island clearly wants to ensure that imaginary feels as realistic as possible and this show throughout his seamless transitions from reality into a terrifying realm are quite impressive the complicated dynamic within the family comes across as natural and their tough backstories bring a crucial balance outside of the main cast and a superb leading performance from dewanda wise is an appearance from horror legend betty buckley who really brings something quite special to the foundations of the picture its most welcome when there are layers to the supporting cast something else that really adds to a horror movie is its soundtrack and within imaginary they went all out with it thanks to the addition of composer bear mccreary godzilla you can tell that an immense amount of work has gone into it and ultimately it brings a crucial element to a horror movie like this although and unfortunately the movie can feel somewhat very similar to what horror audiences have already seen before imaginary is still a worthy addition to a horror icon category that includes the likes of chucky and m3gan with a focus on imagination then a sequel is easily plausible
Mar 8 2024,positive, adults are not the target audience for imaginary this latest blumhouse flick is clearly meant for mall rats and slumber parties  a fact made obvious not just by its pg13 rating but also by a 15yearold character who repeatedly drops the name of bing bong the imaginary friend from pixars inside out thats not to say there werent grownups who bawled their eyes out over the pink chimeras fate in 2015 but that scene probably made a bigger impression on the moviegoers who were kids then and who have since graduated to the relatively scarier exploits of freddy fazbear and m3gan imaginary is about evil imaginary friends so it makes sense that kids are top of mind but that doesnt mean theyll be the only ones who can enjoy it the latest from fantasy island and truth or dare director jeff wadlow is a great teen scream full of jump scares and adolescent antics its also so earnestly absurd that it may be a future camp classic the main character is jessica dewanda wise who moves back into her childhood home with her husband max tom payne and two stepdaughters alice pyper braun and taylor taegen burns we know something spooky definitely happened in this house when jessica was a kid thanks to lots of ominous music and imagery shes oblivious just glad to be back in her happy place when alice wanders downstairs and finds a stuffed teddy bear that she names chauncey the creepiness begins as jessica slowly remembers more about her past chauncey takes alice on a sinister scavenger hunt and starts terrorizing the household you could say imaginary jumps the shark when a weirdo neighbor betty buckley appears or when a child psychologist veronica falcón sets up shop following one of chaunceys nastier fetch quests but its all the little touches that makes this movie so deliciously unhinged jessicas husband a rock star in the ludicrously named band burning cats looks like the love child of harry styles and johnny depp in one scene as he and jessica discuss alices wellbeing she helps him remove his multiple jangly necklaces alice and taylors mom is in a psych ward and we never learn why during a climactic scene jessica tosses off the word impale with hilarious nonchalance  as if it were part of her everyday vocabulary if you want good storytelling you wont get it from imaginary what you will get is some fun inventive scares and performances that are all over the map matthew sato is definitely the weakest link as the familys bad boy neighbor while braun admirably commits to alices many ups and downs wise whos also credited as an executive producer is giving it her all like she thought she was on the hook for another spike lee joint and then stumbled onto this shoot instead the production design also elevates this film in unexpected ways jessicas bed has about five too many throw pillows but the house otherwise looks like these characters actually live in it jessicas childhood drawings play a huge role in the narrative and rather than going for the usual dour etchings that plague nearly every horror movie the films artists conjure up vibrant girlish art that actually feels well imaginative plus in a movie with multiple creepy creatures the scariest one is made with practical effects  horrorfan water in a desert of cgi imaginary is ridiculous and overwritten and the ending is abrupt blundering through the climax before falling flat on its face but everything thats terrible about it is also weirdly awesome this isnt m3gan which wore its silliness like a badge of honor this is a movie that mostly plays it straight even when its spewing absolute nonsense intentional camp is great but its even better when it happens by accident imaginary nearly perfects its sobaditsgood shtick this is not a good movie in the traditional artistic sense  but it is a total joy to watch if youre willing to buy into its particular blend of juvenile scares and stupid selfseriousness come for the practical effects stay for the bizarro side characters if you were stoked for m3gan but thought it was a little too selfaware this new blumhouse flick is worth catching in theaters
Mar 8 2024,positive, there are some movies that you want to be able to watch with the kids thats hard to do with horror as a genre luckily imaginary is here to fill the gap and gives us a frightening look into the world of imaginary friends or just terrifying chauncey jessica dewanda wise is moving her husband tom payne and her two step daughters played by taegen burns and pyper braun to her childhood home to try and reconnect with the happiness she once had there what she actually is doing though is leading her family into chaunceys den chauncey bear is an imaginary friend gone awry and what makes imaginary so much fun to watch is that it has all the elements of a typical horror movie but is tame enough that it can and should be something for the entire family to enjoy its not often that horror as a genre gives you a chance to enjoy it while knowing that the kids in your family will also have a fun time and we have for the most part shied away from those movies in recent years so while we can all enjoy things like scream or even halloween theyre still a little gory on paper imaginary has its scares particularly with the looming figure that lurks in the shadows behind our family of characters but where it works as a horror movie is within chauncey himself and the ideas laid out for us alice pyper braun finds the stuffed bear when she goes to explore the basement first of all why were you in the basement but secondly the bear then brings with it a haunted figure creeping around the home alice is talking to herself she sincerely thinks that chauncey is real and we eventually learn the lore of not only chauncey bear but of imaginary friends as a concept look is imaginary reinventing the genre no but it is a fun horror movie to watch i came out of it knowing that my niece who loves characters like m3gan would enjoy watching this and is a tame way for her to enjoy the genre without an excess of gore it is where blumhouse has found its place to shine what makes imaginary so fun to see in theaters though is to have that bit of fear of what lurks in the darkness and to also never trust that something you thought you made up is actually makebelieve never have i sat in a theater and heard a bunch of people exclaim chauncey at different times it was absolutely hilarious and a blast to watch everyone start to make fun of this bear and his antics all together thats what makes horror such a fun genre to watch in a theatre and imaginary is definitely one you wont want to miss and you can bring the whole family to enjoy it

Mar 8 2024,negative,i honestly wasnt expecting it to be this bad
Mar 8 2024,negative,solid ideas  interesting concepts executed in a very bland  generic way 
Mar 8 2024,neutral, the unacknowledged thing about imaginary as far as i know is how much the justreleased horror movie owes to the maligned winnie the pooh blood  honeypart of a trend of publicdomain characters ripped from the pages of beloved childrens books  in winnie the pooh blood  honey a feral pooh and his equally savage sidekick piglet go on a murderous spree after their friend christopher robin abandons them in the hundred acre wood the wondrous fantasy world robin has created for his imaginary friends has deteriorated into the dark gloom of a dead forest overgrown by weeds and rotting trees  without christopher robins guidance winnie once a thriving sweet bumbling honeyloving bear is now broken and untamed hes not lost his taste for honey but now enjoys it with a splash of blood  would the producers of imaginary welcome such comparisons not likely the production level is higher the performances are more refined and the exploitation is less vivid there are no famous literary characters in imaginary but there is an imaginary world in which an imaginary friend comes in the shape of an imaginary teddy bear  of course none of it is remotely imaginative dreamlike worlds with long endless hallways cotton ball clouds intentional i assume given the childvision premise and animatronic arms reaching out from open doors to attack its victims is as original as a carnival house of horrors  a young childrens story author attempting to bond with her stepdaughters defiant 15yearold taylor taegen burns and 10yearold alice pyper braun taylor is still devoted to her mother whos now institutionalized after severely harming alice jessicas husband max tom payne is a hipster complete with tattoos and a successful band and whose sole purpose in the film is to display congenial acceptance of his wifes efforts to bond with his children and to display a loving parental watch over his daughters payne might be fine but max is useless the incredibly understanding max convinces jessica to return to her family home where she still harbours fond memories her father samuel salary is now in assisted living and because of some unknown terror is half the man he used to be  the situation concerns the house and jessicas unfriendly invisible friend who she abandoned now the invisible friend wants revenge who knew imaginary friends could be so sensitive and needy with imaginary friends like these who needs an imagination  imaginary friends have been terrifying parents and caregivers since reagan met captain howdy in the exorcist 1974 and again in the shining 1980 when little danny torrance meets tony and possessed childrens toys m3gan 2022 childs play 1988 and annabelle 2014 chauncy is no match for any of them during a game of hide and seek alice goes alone into a dark barely lit basement despite being terrified inexplicably she moves several boxes and discovers a hidden door there she finds chauncy a brown teddy bear who adopts alice as his new friend  director jeff wadlow puts up a single card announcing imaginary as a film by jeff wadlow a film by is an annoying prestige conceit rarely earned by filmmakers who are more interested in cinema as consumerism than art granted wadlow aside from directing is also a producer and cowriter so there might be some rationale for giving himself auteur recognition if only imaginary were a better movie imaginary is far too long at one hour 44 minutes the buildup has a few exciting moments but the climax intended as the films centerpiece is a dull repetition of hallways locked doors and unimpressive jump scares 
Mar 8 2024,negative,there was potential here maybe for a film that dug a little deeper pushed a little harder and delivered a contemporary spin on ideas
Mar 8 2024,positive,it is admittedly a bit of a slog to get there the opening events are downright dull but by a button nose imaginary is just weird enough to work
Mar 8 2024,negative, is imaginary any degree of scary no is imaginary brimming with whimsical yet demented visuals also no is imaginary at least a familyfriendly gateway horror treat that will keep audiences of all ages entertained for a third time thats a big ol nope after the mediocre efforts of truth or dare and fantasy island director and cowriter jeff wadlow reteams with blumhouse to defy the redemptive adage that third times the charm imaginary wadlows new horror film is blandly presented muted in tone and lacking any bite as a warped tale about sinister madeup companions despite its creepy killer teddy bear premise its hardly as terrifying as a hard stare from paddington imaginary follows jessica played by dewanda wise a childrens author and illustrator plagued by nightmares borne from childhood trauma she and her musician husband max tom payne along with maxs daughters taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun move into jessicas childhood home in hopes of a new start jessica recalls fond memories in the house before her father lost his sanity one night but forgets about one resident who never left a stuffed bear alice finds and befriends who goes by the name chauncey the potential of imaginary is limitless yet wadlows vision for chaunceys wicked exploitation of childlike wonder is disappointingly flat jacob chases come play or brandon christensens z are two recent examples of how filmmakers can turn imaginary pals into primetime horror villains from which wadlow absorbs no lessons aside from a remix of mario bavas legendary jumpscare in 1977s shock that transforms chauncey from plush toy to snarling beast wadlow reuses the same lame shadowy figure in the background trick to diminishing returns horror thrives in unexpected deliveries which imaginary lacks despite how the screenplays premise introduces an environment where chauncey can bend reality at his whim wadlow alongside coscribes greg erb and jason oremland is onto something neat from a storytelling perspective showing the vengeful side of imaginary friends once theyre outgrown jessicas relation to chauncey and her tether to her familys residence is a compelling plot device yet its frustratingly underexplored imaginary gets too preoccupied with repainting the further from james wans insidious as an imagination realm where kiddos go missing decorated like production designers raided the bargain shelf at a michaels craft store lightbox carousels and windup playthings try to contrast juvenile innocence against demonic manipulation but its weirdly disingenuous theming restricted to spurts so much of imaginary is visually drab with camera frames tainted by empty space and an underwhelming suburban appeal all the films best looks are a flirty tease like the icyblue filtered m c escherstyle entrance to chaunceys domain that quickly leads into a repetitive hallway of doors imaginary underwhelms with the best of em its horror is ineffective since chaunceys take on liveaction coraline eyes never should have passed the test phase wises performance shoulders a production otherwise devoid of personality left buckling under the overwhelming weight of a supporting cast that compares like madefortv cutouts chaunceys scariest appearance is glimpsed early as a scurrying spiderperson creepshow but its instantly evident why wadlow frequently hides this figure either blurred out of focus or in darkness chaunceys supersized teddy evolution play by preys dane diliegro is marginally better if a clunkily immobile suit theres so much detail missing from jessica taylor and alices world  max goes on tour at the worst possible time and immediately becomes an afterthought   that everything might as well be greyscale betty buckleys sassy senior gloria attempts to inject a little wacky neighbor energy to liven the mood and earns the best line delivery of the entire show as the tropesaddled elder with all the information yet even her efforts evaporate into thin air better suited for another hammier movie altogether its a shame because gateway horror movies are vital passageways theyre a necessary entry point for somedayhorror lovers who may not be ready for the big leagues imaginary could have been that padded adolescent horror tale à la last years five nights at freddys a film i enjoyed more than others but its not the problem isnt a pg13 rating or bum script imaginary oversells underdelivers and is never anywhere as frightening as the deepest recesses of your own alltimeterrible nightmares
Mar 8 2024,negative,  throughout imaginary the latest film from blumhouse and directed by truth or dare and fantasy islands jeff wadlow were told about the power of imagination its imagination that made imaginarys jessica dewanda wise become a childrens book writer and author and its seemingly imagination that made jessicas stepdaughter alice pyper braun start talking to a teddy bear named chauncey she found in her basement yet imaginary is packed with generic clichéd characters odd narrative choices and zero actual reasons to be scared to the point that oddly imaginary lacks any imagination that is unless youre imagining that you want to see one of the worst films to come out this year   we also meet liam matthew sato a neighbor whom taylor takes a liking to who is irritating from the moment we meet him and gets invited over to taylors house togive her something to do other than being annoyed at her stepmom which to be fair considering how many things are going wrong in this house jessica is strangely content with allowing taylor to play by herself without any supervision or just flatout leave these kids on their own at the drop of a hat   without giving anything away imaginary also pretends that major moments in the third act are huge shocks however anyone who has managed to stay awake this long in the film should easily be able to figure out any of the films twists and turns one connection between jessica and alice should be immediately obvious to those barely paying attention and one villain reveal is so clear from the beginning that this revelation is laughableand is then followed by an even more ludicrous scene of surprise violence   there are also large chunks of this story that go absolutely nowhere in one scene the troubled mother of taylor and alice breaks into the house and after shes been taken away by the police her presence is never spoken of again after a scene that should be traumatizing max decides its okay to leave his new wife and his daughters to go on tour with his banda job we dont know he has until hes literally abandoning his family with guitar in hand there are even mentions of physical abuse that jessica and alice have shared that doesnt serve any real purpose other than to make the point that people live with the scars that theyve received over their liveswhich doesnt even really make sense to the story thats being told imaginary feels like one pass was done of the script or that these scenes were written on the day without any consideration of how anything tied together or worrying about things like narrative cohesion and character consistency   speaking of characters imaginary is a cast packed with clichés with the exasperated teen the creepy child who everyone ignores for far too long and the mother who is several steps behind the audience these performances are overthetop frequently ludicrous and often downright silly again that likely has more to do with the poor writing and directing choices than these actors having a child actor attempt to be a maniacal and vengeful spirit is completely unfair to said actor and most of the films scares come from ludicrous makeup choices like giant bug eyes for no damned reason its not these actors fault that theyre an amalgamation of tropes youve seen in countless other crappy pg13 horror movies   but imaginations lack of vision or any semblance of good ideas certainly makes itself clear in the third act were shown a place that is supposedly made of pure imagination and yet its so derivative of mc escher paintings and any hall of mirrors you mightve walked into at a dumpy carnival given all the possibilities that imagination can provide this is the best thing that wadlow and co can come up with at the very least wadlow does do some clever tricks with the camera in this section but these are little more than a few seconds of pleasant surprise in a film that by this point will leave you ready to sacrifice yourself to chauncey instead of having it go on any longer   yet maybe imaginarys most egregious sin is that its not scary in the least and its not even really trying that hard again considering that this is literally a movie that is about imagination its painful how there is none to be found here its a similar problem with many of wadlows films which seem more like oneline elevator pitches what is fantasy island was actually about murder what if truth or dare led to death come to life than actual films wadlow will often have a spider monster lurking in the shadows of the film yet considering that he begins the movie by giving us our best look at what this creature is any suspense later on is immediately taken out of the film from then on imaginary is only unsettling if you dont like teddy bears slightly moving or heads turned askew in a family portrait   imaginary is a concept with potential but none of that is seen in wadlows filmimaginary is toptobottom a mess a frustrating mishmash of bad choices that never goes anywhere interesting a few times throughout imaginary someone compares chauncey to bing bong from inside out and its honestly more enjoyable thinking about that far superior pixar film for a few fleeting moments than watching this film imaginary is a horror disaster that not even imaginary characters should go see  ross bonaime is the senior film editor at collider he is a virginiabased

Mar 8 2024,positive, most of us grew up with imaginary friends it was expected in my case since i was an only child but what happens when those friends dont have the best intentions for us worse yet what happens when they want to take us into their world imaginary explores these questions with an inventive approach directed by jeff wadlow the film stars dewanda wise tom payne taegen burns and pyper braun with veronica falcon and betty buckley the film opens with jessica wise having a continuous nightmare that pushes her to move into her childhood home with her husband and two stepdaughters sooner than expected this childhood home has witnessed many unimaginable scenarios one day alice braun is playing hideandseek when she hears a noise in the basement there she finds a teddy bear named chauncey and quickly develops an affinity towards it alice converses with chauncey and they start a scavenger hunt but things take an interesting turn when the game gradually becomes sinister  first i dont actively seek horror films because ive developed a fear of them thank you the exorcist1973 but i decided to give imaginary a chance it was a film that succeeded in entertaining me while scaring me several times  using an imaginary friend as part of the plot makes this story relatable the first two acts are great the buildup and introduction to this world and its mysteries are greatly executed but the third act left me a little unsatisfied it felt slightly comical and unserious there is a specific character that suddenly gets more screen time at this time and it feels overexposed  overall imaginary is a good film that left me contemplating the possible consequences of imaginary friends its unpredictable twists turns and jump scares deliver a fun movie 
Mar 8 2024,positive, audiences going into imaginary will have more fun than they expected the blumhouse flick manages to be scary piling on frights laughs and even a twist the trailer does not do the movie justice feeling like the movie will join tragic bombs like the first annabelle instead it pulls audiences in with tense scenes and carefully crafted jump scares while a different ending and showing less of the monster would cement the film imaginary still turns up the entertainment in a fun engaging way directed by jeff wadlow and written by wadlow greg erb and jason oremland the movie centers around a stepfamily the new mother jessica dewanda wise is at the center shes the latest addition to the home although her husband max tom payne is happy about the new situation as they move into jessicas brief childhood home his teenage daughter taylor taegen burns is anything but joyous the younger daughter alice pyper braun is more open but listens to her sister still theres a shared pain as both daughters and jessica experienced childhood trauma enter the childhood friend from hell to shake things up  as they move into jessicas childhood home the situation quickly turns strange alice chats with her newfound imaginary friend in any other situation jessica and max sharing a smile as they hear alices soft voice chatter away would engender smiles from the audience but this is a horror movie and the first of many uhohs the movie lets viewers infer an abusive past but its also unclear what happened jessica has a scar from childhood and alice also has a scar implying a connection from similar abusive childhoods  this part of the film is disappointing as they also depict the mother as someone with mental health issues depictions in films equating mental health to violence or abuse need to cease its unnecessary in imaginary jessicas murky childhood memories about her brief life in the home do not require it just focus on her the kidsas naturally the dad max goes on a work tripand the oddball neighbor  a gradual fear builds as alice plays with the teddy bear chauncy something about the eyes of stuffed toys looks soulless allknowing and lurky but the toy is not the only thing to fear imaginary makes terrific use of the terrifying presence looming in the background fortunately its not all jump scares shadows and what was that moments pop up making for an entertaining viewing experience with friends it has those blinkandmissit moments that horror films need more of  imaginary is not a perfect film but it is fun to watch with friends as the movie presses on its clear that it does not take itself seriously when the neighbor gloria betty buckley arrives laughs ratchet up even more the cast does a great job dewanda wise brings some emotional depth to her character and the film betty buckley is pure entertainment theres even a twist near the end that might surprise some moviegoers  horror movies leaning into laughs work but its a tightrope to achieve imaginary pulls it off despite its pitfalls however more practical effects or even leaving the frights in the dark would have heightened the scares also the ending is pat and expected its okay and gives some poltergeist vibes but an openending done right filled with uncertainty would provide that extra chill not as epic as m3gan or disjointed as five nights at freddys imaginary is an engagement film wedged between the two viewers will point scream and laugh as scenes unfold moving from creepy to ludicrous its a fun time 
Mar 8 2024,negative,imaginary revolves around such a silly idea that one would think cowriterdirector jeff wadlow might try to have some fun with it
Mar 8 2024,positive,the 3rd act of imaginary feels like the big idea of the movie but getting to it must have been the struggle that notion makes it feel disjointed its marketed as a killer teddy bear movie but its much more than that which is good 
Mar 8 2024,neutral, plot a woman with a troubled past moves back into her childhood homecast dewanda wise pyper braun taegen burnsrated pg13 scary imagery and some bloodshedlength 144where area theatersbottom line a semieffective horror flick with a couple of tingly twists in hollywood the hive mind is on overdrive coming later this month is immaculate about an american nun who travels to italy and enters an evil convent coming in april is the first omen about an american woman who travels to italy and discovers an evil conspiracy on a different note may will see the release of if a comedy about a little girl who can see another persons imaginary friend  but this week weve already got imaginary a horror movie about a little girl who can see another persons imaginary friend its almost as uncanny as that spring in 1990 when lambada a teen film about a forbidden dance came out the same day as the forbidden dance is lambada give some credit to imaginary for exercising a little creativity within its narrow scope the story strikes some familiar notes after moving back to her childhood home childrens author jessica dewanda wise is charmed to see that her young stepdaughter alice pyper braun has unearthed her old stuffed bear chauncey but as alices behavior turns dark  sudden aggression speaking in weird voices attempts at selfharm  jessica wonders if chauncey is the culprit could this bear be the reason jessica has almost no memories of her own troubled childhood despite that case of highly convenient amnesia imaginary holds together fairly well as a mysterydriven horror chiller a visit from dr soto veronica falcón a child therapist lays the groundwork for a couple of plot twists that you probably wont see coming and director jeff wadlow who wrote the screenplay with two others manages to squeeze fresh shivers out of some very old tropes  what works less well is jessicas adventure through a spirit realm called the neverever where little alice has been lured this realm is another cliché one that dates back to the insidious movies where it was called the further and before that to 1982s poltergeist in the neverever where hallway doors and cotton ball clouds combine in a sort of slapdash surrealism the budgetary limitations of imaginary reveal themselves still imaginary has an appealing cast of characters including jessicas indiemusician husband max tom payne in a walkmen tshirt her sullen older stepdaughter taylor taegen burns and the neighborhood kook gloria veteran actress betty buckley if you can withstand some of the goofier moments  such as dr soto asking with a straight face whether little alice has taken up ventriloquism  imaginary might serve as a reasonably effective fright flick during a slow week stay for the closing credits to hear chaunceys theme a cutesycreepy ditty from composer bear mccreary and his daughter sonatine
Mar 8 2024,negative, its hard to know where to start in describing how bad imaginary is the new horror movie from blumhouse and director jeff wadlow kickass 2 starts with the simple but promising premise of a haunted stuffed animal and a malicious imaginary friend but its bland characters muddy storytelling and lack of scares leave behind a movie more lifeless than a teddy bear with no stuffing imaginarys mess of a story begins with a woman named jessica shes gotta have it and jurassic world dominions dewanda wise and her new husband max tom payne waking up after one of jessicas recurring nightmares shes being chased through a long hallway by a giant spider who also happens to be the main villain in the childrens books she writes the couple quickly decide that its time for them and maxs two kids from a previous marriage teenage taylor taegen burns and much younger alice pyper braun to move into jessicas childhood home in hopes that the familiar setting will cure her of her nightmares maxs kids arent too happy about the move though it isnt quite clear how far theyre going or what their specific objection is it isnt really clear whether were supposed to believe jessica wants to get along with her new stepdaughters or if her rudeness to them is an accidental problem of the script and the performance either way after a few days in the house jessica ignores alice by sneaking out of the house during a game of hideandseek in order to take a work call leaving alice to explore the basement and find chauncey the creepy teddy bear chauncey quickly becomes alices new imaginary friend who she talks to constantly and takes with her everywhere this part of the plot strongly evokes m3gan without ever getting near that movies knowing sense of fun all this setup happens by about 10 minutes into the movie and its also where the coherent details of the plot end ed note the rest of this story contains significant spoilers for imaginary the good news is reading about them is much more fun than sitting through all 104 minutes of the movie chaunceys arrival should also usher creepiness into imaginary but the movie gets so diverted by trying to piece together a story out of its myriad meaningless plot threads that it doesnt have much time to dedicate to actual horror in one scene for instance the childrens biological mother shows up at jessicas house without warning attacks jessica reveals that she seems to psychically know theres something evil in the house gets arrested then disappears for the entire rest of the movie this scene is never brought up again shortly after that max just leaves his children with their new clearly not uptothetask stepmom so he can go on a seemingly indefinite tour with his band theres also a creepy neighbor who just happens to have a fully illustrated academic textbook on imaginary friends that seems tailormade for a lazy exposition scene the movie even throws in two separate childabuse plotlines that it eventually just shrugs off when they arent useful anymore  its tempting to try to read into this labyrinth of digressions to try to find some kind of meaning or intention but imaginary never makes that feel worthwhile there isnt a single character in the movie who feels worth rooting for and the performances are entirely devoid of charisma the script written by wadlow jason oremland and greg erb is full of wooden dialogue thats stiff and often feels almost completely nonsensical characters sometimes introduce new information like its a fact the audience has known forever at other times they treat seemingly obvious plot points like major unguessable reveals  like when we find out that chauncey once belonged to jessica none of these plot threads ever amount to much and most of them are just left dangling by the end of the movie if the filmmakers dont care about them why should we  but as with any horror movie most of this disaster could be overlooked if only the story was scary instead thats where its failures become most apparent imaginary doesnt bring a single original idea to the horror genre its entirely paintbynumbers filmmaking that never even manages to create tension let alone fear characters look under beds while the cloying score brings in a swell of strings to beg us to feel something chauncey moves on his own a time or two and even transforms into a monstrous bear but the scenes are lit so badly that the effect just looks cheap and underbaked rather than remotely terrifying watching sequences this rote is soulcrushing for a horror fan and they make the moments where the movie slows down for its next attempt at a scare feel like they drag on for ages  the one briefly interesting sequence comes in the final third of the movie when alice has been tricked into visiting the world of the imaginary friends and jessica and taylor have to rescue her this world floats in darkness and its only solid ground is a checkerboard floor in an endless hallway of doors sections of the world form staircases to nowhere dead ends that drop into an abyss and doors that seem to float upside down none of these visuals are wholly original  they take aim at the middle ground between twin peaks red room and a scoobydoo chase scene without any of the fun that combination implies but even without originality its far and away the best visual of the movie sadly for most of their time in this world the characters just charge blindly into doors and end up in the same boring rooms weve seen in the rest of the movie each one shot essentially the same as it was in the real world just a little bit darker  imaginary didnt have a high bar to clear in a year thats been lacking interesting horror movies so far with the other blumhouse entry night swim as the only real bright spot all this movie ever really needed to be was some silly fun with a few good scares instead it gets lost in a maze of awful storytelling and frustrating characters all without offering anything more than the stockstandard horror tropes that have been done better in a million other movies

Mar 8 2024,positive,  here the films title comes into play as the evil encountered is not so plainly in sight the key character chauncey is seemingly innocent looking but subtly able to change expressions or mysteriously just show up unnanounced while still appearing inanimate he is abandoned in a corner of a new home where young alice pyper braun finds him and immediately turns him into her friend however imaginary this relationship seems at first she and older teen sister taylor taegen burns are the stepdaughters of jessica dewanda wise who has moved from a new orleans apartment with her new husband and father of the two girls max tom payne still haunted by nightmares from her own past and with an institutionalized father ben sam salary max believes a change of pace is needed and arranges for the family to actually move into jessicas childhood home uh not a good idea   there are a few twists a couple of turns and even some nice old fashioned excuses to scream if you are so inclined wadlow is smart enough to know that in the oversaturated horror genre the best path forward might be not what we actually see vis a vis gutwrenching hardr visuals but rather what we actually think we see its effective in its own way especially since imaginary seems set up initially to be just an extension of this subhorror genre given vivid life by the likes of annabelle and chucky among others outside of the blumhouse house  it helps to have a game cast and there is one on board here starting with wise also an executive producer who makes jessicas own past come alive believably as the new experience in her old house comes back to haunt her braun is terrific hardly cloying at all in a role that seems clichéd in this kind of film these days burns makes a strong impression as does salany the latter seen in flashbacks and current day as the institutionalized father who holds dark secrets buckley in essentially the lin shaye role makes the older somewhat creepy neighbor an absolute hoot this tonywinning star adds a lot of gravitas and knocks it out of the park particularly when the action turns to the place beyond the walls known as the never ever every one of these films builds to an overwrought manic climax and this one is no different in that regard with the emerging entity and bloated bear beast on hand but wadlow keeps it all in check enough as to not also destroy the heart of his tale  an eerie and lilting musical theme is exceptionally well used here almost feeling like the childhood soundtrack provided by elmer bernstein in his classic to kill a mockingbird score it is enormously effective and the music for the film is credited to sparks and shadows with an acknowledgement at the end credits to composer bear mccreary for additional work  by providing your information you agree to our terms of use and our privacy policy we use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services this site is protected by recaptcha enterprise and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply  by providing your information you agree to our terms of use and our privacy policy we use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services this site is protected by recaptcha enterprise and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply
Mar 8 2024,negative, yes the latest film from producer jason blums horror factory arrives in theatres this weekend with a killer marketing campaign designed to convince audiences that this films evil teddy bear is the second coming of last years homicidaldoll homicidoll sensation m3gan but while both films feature childrens toys whose switches have been firmly flipped to evil imaginary is as dour a slog as m3gan was a bloody bit of selfaware camp at least imaginary director jeff wadlow does well on the prop front securing a stuffed animal that is creepy in its simplicity with two little black eyes a tightly pursed mouth and eversoslightly pilled fabric the cute little chauncey bear carries a sinister kind of charm i mean what kid wouldnt bat an eye when the stuffie mysteriously appears out of nowhere in the creepy basement of a clearly haunted suburban home perhaps a smarter child than the young alice pyper braun wouldve left the bear be but then again the youngster is dealing with bigger problems than teddies materializing out of thin air problems like the tense dynamic between her bratty older sister taylor taegan burns and their new stepmom jessica dewanda wise a wellmeaning childrens artist who has relocated her stepdaughters into her old childhood home this was perhaps a smart decision given that the family which includes alice and taylors musician father max tom payne were feeling cramped in their downtown apartment but then again it is clear that something horrible went down in jessicas youth  why oh why has her father has spent most of his life in a mentalhealth institution  and now her stepdaughters will be forced to relive it one jump scare at a time the main culprit that would be chauncey bear whom alice once day starts lugging everywhere engaging in imaginary conversations with her new best friend naturally things go supernaturally sideways almost immediately throwing jessica and her stepdaughters into an odyssey thats pitched as nightmarish but is mostly just tedious wadlow gets a slightly surreal spring in his step once he shifts the films action to chaunceys otherworldly realm a kind of checkerpatterned hell that looks like the hotel beetlejuice might run were he a propertybrother poltergeist but by that point audiences will have already ghosted the proceedings whether its the watereddown scares or the terrible performances  no one likes making fun of children but braun needs to leave acting to the stageparented professionals  imaginarys myriad faults are all too real the only brief amusement comes from dreaming of the enterprising podcaster who will surely one day talk their way through a surreal double bill of wadlows film and this years other big imaginaryfriend film john krasinskis forthcoming if a decidedly more familyfriendly affair until that podcast arrives though  or until m3gan inevitably teams up with the prototypical serialkiller doll chucky  it is best to put childish things away preferably under lock and key
Mar 8 2024,negative, your mental todo list should be a packed schedule of action items by the time imaginary a cheaplooking exercise in childhood horror concludes after all youll need something to concentrate on  with so little in this pg13 programmer to draw focus especially the floppy crookedeyed teddy bear named chauncey being oversold as the movies devil toy du jour when kids invent friends to play with theyre showing how fertile they are with their idle hours and how resilient and efficient the brain can be in fact id bet if you tasked any child with a rewrite on this script credited to director jeff wadlow greg erb and jason oremland youd likely come up with something way more colorful fun and freaky than the zipless cafeteria food ladled onto our laps imaginary arrives in the shadow of the new datenight classic m3gan also from blumhouse itself a benchmark in the weaponizing of a troubled kids playtime revealing in its craftiness a surprisingly rich engagement with techage loves and fears imaginary  is marked by a similar starter kit of brokenhome emotions earnest stepmom and storybook illustrator jessica dewanda wise thinks the way to deepen her relationships with the glum daughters of her new husband a negligible tom payne is to move everyone into her old childhood home  teenage taylor taegen burns mopes and sasses but nervous moppet alice pyper braun finds joy in an understuffed redvested bear discovered where else behind a hidden door in a spooky basement chauncey soon exerts a remarkable eventually menacing control over alice who  voices what he tells her triggering jessicas own repressed trauma but where m3gan felt alive to the culty potential of a malevolent plaything imaginary skips the directive to entertain coming off as stiff pedestrian and dreary as a march spacefiller can get when betty buckleys grandmotherly scholar shows up to give us a crash course in the cultural history of kids with spirit besties an already weak film suddenly exhibits the tedium of a book report since when did horror screenwriters feel the need to start explaining everything oh the innocents take me away wadlow is frankly terrible with actors wise his lead has plenty of presence but she never seems to be truly grappling with nightmares tormented stepkids a creative block a father in an assisted living facility and the fallout of a truly horrendous family relo the awkwardness is evenly applied anytime two people in the same scene are supposed to know each other they look as if theyve just met wadlow can even make a motionless plush animal seem poorly directed chauncey is the least of his problems though when whats been structured around those moments feels like a paintbynumbers exercise and not a true wade into terrifying waters when the final act shifts to a world behind a portal  remember theres a kid here named alice  you feel imaginary giving up any interest in shaking our senses hoping a late injection of cgi twists will do the trick if kids can grow out of their pretend pals so too can horror audiences of cynical snoozes like this
Mar 8 2024,negative,  theres a lot to unpack in the new horror film from blumhouse which seems designed to provide fodder for family therapy sessions throughout the country   the new house is where alice finds the bear who at first seems harmless enough everyone keeps referring to it as alices imaginary friend much like the one that jessica herself had in the same house many years earlier alice seems happily content with chauncey sitting down for a tea party with him and playing hide and seek but their close relationship grows increasingly disturbing especially when he makes her engage in a scavenger hunt that turns dangerous  but wait it gets better although for the sake of avoiding spoilers too many more plot details wont be revealed suffice it to say that alice soon goes missing that her imaginary friend is not so imaginary and that everyone winds up in an alternate dimension resembling an mc escher drawing and featuring various monsters including a very large guy in a bear suit  and then theres the supporting character of gloria a creepy old woman who wanders around the neighborhood at all hours and seems desperate for conversation it turns out that shes jessicas former babysitter and has inside knowledge of her past nightmarish experiences shes also an author who specializes in the subject of imaginary friends which comes in very handy when the group decides to offer a benediction to summon a spirit from another realm nostalgia buffs will enjoy the fact that gloria is played by betty buckley who established her horror bona fides so many years ago in the original carrie and more recently in m night shyamalans split the veteran actress plays the role to the hilt clearly relishing the opportunity to enjoy the sort of latecareer renaissance in horror films as such hollywood legends as joan crawford bette davis and olivia de havilland
Mar 8 2024,negative,  it used to be that if a horror movie wasnt very good it was probably too simplistic in its fear mechanics stalker on the loose ghost in the attic dont go in the basement today though its often the case that megaplex horror schlock isnt too simple  its too busy too fraught with convolutions instead of jump scares we get worldbuilding hoops to jump through  in its skittery overlayered trickiness what imaginary lacks is a grounded feeling for the psychology that binds children to the friends they make up m3gan which was also a blumhouse production a far superior one had that kind of catchy and scannable horrorfilm psychology in the relationship that developed between violet mcgraws cady and her lethal robotdoll bff but psychology in too many films these days is the dramatic ingredient that gets left on the shelf thats true even in a certain current acclaimed big hit  a movie with more sand than psychology imaginary despite a few creepy moments is starved for scenes that make the fear its showing you relatable  theres a moment of the purest camp where a therapist is interviewing alice with chauncey the teddy bear sitting there and alice is speaking in both their voices suddenly the bear talks without her the therapist scared and disturbed asks jessica if alice has been studying ventriloquism i guess thats a rational question but its also a preposterous one the other element imaginary lacks is any supple sense of family dynamics the director jeff wadlow establishes to the point of overkill that taylor resents the existence of her stepmother but the film still makes jessica into too much of an interloper the girls real mother it turns out was a violent head case which just tosses one more layer of undigested material into the stew  that said you know youre in the hands of a horrormovie pro whenever betty buckley shows up in oversize glasses and clipped middle american suburban dowager hair and with an intrusive smirk as gloria the busybody of a neighbor who used to babysit for jessica when she was a little girl gloria who discovered the sinister metaphysics of the imaginaryfriend world back then has written a historical tome about the subject shes officially obsessed and might even be one of the villains yet buckley with the teasing clarity of her delivery makes gloria that rare thing a karen you dont want to stop listening to 
Mar 8 2024,positive, past and present trauma fuse in jeff wadlows imaginary the latest in the blumhouse catalog of reliably creepy horror movies whose fans typically expect wellexecuted jump scares fun plot twists and the occasional rubbery monster what they probably dont expect is the sophisticated allegory that imaginary appears to be flirting with  and comes close to pulling off  before losing its nerve or maybe its my imagination gone supernova alongside that of little alice a delightful pyper braun and her stepmother jessica dewanda wise a writer and illustrator of childrens books after jessicas father is settled in a care facility she and her family  including a rebellious teen taegen burns and a guitarplaying husband tom payne who smartly buzzes off on tour when things get hairy  move into her childhood home almost immediately alice is conversing with a stuffed teddy bear she finds in the basement an imaginary friend whose increasingly sinister games stir memories jessica has long suppressed on one level then we have a mildly embellished hauntedhouse picture entertainingly realized mainly with puppets and other practical effects theres also the familiar eerie neighbor here played by the wonderful betty buckley whose job is to help us make sense of the storys woowoo logic whats also playing out though are the lonely struggles of a stressedout second wife who is black to connect with the distant sometimes resentful white stepdaughters whose mentally ill birth mother is not entirely out of the picture in that sense the movies devolution into by my count at least three attempted endings suggests some dithering over whether to deliver the logical conclusion to jessicas sacrificial trajectory or ease the transition to a possible sequel as to which prevails youll have to use your imagination
Mar 8 2024,negative, its yet another subpar day at the blumhouse factory production line operating at full breakneck speed yet machinery on the perilous verge of total collapse the house of horror behind hit franchises like insidious paranormal activity and the purge has become something of a franchise in itself a branded string of lowbudget films making a high profit yet quality control has forever been an issue and in the last year or so its barely existed on the first cursed weekend of january 2023 usually home to the most unintentionally horrifying horror films m3gan upended critical expectations and scored reviews as impressive as its box office total but normality soon resumed with a limp insidious sequel a junky time travel slasher a loathed exorcist reboot an astonishingly dull video game adaptation and most recently a soggy haunted pool horror yet somehow the very worst was yet to come and now here it is crashlanding into cinemas with an embargo so late some preview audiences will have already started watching it imaginary teased by an audiofirst cinemaonly trailer far smarter than the movie itself is a shameless grab bag of stolen parts clumsily stitched together with such carelessness its a miracle its even getting a theatrical release the bar might have fallen to its lowest ever point for studio horror but its still a surprise to see just how bad things can really get i was kinder than most about writerdirector jeff wadlows first blumhouse offering the gimmicky yet fun franchise nonstarter truth or dare which worked just about enough in a low stakes kinda way a final destination ripoff for the sleepover crowd his followup fantasy island was a disordered mess trying and failing to do far too much and theres a similar level of unearned confidence on display in his latest worldbuilding done with an unsteady hand and an unfocused mind things start off in familiar genre territory as a woman named jessica played by dewanda wise returns to her childhood home with new family in tow husband max british actor tom payne and his two children from a former marriage both jessica and max have some sort of trauma in their past  her absent father his mentally unwell exwife  and both are hoping that a new start will help them heal but when youngest daughter alice pyper braun finds an old teddy bear and claims it as her new imaginary friend chauncey their dream home becomes a nightmare while red flags start to fly pretty early on  some bad acting some even worse dialogue  the buildup is at the very least competent if entirely derivative recalling the 2005 robert de niro thriller hide and seek as well as poltergeist and m3gan a child falling into dangerous fantasy dragged deeper by a nefarious presence but like so many horror films these days its a logline scrawled on a napkin rather than a fullyformed and fully thoughtout script and so when the plot inevitably thickens the cracks turn into chasms and a twostar timewaster descends into a onestar catastrophe along with the years other blumhouse misstep night swim imaginary feels like the sort of bottomshelf shocker that would have littered video stores decades ago modernised only by its almost parodic obsession with trauma the word that has ruined many a horror film of late the last act as dripdrip creepiness turns into flash flood chaos is a laughably incoherent string of question marks  how did they how could she what was that  which plays out as if it were being made up on the spot sloppy enough for a refund wadlow and his cowriters greg erb and jason oremland in need of a stern sensechecker theres such lumbering gracelessness to how rules are introduced  characters stumbling over nonsensical realisations and reveals  and such shamelessness to how other better films and shows are copied there are too many to list but you can feel elements of it beetlejuice housebound come play stranger things and most obviously coraline with a visual trick so brazenly similar legal action should follow wise can be a charming presence elsewhere but theres only so much that can be done with the suffocatingly soapy dialogue shes lumped with and she quickly gets lost in the murk surrounding her even the promise of betty buckley playing a mysterious neighbour frantically ranting about demonic mythology isnt as much fun as it should have been wadlow has spoken of his desire to make a fourquadrant horror intended for a broader audience the likes of which audiences saw more of in the 1980s operating like a rollercoaster thats exciting in the moment but unlikely to leave a mark its an admirable mission statement and given how selfserious so many horror films can now be aiming for more fun is no bad thing but imaginary is far too dumb and ungainly to move at the pace required and bring the thrills it should a theme park ride that should be closed for repairs
Mar 8 2024,neutral, blumhouse seems to be trying to cobble together an eventual superteam of anthropomorphic robotic or stuffed serial killer toys the latest member to join m3gan and the five nights at freddys gang in this unofficial murderers row is chauncey the creepy stuffed bear at the heart of imaginary but working against chauncey is that the movie hes stuck in is unimaginative lacking in scares and stuffed not with cotton but with bland horror cliches that even genre fans will be bored by a movie about a terrifying killer bear friend should be a lot scarier than this the most imaginary thing about imaginary are any frights youll have sitting through it dewanda wise such a presence in the most recent jurassic world movie stars as jessica the tropes begin right away as jessica and her husband max tom payne move into her childhood hom with his his two daughters from a prior marriage psychological trauma is all over the place here jessica clearly had something horrible happen to her as a child memories she seems to be repressing but are coming out in the childrens stories she pens as an author maxs exwife also suffers from mental illness and has been a threat to his daughters taylor taegen burns and the youngest alice pyper braun its alice who is struggling the most but she finds some comfort when she discovers an old teddy bear promisingly hidden away in a secret basement compartment she names him chauncey and her new imaginary friend becomes the catalyst for some disturbing increasingly dangerous behavior director and cowriter jeff wadlow has become a blumhouse favorite for making easytodigest horror movies with a minimum of blood and violence its a crucial component to the blumhouse formula of maxing out audience appeal for their smallbudget line of horrors that they drop on us every couple of months with conveyor belt consistency wadlow impressed me with his breakout film a personal favorite crywolf a slasher with very little onscreen bloodshed to speak of but had loads of personality following his dreadful kickass 2 misstep which wasnt totally his fault hes found modest success for blumhouse on the final destinationesque truth or dare and again with the bloated fantasy island remake imaginary is less of a movie than it is a single idea stretched thin for 100minutes wadlow fills the gaps with generically ominous music hoping thats enough to keep reaction shots of chaunceys murderous teddy bear face from becoming a punchline it doesnt work youll also laugh yourself silly at everything this movie liberally borrows from better horror movies from the past cliches such as creepy kids drawings rebellious teens ineffective psychiatrists menacing toys playing more menacing tunes and a clueless husband who seems unaware of the threat to his family they shouldve had patrick wilson play him that stereotypical role has become so worn out over the years while the cast mostly struggles with a terrible script horror veteran betty buckley makes the most of her scenes as a nosey neighbor linked to jessicas past buckley plays the role with all of the histrionic excess that a film this ridiculous deserves its a shame that imaginary is so devoid of frights because there are some solid aspects here including relative intense build where jessicas natural instincts clash with her repressed memories wise is such a talented actress she can convey jessicas desire to be a good stepmother to the girls but also her frustration at the mounting issues preventing that from happening wadlow mixes an array of dynamic colors with shadow to capture images both surreal and frightening much like a childs vivid imagination imaginary takes from everything from coraline to childs play but surprisingly also from toy story while the toys in that pixar classic were saddened when ignored by their child owners and used it to inspire adventure chauncey refuses to be left behind and will destroy everyone to make sure it doesnt happen in a way its a twist on the wellworn idea that what evil spirits want most is life its actually quite a cool idea that mightve worked with more commitment to making chauncey a fearsome paranormal threat but imaginary plays it far too safe to offer any memorable thrills
Mar 8 2024,positive, the great escaper 12 96 minutes  m in his final film before announcing his retirement michael caine is effortlessly fabulous in the great escaper playing reallife figure bernie jordan who in 2014 went awol from his nursing home to attend the 70th anniversary commemoration on the dday landings in her final film before passing away glenda jackson puts in an equally wonderful turn as irene bernies loving wife who remains at the home trying to provide cover before the truth of bernies disappearance inevitably surfaces delicately directed by oliver parker from a screenplay by william ivory made in dagenham the films sweet tone thankfully never veers into sentimentality the story remains grounded in the tragedy of war building to a memorable scene decrying the human cost of battle a beautifully etched performance by john standing as raf veteran arthur who befriends bernie with a touching gesture of camaraderie further underscores the lifelong mental scars war can inflict there are some nicely judged moments of humour as bernie becomes an unintentional celebrity but these never overwhelm the films themes of sorrow loss and closure to wit one nearsilent vignette shows figures standing on the nearempty beach at normandy a stirring reminder of how war can imbue an otherwise picturesque location with the chill of memory bear vs kid in imaginary imaginary 12 104 minutes m  the style is strong and the ambience creepy as the long tradition of scary movie kids continues apace in imaginary a highquality horror jaunt thatll make you see cute stuffed toys a whole new light when jessica dewanda wise and husband tom tom payne move in to her childhood home she notes with nostalgic delight how her stepdaughter alice pyper braun  a movie name that has long been an omen of impending nastiness alice sweet alice anyone  has taken to her old teddy bear chauncey well directed by jeff wadlow who does a fine job generating just the right mood of supernatural paranoia  thanks in large part to a terrific turn by veteran betty buckley as a creepyass neighbour  the film carries the formidable stamp of blumhouse productions dedicated to horror films that boast some originality the studio has largely been good to its word knocking out consistently good horror fodder such as insidious the purge unfriended the black phone m3gan and most recently five nights at freddys how to have sex 12 91 minutes ma blessed with a caustically ironic title this finely directed zeitgeisttapping sex drama dives into the downside of raunch culture as three posthigh school british girls join the hormonally preoccupied throngs at a hot holiday spot looking for fun and hopefully a few casual hookups with similarly minded guys with laddish swagger and zero body fat the girls find prospects in the adjacent apartment with tara mia mckennabruce becoming entwined with bad boy paddy samuel bottomley whose seduction strategy takes them to the beach rather than deploy offtheshelf clichés about toxic masculinity writerdirector molly manning walker in a very strong debut instead opts for a more nuanced engagement with the issues of consent and the presumption of sexual entitlement nobody gets off lightly as the truth behind events unfold full of challenging questions and confronting conversation triggers the film offers unforced observations about excessive drinking female bonding blithe degradation  that pool party scene is hard to stomach  and recreational sex through an impressive raft of naturalistic performances especially from mckennabruce and shaun thomas who plays paddys mate badger cabrini 12 145 minutes part subtitled m dedicated to the adoration of feisty protofeminist nun francesca cabrini cabrini is a loving and long biopic detailing her dogged fight against antiitalian prejudice as she and her sisters work to help the poor and starving immigrant souls of late1800s new york lovingly directed on a noticeably big budget alejandro monteverde sound of freedom mounts cabrini as an historical melodrama about bigotry dignity morality and political corruption  often all in the one scene propelled by a strong central performance from cristiana dellanna who projects a subduedyetunmistakable dont fool with me attitude to all the people who give her stick  and there are a lot of them  the film is a punchy if prolonged paean to cabrini in particular and more generally to the underacknowledged truth the people of faith have the capacity to be huge troublemakers  this of course follows the lead of jesus christ whose example instructed his followers to defy authority especially when it was in the service of his dictates by this measure cabrini proved herself a heck of a kickass catholic confronting everyone from the pope her archbishop david morse and the apples mayor a heavily bearded john lithgow the production is handsome  kudos for the films recreation of old new york streetscapes  and theres no doubting the tenacity cabrini possessed in kickstarting a global network of hospitals designed to help the poor that said the film is a bit of a tubthumper with loud declarations about the power of women and the rights of the poor to decent health care
Mar 8 2024,negative,if the wayans made a parody of an insidiouspoltergeist mashup and forgot to include the jokes that would be imaginary
Mar 8 2024,negative,a convoluted tonally uneven and underwhelming pastiche of better horror films like insidious pans labyrinth and hereditary its just as dull as last years cobweb
Mar 8 2024,negative, with the worrying proliferation of artificial intelligence now frequently implemented or encouraged to be used towards creative endeavors we jest when we come across something ostensibly humanmade that nevertheless feels born of ai its a bleak if facetious admittance of our own potential incapability to distinguish whats manmade trash and whats robotmade case in point while watching the new blumhouse horror film imaginarydirected by truth or dare and kickass 2 auteur jeff wadlowthe question around the extent to which ai was or was not utilized was constantly present in my mind to the point where i felt i was legitimately going insane the screenplay of imaginary is credited to humans three to be exact wadlow himself greg erb and jason oremland and yet there is nothing in the film which doesnt appear to be pulled from an algorithmic ether and designed to hit all the right buttons of what an audience would presumably want to see in a horror filmbecause theyve already loved it in the past our story follows jessica dewanda wise an artist and author of a popular childrens book series who moves back into the childhood home after her deteriorating father has been placed in an assisted care facility shes accompanied by her tattooed hipster musician husband max tom payne and maxs two daughters from a previous marriage mouthy teenager taylor taegen burns and the much younger alice pyper braun unsurprisingly this previous marriage was to a mentally unwell woman who went insane for undisclosed reasons and got herself locked up in an asylum also unsurprisingly she later escapes from said institution to warn her daughters of the impending horrors that await them because neurodivergent people typically have the psychic ability to sense foreboding supernatural doom weve seen this all play out before of course  while exploring her new homes creepy basement a basement that looks like every other creepy basement in a million other horror movies alice a precocious girl who speaks like an adult in a childs body trying to mimic how children speak finds a hidden door which leads to a worn abandoned teddy bear named chauncey alice attaches herself to the toy and begins to manifest chauncey as her imaginary friend and its not too long before her behavior starts rapidly altering as she appears to be doing her new friends biddinglike embarking on an innocent scavenger hunt that requires alice to slam her little palm into a rusty nail  jessica manages to stop this heinous act at the last moment which is probably a more stressful time bonding with her stepdaughters while max is away touring with his band  than she probably anticipated eventually jessica unlocks more of her traumatic past and the strange puzzle pieces of the situation begin falling into place when she was just five she was sent to live with her grandparents after her father went insane following the death of jessicas mom but jessica realizes that this past involves the same chauncey who alice now totes around having full conversations with who tells alice that shes going somewhere called the never ever meanwhile taylor incensed at the idea of having to kowtow to a fake mother acts out by bringing a neighborhood boy over who promptly insults her younger sister and tries plying taylor with molly that later turns out to be allergy medicine while trying to manage the stresses of new motherhood and an encroaching and unknowable evil its up to jessica to unlock the repressed secrets of her past to keep alice from being transported to the world of a malignant spirit that wants to play with her forever that aforementioned scenario with the neighbor boy and the fake drugs is just one of a seemingly endless supply of absurd narratively jarring situations conversations and plot points sometimes these scenes are downright laugh out loud like the baffling introduction of an elderly woman referred to as old bag patterson by the delinquent young neighbor the teen drug bust or when alices therapist is so alarmed by a conversation she observes the child having with chauncey that she gravely asks jessica if alice has taken up ventriloquism as a new hobby i was so totally baffled by the extent to which imaginary feels cobbled together by triedandtrue tropes and how unabashedly banal it is in nearly every aspect that there was no other conclusion i could come to than to start my own little conspiracy that imaginary is the first totally aigenerated screenplay i know thats not the case but nevertheless everything about the film feels off in a way that ive never experienced beforeas if the entire film exists in the same uncanny valley as those demented polar express children every aspect feels tailored to meet certain horror movie quota a creepy child talking to someone no one else can see check a creepy toy possessed by something unknown and evil and can move on its own sometimes check a female lead with a traumatic past check a creepy old woman harboring secrets check a creepy basement check and about 50 shots of an entity lingering outoffocus just behind our characters after which the camera pulls away until it returns to the same spot with the entity now missing yes even the camerawork appears to have been tested by a focus group characters even speak in a way thats less like a robot approximating conversation by attempting to mimic human speech and more like a robot approximating how humans speak to one another in a movie nearly every line of dialogue reads like a slightly offkilter cliché that was both said a million times in other films before and also said much better by better actors there are few redeeming factors in imaginary except maybe the final boss chauncey bear demon which looks so tangible id be shocked to find out it wasnt a puppet the design of the creature is genuinely frightening and it moves in that slow stilted way physical creations tend to in films which filmmakers have since gone on to dismiss in favor of the uncanny awful smoothness of cgi if it is indeed a puppet its a nice touch in a film which otherwise coasts on complete unremarkability if its not well then i suppose credit where credits due to the vfx artists who managed such an affecting spectacle yet i still cant help but view even this positive aspect with just a hint of suspicious cynicism due to all the other offputting parts of the movie if chaunceys presence is indeed tactile maybe the choice to erect him as a real object was another cog in the algorithm machine a choice made less out of reverence for tangible fx than one decided by the allknowing ai gods deemed as more likely to appeal to audiences  regardless of whether or not imaginary was created with the power of ai behind it its still a clear reflection of the film industrys emphasis on copying its own work and to what end so that we can have a horror movie so derivative that it becomes uniquely terrible the desire to make ai cracks about slop like this comes perhaps from me having too much respect for screenwritershow could years of cinema history lead to imaginary without something dark sinister and inhuman behind it human incompetence is more terrifying to me than artificial intelligence we talk about our pressing existential fears around ai yet were quite clearly capable of

Mar 8 2024,negative, well since last weekends column i took the plunge  in other words i quit above the line in quite a loud and glorious way i mean i had already given them my notice weeks ago but there were no signs of me or any of the writers being paid and i finally reached my limit of how much bullshit i could take if you want to read more about it you can do so here but honestly i just want to try to move on my three and half years there have been extremely stressful and traumatic even though i kept trying my best to make this work out the simple fact is that i cant keep working for free except when writing this column but at least my boss here treats me well feeds me gives me regular naps etc etc hopefully something else will come along but ill be doing this and of course continuing at gold derby as long as i possibly can note that its oscar weekend plus we have to set our clocks forward saturday night so diehard movie fans probably wont be out seeing movies on sunday night and many of the weekend offerings may be frontloaded due to that  ive reviewed four very different movies though one of the reviews is embargoed until thursday night  the big release for the weekend is the fourth movie in dreamworks animations longrunning animated franchise featuring jack black as the voice of po the martial arts eschewing panda bear who needs to find his successor as dragon warrior to become a spiritual advisor to the valley of peace soon po learns that an evil sorceress known as the chameleon voiced by viola davis threatens the valley of peace so he turns to a thieving fox named zhen voiced by awkwafina as they go on a journey to stop the chameleon as you can guess from the number in the title this is the fourth installment of a franchise that seemed to peter out with the third installment in 2016 but actually has been kept alive through streaming on both netflix and peacock where the original theatrical releases and a few specials and series have thrived most recently on netflix but with a series leading up to the third movie thats kept avid young fans entertained kung fu panda 4 also benefits from there not really being many other animated movies in theaters other than universals migration which has done quite well  minireview it feels necessary nae mandatory to question whether a fourth movie in any animated franchise is something thats really warranted or necessary as far as jack blacks title character in this franchise hes been keeping kids entertained for 15 years not only in the three theatrical movies but also in a number of streaming series and specials so he might have already reached a shrek level of popularity even without having a broadway musical the premise for the fourth movie is about as simple as you can get the biggest new addition being a character voiced by the ubiquitous and frequently annoying awkwafina who showed so much range in the farewell but just cant come close to then when just providing her voice  directed by mike mitchell trolls the lego movie 2 this installment is written by jonathan aibel and glenn berger who wrote the previous three kung fu panda movies so its a little surprising how unfunny this one its as if they ran out of joke ideas after writing the other movies and that really hurts the movie since it was always a mix of humor and frenetic action in fact the action is so frenetic its dizzyingly hard to follow at times and it isnt nearly as impressive as previous movies that took its cues from classic shaw brothers and other hk martial arts classics not having pos colleagues in the furious five also hurts the movie greatly so instead the movie turns to a slew of lesserdeveloped characters both old and new with some used better than others theres a whole sidejourney involving pos father ping and li james hong bryan cranston as they search for their son which often provides a welcome change from the pozhen bits but again all the characters are just following the most standard storytelling formula other characters voiced by ke huy quan and ronny chieng show up say a few lines and then are gone neither of their characters offering much in terms of charm personality or anything particularly memorable viola davis does a fine job voicing what turns out to be a substandard villain as were reminded of some of the better villains as her chameleon captures them to their steal their martial arts skills using pos staff of wisdom things basically go along as expected until a big battle finale and the relationship between po and zhen goes exactly where its expected to go so it doesnt feel like anything in the movie really does much to add to the mythos set up by earlier films from blumhouse comes another highconcept horror film this one the latest pg13 film from jeff wadlow truth or dare fantasy island starring dewanda wise jurassic world dominion as jessica a woman who returns to her childhood home with her husband and two stepdaughters as the younger one starts communicating with an imaginary friend that might be connected to jessicas own imaginary friend from childhood but this friend chauncy bear may have malevolent intentions for jessicas entire family after the disappointing showing for night swim in january a movie that quite liked that was distributedmarketed by universal one wonders if these blumhouse high concept horror films may be running their course and how imaginary does will certainly control that narrative  lionsgate has embargoed reviews until thursday night at 8pm so youll have to wait until then to find out how much i absolutely fucking loathed this movie this was absolute garbage minireview while imaginary is about as highconcept horror as you can possibly get essentially about an imaginary friend that was deserted by a young girl and who turns out to be quite evil when the nowwoman returns to the house with her new family maybe youve seen the trailer or commercial in front of farbetter horror movies or before five nights at freddys which sucked but for the most part this is exactly whats being touted except that its not scary nor is it very good and yet this is still not the worst horror movie ive seen this year that would still be founders day i mentioned night swim above and i believe that i reviewed it over on that site that is now gone and quite liked it but when you watch imaginary and realize that it uses a very similar story about a family moving into a house and weird and bad things happening to them then you may start thinking that blumhouse may want to take a step away from this particular horror subgenre for a bit dewanda wise who is also one of the films producers is perfectly fine but so much of the focus is put on her younger stepdaughter alice played by pyper braun possibly one of the most obnoxious and annoying child actors in recent memory l know that its kind of mean to pick on a child actor but you know what there are plenty of young actors that could have pulled this role off better but this was a combination of bad casting and just plain old bad direction my biggest issue with imaginary is that it literally rips off insidious another blumhouse production  i mean its fairly blatant  so besides the typical cheap jump scares wadlow is best known for we get so much that just isnt particularly original either theres even a pesky neighbor woman kind of taking on the lin shaye role someone who knows so much about what is going on and proceeds to tell the other characters ad nauseum via ridiculous exposition about what she knows and the whole thing just gets more ridiculous the more words that come out of her mouth by now blumhouse should realize that these sorts of movies have to be at least partially fun to keep viewers on board and imaginary is just grim going down this rabbit hole that seems to point to some past abuse suffered by jessica as a girl but never really outright stating it theres also her aging father who is in a home and seemingly suffering from dementia though it ends up being something related to the house and what happened decades earlier hes another character that could have easily been omitted and the movie would have been just fine instead its a disaster that is already teetering on the edge of going over a cliff by the third act  imaginary isnt scary its barely entertaining and its a flagrant ripoff of much better movies including quite a few from blumhouse its likely to leave even the most casual of horror fans disappointed this may be one of blumhouses worse movies since well five nights at freddys but this one combines bad writing with absolute incompetence making it quite a bit worse  this is quite a different movie from faithbased film specialists angel studios which is actually the new film from mexican filmmaker alejandro monteverde who had such an enormous hit in 2023 with sound of freedom it stars cristiana dellanna as mother frances cabrini an italian nun who is sent to new york city in the late 19th century by the vatican to run an orphanage for the impoverished kids of five points once she gets to new york with a group of sisters mother cabrini realizes that she needs help so she turns to the archbishop david morse and eventually the citys mayor john lithgow only to be rebuffed as she realizes that the antiimmigrant sentiment goes right to the top still she fights to get the money and help she needs eventually helping the citys italian community achieve the respect that theyve build upon for over a century  minireview i wasnt really sure what to expect from this film which is mostly a straightahead biopic but being about a nun and being from faithbased film specialists angel studios i was expecting there to be a lot more praying and godstuff that really isnt the case at all even with the primary character being a nun and it also involving the vatican and a new york archbishop  even though i live not far from the former five points just a few blocks away actually i didnt really know much about the country and city at the time outside of what i saw in scorseses gangs of new york right off the bat i was impressed by how monteverde and his team recreated the impoverished crimeridden area and then contrasted the havenotes with the much wealthier new york city inhabitants of the time presumably with a much smaller budget than scorsese  being that much of the film criticism community are liberal atheists presumably its easy to understand why theres such a pushback against the genre and why many filmmakers behind these movies dont feel the urge to screen them for critics outside the bible belt but cabrini could just as easily been watched as a biopic about someone famous ala bob marley maestro except that it has the added benefit of being somewhat educational about the history of someone who was honestly trying to do something first for the citys immigrants and impoverished and then for the rest of the country and world  honestly cabrini is a terrific biopic about a benevolent personality that similar to the recent ordinary angel does not feel the need to hit its audience over the head with the spirituality behind the storytelling its just trying to tell semitrueish stories about good people trying to do good things in hopes of inspiring others to do the same and theres nothing really wrong with that at times cabrini may be a fairly traditional biopic but mother cabrini is just a fascinating and inspirational woman from history who few will know about and for that alone monteverdes ability to tell her story in such a cinematic way makes cabrini a worthwhile endeavor with a strong moral compass saint maud filmmaker rose glass returns with this thriller starring kristen stewart as lou a manager at a gym in a small western town where she meets drifter and bodybuilder jackie katy m obrian from the mandalorian and the two fall in love when lous sister jena malone ends up in the hospital at the hands of her husband dave franco lou threatens to do something about it but its jackie who does something about it putting them both at odds with lous criminal father played by ed harris this will open in new york and la this friday and then expand nationwide on march 15 minireview i dont remember being nearly as big a fan of saint maud as others were but its also a movie that got delayed for over a year due to the pandemic after debuting at the september festivals in 2019 i honestly cant remember when how or where i saw it as i got it mixed up with the lodge quite a bit but at least glass second movie is being released shortly after its sundance premiere where it received mostly rave reviews this is set in such a different setting for glass rural america essentially a red state where guns and homophobia are prevalent which just makes the romance and relationship between lou and jackie so much more precious we first meet lou as shes being pursued by a bubbly but annoying coworker played by anna baryshnikov so we know right up front about her queerness whereas jackie is actually being fed in a car by francos character when we meet her in hope of getting a job which she does as she is introduced to his fatherinlaw lou sr who runs a shooting range this is a film filled with great dark humor that often counters other parts that are just chillingly dark in other words this is just a perfect film for a24 to get out there to the audiences who thrive on this sort of edgy material even if one wonders whether actual red states would be open to the love story at the center of what is essentially a rural noir story while love lies bleeding does veer away from the horror and supernatural elements of saint maud glass delivers a gory crimethriller on par with nicolas refns drive in the way the story plays out with so many unexpected twists and turns its a rare case where a sophomore effort far exceeds a filmmakers debut since it shows far more range and makes you wonder what ms glass might be able to do with an even larger budget peter dinklage shirley maclaine and matt dillon star in this dramedy written by theodore melfi which i saw at tribeca way back in 2022 and its finally getting a limited release this weekend its been so long since ive seen the movie and i dont think i liked it very much so i decided not to rewatch again to write an actual review in the film dinklage plays phil loder a divorced economics professor hoping someday to own his own home leading to him striking a dal with maclaines astrid finnelli a lonely widow who is near death who offers her estate for pennies but under specific circumstances this is actually based on a true story that was told on chicago public radios the american life and i remember when i saw it thinking that there were so many ridiculous subplots that it made it hard to believe any of it was true its a little amusing that this is being released the week after problemista which has a similar awkward relationship between a dreamer and an awful older woman mark bristols dramedy based on the novel chocolate lizards by cole thompson stars rudy pankow as erwin a harvard student whose first professional acting job in new orleans goes so poorly that he runs away only to have his car break down in the middle of texas oil country with no phone service he turns to diner waitress faye carrieanne moss who offers to help him find a mechanic to fix his car but with no money he turns to local oil driller merle thomas haden church who is also nearly bankrupt this sounds like it could be fun especially with church who is such an underrated comedic actor we havent seen that much of in recent years just didnt find the time to watch for review  this haunted hotel movie comes from the china brothers making their directorial debut with phoebe tonkin as gwen taylor a young woman working her first night shift at a hotel when she begins to think shes being followed by a dangerous person from her past but then realizes the hotel might actually be haunted hitting prime video this thursday is the new comedy from peter farrelly who seems to be returning to his highconcept comedies after a brief foray into oscar territory with his best picture winning green book it stars zac efron andrew santino and jermaine fowler the blackness as childhood friend who pull a prank by creating an imaginary guy named ricky stanicky out of trouble and decades later they still use him as an alibi until their partners get suspicious they hire a washedup actor named rock hard rod played by john cena to pretend to be stanicky but his raunchy behavior makes him wonder if that was the best move this sounds like it could go either way and im a little bummed i wasnt able to watch this to review because i do enjoy some of farrellys sillier comedies but this will be readily available to stream this weekend so theres no rush on seeing it the single new series this weekend is a touch of wang hongwei focusing on the chinese actor screening jia zhankes a touch of sin 2013 and chao yangs crosscurrent 2016 bad actress has one more screening of robert aldrichs classic thriller whatever happened to baby jane 1962 starring bette davis and joan crawford as well as two screenings of fassbinders veronika voss 1982  forever young will once again screen la haine and ghost world as well as tsia mingliangs rebels of the neon god 1992 and roger kumbles thriller cruel intentions 1999 also starring john cazale will follow the sad tale of fredo corleone in the godfather and the godfather part ii which will both screen again on thursday as will francis ford coppolas 1974 thriller the conversation  im quite bummed that i was out of town last weekend and havent been able to get to this excellent japanese horror series which apparently has been selling out most of its screenings but there are more screenings this weekend including some repeat showings house godzilla dark water and cure will screen on friday as well as much more over the weekend  its strange to see moma doing a series on fleischer cartoons just a week or so after i went out to bushwick to see tommy stathes latest cartoon carnival which focused on fleischer cartoons but thats running from this coming thursday through march 14 again its nice to see moma getting involved with celebrating these great vintage cartoons but anyone who has seen stathes programs knows that hes the real deal snubbed 2 the performances continues through oscar weekend with screenings of andrew bujalskis support the girls 2018 the heartbreak kid 1972 and the carl reinerdirected all of me 1984 there will also be a 10th anniversary screening of muppets most wanted 2014 on saturday and sunday my 1 movie of all time terry gilliams brazil will play three times on monday march 11 sadly im not sure i can get over there since i have other things to see that day thats it for this week next week theres mark wahlberg in arthur the king and sir anthony hopkins in one life the american society of magical negroes plus other things expanding wider mostly
Mar 8 2024,negative,a halfbaked study of anguish from the guy who thought turning fantasy island into a horror movie was a good idea
Mar 8 2024,negative, maybe the first sign that imaginary wasnt going to pack the chills and frights you want is the fact that the teddy bearimaginary friend is namedchauncey onto the trash pile of middling killerchildrenstoy horrorshows one must now toss imaginary a lifeless hodgepodge of the hoariest cliches the genre has to offer lifting liberally from countless scary movies with henry selicks coraline near the top of that list this throwaway features creepy basements harrowing nightmares unsettling old ladies fuzzy memories bratty teens helpful therapists mentally unstable adults who can sense the supernatural eerily bouncing balls spooky shadow lanterns that play unnerving lullabies foreboding kids drawings uncanny family photographs witchy magic rituals secret doorways inhuman specters alternate universes giant monsters and mc escher dreamscapes creakiest of all its hackneyed devices though is its villain a teddy bear whose malevolent designs are about as routine as its appearance is mundane directed by jeff wadlow truth or dare who cowrote its script with greg erb and jason oremland imaginary which hit theaters mar 8 revolves around jessica dewanda wise an author of a series of childrens novels about a cheery millipede and her evil arachnid nemesis jessica is married to musician max tom payne and is stepmother to his daughters taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun the former a petulant 15yearold who cant stand jessica and the latter a young girl reeling from the figurative loss of her mother who suffers from some undefined psychological problems and is the apparent cause of arm burns that have left alice fearful of fire at the storys outset all of them move into the home where jessica lived until she was five with her mom who died of cancer and dad whos now blind and in a nursing home still she admits she can barely remember her time in the abode for reasons that are quite obviously related to the forthcoming mayhem no sooner has this foursome established themselves in the house than alice is venturing into the poorly lit junkfilled basement to discover a tiny door behind which sits a stuffed bear that tells herin dialogue that only she can hearhis name is chauncey while this plaything hasnt previously made an onscreen appearance imaginary has already depicted an identical door in an intro dream sequence in which jessica flees an enormous spider and navigates a smeary blue hallway alice endlessly talks to chauncey who always claims to be very very hungry and jessica and max initially find this to be both cute and a heartening sign that the girl is getting over whatever undescribed trauma she suffered with her biological mom however its not long before alices fun and games with chaunceyhighlighted by a scavenger hunt around their propertyturns weird what with the bear demanding that alice hurt herself by slamming her hand into a rusty nail as jessica continues working on her latest novel which she also illustrates and alice chats away with her new imaginary bff max departs the premises and film for a music tour and taylor sneers at jessica and flirts with next door neighbor liam matthew sato who comes over when no one else is around and tries to ply her with drugs and booze alice doesnt like liam and neither it turns out does chauncey yet despite having the bear play frightening tricks on the boy imaginary is too weakkneed to depict anyone actually sufferinguntil that is its finale during which one unfortunate character is slaughtered albeit behind closed doors in order to let the film maintain its pg13 rating of course gruesomeness and ultraviolence need not be employed to generate scares but modesty doesnt get wadlow anywhere his material devoid of a single moment that registers as surprising or startling much less terrifying the stranger things get the more jessica begins suspecting that chauncey is the culprit thereby instigating a visit from a psychologist veronica falcón whose input further makes the heroines head spin fortunately for jessica her former babysitter gloria betty buckley remains nearby and can provide all sorts of answers about jessicas past and in particular her own obsession with an imaginary friend that fact coupled with her unstable fathers comment about her disappearance as a kid suggests that jessica knows chauncey or at least the spectral fiend that lurks in the house potentially pulling the teddy bears strings gloria is one of those ohsoconvenient peripheral figures whos an expert in the very chaos taking place and courtesy of buckleys awkward and wooden performance she comes across as a caricature of a typical horror type all exposition and no personality whether encased in comforting sunshine or drenched in malignant darkness imaginarys visuals are flat and derivative and its dialogue is even more functional full of repeated statements you should never have to leave the things you love that dont mean anything on their own or in any larger narrative context stuck playing a cipher wise proves a serviceable if unremarkable lead and everyone else similarly goes through the motions with forgettable competence chauncey on the other hand is as nondescript as they come a ratty brown teddy with blank black eyes who doesnt move speak or do anything calculating or menacing in terms of sheer clumsiness however nothing tops the largerthanlife beasts that eventually stalk jessica and company given that they look like actors wearing shoddy homemade costumes theres something to be said for a 2024 film refusing to resort to the usual blurry and indistinct cgi that has become mainstream horror directors favorite tool yet the cruddiness of these creatures nonetheless renders the big set pieces a joke in its race toward a lame fakeout finale and afterwards an even more lackluster real one the film cribs shamelessly from coraline while evoking everything from magic and childs play to dolls a nightmare on elm street and m3gan the central conceit of wadlows tale is that imaginary friendships are twoway streets and humans must treat them as such lest their makebelieve buddies get bitter and covetous though that idea has some paranormal potential the director executes it with all the invention and excitement of a paper bag striving to be hip by frequently invoking the name of inside outs beloved bing bong imaginary proves a dreary ding dong of a thriller
Mar 8 2024,positive, netflixs damsel is a powerful twist on the classic fairytale trope that a prince must swoop in to save the damsel in distress millie bobby brown oozes girl power as she is faced with what seems like an impossible task  defeat a fire breathing dragon who is extremely disgruntled when elodie brown is tricked in to what seems like a fairytale wedding she quickly realizes her mistake as she is thrust into a dragons layer as some sort of sacrifice refusing to just lay down and die damsel follows elodie as she does everything in her power to survive and to set things straight this netflix movie is packed with suspenseful moments and a whole lot of action millie bobby brown was the perfect choice as she looks the part of a princess while having the badass moves to go toetotoe with a dragon something that really works with damsel is that elodie does not immediately have the guts to take on the dragon and she certainly doesnt know what she is doing all too often movies like this will all of a sudden thrust the lead into situations they would never escape in real life and has them do it without a scratch on them while elodie does have great survival instincts that kick in she takes her hits too these are intense situations with high stakes and it isnt easy for her  damsel doesnt take too long to put elodie into these situations which is a good thing because just reading the synopsis will set viewers up for what is to come if the movie took its time before putting elodie in peril it would have have dragged luckily they waste almost no time only giving us the first act so that we can understand the situation and know some things that will come in handy in the future  brooke carter who plays elodies sister floria has wonderful on screen chemistry with millie bobby brown the two truly feel like sisters she isnt in the movie a lot but when she is she earns her spot on the screen  the same can be said for angela bassett who quite frankly feels underused she portrays elodie and florias stepsister and while she certainly shines in the movie we could have used more time with her it almost feels as if her character is done dirty however we also understand needing to stick to a breezy runtime and remain under two hours for a film like this ray winstone is fantastic as well and a wonderful choice to play the girls father  one of the biggest issues that this movie has is the dialogue this is not the strong suit here no matter which actor is doing the best they can with the script they are given there are only a handful of times it doesnt come off as forceful and being there only to drive the story forward rather than allow us to connect with the characters the choice that damsel makes to have the dragon breath fire as well as what appears to be molten lava at the same time is a strange one it brings something unique to the movie that we dont often see but it doesnt exactly look good in fact the cg overall isnt the best now we did see it on the big screen in a theater so it is sure to look better on a small screen while streaming at home  at the same time the dragon mostly looks really good however there are few moments where it misses the mark the overall design is unique and very very cool but we cant help but think they gave us too much of her when something that is supposed to be scary is shown less often and only alluded to in the shadows it tends to be more effective still her part of the story is incredible and brings a lot of heart to damsel damsel turns the average fairytale on its head as we see elodie face her fears and put everything she has into her survival at the same time she is strong willed where it matters plotting to expose those who have done her wrong and enact revenge on them during the third act there is a major reveal that elevates the film to a whole new level should they have shied away from this the movie would not work nearly as well as it does this movie is inspiring and is sure to be a treat for young women who have a lot to learn from it millie bobby brown commands attention and is able to carry the film while she is alone on screen which is most of the time her supporting cast does exactly that supports her in ways that help this movie to become something special a dutiful damsel agrees to marry a handsome prince only to find the royal family has recruited her as a sacrifice to repay an ancient debt thrown into a cave with a firebreathing dragon she must rely on her wits and will to survive tessa smith is a rotten tomatoes tomatometerapproved film and tv critic she is also a freelance writer tessa has been in the entertainment writing business for ten years and is a member of several critics associations including the critics choice association and the greater western new york film critics association
Mar 8 2024,negative, imagine if you will a movie whose first half rehashes every convention of the modern suburban horror film and whose final act plays like an unholy marriage of hellbound hellraiser ii and pixars inside out which gets numerous shoutouts in the dialogue well you dont have to imagine it because its not an imaginary film its a film called imaginary if that was a little convoluted well its an appropriate way to introduce a review of imaginary which isnt quite as overcomplicated as director jeff wadlows previous fantasy island though it comes close this is another one of those horror films in which the characters spend so much time discussing and explaining whats going on its surprising they have time to be scared by it early on were introduced to a character who is disparagingly referred to as old bag patterson whose name is actually gloria betty buckleybetty buckley but who should perhaps instead be called old lady exposition because her only real function is to spend many minutes explicating both the domestic and supernatural background of whats plaguing imaginarys central family in a setup rather similar to that of blumhouses previous and says i underappreciated night swim a brood consisting of mom dad sullen and resentful teenage daughter and a younger child arrive at their new house where bad stuff awaits below ground in this case its childrens book authorillustrator jessica dewanda wise moving into her childhood home with new husband max tom payne and his kids taylor taegen burns and little alice pyper braun his former wife apparently did something bad to alice that has left her with burn scars on one arm though thats one of the only things the movie neglects to explain in great detail and speaking of burn scars that house is on elm street in springwood a nightmare on elm street reference eliciting comparisons that do imaginary no favors instead of a razored glove in the furnace alice discovers in the basement a teddy bear that calls itself chauncey though only to her in a voice only she can hear anyone sitting down to watch this movie will know that the imaginary friend conversing with alice through chauncey is a malevolent spirit and a prologue nightmare scene establishes that jessica has a history with it as well indeed even though jessica claims her memories of growing up are happy ones the fact that her mother died when she was very young and her father is blind severely troubled and confined to a nursing home make it obvious shes carrying some heavy psychological baggage which will come to the fore as chaunceys influence on alice becomes increasingly pernicious pretty much everything about imaginary in fact is obvious theres very little here that cant be predicted once the basics are established and the details are familiar from the dozens of haunted houseobject movies that have come out over the last couple of decades wadlow stages a number of lowimpact jump scares and some of the dialogue is unintentionally risible in particular a psychiatrists query has alice taken up any hobbies lately ventriloquism bids to become this months he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died this line comes up after an encounter that proves to be not quite what it seems in a twist that only serves to confuse matters and is one of several moments where imaginary tries to be too tricky for its own good the idea of a childs beloved plaything going bad was done with much more panache and awareness in blumhouses previous m3gan and the characters are either walking collections of neuroses or functional pawns in the overly busy plot max in particular who could have been a catalyst for some dramatic story turns is particularly uninteresting and its no surprise when the movie abandons and forgets about him in the second half eventually imaginary gets to that protracted climax in a netherworld thats both elaborate and underimagined and based on what has come before it wont surprise any viewer that wadlow and co drop a couple of false endings on the way to the closing credits those credits include one for a cultural awareness producer who might have done well to make imaginarys creators aware that too much of their film has been seen many times before
Mar 8 2024,negative, the curse of bridge hollow and fantasy island director jeff wadlows imaginary adheres to the timehonored tradition of transforming makebelieve childhood pals into sinister manifestations that torment their abandoners here a cuddly teddy bear named chauncey harbors dangerous resentment for being forgotten igniting a wave of terror for an unsuspecting family if only that terror extended to the audience experience a cold open teases the monstrous imaginary friend via nightmare sequence before introducing the central family unit jessica dewanda wise along with her husband tom payne and stepchildren taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun relocate from their hectic new orleans apartment to jessicas childhood home in the suburbs typical growing pains and adjusting to a new town are compounded by dark family histories then alice finds a cute teddy bear named chauncey in the basement which will force jessica to confront painful memories when alice starts behaving strangely wadlow who cowrote the script with jason oremland and greg erb adheres to the welltrodden path of a young child falling under the sway of their mysterious new friend complete with familiar scare tactics save for one fakeout moment executed by braun the scares fall flat here the musical stingers are largely absent and without any tightening of tension the punchlines induce incredulity instead of goosebumps and that extends to the plot too dewanda wise earns easy rooting interest for infusing jessica with unwavering empathy no matter the trials and tribulations that imaginary throws at her or rather forces upon her the friction between taylor and jessica is a manufactured focal point but most characters arent fleshed out enough to earn the same interest taegen burns is relegated to archetypical rebellious teen the contrivances to get jessicas husband out of the equation are absurd and pyper braun maintains a precocious spirit even when alice is nothing more than a plot prop the worst is that imaginary delegates the unenviable task of wacky exposition delivery to betty buckley as the crazed neighbor who knows far more about jessicas family than she should not even buckleys talents can make her character arc work the plot only grows more preposterous as the runtime wears on which can feel sluggish with the scares so scarce where imaginary does shine though is in its commitment to doing as much as possible practically chauncey the bear displays many emotions through articulated animatronics brought to life by the awardwinning sfx house spectral motion even chaunceys more monstrous iterations like the chauncey beast preys dane diliegro give the central cast plenty to work with in the third acts venture into the never ever more than just a familiar entry in horror imaginary is the type of silly that doesnt even work on a gateway horror level the protagonists adult worries and themes of mental illness are in stark contrast to the adorable chauncey and his childlike nature the stakes feel low the scares are too toothless and the plotting feels more algorithmbased than organic worst of all though is the way imaginary squanders the creative potential in its approach to the limitless concept of imagination despite the dialogue constantly reinforcing the boundless creativity of its heroine imaginary is rather low on imagination of its own instead opting to chart a safe course filled with familiar tropes and scare trappings horror journalist rt top critic and critics choice association member cohost of the bloody

Mar 8 2024,neutral, a broken family struggling to accept a new also broken member a vaguely creepy old toy an old house that creaks regularly a forgotten past a soundtrack filled with whispers a mysterious older lady with insight into the supernatural nearly every element of imaginary the latest pg13 hopeful horror hit from blumhouse has been handed down from other films this is of course by design while the film was directed by jeff wadlow and cowritten by wadlow greg erb and jason oremland the real auteur here is production company honcho jason blum blum has been one of the most successful producers in recent years churning out lowtomidbudget horror films with clockwork regularity the studio made its name off critically acclaimed box office successes like paranormal activity whiplash and get out but its failures are perhaps more numerous truth or dare fantasy island firestarter the lazarus effect and on and on while the studio has made its fair share of sequels  franchises the purge and paranormal activity were birthed and nurtured here  imaginary feels like an attempt to recreate the start of a franchise that didnt start in the house of blum james wans insidious imaginary follows the insidious template to a tee a family moves into a new house  in this case father max tom payne is moving his two girls taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun to the childhood home of his new wife jessica dewanda wise the girls mother alix angelis had some sort of mental break leaving alice with terrible scarring on her arm jessica only wants to be a good stepmother to the girls as her father suffered a similar break when she was a child when alice finds an old stuffed bear in the basement of her new home she starts talking to it like an imaginary friend and goes on a scavenger hunt for items it suggests things start innocently enough with alice asking for a piece of paper or something happy but she says chauncey the bears name doesnt want anyone else to see the list and the more items alice collects the more dangerous the tasks become when jessica catches alice trying to hurt herself with a rusty nail she calls the girls psychologist who discovers that alices imaginary friend might not be so imaginary after all and may even have a connection to jessica herself now jessica has to face her deepest fears and repressed memories if she wants to save alice from chauncey  the idea of a malevolent spirit posing as a childs imaginary friend in the body of an old stuffed bear is just ridiculous enough for audiences to expect something slightly campy imaginary is in on the joke at least a bit but unlike films like childs play or m3gan it never leads with humor nor does it ever try to make chauncey the lead character but the films pg13 rating renders it toothless on the horror front with wadlow aping the tensionfilled panandscare technique wan perfected in the conjuring for nearly every single one of the films attempts at jump scares instead of making the film scary this technique makes it fun signaling to the audience that something scary is going to happen at the exact second you think it will being fun is certainly a noble goal for a pg13 film to shoot for but even childrens horror films have more genuine frights in store for their intended audience than this insidious may have had that rating as well but that film had an almost oppressively spooky atmosphere that aided its numerous shocking successful scares imaginary on the other hand contents itself with sticking to triedandtrue formulas wherever it can to its detriment as a piece of horror cinema the one place where the film does latch onto some actual horror is in the fantastically creepycrawly creature design a faceless figure creepily blends in with the background of several scenes and chaunceys full form is a terrifically tactile monstrously deformed bearlike thing that genuinely feels like the monster you imagined under your bed as a kid we finally see this in the films last act which significantly raises the stakes in several ways when described the premise of the finale sounds bonkers but it doesnt actually play that way given the influences wadlow and crew have shamelessly exploited throughout its not difficult to figure out where the film will go and once it gets there it leaves a lot to be desired the screenplay has some wild ideas and wadlow and the production design team come up with some fun visuals but no one involved had the guts to follow through on the wildness of the concept instead of leaning in and giving the audience something that would be genuinely trippy and new the screenplay barely scratches the surface of its own idea settling for a straightforward horrorfantasy final boss battle that works on the level of character and theme but feels like a letdown for how utterly standard it is such is the ultimate failure of imaginary for a film about imagination it doesnt have nearly enough of its own thankfully it does have other things that make it worth watching wise builds a believable rapport with burns and braun the latter of whom gives an outstanding performance that never tips too far into child actor cliché jessica is also one of the more intelligent resourceful horror heroines in recent memory with wise giving her a strong core of decency even as shes pushed to the end of her rope the dialogue shes saddled with cant be helped although not many actors could put over this films most ridiculous lines while laid on a bit thick the films ultimate message about love and family does shine through because of the performances the aforementioned jump scare moments may not be scary but they do have a sense of fun to them when combined with the occasional glimpses of campiness its almost enough to trick you into thinking the film is better than it actually is dont fall for it imaginary may be enjoyable but that doesnt mean its great
Mar 8 2024,negative, growing up many kids find solace in having an imaginary friend traditionally this is seen as a positive aspect of childhood development fostering social skills creativity and more however for those with a penchant for horror like myself the notion of an imaginary friend often invokes unease and fear films such as poltergeist z and the exorcist exemplify this portraying imaginary friends as harbingers of dread rather than companionship in imaginary 2024 the newest film from director jeff wadlow truth or dare fantasy island the familiar concept of an imaginary friend embodied in the form of a teddy bear receives a fresh twist in an attempt to distinguish itself from its contemporaries does wadlow and his team manage to deliver a memorable horror flick unfortunately even with the addition of an adorable teddy bear this film fails to leave a lasting impression to keep spoilers to a minimum here is the official movie synopsis when jessica dewanda wise moves back into her childhood home with her family her youngest stepdaughter pyper braun develops an eerie attachment to a stuffed bear named chauncey she finds in the basement alice starts playing games with chauncey that begin playfully and become increasingly sinister as alices behavior becomes more and more concerning jessica tries to intervene only she realizes chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be who isnt a sucker for a horror film featuring childhood toys and cuddly plushies certainly not me just take a look at what happened with five nights at freddys though it benefited from being an established ip the premise of murderous stuffed animatronics propelled it to become the highestgrossing horror film of 2023 theres something to say about horror films that exploit the innocence of childrens toysexperiences by turning them into the most unexpected source of danger imaginary 2024 presents a solid premise by initially exploring how an imaginary friend can serve as a coping mechanism for trauma the potential to delve into the complexities of trauma and its terrifying manifestations is evident particularly with jessica navigating the role of stepmother to two girls in her old memoryladen home however rather than refining this narrative and allowing it to unfold organically before introducing horror elements the writing team comprised of wadlow greg erb and jason oremland chose to divert attention towards numerous inconsequential plot points detracting from the films overall coherence this caused the film to feel disjointed with too many weak threads of narrative and little substance to support them for example writing in characters that dont offer much to the story alix angelis who plays samantha the biological mother to alice and taylor is reduced to a mere caricature of a woman confined to a psychiatric ward that she escapes for unspecified actions against her children theres an absence of further exploration or context provided leaving her portrayal as nothing more than a stereotype of mental illness furthermore the husband portrayed by tom payne the walking dead appeared somewhat pointless paynes character primarily serves as a passive presence he offers little more than positive affirmation to jessica before conveniently departing to go on tour while he and samantha may only be background characters they still provide insight into the family dynamics their lack of substantial involvement felt like a missed opportunity despite its writing and character development shortcomings imaginary 2024 showcases several notable strengths pyper braun in particular delivers a standout performance as alice demonstrating remarkable acting prowess that is bound to set her up for success alongside pyper taegan burns impresses as the older sister skillfully balancing teenage angst with emotional depth dewanda wise as jessica stands out as one of the films more solid performances offering an open heart while standing strong in her convictions lastly betty buckley who plays gloria jessicas nosy neighbor adds a compelling layer of intrigue the film also boasts impressive practical effects particularly in portraying the teddy bear seamlessly transitioning it from a benign toy to a menacing and lethal entity moreover the tension is expertly built up through the use of the entity outside of chauncey furthermore wadlows evident passion for the horror genre shines through in the films nods intentionally or not such as the exorcist and insidious imaginary 2024 presents a fun concept with a unique twist but ultimately falls short due to an overcrowded narrative with too many competing storylines trying to cuddle up to the spotlight the film lacks focus had the writers streamlined their approach and concentrated on one or two central plotlines the result would have been a much stronger and cohesive film this missed opportunity prevents imaginary 2024 from finding its place in the toy chest of the best horror toy films and instead leaves it scattered among the clutter of competing narratives imaginary 2024 presents a fun concept with a unique twist

Mar 8 2024,positive,seasoned genre fans may not be terrified but the film offers enough chills  thrills to make this perfect gateway horror
Mar 8 2024,negative, unseen entities befriending and manipulating children are a triedandtrue pairing within the horror genre with this pairing comes a certain expectation of tropes but there is always room for exploration and experimentation today experimentation is more often rewarded than lauded regarding the familiar this is part of why imaginary 2024 proves more disappointing than not lacking the imagination its premise should thrive on the latest from writerdirector jeff wadlow does little to step outside the safe confines of the metaphorical sandbox starring dewanda wise tom payne taegen burns pyper braun veronica falcon and betty buckley imaginary 2024 starts with a horrifying opener that highlights the horrific potential buried deep within the heart of the film this nightmare reveals jessicas dewanda wise anxieties about returning to her childhood home with her new family theres unresolved trauma there but with little memory of what happened theres not much she can do but move forward moving forward is also at the forefront of her stepdaughter alices pyper braun mind lonely and riddled with burn scars this imaginative young girl wants a friend conveniently mysterious voices lure her to the homes basement where she meets her new imaginary friend chauncey at first things start innocently enough but chaunceys hold on the girl takes a progressively sinister turn with one scene highlighting a taste of what this imaginary friend can wreak if left off its leash on paper imaginary 2024 has potential the plot is familiar enough for casual and hardcore horror fans alike to at least think you know what youre getting into this is where youd be wrong wadlow and screenwriters greg erb and jason oremland throw everything but the kitchen sink into the script from a brief glimpse of a mentally ill mother to an itsallinhermind subplot to a barely touched upon exploration of the never ever the plot features so many different distractions that youd think alice herself concocted the tale childlike distractability and all  these multiple story points remove any definitive identity to imaginary 2024 even with its memorable chauncey plush it is as if the writers threw darts at a board hoping one thing would stick before moving to the next its a shame because there are elements of the screenplay that showed potential for further explanation chaunceys possessiveness over alice manifests itself in one of the films most memorable game of catandmouse theres also the never ever which offered the films most exciting forays into the unknown far too late in the story for what it is worth the cast tries their best with the material provided dewanda wise is sympathetic as the stepmother trying to reconcile with her fuzzy past and parent her increasingly troublesome stepdaughters pyper braun checks the box of creepy little girl well here giving the willies as chaunceys hold over her alice grows tighter the material and direction falter a bit further with betty buckleys friendly neighbor who has the devils task of delivering the bulk of the films expositional bits more theatrical in delivery than likely required buckley renders more awkward laughs than not with her performance  what lifts imaginary 2024 is its embrace of the practical particularly in the never ever the puppeteering of chauncey does so much with so little a simple turn of the head a change of facial expression or even when chauncey levels up in a giant rawrworthy suit still worthy of boops immerses the audience in the world  the same can be said for the never ever while the design is reminiscent of films like insidious and jim hensons labyrinth a whimsy hints at the children likely trapped within the clouds on the ceiling flash with lightning the multiple different doors a randomly appearing puppy from nowhere it all comes together to flesh out this strange world chauncey calls home unfortunately neither the audience nor the characters spend enough time there to learn never evers secrets  it is hard to say whether wadlow and co were afraid to lean into the more campy elements of chaunceys murderous being the potential was there to go further with little pockets of horror to give us a taste of what could have been unfortunately by doing too much and accomplishing too little all at once imaginary 2024 will make others want to imagine a whole other adventure once the credits roll
Mar 8 2024,negative, with a similar elevator pitch and budget as m3gan jeff wadlows imaginary is clearly striving to become 2024s pg13 horror darling about an evil childrens doll wreaking havoc on a family already in a state of metamorphosis regrettably the filmmakers here have completely abandoned the archness of tone and shades of camp that made m3gan such an entertaining if ultimately inconsequential experience in place of that films knowing playfulness is an overwrought family drama thats as undercooked as it is painfully familiar the blended family at the center of imaginary consists of comic book artist jessica dewanda wise her new husband max tom payne and his two kids from a previous marriage taylor taegen burns and alice pyper braun while moody edgy teenager taylor constantly gives jessica the cold shoulder alicemuch to her big sisters chagrinhas started to warm up to her stepmom the stress caused by this dynamic continues to percolate as the family moves into jessicas childhood home which jessica thinks of as her happy place despite repeatedly saying that she has no memories of the first five years of her life she spent there when the film isnt busy serving up one solemn shoddily scripted scene after another revolving around jessica struggling to make headway with taylor it follows alice as she befriends an old stuffed bear named chauncey which she foundwhere elsetucked away in the deepest corners of her new homes basement soon chauncey starts talking to alice convincing her to play increasingly ridiculous and dangerous games that threaten the lives of others including the hunky neighbor matthew sato that taylor has set her sights on and its right around here that imaginary starts begging for a more well imaginative approach to the material somehow this film about an imaginary friend in the form of a teddy bear never thinks to lean into the blatant silliness that its premise invites it instead remains a frustratingly dour and humorless affair expecting the audience to find chauncey and the scenario frightening without bothering to deliver a single scare or even set a discernibly creepy mood  this misjudgment in tone leads to several unintentionally funny scenes such as when after hearing chauncey speak without alices lips moving the young girls therapist veronica falcón asks alice if her stepdaughter has taken up any new hobbies like ventriloquism its a moment obviously ripe for humor but the film plays it completely straight even doubling down on its selfseriousness right after with a twist thats as inane as it is telegraphed as alices behavior becomes more and more erratic and jessica begins to slowly recall her childhood trauma including her own former attachment to the doll imaginary shifts gears taking the audience into a more fantastical realm the opportunities for mindwarping visuals or at least something remotely offbeat are aplenty during this stretch yet this imaginary world is as dull and colorless as the one its characters are whisked away from drowned in monochromatic blues and flat monotonous cgi every step of the way this is a film that desperately wants to capture both the potentially vitalizing and perilous powers of imagination which makes it all the more surprising just how sterile and uninspired it is
Mar 7 2024,negative,maybe if your tweens are having a sleepover this could keep them quiet but everyone else will likely want to close their eyes and imagine theyre watching a better movie
Mar 6 2024,negative, given that the promotional material for imaginary has highlighted a certain stuffed teddy bear one would be right in assuming that the film  boasting its from the studio that brought us five nights at freddys and m3gan  would be taking inspiration from those two successful properties  unfortunately despite such promise a committed turn from the deservesbetter dewanda wise and the occasional inviting visual jeff wadlows supernaturallyinclined horror outing is light on both scares and ironically imagination at the centre of the supposed terror is jessica wise a childrens illustrator whos continually plagued by nightmares  hoping that surrounding herself in her happy place  her childhood home  will fix these night terrors jessicas integration as a stepmother to her husbands two children taegen burns as moody teen taylor and pyper braun as the young alice is all the stress she can handle and initially bringing her new family into the environment where she grew up seems to mend a few issues at least on the surface but when young alice finds a stuffed bear at the premises wadlows narrative  written in partnership with greg erb the princess and the frog and jason oremland playmobil the movie  moves in predictable circles as the bear named chauncey manifests itself as an imaginary friend for young alice and soon things are going bump in the night and jessicas own nightmares come to light as she has to face the darkness in order to save her family  ultimately its nothing the insidious series hasnt already attempted as a horror film imaginary sadly barely registers but its penchant for physical effects its story touching on dementia loss and guilt and the continual commitment of wise allow the film which thankfully never overstays its welcome at 104 minutes to not entirely be put to bed  the genre deserves better and the trope of the expositionheavy neighbour can entirely be laid to rest but small wins are ultimately what imaginary has to cling to as its an alltoofamiliar effort that cant escape its clear poltergeist inspiration the films final third is quite the bonkers turn of events and though its climactic moments are its most liveliest to some it may be too little too late and to others perhaps too silly to be deemed an appropriate scare this seeming need to cater the genre to younger audiences sadly undoes any horrific potential this story has and theres definitely some nuggets of unsettling promise there a story that deserves a better execution imaginary is more the afterthought of a power nap than anything deeply rooted in a nightmarish slumber  the tweens may find themselves enjoying the telegraphed scares but genre appreciators will wait for an afterdark viewing film critic with a penchant for dwayne johnson jason momoa michelle pfeiffer and horror movies harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news
