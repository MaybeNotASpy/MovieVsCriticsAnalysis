Apr 12 2024,positive,well it was awesome 1010
Apr 10 2024,negative,tom hardy and venoms relationship where the best part and tom hardy himself everything else was pretty bang average and empty doesnt hold up as enjoyed my 1st viewing much more
Apr 7 2024,negative,while venom is much better than he was in spiderman 3 this movie is overall worse
Apr 6 2024,neutral,its overhated its not a terrible film but its not something that can be taken too seriously
Mar 30 2024,positive,its a good movie to watch  sound effects are stunning
Mar 29 2024,positive,i very much like this movie and seeing a big budget movie about venom the cgi is revolutionary and i think it holds up to the cgi of the transformers tom hardys acting is top notch and i love how crazy this movie can get venom eating literal soldiers firing like ak47s and smgs at him riot is an absolute perfect villain even though it isnt carnage and the fight in the end is perfect in total i think a movie about venom was well deserved and the payoff is amazing
Mar 29 2024,positive,tom hardy delivers a funny eddie brock and venom buddycop with stunning fights and a perfect story plus a great emenem song
Mar 28 2024,positive,i like how they made the designs this movie is pretty good and even if they do make a bad movie i can understand that venom is kind of hard to make a plot about
Mar 27 2024,positive,75100  a good film love tom hardys acting better fight scenes in the first film than the sequel
Mar 22 2024,positive,this masterpiece is one of my favorite movies of all time
Mar 16 2024,positive,fun movie i like the idea of the lethal protector type of venom
Mar 16 2024,negative,this has to be the most mediocre film that is spiderman related its just bad could of been better
Mar 10 2024,negative,i was so excited to watch the movie until i actually watched it the acting is quite mediocre and the funny scenes are tacky i dont know whether they rushed to meet deadlines but the film wasnt thoroughly planned the venom in spiderman 3 was far more convincing and entertaining in my opinion i think they should have tried a series instead of a movie and with a bigger budget to get grade a actors they should have made something similar to the tv series the strain where this simbiote keeps on infecting high profile figures and causing them to wreck all havoc
Feb 27 2024,negative,venom is a disappointing film it is about a failed reporter is bonded to an alien entity tom hardy and michelle williams give horrible performances the screenplay is badly written ruben fleischer did a terrible job directing this movie i was not impressed with this motion picture
Feb 20 2024,positive,i am not a real marvel movie kindbut i liked this one a whole lotwell acted some parts are iffy but i think it deserves 4 stars dont judge it on one watchi like it the more i saw it
Feb 19 2024,positive,exactly what is needed for a first venom film
Feb 17 2024,positive,its great to see a beloved character have some fun but the pacing is very stretched out as the film struggles to make due with a lack of action budget compared to the mcudisney hardy can be charming but often comes off as cartoonish the other actors are worse the villain is forgetable
Feb 15 2024,positive,the critics are wrong about this one im not sure what they think makes a good movie but sometimes breaking the rules isnt a bad thing
Feb 14 2024,positive,well that was one great start for a fresh franchise just wish they would have continued on that way with the second movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,rotten tomatoes critics are crazy as fu3k just being honest when you saw spectacular movie 30 wtf are you crazy
Feb 14 2024,positive,great movie good twist on the origins of a character funny as well as lots of action
Feb 14 2024,positive,words can not describe how much i love this movie so much venom is a great character action is amazing
Feb 13 2024,positive,really fun and enjoyable and tom hardys acting was outstanding i loved michelle williams in this and the voice actor for venom and riot was really good cgi is amazing and this is so overhated cant wait for carnage
Feb 8 2024,negative,pretty terrible actually the only reason people like it is because of venom and tom hardy if any other character had a movie with a similar script it would fail miserably
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was a fairly standard movie tom hardy was fantastic as both eddie brock and venom the action sequences were great and a fairly standard story i just wish it was rated r
Jan 31 2024,negative,very bland and just dumb this movie has one of the worst villains created venom needs to have spiderman in his origin even if they went the ultimate spiderman route it would have been better
Jan 27 2024,positive,though very flawed venom is a wildly fun and entertaining film filled with violence and plenty of funny antics between eddie and venom as well as other characters  while still being a pg13 film venom is a great experience to watch if you just want to shut your brain off and enjoy the show but if your looking for something deep i would suggest looking elsewhere
Jan 25 2024,positive,a messy goofy and extremely entertaining ride
Jan 17 2024,positive,loved it when it was still in theaters and still love it now
Jan 16 2024,positive,we dont actually see venom until nearly an hour into the movie that first act is loooooong
Jan 15 2024,positive,will watch anything with tom hardy in it  not keen on comic book movies nor monster movies but this is entertaining because of tom and because the movie does not take it too seriously some very cute comedy comes through to relieve the basic stupidness of the story line  good for a wet afternoons entertainment  without tom it would be unwatchable  so give it a go have fun
Jan 6 2024,positive,venom was an oddball mess of a movie and origin story but at the same time oddly captivating to watch what was supposed to be another runofthemill origin story wound up being an odd couple comedy flick with a romance not between a guy and a girl but a guy and his symbiote venom might not be your prototypical superhero and this might not be your average origin story but i still find myself attracted to a movie that wound up being something oddly wholesome
Jan 5 2024,negative,the movie cant decide what the arcs of the any of the characters are supposed to be but thats probably the result of making cuts to appease a more box office friendly pg13 rating ultimately the movies greatest sin is how boring it is
Jan 5 2024,negative,honestly i thought this movie was pretty solid at first but after thinking about it this movie is pretty ass although morbuis is worse overall i would give it a 410
Dec 19 2023,positive,venom amid the wave of superhero films doesnt bring anything particularly new or gamechanging to the table some argue this film may not need to exist but it does due to corporate reasons resulting in a good yet average movie tom hardys acting is a highlight making the main protagonist enjoyable although fans of the comic book character might not fully appreciate this rendition the dynamic between the main character and the symbiote inside him creates a fun duo on screen throughout the runtime michelle williams is notably lackluster possibly due to script limitations rather than her acting ability riz ahmed plays a generic superhero villain meeting expectations the story takes a while to get going but once it does it delivers the actionpacked superhero experience promised overall as a success for sonys objectives it hits the mark but comic book enthusiasts may find this unnecessary film less appealing
Dec 7 2023,positive,action filled and enjoyable and entertaining what a dc film should be 
Dec 4 2023,positive,tom hardy is awesome
Dec 3 2023,negative,eating ants or sleeping naked outside is better
Nov 23 2023,positive,this movie is really funny its got great humor great action great acting great everything the swear words are timed perfectly and venom sounds amazing you will love this film
Nov 13 2023,negative,terrible pointless and a futile experience  a venom store which has nothing to do with spiderman is proof sony has no concept about what they are doing     why cant they just get overthemsevles and write this kind of story with characters that matter in the mcu instead of doing some like making joker with no batman       the characters primary motivation doesnt exist so its not actually the character
Nov 11 2023,positive,cant believe critics did this movie so dirty so much better than the modern corny marvel movies we see nowadays this movie was exiting quirkyfunny and kept me in it the whole time so great to see this representation of venom as a more  multidimensional character and how he coexhausts with eddie we need to find the critics who shunned this movie and make them pay venom style i literally only signed up to give this movie 5 stars
Nov 3 2023,positive,look i know that many people say that venom from 2018 is bad and i have to respect that i saw it in the cinema and i loved it and it was not just me but also friends and family i just want them to know that the movie is not bad at all
Oct 31 2023,positive,very cool movie i was worried it wasnt going to be any good but it was worth the watch
Oct 30 2023,positive,one of the funniest movies ive ever seen it is dark in places but at its heart it is just a buddy comedy about a boy and his alien
Oct 30 2023,negative,it was doable but thats just about it
Oct 22 2023,positive,not bad for an attempt on shedding some light on the character after sam raimis spiderman 3
Oct 22 2023,neutral,if not for tom hardy this movie would be blah  michelle getting cast as his partner was the biggest mistake they did not seem comfortable being a couple because of her and i dont think shes a good actress or else she couldve did a better job pretending i mean could you not even fake being attracted to tom hardy i just couldnt get past them being a couple in the film whoever played jack should never work as an actor again i mean he just sucked where did they find him
Oct 20 2023,positive,first off the big bad con here is the messy dumb plot but tom hardys eddie and venoms chemistry the action and the hilarious silliness make it a much more fun ride than its plot deserves
Oct 19 2023,positive,great movie highly recommended a 
Oct 15 2023,positive,the dumb absurdity of the movie is too fun to ignore everyone is aware its stupid but its too fun it causes me to resist the critical factor not every superhero movie is spiderverse bust not every movie is howard the duck this simply refuses to be either
Oct 9 2023,positive,expected it to be a great start to a venom saga however its not how it couldve been more of a slowburner venom is more of a comedian than a menacing villainantihero that makes you realize why it is an overpowered menace that can end heros like peter parkers spider man with ease but some of the venom quotes were straight out of the comics which were great to hear so many missed opportunity that wouldve made it at least a 71 movie
Oct 6 2023,positive,venom 1 is a amazing start to a possibly amazing new cinematic spiderman villain universe
Oct 5 2023,positive,sony pictures and marvel present their first solo movie of arguably the greatest comic book character of all time the character was introduced in the comics in the early 1980s and considered one of spidermans best villains he was a badass jock type alien organism that bonded with a human host the film wastes no time establishing the characters origins as a space shuttle returns to earth carrying with it an alien organism the organism latches onto several hosts making its way to san francisco this is where tom hardy as eddie brock resides hes a reporter for the citys paper digging into the lives of people as a social justice warrior covering the homeless epidemic to the tech companies he lives with his girlfriend anne weying played by michelle williams his latest assignment is carlton drake played by riz ahmed whos company the life foundation is dedicated to finding resources in outer space since he feels earth has been ravaged to the brink of collapse eddie ends up getting fired going above and beyond and while looking into the companys true nature involving human experiments thanks to a scientist named dora skirth played by jenny slate the alien organism latches onto him it perfectly bonds with eddie making him stronger faster more agile and giving him a black bulky appearance with razor sharp teeth this symbiote is named venom reminding eddie that he needs to feed on humans constantly otherwise eddies internal organs will serve as substitute sustenance of course drake has other plans wanting the symbiote for himself and he doesnt care who gets in his way or how many test subjects he goes through to get it eddie is in a constant battle with this alien organism as he is being hunted while also struggling to reconnect with anne 5 years later and this was way more fun than i thought it would be im glad the filmmakers and director ruben fleischer stay true to the comics mainly with the symbiotes biology of being hurt by ultraviolet heat and sonic vibrations the movie itself is not bad the only issue i has was it just too short even at an hour and 52 min hardy even admitted he was sad they cut 40 min out the humor is actually good next to the intense action scenes theres so much excitement explosions and i love the sound mixing theres even a few references for fans and a mid credits scene that perfectly sets up whats to come theres also the eddie brocksymbiote relationship is the true highlight to me it feels like a throwback to those 90s buddy flicks despite it not getting loved by critics it still broke october box office records so many people hated what sam raimi did to the character in spiderman 3 even though i still love that trilogy so much here the movie is based more on the lethal protector series with venom as an antihero as mentioned before tom hardys performance is the best part of him as eddie and the symbiote and we do get some decent laughs ive actually never heard of riot from the comics and it turns out there are dozens of other symbiotes the tone might be all over the place for some and is pretty disjointed but this is still very entertaining and fun to watch they might have something here if they play their cards right 
Oct 1 2023,negative,this movie spends too much time building uninteresting characters when all i want to see is eddie and venom but when they are on screen each scene is held back from its full potential because the filmmakers were unable to commit to an r rating was it a good studio choice im not sure but logan and deadpool were successful so why does venom get the short end of the stick
Sep 27 2023,positive,coolest movie in the flunken universe
Sep 20 2023,negative,like a turd in the wind
Sep 20 2023,positive,eddie brock and venoms backandforth is almost enough to carry this film on its shoulders but the burden gets to be a lot the entire first half of the movie is a boring slog and just when things start getting good they start wrapping up the film lacks a wellrounded cast of solid characters relying on tom hardy to pull more than his share of the weight he does a fantastic job proving his strengths lie in the completely deranged moments its fun to see venom on the big screen in his own movie but since hes only present for maybe half the film that diminishes the fun
Sep 17 2023,positive,you will never get wrong with marvels effects but the story are all typical
Sep 5 2023,neutral,what a mess the editng is terrible here tone wise while it does eventually start following a focused narrative on eddie it is all over the place tone wise this cant decide if it wants to be a gritty nolan style super hero film a marvel comedy or a horror movie and never makes them work together in fact it feels like the 3 are fighting each other more and more as the film goes on that it becomes so confusing this leads to subpar cinematography while the first 15 minutes is well shot charming and this is creative it is all over the place camerawork wise this has no consistent style to it the venom fight at the end almost feels like its from a completely different movie half the movie is dark at night and oversaturated with cgi that is shotty and this filled with some just bizarre scenes with marvel style humor the worst part is a lot of scenes im honestly not sure if there meant to be funny or not because the film is shot like nolan and its settings and tone is gritty and serious but than does weird tom green almost like humor also stupid scene where she uses the mri to get venom out of him and doesnt finish it off beyond stupid choice and the flashbangs i dont understand why they dont affect venom either the music is ok and kind of messy with lots of different styles that never really work together the acting is ok overall hardy is decent and the best thing in this giving a bizarre performance at times hes pretty likeable the first 15 minutes but it just goes all over the place from there the supporting cast is just ok and is super forgettable and disappears behind all the crazy antics and tone problems in this the worst part is the villian who is so laughably out of place and a terrible villian overall that i laughed at more than was ever intimidated this all leads to subpar pacing as this just feels like it goes off the rails in such a short runtime with over 20 minutes of credits this feels like its way longer than 90 minutes its a shame because this starts out good but the more it goes on the more every scene just is wiieghed down by something that bogs a scene down or makes it distracting or out of place i seriously cant recommend this except for die hard hardy fans or super hardcore venom fans everyone else should skip this
Sep 4 2023,positive,awesomesuper underrated unmissable
Sep 3 2023,positive,it was slily movie about a villan who became a antihero and it does have creepy and jumpworthy scences best for teens but other than that the plot the action scences and the cast are so great that even if you do not like the movies plot you must at least see what columbia pictures did to make this movie please watch this flim i love it 55 just be mindful of the vilonce and swearing you can watch this movie right now on disney plus or vudu or apple tv or prime video or on dvd bluray and 4k ulitra hd bluray disc
Aug 27 2023,positive,i thought this movie was awesomeit was really cool to see the origin story of venomtom hardys performance as eddie brock was amazingi would definitely recommend this movie
Aug 16 2023,positive,the movie is very generic but its pretty enjoyable
Aug 16 2023,negative,there are some funny jokes and cool scenes but the good comes to an end  the villain has a dumb plot the cgi is atrocious and even the cool scenes get ruined by those fake human in cgi
Aug 15 2023,positive,for any sony or spiderman fans like myself i recommend this one very funny watch
Aug 14 2023,negative,i have three words for this movie boring stupid forgettable do yourself a favor and skip this movie its bad
Aug 9 2023,negative,venom is a blast but beyond that its just another bad attempt at making another movie about our favorite symbiote
Aug 5 2023,positive,another example of how acclaimed critics are so disconnected with the general audience they simply cant give a high rating to a movie thats just trying to be fun venom is great it wont win any awards but so few action movies do fun and exciting with great effects whats not to like
Aug 5 2023,positive,its a movie with meh plot but the dynamic between venom and eddie brook is so goot that it carry the whole movie on its back
Aug 4 2023,neutral,the cgi is good but having a venom movie without spideerman is hard  the movie was pretty bad looking back at it
Aug 1 2023,positive,i hadnt seen any of the venom movies until 2022 i had heard mixed reviews about the movie so i didnt go into it expecting much especially considering the bland and repetitive nature of marvel movies however i was delighted with venom its action humour and story were genuinely refreshing i particularly enjoyed tom hardys character and his dynamic with venom considering the movie is almost 2 hours long the movie seemed to fly by of course this review needs to be qualified by the fact that it is a superhero movie made to please the masses so dont expect something earthshattering for example amongst other things the cgi is plenty good enough but nothing special although the movie knows what it is and certainly delivers in the areas it needs to overall anyone tired of the state of superhero movie format will be pleasantly surprised by venom and i am looking forward to seeing the next one good job sony
Jul 23 2023,positive,i know its not a spiderman movie but its still really awesome as one of my favorite spiderman villains and how he becomes a anti hero noice 4 stars
Jul 21 2023,positive,michelle williams wig was terrible but everything else was great
Jul 18 2023,negative,the wrost of marvel  really bad actor
Jul 14 2023,neutral,i had a lot of fun with this movie its very dumb and incompetent but i love it for that reason
Jul 11 2023,positive,the lack of spiderman really hurts this movie but its still pretty okay i liked it
Jul 9 2023,negative,such a disappointing movie in my opinion venom is such a cool character and we got this some aspects of this film are cool and entertaining but honestly it was such a letdown
Jul 5 2023,positive,its a witty clever film and presents its star with the opportunity to really show off his acting skills  but tom hardy alone is not enough to make this a memorable tale you want to come back to again and again   the use of spiderman in this film may have helped get the character of venom across more   the two are very much yin and yang of each other and having both on screen would benefit both actors to crate something special   by having the villain be the hero  and then having his only obstacle his own species it doesnt leave much to really build a film around   you feel like this is a grate character trapped in a film where the people handling him  have no idea what to do with him   venom is worth watching but it is sadly very forgettable   its a very interesting character with a lot of personality that could lead to some brilliant films in the future   lets hope by the time we get use to him sticking around in this universe he has at least had a decent story that makes the most of what this character can be
Jul 3 2023,positive,venom may not have been the best marvel movie by sony i still enjoyed it for what it was and tom harrys performance as eddie brockvenom was entertaining 
Jul 1 2023,positive,funny and scary at the same time and the swear words makes the movie funnier  for me
Jun 29 2023,positive,pretty cool         
Jun 29 2023,positive,relly amazing film but the crtics  hate for someresson
Jun 23 2023,positive,watched this movie with low expectations due to what the critics had to say but found it rather entertaining could do with a stronger protagonist and still far from perfect but not as bad as many say imo
Jun 9 2023,positive,so much fun super hilarious and action that never got boring
Jun 8 2023,positive,overrated but still not very good but good
Jun 3 2023,positive,pretty good    tom hardy as eddie brockvenom was entertaining its not a movie that you need to rewatch a bunch of times but its still entertaining
Jun 1 2023,positive,the greatest 01 hour and 52 minutes ever
May 23 2023,negative,lacks acting from actors plot is abysmal writing is copy pasted every scene this movie sucks
May 20 2023,positive,if youre looking for a deep or meaningful story this is not the movie for you however if you just want to have a fun time venom absolutely succeeds the plot is incredibly basic but tom hardys incredible performance as eddie brockvenom keeps the movie entertaining throughout its short run time there are many moments that are just completely insane that manage to somehow come together to make a fun movie
May 17 2023,positive,pretty cool and intense
May 16 2023,positive,a simple superhero comedy dont expect more than a quick laugh some jokes land some not screen play could be more efficient at some times like when the characters are talking and talking and also not saying anything meaningful
May 15 2023,positive,this movie reminded me of the enderman from minecraft and real life he likes to touch me irl regardless eating people is fun 1010 0 complaints sups fun
May 15 2023,negative,a really boring plot for a really cool hero eddie and venoms relationship is just the cutest tho 
May 8 2023,positive,venom is not amazing but its a interesting start to this odd couple
May 8 2023,positive,i appreciate this character and this movie i wish venom would get more love
May 8 2023,positive,i really the relationship developed between venom and eddie
May 7 2023,positive,still probably the best comic book movie sony has put out thats part of there own spiderman universe tom hardy really sells on the acting the comedy is surprisingly good the action although could have been better was still cool the movie is just pure fun and vemom himself is quite an interesting character
May 4 2023,positive,the story may be predictable and messy but i had a lof of fun watching it
May 1 2023,negative,i honestly liked morbius more than this movie its just boring even though it isnt a bad movie i just didnt like it it felt boring and it didnt got me like mcu movies do tom hardy as eddie brockvenom is great thought luckily enough its sequel saved everything for me
Apr 18 2023,positive,venom is a dark maybe overly dark film that does well putting one of spidermans most iconic villains on screen    rating 61
Apr 15 2023,negative,interesting idea but i feel like the movie was only 15 min long maybe its just because i had it playing in the background but i really feel like barely anything happened everything interesting was on tiktok
Apr 7 2023,negative,the film makes no sense it tries to profit from a famous character from other media its characters are rotten and aimless the script is weak and does not hold the audience in the material presented with dull jokes
Apr 3 2023,neutral,venom while being extremely entertaining and tom hardy doing an excellent job as the protagonist it still has an excruciating amount of problems a cobbled together first act occasional questionable cgi and the villain lacking a presence within the film
Mar 28 2023,positive,as soon as he turned into venom who is black the cops instantly shot at him 1010 very good movie very real and i support this kind of stuff
Mar 27 2023,negative,this movie is ok i dont have much to say about it
Mar 27 2023,neutral,as a character it had bags of potential tom hardy as the star great but why the decided to make venom as a comedy style character is bizarre   hopefully the mcu can rectify this mistake with the introduction of venom into secret wars fingers crossed
Mar 27 2023,negative,at least this movie was better than antman and the wasp 2018
Mar 24 2023,positive,its pretty good  i mean its venom after all but it can get very boring and sluggish at times  she venom is a baddie
Mar 22 2023,positive,this movie is so hated when it is actually pretty goodthe relationship with eddie and venom is surprisingly fun and the final battle is awesomethe one problem is that it can be boring at times but whenever venom is on screen it is fun  fine watch 710
Mar 17 2023,positive,this movie feels like it shouldve came out in the 2000s but its decent fun with the relationship of eddie and venom being suprisingly good and fun to watch
Mar 9 2023,positive,a fun watch nothing that amazing but nothing disgusting
Feb 20 2023,positive,loved it super fun and dorky all at the same time plot was weak but it was over way before i wanted it too rotten tomatoes is wrong on this movie
Feb 18 2023,positive,do have a fondness for superhero films venom also had talented people in the cast tom hardy and michelle williams have both done great work in their careers it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting antiheroes in the superhero universe    watched venom with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness as always to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion was aware that it was not well liked by the critics but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked have to agree with those that were left disappointed while also not finding venom to be that bad am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion    venom does have good things it is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between eddie and venom which had fun and tension it is when venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest after too long struggling to invest in the first act the darker elements of the film are actually quite well done having a dark grit and creepiness it looks reasonably good well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere    the music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action especially the car chase sequence some of the effects are terrific tom hardy is intensely charismatic with eddievenom being interesting and well contrasted characters far more believable than topher grace in spiderman 3    however the rest of the cast dont fare so greatly michelle williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a developmentfree plotdevice role riz ahmed is far too anaemic for the onedimensional villain thats both cartoonish and insipid of the characters only eddie and venom engage and intrigue the rest are flat while some of the effects are terrific others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax    it is the script and story where venom fails most the script is really clunky especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced venoms disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing the less too about the soapy and clichéridden scenes featuring hardy and williams the better they are bland and dont serve much point and the life institute scenes should have had more clarity unfortunately these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and taking too long to get going the story is tonally disjointed too many tones that are very variable on their own and dont gel together and very clunky this is not a case of the film not trying to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely for a story intended to be dark and violent this seemed rather tame and held back    summing up a disappointment but not that bad 610 bethany cox
Feb 7 2023,positive,great venom version i liked the movie
Jan 27 2023,positive,heart pumping and great view of modern day villains left wing rich people lol
Jan 27 2023,positive,great venom version i hope the story continues with a more indepth representation of this character
Jan 24 2023,positive,better than his original appearance in spiderman 3 but riot is such an under used villain in this that it makes no sense to throw him in the movie
Jan 16 2023,positive,it was good and stuff
Jan 11 2023,positive,its good and entertaining
Jan 5 2023,negative,a film that has no depth coupled with hardys terrible performance and a venom with no spiderman makes this film just awful
Jan 4 2023,positive,go to movie for movie night for sure
Dec 24 2022,positive,it was a masterpiece loved every second of it these critics are one drugs it was a lovely movie with just the right amount of everything
Dec 22 2022,negative,terrible plot and weak storyline that devoid any character development a lazy attempt to fill the superhero quota
Dec 12 2022,positive,the character has some development even if it isnt that great  venom is cool but sometimes lacking in depth  the development is a great change from the normal kind of movie where its just action the entire movie
Dec 9 2022,positive,tom hardy was great effects were great story felt mainstream and i expected more but good action movie 
Dec 7 2022,positive,loved this movie   perfect balance of action and humor   great movie
Nov 27 2022,positive,loved it hardy is brilliant as always
Nov 24 2022,positive,very dumb movie but who cares at this point 710
Nov 21 2022,neutral, an unnecessary spiderman spinoff it was successful so every spiderman villain sony has the rights to is getting a solo movie
Nov 18 2022,positive,its messy has several plot flaws and the villain isnt the best bit its light heartedness mixed with some interesting cgi action makes it extremely watchable and enjoyable
Nov 17 2022,negative,this should have been r rated as it is its just kinda boring
Nov 11 2022,positive,a popcorn action thriller tom hardys excellent performance as well as the aboveaverage visual effects buoy this otherwise pedestrian super hero cash grab
Nov 5 2022,positive,amazing movie venom looks like a horror character but is actually hilarious
Nov 4 2022,positive,loved it it was funny and with some great action it just worked
Nov 2 2022,positive,a movie that nobody looked for but surprised me its almost good
Oct 29 2022,negative,that is not venom they took a complex and interesting character and destroy it you cant have a venom without having him interact with spider man before but sony does not care they a are too greedy and stubborn sony did not bother to wait to loan the character to marvel so that they could do something much better tom hardy is a good actor but a good actor was not enough to save this piece of garbage a sad hastily lazily thrown together cashgrab
Oct 22 2022,neutral,good movie not what i expected weak villain  and definitevely it lacks the spiderman origin factor
Oct 17 2022,positive,i think it added a new spin to the character and tom hardy as venom was perfect
Oct 14 2022,negative,wow this movie was bad
Oct 14 2022,positive,venom is one of my favorite comic book characters this movie does partial justice the dynamic between eddie brock and venom is wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed their conversations and banter however the action was sparse and the villain was one note i wanted more from this movie but it is slightly better than average when the action happened it wasnt bad but i wanted more from it
Oct 11 2022,positive,a wonderful epic mcu marvel cinematic universe origin film with a different twist on the characters and the locations involved the film has a wellknown cast along with newer faces as well it has a very interesting plot and the scope of the music makes it feel more dynamic memorable characters and interesting storytelling drive this film to its glorious finale
Oct 5 2022,neutral,tom hardys venom is awesome and the action and humor with him is sick but when thats the only thing this movie has going for the rest feels gone
Sep 29 2022,positive,its an amazing and entertaining movie the genre of the movie is scifi and action  venom is a narrative nightmare in which every scene feels rushed and yet by the power of slimy black tentacles possessed dogs and children and hardys fearless lunacy it is a wickedly watchable experience the beast inside eddie is very scary and unpredictable this is not a childish movie its only for the brave ones the cliffhanger is about venom in spidermans world eating a pizza  this scene was so exiting because there might be a venom vs spiderman its a lot of fun once youre over the weirdness of tom hardy in a big franchise movie in theory it is almost aggressively ridiculous and yet if youre willing to suspend your disbelief there is a slightly childlike sincerity to it that becomes irresistible
Sep 22 2022,positive,i think most people will agree that this movie was a hot mess from beginning to end that being said i loved absolutely every second of it and would not change a thing
Sep 22 2022,positive,okay so this movie isnt great it isnt utter garbage but it isnt great that being said it was fun and i enjoyed watching it i would recommend you watch this for a good laugh maybe but dont expect a cinematic masterpiece or anything
Sep 9 2022,negative,this is complete garrbage
Sep 6 2022,positive,venoms standalone does its best to stand on its own feet but cant helped being too rushed and continually loud but still it has its best moments
Sep 4 2022,positive,this an ok marvel comic based film im not too keen on superhero type films  this is very much a monster based antihero sort of a film although it is based on comic books i enjoy some super hero type films but not all of them  i can appreciate any film with decent special effects cgi and so on and this film does feature some pretty impressive visual effects the cast give pretty decent performances i suppose its a fairly entertaining watch if a bit far fetched plot wise but then i suppose thats to be expected i liked one plot element featuring the owner of a small store near where the main character lives this is an ok film but not more so i wouldnt entirely recommend it no
Sep 1 2022,positive,a good start to the franchise with enough action and plot to keep you entertained it throws in some humor as well as good cgi making this a solid film
Aug 31 2022,negative,mediocre at best occasionally entertaining scenes but generally doesnt produce anything particularly unique
Aug 25 2022,negative,this isnt the venom the fans wanted personally i want to see villain venom done right not like that awful topher grace performance 15  bad
Aug 19 2022,positive,confusing yes but very very enjoyable at the same time
Aug 8 2022,positive,i love the comics i loved the movie enjoy
Aug 8 2022,neutral,im not sure that i am right but the eddie brocks exwife was so serious they broke out just because eddie brock tell the secret of her job not interesting man 510
Jul 30 2022,neutral,i dont think venom is one of the worst superhero movies in history but it is too oldfashioned and generic and in the long run that could be worse
Jul 29 2022,negative,venom sucks it was a copy of morbius this movie is bad
Jul 24 2022,positive,i dont see why this movie got so much hate venoms character developments are great the film is fresh and entertaining id change nothing about this film
Jul 23 2022,positive,this movie is visually very appealing however it is just too short and fails to keep the viewers interest at the start this movie is however pretty enjoyable and fun to watch
Jul 23 2022,neutral,my rating for the film is a 5910
Jul 19 2022,positive,it is not a masterpiece but still it is worth watching one time it has its moments is funny and exciting and tom hardey does a great job
Jul 11 2022,positive,i had a great time with venom now dont get me wrong it is quite a flawed movie but to be honest i dont care this movie is such silly anti hero fun that never takes itself too seriously while also not decending into complete farce eddie brock is an entertaining character yeah he is pathetic and kind of sad but its so over the top that i do find it funny most of the time i think my favorite part of this movie is just the banter between eddie and venom its so over the top sometimes and i love it the villain is alright here hes not terrible but hes not brilliant either i think the visual effects are solid but it was a really strange decision to make the villain venom  basically the same color as venom its confusing anne is alright not super interesting and it is weird that she dumped eddie that quickly but shes mostly fine i loved dan a lot because its quite rare to see the enemy love interest in a love triangle to be portrayed as a genuinely nice person and thats what he is i like the love triangle because the movie is okay with anne being with dan and it seems more realistic to me overall its just a really fun movie that is definetely not challenging at all but i dont mind a non challenging movie once in a while flaws and all i just had a great time
Jul 11 2022,negative,i love superhero movies but not this one for one thing absolutely nothing happens until 40 minutes into the movie thats half way the other half is non stop fighting with a few jokes here and there the premises are interesting but the way its covered is simply not its a pass
Jul 10 2022,positive,its a pretty fun movie thats all im gonna say
Jul 10 2022,positive,ive watched this movie so many timesdefinitely a comfort film and just an enjoyable film in general
Jul 6 2022,positive,venom is the best i loved it so much
Jun 30 2022,positive,im rating this on how i enjoyed it not the quality of the film this film works mainly for 1 reason tom hardy his performance as eddie brock is different to the comic book character but welcomed the relationship between venom and eddie is hilarious and enjoyable to watch venom himself actually looks pretty good minus missing the spider logo but i have a feeling well see that soon enough this film isnt perfect by any means but is it entertaining hell yeah
Jun 24 2022,positive,i liked it because it was something new after all these perfect heroes sometimes awful but mostly fun
Jun 21 2022,positive,liked it   tom is a good eddy  keep it close to the comic lore though  stay away from injecting woke nonsense and you will be good
Jun 20 2022,positive,even though not the most faithfull version of the character its such a fun movie that it just sticks out in your mind just like venom would
Jun 19 2022,neutral,i was happy about this film because the trailer made me exciting was scary now that i watched the film i was a bit disappointed because i see its the studio version sony matt tolmach says i dont want to see a rradet venom film  what a asshole and wanted to make this movie funny and it was funny
Jun 19 2022,positive,after seeing this film it was actually pretty good than i expected it was fun seeing hardy play eddie brock and how his character interacted with the wellknown symbiote as go on a journey to prevent carlton drake and riot from sending the other symbiotes from invading earth
Jun 19 2022,positive,decent better then i thought actually 
Jun 13 2022,positive,i love this movie  just watched it for the second time i dont know what else to say for me its all about feeling empathy for the characters this movie does that for me in spades
Jun 2 2022,positive, story 8    acting 8    visual 8    sound 9
May 28 2022,positive,i love how they did venom both venom movies are the best could watch venom all the time
May 27 2022,negative,a boring uninspired waste of time its almost impressive how they took something so interesting and beloved and made it something i couldnt care less about
May 23 2022,negative,mediocre and dull worst tom hardy film ever
May 18 2022,positive,i enjoyed this one it has plenty of action the acting and writing is good it had some comedic moments and you actually feel for the characters i dont know why critics were so harsh i recommend venom and im excited to watch the sequel
May 14 2022,positive,it may not be bad but it was really enjoyable and sometimes that matters more eddie and venom have been a really enjoyable dynamic also just generallyfor anne taking her stand like that her new boyfriend is really a champ and eddie respecting that in the end i could go more in depth but perhaps another time too often these relationships and these female characters fall into such off tropes so i can appreciate the times something doesnt fall into them
May 14 2022,negative,venom and deadpool are the two most overrated characters from marvel comics the deadpool movies at least understood the bad character they were presenting this is simply a bad film that tom hardy cannot save
May 14 2022,positive,while the plot is sometimes messy and basic the movie is still hella a lot of fun
May 10 2022,negative,this movie is horrible i started crying when i was watching it because it was so bad
May 5 2022,positive,good film and entertaining
May 4 2022,positive,when i saw the trailer for this movie i was not hyped to see it i thought i was going to hate it but to my surprise i actually liked it the cgi just seemed perfect to me tom hardys performance is really good some people say his new york accent was bad but i just got used to it after the first couple of minutes of the movie there are some scenes in the movie where venom is controlling eddie and how tom hardy shows it is so good  this movie would also be way better if it was rated r i mean its kind of weird how venom bites peoples heads off but we see no blood
May 4 2022,negative,i feel like ive seen this movie so many before  except this time woody harrelson and tom hardy were in it totally zoned out through this movie barely made it to the end
May 3 2022,positive,i know im bias towards venom him being one of my favorite comic book characters but i cant help it his character feels a like a nice parody of spiderman as well as being both goofy and edgy a unique characteristic tom hardy really nails in this film i really felt connected with eddy brock as he and the symbiote feel genuine but flawed the designs are just as good too simple but intimating as venom should look while the story drags in some places and riot isnt the best villain ive seen this movie is fun to watch still if you like superhero movies i would recommend this movie 
May 1 2022,positive,im sorry yall but i really kinda like this movie i think the characters are pretty good not great some are just mehbut the rest of them are amazingi like eddie brock kinda he is fine i guessthe girlfriend adds nothing to the story but all fightthe stan lee was awesome i liked thatthe final battle is great but happened way to fast kindathe movie has bad reviews but i will say its a decent marvel movie but you will not like does if you like a lot of action this less action kinda its more talking its just a kinda movie honestyits a 610 i will not see again but i had a kinda decent time
Apr 27 2022,positive,visually stunning the final battle is amazing but sometimes is boring
Apr 26 2022,negative,this movie not morbius    michael morbius
Apr 25 2022,positive,a fun and entertaining movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,this was really enjoyable im not sure why this got so many negative reviews hardys performance is edgy and exciting the plot was formulaic but still watchable i found it a great way to while away a few hours look forward to watching the next one
Apr 21 2022,positive,really enjoyed this tom hardy is always excellent and this was very well handled i was a big venom fan as a kid and this didnt disappoint
Apr 17 2022,negative,disappointing the actor played brock really well but the script really didnt pull through the climax and conflict felt hollow and poorly presented it was an enjoyable movie but from a critical standpoint it needed more thought and maybe an entirely different conflict 
Apr 10 2022,positive,tom hardy shoulders the heavy lifting giving this any entertainment value  couldve been much much worse but he saves it  at times pretty funny
Apr 9 2022,positive,just a fun movie with a fun plot
Apr 8 2022,positive,great one of the best on its kind
Apr 6 2022,positive,i have no idea what is up with the critics it was a good movie venom says some funny things
Apr 4 2022,positive,good movie would definitely watch again
Apr 2 2022,positive,i actually really like this movie minus one star because the mri scene sets off all of the fire alarms in my apartment building somehow
Apr 1 2022,positive,venom is a bad movie with charm if you can get over some of the corny acting and dry plot the movie oddly works well as a dark yet tame buddycomedy with some pretty fun action sequences
Mar 31 2022,positive,critics is l the is great and the sequence as well this is w
Mar 31 2022,negative,cinema at its worst is what defines this movie feels funny and weird as to how audiences even liked this movie
Mar 28 2022,positive,lot of people hating on this movie for no reason i expected venom and i got venom good plot good characters good movie
Mar 22 2022,neutral,do have a fondness for superhero films venom also had talented people in the cast tom hardy and michelle williams have both done great work in their careers it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting antiheroes in the superhero universe    watched venom with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness as always to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion was aware that it was not well liked by the critics but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked have to agree with those that were left disappointed while also not finding venom to be that bad am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion    venom does have good things it is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between eddie and venom which had fun and tension it is when venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest after too long struggling to invest in the first act the darker elements of the film are actually quite well done having a dark grit and creepiness it looks reasonably good well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere    the music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action especially the car chase sequence some of the effects are terrific tom hardy is intensely charismatic with eddievenom being interesting and well contrasted characters far more believable than topher grace in spiderman 3    however the rest of the cast dont fare so greatly michelle williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a developmentfree plotdevice role riz ahmed is far too anaemic for the onedimensional villain thats both cartoonish and insipid of the characters only eddie and venom engage and intrigue the rest are flat while some of the effects are terrific others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax    it is the script and story where venom fails most the script is really clunky especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced venoms disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing the less too about the soapy and clichéridden scenes featuring hardy and williams the better they are bland and dont serve much point and the life institute scenes should have had more clarity unfortunately these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and taking too long to get going the story is tonally disjointed too many tones that are very variable on their own and dont gel together and very clunky this is not a case of the film not trying to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely for a story intended to be dark and violent this seemed rather tame and held back    summing up a disappointment but not that bad 510 bethany cox
Mar 21 2022,negative,the only reason it gets one star is because of tom hardy
Mar 17 2022,positive,the movie is not bad but it could have been much better the script and development is very simple it has a good story of the symbiotes and especially venom and eddie what i didnt like was the villain
Mar 15 2022,positive,not a great movie but entertaining enough to  enjoy most of it
Mar 14 2022,positive,the ssu  thankfully renamed from spumc  begins    i enjoyed venom in short tom hardy is one of my favourite actors and i thoroughly enjoyed his showing here as the titular character the bonkers nature of the story if not perfect at all is very entertaining to watch unfold i also found the pacing and special effects to be more than solid looking forward to checking out the sequel
Mar 12 2022,positive,i think this movie is really good people give it lots of nasty hate but i really like it i think its a funny action movie that i will watch anytime i feel like it if youre someone who feels this way too respect to you
Mar 11 2022,positive,i love tom hardy xoxo
Mar 7 2022,negative,this is complete garrbage
Mar 7 2022,positive,not for everybody but good popcorn movie
Feb 28 2022,positive,its a great action movie and it has good moments but it sometimes lacks its fun and funny moments but still a great movie and i recommend it
Feb 26 2022,positive,good action movie as we see another character from the comic books come to life with a great cast it certainly sets up well for the sequel of carnage with woody harrelson and wonder about the future of the science lab
Feb 24 2022,positive,it lacks the chilling vibe of a superhero movie but its still entertaining for the 00s based prequelspinoff
Feb 21 2022,neutral,pretty disappointed i went in with high expectations and got a movie with a very basic plot and a very predictable ending it wasnt awful but it wasnt great
Feb 18 2022,positive,as usual the average joe and suzie q are able to enjoy a movie that the pretentious critics cant
Feb 18 2022,positive,i think about this movie too much to not give it this rating currently id rate it 510 but when i think about how awesome the high points in the movie are and that one of my favorite directors directed thisit gets to an 810
Feb 13 2022,positive,venom is like terminator 2 with an split personality and a vampire this film put our hero in silly situations with more power than necessary and a goal to stop another and get the girlfriend hilarious film noir
Feb 7 2022,positive,good isnt the best one but pretty good
Feb 1 2022,positive,dont listen to the critics those who get this movie get it the ones who dont well they write these wrong and uninformative reviews criticizing this movie when there is nothing to be criticized venom is a masterpiece disguising itself as an edgy superhero blockbuster venom is more than that its a love story its romance its a romcom to put it simply this movie is camp as the twitter users would say there is a true symbiotic relationship between man and alien venom i encourage you to watch this movie with only the absolute smartest the intellectuals of your friend group you will enjoy this movie more than any other venom is art
Jan 30 2022,positive,why do the critics hate this movie its great its more than great its a improvement from spiderman 3s version and i love how its not just eddie as the main character its also venom its almost as iconic as wilem dafoes switches when he plays norman osborn green goblin
Jan 29 2022,neutral,i watched this movie after a request from my daughter i was skeptical because of the reviews i have to start by quoting cinemasins the books or comic books does not matter i wont go into details as towards why but the summary is that they dont matter because movies try to reinvent reinterpret or sum them up movies dont have enough time lets put it simple    so eddie brock wannabe pokémon master lol is a lookingforthetruthatalltime type of reporter he is always looking for the ultimate slip by big evil companies he gets the bigshot opportunity to interview carlton drake leader of life foundation whom eddie distrusts life foundation is secretly trying to find something in outerspace to augment humans to live in other planets which leads them to slip onto the extraterrestrial symbiotes     one problem is evident from the main plot the movie does not develop eddie enough so we sympatize when eddie messup big time it feels like he did it out of selfishness rather than trying to help the others as he and the movie implies    the movie really begins when eddie is possessed by the symbiote called venom which i always thought it is stupid why would an extraterrestrial lifeform call himself venom or riot how would they know english whatever well venom possesses eddie in search of a strong host at first venom just wants to consume everybody in the world later he simpatizes with eddie i dont know why for sure    then of course we have venom wanting to save the world for reasons    the movie is not terrible like some people mentioned i guess it is just out of place the puns and humor touches are actually enjoyable cgi is meh this movie is just not up to the most recent marvel movies
Jan 20 2022,positive,its a good movie to watch may be the climax is not good enough and tom hardy killed it
Jan 17 2022,positive,venom is still entertaining despite not having spiderman in its origin story but we have to admit that it would be a much bigger blockbuster if it did tom hardy is the main driving force behind this standalone movie his acting is great as always it really suits him to play roles that require unusual human behavior he acted out the character very well but id have to agree with some friends who said that eddie brock is supposed to have a tougher personality visual effects were great i expected to see cgi overload since it was needed but i dont think that it was over the top venoms creature design is so good he looked like he jumped right out of the comic book storywise its not your usual superhero movie since venom is really an antihero it was cool to see other symbiote characters making an appearance i didnt really expect to hear humor and im not sure if it helps or not the movie is entertaining enough but id have to agree with some critics that this could have been a lot better if they didnt hold back on the gore and violence
Jan 15 2022,positive,enjoyable and fun critics dont know what they talking about
Jan 15 2022,negative,tom hardy is perfect but this is not venom
Jan 9 2022,positive,great antihero movie
Jan 7 2022,positive,the first acts feel a bit slow but once the venom kicks in literally its one hell of a ride
Jan 6 2022,neutral,was fun but needs a litttle more spiderman
Jan 3 2022,positive,its a solid movie felt like it really did not have a big bad villain riot felt underused still a funny movie but not as good as its sequel
Jan 3 2022,neutral,it was entertaining but it lacked a true villain the riot symbiote only bonded to carlton drake in the last act of the film i did enjoy the banter between eddie and venom but the film is just basic still i enjoyed some bits just not the film as a whole
Jan 2 2022,positive,brilliant stand alone venom movie although we are all used to venom being the villain it was good to see the charater development of the of eddie and the symbiote brilliant acting and character choice really brings the movie together
Jan 1 2022,neutral,fun movie but boring at times
Dec 31 2021,negative,bad story tom hardys accent is all over the place and he mumbles a lot to make it not as noticeable silly movie a little funny is what it has going for it
Dec 31 2021,positive,so stupid and fun and just totally marvel all in one five stars because it keeps my son entertained for hours
Dec 29 2021,negative,the baddy in this movie carnage was totally indifferent venombrock duo was not funny
Dec 29 2021,positive,this movie is amazing i dont know why so many bad rewiews
Dec 27 2021,negative,best worst superhero movie
Dec 26 2021,positive,great action and comedy kind of a cheesy story at times but venoms character makes up for it great portrayal by tom
Dec 26 2021,negative,this movie has too much common sense with matrix 4 but at least in matrix 4 people do not vomit so i can say matrix 4 is slightly better
Dec 25 2021,negative,pg13 really ruins all the venom experience
Dec 25 2021,positive,great movie ready for the next instalment
Dec 22 2021,positive,i dont know why the critics didnt like it but this movie was great
Dec 22 2021,positive,dont explosions cover 40006000 hz 5810 for best alien romance
Dec 22 2021,positive,im not a fan of tom hardy i think its mostly his voice however i was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was done this was a great a job of introducing the character
Dec 22 2021,positive,absolutely spectacular performance by tom hardy this movie is what deadpool thinks it is
Dec 22 2021,positive,the characterscharacter of eddie and venom are what makes it good
Dec 21 2021,positive,absolute insane fun dont come in expected a cinematic masterpiece or a typical superhero movie come for the hilarious and insane dynamic between eddie and venom this is not artistic or highly nuisanced film this is a fun hysterical romp with a human disaster and his equally disastrous parasite
Dec 19 2021,positive,the introduction to venom in this first movie kind of feels off as well as the pacing but  nonetheless great character development at the end of the movie makes it in my opinion better than the sequel
Dec 18 2021,negative,substandard superhero movie just dont think to hard about it and it can be fun at least half of the time
Dec 18 2021,positive,yes its another marvel flick but its pretty darn good  the special effects are great  the writing ideal  several times i laughed out loud  the superhero part was action packed
Dec 17 2021,positive,venom shows us a diferent and more creatve origin for on my favorite characher of marvel comics tom hardy made an awesome job as eddie brock with having funny cupel with venom  unlikely vilan is terrible and generic and the cgi doesnt help
Dec 16 2021,positive,the movie is great the origin feels a bit rushed and you dont learn much about venoms powers and the villains motive is a bit strange but the action scenes are brilliant and tom hardy is a fantastic eddie brock
Dec 16 2021,neutral,a corporatebacked space flight crashes somewhere in malaysia spilling its priceless cargo four canisters of stringy thinking creeping extraterrestrial slime one such goopy critter manages to escape inhabiting a series of human carriers like a serial carjacker while the others are whisked back to company hq for various pokes and prods in the lab there a forsaken exjournalist with a grudge against the ceo who is eeevil for the record makes off with one of the remaining creatures and everything quickly descends into metro mayhem and superpowered action    the nuts and bolts of how venoms symbiosis functions are interesting and the running conversation inside his cranium is campy yet entertaining think willem dafoes competing personalities in 2002s spiderman but the human characters are generic the plot is full of gaps and the narrative is terribly predictable we also dont get a lot of good reasons to cheer for the star beyond the visceral thrills of watching him crush cars eat heads and say precisely whats on his mind hes a victim of his own bad decisionmaking both as the human eddie brock simultaneously killed his career and his love life in one selfish act and his eightfoot alienskinned alterego prone to violence wrests control from several unwilling host bodies theyre better together occasionally pushing each other to grow and learn but that feels more like a throwaway scrap than a theme and the climactic struggle falls short of achieving redemption    tom hardy turns in another satisfying performance as the twin leads completely transforming his voice to inhabit the role of a bloodthirsty foreign consciousness and the effects work is appropriately exciting in all his glory though venom looks rather bland without a big white spider icon on his chest his design is basically all head now this isnt boring its just incredibly dumb
Dec 14 2021,positive,it wasnt what we expect from venom i think the venom in spiderman 2007 was the best venom of all time and it wont be repeated
Dec 12 2021,positive,average to me for a comic book movie i suppose great comic book movies in the last 10 years has changed peoples opinions on what is average good and great decent introduction to the character
Dec 11 2021,neutral,too much noise  too less plot line  hardy was the only saving grace 
Dec 10 2021,neutral,the only redeeming qualities here are the look of venom the voice and the interactions between eddie and venom pretty much everything else is crap even if we ignore the fact that the movie just completely misses the point of venom its just not a good story not a good villain not a good origin the character motivations are weak and the final conflict isnt even that good also michelle williams character was completely pointless could have just made dan eddies doctor and the story would have been exactly the same
Dec 9 2021,positive,better than the average superhero movie  funny and adult
Dec 8 2021,negative,easily one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time the writing is bad cliche and gimmicky tom hardys acting is so overthetop silly and obvious he literally comments everything he does to make sure that everyone understands that what youre seeing is actually happening this is fantastic 4 or catwoman bad
Dec 7 2021,positive,while the graphics are good and the action scenes are fun to watch the plot and timing are quite off first of all the final big battle happens way too early and it makes the timing feel off one moment the characters are just doing typical superhero stuff and then suddenly they start attacking the bad guy with basically no leadup it just felt off and rushed second of all the plot isnt the best in the second half of the movie and some things that happen can feel strangely convenient and rather forced for example spoilers when the guy is getting consumed by riot the girlfriend appears out of nowhere i have no idea how she got there so fast and uses some speakers that she couldnt have possibly known were there in the first place that make noises go save the main character the scenes like these feel very forced and unnatural in conclusion while a mainly fun and enjoyable movie the timing is terribly done and the plot is poorly made
Dec 6 2021,negative,bogged down by a dumb plot and a boring underdeveloped antagonist but worth a watch if nothing else for tom hardys chaotic performance
Dec 2 2021,positive,great movie and music especially eddies and vemons dynamic is just so funny
Nov 30 2021,positive,a really enjoyable fun scifi action flick with tom hardy great for this role movie has its flaws but still an easy recommendation
Nov 30 2021,positive,some people hate this movie because it doesnt live up to there expectations and it kind of didnt live up to mine but venom redeems it self for being so cheesy its so good some aspects of the plot kept me watching this is a good movie overall
Nov 29 2021,positive,i think this film spent a little too long on venoms origin story when they should have saved that for an inevitable sequel  the scenes where hardyvenom are talking to each other are pretty amusing but the tone effects and character development were that of a premarvel era superhero film  there was inconsistent tone acting styles and visual effects all around  the script was sloppy and too formulaic but this venom was far better than spider man 3  hardy specifically was fun in this film though probably too method for my liking in this setting
Nov 28 2021,positive,sloppy effects and unnecessarily silly dialogue really hurts a film which could have been something special i usually enjoy hardy yet he feels terribly miscast as the complicated and often mishandled charter of eddie brock everyone involved seems to be trying their best but are all let down with a story that can only be described as stupid venom is clearly an awesome character who needs to battle spiderman to be taken seriously his solo films feel like zod without superman pointless 6510
Nov 27 2021,positive,the privileged critics are pretentious pretty good classic id vs ego
Nov 27 2021,negative,to put it simply venom is a confusing mess
Nov 26 2021,positive,this movie was badass cant wait for more hope they tie in spiderman some how
Nov 24 2021,negative,terrible from every angle you look serkis please keep doing the thing that you are great acting
Nov 21 2021,positive,the movie is fun and entertaining tom hardy gave one of his best performances and his chemistry with venom is really good the thing i didnt like was the villian
Nov 19 2021,positive,usually introducing characters for me is pretty boring but this movie actually made it interesting the movie itself to wasnt bad it was pretty good
Nov 18 2021,negative,if you loved venom in the comics i feel you will dislike the movie if you  dont know the back history maybe the movie will seem better
Nov 16 2021,neutral,the story is a little forced and more complicated then it needs to be its still a decent movie my biggest complaint was that almost everyone except venom mumbles a lot when venom speaks his voice is resonatingly loud it was very annoying after a while
Nov 16 2021,positive,it ok i think the movie not that bad
Nov 15 2021,positive,this movie is sooooo overhated and its not even funny people need to understand venom doesnt need spidey to shine i enjoyed it it was fun
Nov 15 2021,neutral,a loud and noisy film with mediocre cgi that has nothing more than an average story with overdone action while some may find venom to be enjoyable more than others it does become hard to watch at points due to headache inducing cgi the banter between eddie brock and venom is fun to watch though and tom hardy excels in this film
Nov 12 2021,neutral,eddie brock did not have it the hardest the person who had it the hardest was the lobby guard 
Nov 12 2021,positive,i enjoyed it lots of action i really liked the venom interactions but there were lots of clichés such as the young tech bad guy surely this has been done to death switching off the brain it was fun
Nov 12 2021,negative,like a liveaction hentai with no nudity
Nov 11 2021,positive,since i reviewed the second one im going back and give my thoughts on the original  while this is watchable it suffers from a weak and boring villi an and it drags in spots  it most fun when they lean into tom hardy fighting or eddy fighting with venom which both toms thing so it works and the movie works when this happens  the end fight is kind  of a cgi mess and not very excting its okay but ehh  in the end i cant heavly say yeah see it but its not to bad either so enjoy the eddy and venom show the rest is very ehhh
Nov 8 2021,positive,a great start for the journey of an antihero there ara problems like not including spidey but i really like it
Nov 7 2021,negative,my rating 37 venoms messy screenplay clumsy performances and tonal inconsistency all end up delivering unintentional entertainment
Nov 6 2021,positive,the villain was kinda weak but tom hardy as eddie brock is perfect
Nov 5 2021,positive,a lot of fun different from other marvel films
Nov 5 2021,positive,it gave me everything i ever wanted
Nov 4 2021,positive,the movie is good but the story is slow and ends up boring
Nov 3 2021,positive,this movie is absolutely one of the most fun movies ive ever seen if not for spiderverse itd easily be my favorite movie of 2018
Nov 2 2021,negative,very disappointing with some of the worst dialogue in a film
Nov 2 2021,positive,first one was better
Nov 1 2021,positive,i dont understand why the critics panned this film how is it not as good as other super hero origin stories which scored 80s and 90s if anything its more original and darker than most of them tom hardys performance as a down trodden new yorker inhabitedpossessed by the alien symbiote if anything is too good it felt grounded and believable the cgi to bring venom to life was excellent i found it thoroughly entertaining and interesting from start to finish
Oct 31 2021,positive,this one was way better than the sequel
Oct 31 2021,negative,seemed rushed plot was flimsy ending was anticlimactic acting was good and effects were good so audiences may like it very little replay value
Oct 30 2021,positive,loved the juxtaposition of the symbiote and eddie main villain could have have been made better cant wait to see carnage
Oct 30 2021,negative,was just a mess of a movieeverything overloaded with pointless characters backstories then just crammed in and extruded out in the last 15 minutes
Oct 30 2021,positive,this movie is the best movie i ever seen bc i like movie type like this venom and eddie also damn cute everything in this movie is good
Oct 30 2021,negative,takes a dark character and makes it quirky it was not terrible but very disappointing
Oct 29 2021,negative,although it is a superhero movie that uses a technical and professional element the minus point of this film is that the main character is too artificial and overwhelmed by the plot moreover the fight scene at the end of the movie make me hate it
Oct 28 2021,positive,nice change from the rest of the mcu  comedy and action buddy film  enjoyed toms take on the character of eddie brock
Oct 28 2021,positive,an incredible and fun movie with great dynamics between their characters
Oct 27 2021,negative,for once i agree with the critics on this site i did not enjoy this film i watch films just about every week and its rare for me to walk out and i almost did tonight at the cinema within the first half an hour of the film starting i knew it was going to be dreadful  the first venom was better much better but even that was average this one was just silly the story was weak the acting poor its not something we havent seen a thousand times before to be honest its less than average     the worse films ive seen this year if you have kids it might be enjoyable for them but i dont think even kids would be interested and would find it silly it was very dull i found it hard to watch to be honest couldnt wait for it to end
Oct 27 2021,positive,absolutely loved this movie tom hardy is perfect cgi is perfect venom is perfect action is perfect one thing off is the pacing we only see the bag guy right at the end and we only see full venom after half the movie has gone
Oct 26 2021,negative,an embarrassing cringefest for all involved has nothing to do with the source and is a clunker in its own right why even make it if this is the best they could do
Oct 26 2021,positive,just good old fashioned dumb action movie very good entertainment qithout a lot of thought
Oct 25 2021,positive,i waited 3 years to watch venom because i had no good expectations  i was totally wrong is this the next matrix nope better than deadpool nope it is however a great pick your night of the week relax and unwind with some buttered popcorn type of movie
Oct 25 2021,negative,a rushed mash of lets go there and have a fight scene lets go here next lets have a fight scene  lacked depth and storyline a filler to get to the end of credit scene  was amazed it could be worse than the first venom 
Oct 25 2021,positive,very fun and goofy movie
Oct 25 2021,positive,i really enjoyed venom  if you liked the first one you will like this one  the end credit scene is cool
Oct 24 2021,positive,venom is a really good movie tom hardy plays the role excellently and the effects are spectacular the plot is great but could have been established deeper for example a deeper look into why the symbiotes are interested in coming to earth another thing that i felt was missing is creating a deeper viewerrelationship with venom himself and to build the change of heart he has about helping riot the change of heart happened in one dialogue line and thats not enough to connect with viewers still an absolutely great movie nonetheless and very entertaining i would definitely recommend it
Oct 24 2021,positive,a little slow at first still a great ride in the end
Oct 23 2021,positive,good movie how can you go wrong with tom hardy you cant
Oct 23 2021,positive,not as good as the original but still worth watching
Oct 21 2021,positive,the more i rewatch it the more i enjoy it
Oct 21 2021,positive,short sweet entertaining  classic popcorn movie
Oct 21 2021,negative,watchable  i did not mind it
Oct 20 2021,positive,it was an enjoyable movie no political noncens just a satisfying story from a cool antihero
Oct 19 2021,positive,since i was a little girl i have been a massive fan of spiderman and his usual rogues gallery while this movie isnt perfect for instance eddies life immediately falling apart was a little bit rushed and his conflict with his exfiancee feels forced in my honest opinion but the rest of the movie is ultimately a bloody good time
Oct 19 2021,positive,a very good movie must watch
Oct 18 2021,negative,it is not an original story
Oct 18 2021,positive,our whole family loved this movie
Oct 18 2021,positive,wasnt amazing but i did have fun watching it
Oct 18 2021,positive,this movie will never deserve the 30 on rotten tomatoes as im currently writing this this movie is fun as a fan this movie is so nice venom in the comics isnt just some scary monster that wants to defeat spiderman hes a bit of a goof because hes a goofy character this movie nails that aspect of the character and deserves more great fun you should watch it
Oct 16 2021,positive,the low ratings are understandable   but just too much fun anyway
Oct 16 2021,negative,better cgi on a ps3
Oct 16 2021,positive,tom hard was the best part of the movie everything else was meh
Oct 16 2021,positive,a nice followup this one has more of a dr j n mr h vibe mixed in with a serial killer in love story its fun
Oct 16 2021,positive,some missteps but a lot of fun to watch  nice to not have the spiderman angle
Oct 15 2021,positive,fun movie i dont understand why people hate this movie lol
Oct 15 2021,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie a lot now waiting on part 2
Oct 15 2021,positive,its fun and quite fresh depiction from venom comics the movie gives off a wonderful dynamic between the main actor and his alien friend cant wait to see the sequal
Oct 14 2021,positive,i like venom its a perfect representation of the best marval villain but riot is so bland and dumb and other than that the movies fun and really good 610
Oct 14 2021,positive,it was great huge fan of venom and cant wait to see him alongside the other mcu characters
Oct 14 2021,positive,its a cool movie but nothing special
Oct 14 2021,negative,slightly worse than the first venom its ok if you watch with it with no expectations the best part of the movie is the mid credit scene sony really needs to give the rights to these characters up and let marvel do its thing
Oct 14 2021,positive,comic originality issue but a great movie otherwise
Oct 13 2021,positive,i think the chronological events order is a drop in this movie but its okay ive got what i asked the director and cast for
Oct 13 2021,positive,loved it  tom hardy is excellent  love the graphics the fighting and woody
Oct 13 2021,positive,great movie saw this before heading into see venom 2 mind blown i hope there buddy dynamic continues
Oct 12 2021,positive,lot of fun i had a lot of laugh with this
Oct 12 2021,negative,it was funny at some points but everything felt gratuitous and absurd
Oct 11 2021,negative,i sat through this while having a movie night with friends  one friend in particular went on and on about how great it was  i got up halfway through and went outside to sit in silence and stare at the night sky  more entertaining and a far better story
Oct 11 2021,positive,sarcastically funny a good performance from tom hardy and a generally enjoyable plot
Oct 11 2021,negative,fast forwarded through the first half  so incredibly bad  i couldnt finish the other half  hardy has no charm or comedic talent  the most frustrating part is that amazon prime gave this 4 stars
Oct 10 2021,negative,i never read any of the comics so i cant say it was or wasnt a good rendition of venoms character but i can say this is not a good movie it can be fun if youre not expecting a masterpiece and i wasnt expecting a masterpiece i was just having lunch but i was expecting at least some effort the movie follows the same journey of the hero used in so many action films basically verbatim the movie also doesnt make a lot of effort to make eddie likeable and unique in his character and his approach to things was kinda confusing it was never clear if he was an edgy guy who loves to take risks or a goody two shoes who just wants justice tom hardy was misused in this film he couldve had a better character eddies romance with anne was pretty bland and if the intention was to make us root for them it didnt work for me personally eddies chemistry with venom happened super suddenly too there was no buildup and venom decides to be a sortagoodguy out of the blue their connection didnt have any time to develop and their innerworld conversations go from arguing to joking in a matter of one or two scenes but not all is lost i enjoyed riz ahmeds and jenny slates performances they were fun to watch and ahmeds character sounded very natural and beliavable for me they coulve risked a bit more with the cgi i dont think it wouldnt be pg13 if they made it a little bit more grotesque and intense especially when people are being posessed by the symbiote overall is fun if i was expecting to watch transformers or fast and furious i would switch it to this movie and have more fun with it
Oct 10 2021,positive,great film tom hardy is some legend just the film should have been longer
Oct 10 2021,positive,while venom is not a perfect film it is an enjoyable watch that includes many solid elements the most flawed feature of the film is the story which is not even all that bad the story is simplistic and that is why it is defective a simple story is not inferior to a complex story yet there are such fascinating ideas in the movie that allows for exploration showing the audience these environments provides a better grasp of the world of venom that would support a concrete story for example the opening scene is solid but exploring the comet covered in symbiotic life forms would have reasonably made the film feel more comprehensive the pacing is also slightly affected by the story flaw as certain story elements did not feel complete it is most apparent in two subplots with the first being the romance between eddie and anne the relationship does not feel genuine among the pair until after they split having a few more scenes that go back and tell the audience more about the relationship would have made their character development stronger the other subplot is riots storyline the sixmonth traveling time did not make sense seeing how easily riot transferred from the other two humans in the very beginning plus once riot reached his ultimate destination it was kind of lackluster the cast does support venom in a dignified way as nobody carries the film down tom hardy does an exceptional job here as he never makes eddies movements exhibit a cringeworthy or creepy vibe plus hardy doing the voice of venom shows that he has an influential connection to the film as a whole michelle williams was also excellent here and it was delightful to see her in an active role throughout the movie reid scott is also a lot of fun here as dan lewis yes his role as the new boyfriend is a bit cliche at this point but scott presents the role as his own with a lot of fun quips that make him a notable character finally riz ahmed as carlton drake is ahmed the best in the cast no as it felt like he was missing something ahmed is a great actor but his performance felt a little weak it is most likely due to his inadequate character arc the visual effects and cgi in the film were strong while they are not perfect it is enough to make venom and riot look like actual aliens it helps in the significant concluding battle that is almost all computergenerated that whole end battle scene fell short as it didnt feel climatic there were not a lot of moments that were visually striking or had a sense of astonishment the whole sequence felt sort of weak venom is a funfilled movie that could have been even better with some more substantial elements the overall story is solid yet it needed more connecting aspects to make the narrative structure flow undeviatingly tom hardy drives this movie in such an incredible way in which no other actor could even with minor flaws venom is a guaranteed fun time for people of all ages read more reviews like this at postcreditreviewscom
Oct 10 2021,positive,how refreshing a film that is simply content to be entertaining no agenda no issues all fun
Oct 10 2021,positive,the first film of sonys spiderman universe follows one of the most popular villains from the marvel comics failed reporter eddie brock is bonded to an alien entity one of many symbiotes with lethal abilities who have invaded earth but the being takes a liking to earth and decides to protect it given how the story develops it would have been more enjoyable if this movie had been made rrated however the visual effects are great and despite the plot feeling a bit rushed the showdown is quite satisfying tom hardy pulls off a great venom and hopefully in the future this antihero can be seen alongside or against spiderman in a new adventure
Oct 10 2021,positive,fun much better than i thought it would be 
Oct 9 2021,positive,i didnt really want to like this movie because of they changed the story a bit compared to the comics and the older spiderman movies  but it was a decent movie  not the best but still enjoyable
Oct 8 2021,positive,a very good movie no notion of these negative opinions
Oct 8 2021,positive,great movie  fun never drags  it is exactly what you expect  a buddy action comedy  the only moralizing is done tongue in cheek  channeling venom the critics will be delicious  i will eat them all
Oct 8 2021,negative,i wish carnage was in this movie though venom was fking awesome especially eminem at the end freakin sick man
Oct 8 2021,positive,a really bizarre non superhero superhero movie if you accept that deep down this is really a comedy its quite enjoyable tom hardy brings just the right amount of crazy without ever going full jim carey goofy
Oct 8 2021,positive,loved itand very funny
Oct 7 2021,negative,wasnt a fan of the first one but it had some memorable moments i fell asleep in this one it was boring to me actually very boring the characters did nothing to actually grow most things that happened did just becouse it was on the script half of the setups didt make any sense and the actors where good but the script was not it wasnt even dumb it was just plain bad
Oct 7 2021,positive,its fun and funny has good action etc but you start to get tired of constant explosions and fighting
Oct 6 2021,negative,i have heard so many mixed opinions on this movie but when i watched it my experience leaned towards the negative ones it takes quite a while to get to the venom  eddie stuff which is pretty much the only stuff that people care about for this movie then when we finally got there it did not really work for me because their relationship felt rushedawkward most of the time the performances feel somewhat strange but i think it was the direction that did this ultimately this movie just wants to be dumb fun which i can get behind sometimes but with dark and messy action scenes and not much time devoted to venom it is hard to enjoy villain was also very generic and riot was rushed ultimately i think being rated r and having a different director would have done wonders for this movie
Oct 6 2021,positive,entertaining but the ending could have been better
Oct 6 2021,positive,it would have been better if they gave more backstory to venom and why he didnt want to fight the humans and the weird backstory of eddie u just couldnt connect but it was funny and full of action
Oct 6 2021,positive,i thought the first one was meh but this one was shockingly funny entertaining and had good action
Oct 5 2021,positive,everybody should see this film  no it does not have spiderman but it does have eddie brock who was the first man venom had contact with  the fight scene at the end of the movie is one of the best ever filmed
Oct 5 2021,positive,action packed crazyfun movie would recommend 2 most and i believe the future sequels will make this that much more worth the while
Oct 4 2021,positive,reall cool film i def enjoyed watching i recommend it  and ioved all the cgi great job
Oct 4 2021,positive,tom hardy is just amazing in this role i couldnt think of any other actor for this
Oct 4 2021,positive,something new but needs a lot more work kudos to the cgi team
Oct 4 2021,positive,the woke writing was a downside but my son loved it and so did i  please stop being woke thank you good job venom
Oct 3 2021,positive,from now on ill establish 4 themes at the start of each months and base my overall movie choices doesnt include theaters and improvised watch withe family for october it will be spiderman horror denis villeneuve and anime   today i started with venom for the spiderman theme i wanted to see it first because let it be carnage is out so maybe i will go see it honestly i liked it it could have been funnier or have a better scenario but overall it was good there was style goofiness and good acting but the only things that made me like it less are the fact that the budget seems used only for venom riot etc as a matter of fact it is a high budget film but some sets seems fake like a sitcom you know also the scenario had its flaw the moment when he is fired and he broke up seems speed up and it felt like the writers wanted to pass this moment as soon as possible overall it was nice
Oct 3 2021,positive,i saw this in 2018 and i loved it it was a great original venom origin story
Oct 3 2021,neutral,one of the worst marvel movies weak illogical story unmotivated actors the film lives only thanks to tom hardy
Oct 3 2021,positive,i kind of like this one more than the second one
Oct 3 2021,positive,venom was an enjoyable movie what i liked is that it was fun funny the fight scenes were cool and venom was cool what i didnt like is that the acting was meh the cgi was meh also the final battle was a barf of cgi also i wish we saw more of venom vs riot
Oct 3 2021,neutral,the villain could have been a lot better however the relationship between venom and eddie brock is actually very entertaining and fun tom hardy does an acceptable job with the character tom hadys first venom relies on the mcus formula without the direction to make it stick although this first movie provides a lot of potential for future installments its emptyheaded tom hardy carries the film the plot is generic
Oct 2 2021,positive,it was funny and enjoyable tom hardy did great as venomeddie brock and the end credit scene was fun as well 
Oct 2 2021,neutral,its fine it has cool cgi and tom hardy is obviously putting in a lot of effort  the plot isnt great but the performance and effects make up for it  its a fun watch
Oct 2 2021,positive,far better than i expected
Oct 2 2021,positive,venom is a fun movie  the plot is relatively simple and follows a shallow formula for action superhero movies  that said there is a lot of good things going for the film    it would have been nearly impossible to make a film with these gooey alien effects a decade ago  this movie does it very well  it gets about as good as possible for cgi in a liveaction movie    generally all of the camera work was visually pleasing and the action scenes were entertaining    the dialogue motivations and actions of each character are well thought out and feel authentic  the actors do a great job bringing them to life      the relationship between eddie and venom is fun to see
Oct 2 2021,positive,not great but a decent shut your brain off and enjoy type movie 
Oct 1 2021,positive,this movie offers a spin off for the best spidermans characters franchise  somthing new and incredible a huge fan
Oct 1 2021,neutral,venom is a slimming marvel movie is badgood and goodbad but it feels meh for me
Oct 1 2021,positive,everything you could of wanted in a venom 2 100 no forced politics or agendas not even a brain turn off of a action movie it is honestly a solid comic book adaptation i loved the new characters naomie harris and woody harrelson are outstanding along with of course tom hardy having his venomous infectious fun with venom the one and only thing i can critique is how carnage is created but they since spider man isnt in the movie  he couldnt be created from his blood
Sep 30 2021,negative,how has this got such a high audience score  this film is trash the script is terrible and theres absolutely no depth to any of it  this is the over saturation of super hero films that were currently stuck with leave it to the big dogs please  i know that were getting a third film i just really hope it ends there
Sep 30 2021,negative,terrible comic book film worse yet it was boring
Sep 30 2021,positive,fun if poorly crafted movie that works thanks to a mostly game cast and some great action  the main appeal of the film is tom hardy as eddie brockvenom playing against himself brilliantly portraying brock as a selfcentered if wellintentioned reporter while venom is sadistic and unhinged he would gladly eat anyone he comes across  he is matched nicely by michelle williams as his love interest who delivers some fun moments reacting to the mayhem  behind the camera rueben fleischer delivers some fun action with some nice nods to the comic but barely skirts on many of the material the symbiotes are barely explained  it doesnt help the film is a mere hour and thirty minutes and could have been helped with some time for character development venom turns good for no reason  overall still fun but not an entirely good film
Sep 29 2021,positive,venom feels like an older superhero movie with its humor and relatively light tone which is not a bad thing it is almost similar to raimis spiderman and is a blast the whole time especially when eddie and venom start interacting tom hardy was absolutely the best actor for this role and he is going to kill it with woody in the 2nd entry
Sep 29 2021,positive,a pretty enjoyable movie good blend of action and humor 
Sep 28 2021,positive,an okay movie but isnt perfect lets just start by saying that venoms origins makes no sense without involving spiderman in the comics eddie and venoms shared hatred for spiderman is what causes him to become a villain in the first place in this movie its because of this carlton drake guy if anything this movie should have been set in the mcu sony ruins everything 
Sep 27 2021,positive,amazing movie from start to finish  if anyone rates poorly on this movie they just dont know a good movie if it slapped them in the face or are crying about how its different than the comic origins
Sep 27 2021,positive,really good movie that really got my attention 55
Sep 25 2021,positive,definitely enjoyed venom and its worth a watch not the best superhero movie but if youre a venom fan you will enjoy it
Sep 25 2021,positive,funny and lots of action awesome cgi effects  the main character is a funny loser type who is very human and an excellent nuanced actor
Sep 17 2021,positive,so fresh why thirty
Sep 16 2021,positive,i loved it why is it hated let there be carnage is coming out too
Sep 11 2021,positive,really awesome violent marvel movie everything abby it was amazing like the acting scenery plot kills and even the chose of monster was excellent  55  1010 in my opinion
Sep 8 2021,negative,this movie is awful in many ways didnt enjoy it that much
Sep 7 2021,positive,a great entertaining thrilling film filled with action and stunning visual effects dont trust the critics with this one
Sep 6 2021,positive,awesome movie cant wait for venom 2
Sep 5 2021,positive,the plot is super generic but the relationship between venom and eddie brook make this a fun watch
Sep 4 2021,positive,awesome movie poor critics wouldnt know a good movie if it was staring them in the face i cant wait to see what becomes of venom well done to everyone involved in this film
Sep 1 2021,positive,despite the critic review i really enjoyed this movie hilarious 
Aug 31 2021,positive,its a solid movie though they needed to go all the way with venom  they held back too much with this one  dont listen to people say its a marvel movie the movie rights are owned by sony so it is not done by the mcu
Aug 30 2021,positive,the low quality is very evident and does not feel professional very solid start with a fine villain at first which is later rushed like everything else quite shocking how everything goes downhill once venom shows up
Aug 25 2021,negative,that is not venom it does not have the character the presence or the spirit of venom it is just a cheap copy sony did not bother to wait to loan the character to marvel so that they could do something much better   tom hardy is a good actor but a good actor was not enough to save this piece of garbage  a sad hastily lazily thrown together cashgrab
Aug 24 2021,positive,its called venom there doesnt need to be spiderman that doesnt make it automatically good you came to see venom and thats what you got movie is a bit slow at the start but after he gets the symbiote its tight
Aug 21 2021,positive,venom and eddie make for a fun duo but its not enough when the rest is just meh and generic
Aug 17 2021,positive,excellent very fun to watch hardy is amazing needed to be r rated 
Aug 10 2021,negative,mediocre film with some bright spots id recommend watching upgrade instead it has a similar plot but executed better 
Aug 5 2021,positive,despite the serious holes in the script venom is a fun and humorous origin story with tom hardy fitting in perfectly as eddie brock 710
Jul 30 2021,positive,a flick that you cant stop yourself from loving with its loveable duo venom suffers from some very noticeable flaws a villain thats hot garbage no real character arcs in any of the cast and some questionable story telling decisions but thats all forgiven when looking at the two leads eddie brock and venom and the chemistry they have the relationship they have is hilarious wholesome and absolutely brilliant just those two alone make this movie worth watching and if that doesnt sound impressive enough both characters were performed by tom hardy who couldve thought that someone would be capable of making such a likeable duo all alone truly phenomenal
Jul 29 2021,positive,movie was very good fight comedy entertainment everything is there carnage is very good for sequel in venom let there be carnage there is mulligan who is toxin shriek is girlfriend of carnage not happy because there is no spiderman in this movie maybe spiderman will be in sony villain universe  in morbius and venom let there be carnage and in sony upcoming movie venom was box office success and highest grossing film of 2018 and i also heard venom let there be carnage also have a sequel
Jul 28 2021,positive,stupid but lots of fun
Jul 28 2021,negative,a dull and utterly predictable film that features unimaginably terrible dialogue a wasted cast and rushed character development all rounding up into a disaster of a film
Jul 27 2021,positive,a fun and incredible film with tom hardy being the real star this film has terrifying and suspenseful moments mixed with comedic scenes that will have you laughing and clenching yourself while your heart races along with great action sequences the stakes dont seem that big and sometimes the films sequences arent that epic or they are stretched but overall a great film
Jul 24 2021,positive,slightly less comedy more dark and this movie would have been amazing
Jul 18 2021,negative,tom hardy is not the person for this role it all felt out of place the acting was forced and the plot was dumb 22
Jul 16 2021,positive,is venom a ridiculous movie yes most definitely but while the serious movie goer may be extremely disappointed if you were just seeing this to have a good time you will not be disappointed hardys performance is simply amazing once again proving himself to be one of the more likeable actors in the industry funny goofy but also serious he plays both eddie brock and venom with 100 commitment and it pays off the only issues are an especially weak villian and a dull first act but once the sinister symbiote latches on the former reporter the good times begin
Jul 6 2021,positive,genuinely a surprising good movie the only critic i can give is the journalistic moments of tom hardys eddie brock are less than believable i went in with fresh eyes not knowing much about the source material and really enjoyed the story of the relationship between eddie and venom
Jul 4 2021,positive,getting the negative out of the way firstthe pacing is just off almost all of the time and the plot devices and character motivations are really sloppy however what is done with the relationship  between venom and eddie brock is one of the more fun villain stories in recent comic book movies despite tom hardy being waaaaaaay too old to satisfy my selfish need for spiderman and his peers to be college age or younger he does a good job with the character and is enjoyable to watch  as is michelle williams all in all yes venom couldve been a lot better but i think it sets up a lot of potential for a fun mini sony marvelverse of spiderman villains over the next few years
Jul 3 2021,positive,such a good movie cant wait for the 2nd one im so annoyed at the critic reviews its just goes to show critics dont know what theyre on about critics didnt seem to like it but the 850 million box office and audience rating goes to show how good of a movie it is if youre a critic reading this  get lost no one likes you
Jul 2 2021,positive,with a confusing plot lack of character development and too many tonal changes this film isnt perfect but it still has some heart with the chemistry between eddie and venom
Jul 2 2021,positive,it was a joy to watch tom hardy go nuts i have never read american superhero comics except for 1 spiderman issue and i do not care how accurate or inaccurate it is to the source material the movie was fun and years later i still like to rewatch it which is what a good movie means to me
Jun 28 2021,negative,if you think superhero movies are stupid but decide to make one anyway just for the money you get this    its not venom  it is just something the director decided to make and call it venom
Jun 27 2021,negative,yeah its pretty bad
Jun 22 2021,negative,very stupid movie do not watch it unless you are goin to make fun of this stand a lone spiderman villain movie  sony is desperate for spiderman i will admit tom hardy is a good actor and the cgi is really good other than that it is flaming trash which is a big part of this movie like how did venom survive a loud firey explosion
Jun 21 2021,negative,if you are a venom fan or a marvel fan or a comic book fan in general dont just dont tom hardy is always great but no
Jun 19 2021,positive,the critic review is quite low but thats likely only due to the fact that it takes a while to develop everyone and sometimes feels like its missing something however its still a great movie that i definitely recommend watching
Jun 19 2021,positive,great film watched it 5 times cant wait for the sequel its all the good things the mcu could be if they werent catering for young children
Jun 17 2021,positive,yes its nothing new but i love this film
Jun 14 2021,negative,tom hardy is the only one good thing in this movie he does everything to pull something good and he succeeds why no r rated movie this could be very good
Jun 8 2021,positive,amazing movie the only reason why it has such a low critic score is because it has some plot and pacing issues but most of the audience doesnt really care about that what matters to the audience is that this movie is very entertaining i love the bond between eddie and venom and venom vs riot managed to work despite it being a really dark fight cant wait for venom 2
May 29 2021,positive,just another case of pretentious critics not allowing themselves to enjoy the movie for what it is great darkcomedic antihero movie with some scenes that really dont hold back graphically loved this movie every time ive seen
May 29 2021,positive,i think people give venom a bad rep this film isnt perfect but it certainly dose not  deserve the tomato meter score it got tom hardy does an amazing job playing both eddie and venom the duo is very enjoyable on screen the villain could have been a lot better and its clear certain characters are only there to deliver context and keep the plot moving and none of them are memorable expect eddie and venom the first half is pretty boring and slow but as soon as eddie and venom bond the film gets a lot better this movie is like set up for the next one it gets everything out of the way so we can do the good stuff going further and i am exited for the next one still holding our for the r rating though
May 26 2021,positive,despite what the critics thought i actually love this movie while its definitely not flawless the movie is still an action packed humorous adventure its not exactly comicbook accurate and the lack of spidey may disappoint some fans but tom hardy did an amazing job portraying eddie brockvenom i found the venom from 2007 topher grace played him to be a bit of a disappointment he looked more like spiderman than actually venom from the comics but this venom is a lot more bulkier larger and more funny id definitely recommend this to any symbiote fans
May 25 2021,positive,fun and interesting venoms personality and his relationship to eddie is charming and endearing and the movie itself is wonderfully shot my only real complaint is how fast the movie moves leaving us with very little time to enjoy this story
May 24 2021,positive,venom isnt a perfect movie but its an entertaining one venom in the movie isnt great but he isnt terrible tom hardy does a great performance as eddie brock of course the action in this movie is pretty entertaining  my personal favorite is the swat scene  venoms design is very accurate and the villain riotcarlton drake is not the best villain but he is good enough i recommend this movie for how entertaining it is610
May 24 2021,positive,this movie is not a masterpiece but its very good i think its a   really good start for sonys universe of marvel characters there are some plot holes in the film but it is still really enjoyable movie by the way acting of tom hardy is perfect cant wait to see him in the sequel
May 23 2021,positive,i think this is a underrated movie its a good way to show the audience a new lifestyle for venom
May 23 2021,negative,a disappointing and truly obscene film tom hardy may not perform even a bad performance but otherwise its a disappointing and terrible film nothing to add
May 22 2021,positive,dont care what the haters say this movie is a fun ride i cant wait for spiderman to enter the picture but venomhardy totally can handle a movie on their own the silliness and camp was appropriate for a comic movie maybe the critics didnt read the comics
May 17 2021,negative,this movie just wasnt that good aside from finally seeing a visually cool live action venom on screen i genuinely dont understand how people liked this movie i thought tom hardy who is great came off laughably bad it seems like they were trying to go for a deadpool dark humor vibe and it just didnt land the portions of the movie where they were going for funny failed miserably and other moments that i think were played seriously made me laugh out loud the villain was incredibly generic and disinteresting file this under a bad movie that i enjoyed when i saw it but have never gone back to watch it again which says everything i need to know about the quality i almost gave it 3 stars because there were enough cool moments that i enjoyed the initial viewing but i just couldnt do it
May 15 2021,positive,venom is a good attempt to start a universe without spiderman its a really fun movie if you turn your brain off a little bit but despite being a good movie it still sins in some ways like the beginning of the movie its boring boring but when venom appears the film becomes a true romantic comedy  venom needs eddie and eddie needs venom its a great love relationship between these two the action of the film is good it is up to standard but the villain and the secondary characters are weak and not at all engaging critic tries to find problems in a film that wants to be crude and even simple but she does not understand that this film is not a hero film
May 15 2021,negative,this movie is awful im not sure who the target audience is because the mcu marvel universe is fantastic and targets everyone this sony film is the worst movie i have seen in a long time
May 15 2021,positive,i have recently rewatched venom and i still think its a really good movie definitely should see it if your into deadpool like movies
May 14 2021,positive,actually really good
May 13 2021,positive,i think the critics are smoking something cause this movie slaps
May 13 2021,neutral,5010  poorinferioramateurish    seen on 51321
May 13 2021,positive,a great film that pairs comedy and action it reminded me of dead pool tom hardy was amazing however it wouldve been a bit better if it was r rated
May 12 2021,positive,best movie of 2018 for me i like the story the visuals the cgi people took to much criticism for this movie but i love the film im excited for the new venom movie coming this year
May 11 2021,positive,i really loved the first venom movie and cant wait for the second one its a great adaption of venom
May 10 2021,negative,this is one of a handful of movies that made me fall asleep boring and messy just pointless and unauthentic story all around a movie that couldve done well in the early 00s
May 10 2021,positive,i would say this movie was decent but were is the blood the gore and i wanted to see the other symbiotes in the movie
May 10 2021,negative,i think this is one of the worst superhero movie ive ever seen not only how bad it was but after all this time and the lifting of the superhero movie level to such a high degree these movies have no business being this bad ever again this might have done ok in the 80s but dont we know better now
May 10 2021,positive,its good i enjoyed it the best part of the movie is the dialogue between eddy and venom when its not doing that or theres not like an action sequence then its just kind a like eh
May 9 2021,positive,i wasnt excited to watch this one but ended up enjoying it thanks to all the humour
May 9 2021,positive,the film isnt awful but it isnt good either ill definitely see the sequel tho
May 5 2021,neutral,510 given sonys lack of quality spiderman product since the spiderman 2 of my youth i wasnt getting my hopes up for a return to form and while it served me well to quell my expectations venom was a fairly funny chatoicbutstillfun flick its empty headed and relies on the mcus formula without the direction to make it stick but tom hardy carries the film with a physical and understatedly hilarious performance the plot is as generic as it gets  an evil tech mogulpsuedo genius tries wielding ultrapowerful space goo for his own twisted purposes and faces resistance from an antihero who also has a space goo it didnt feel fresh and many of the action scenes gave me whiplash but the action scenes that didnt were a good time the cgi and special effects varied in quality from good to noticeably out of place i was entertained enough that i would see a sequel but might also forget when it finally comes to theaters
May 4 2021,positive,tom hardy kills it in this role great amazing special effects and awesome symbiote action what venom shouldve been like in live action all along
May 2 2021,positive,critics are wrong once again this is a great adaptation of venom we just need a couple more movies to tell to the story
Apr 18 2021,positive,tad more serious and darker then im in love
Apr 15 2021,positive,it maybe due to the fact im a huge venom fanboy but i dont give a shit venom is one of my favorite marvel movies to date being a movie where you mainly just watch to have fun with it cant wait to see venom take on his son carnage in the sequel
Apr 8 2021,positive,9010 this is one of my fav films in the smu tom hardy makes a pretty good venom the cgi is a big improvement over the 2007 version the action is shot very well and the dialogue between eddie and venom is hilarious
Apr 8 2021,positive,this movie is absolutely fantastic i am so sick of critics with their head so far up their asses because they went to a film school they forget what its like to see a movie without thinking about stupid shit the average person doesnt think about  this movie is awesome its funny there is the no toxic masculinity and if this series follows the comic book series to any extent it will have lgbtq representation because in the comics whether you like it or not eddie and venom are a cannon couple eddie breaks up with his girlfriend and in the beginning of the movie or rather she breaks up with him later she has a boyfriend his name is dan and he is a doctor and at no point is he concerned about her hanging around addie he is only concerned with eddies wellbeing and he is not threatened or upset by her ex and its really wholesome critics know nothing and are useless for the most part whenever i follow critic reviews i often find that the movie is dry and boring and not at all entertaining however when i follow the reviews of real people the movie is almost always great because real people know how to watch a fucking movie and not think they could do it better
Apr 4 2021,positive,cinema sins said to give it a look so i did its a shame i feel like someone on the team wanted to make this something special but the suits wanted it to be pg and appeal to the masses the disparity between tom hardys acting and the rest of the cast is jarring dialogue is terrible this is an alien entity that shouldnt give a dam about humanity every now and again you can see hints of this but its not consistent at all i would say watch it as a case study of taking a cool idea and turning it into something mediocre
Apr 3 2021,positive,i was drawn to this one by hardy and ahmed two fine actors who i highly respect despite the negative critic reviews i am not entirely sure why this one was so hated it was certainly short meaning it never dragged tom hardy gives a committed performance even if his surroundings dont always add up some of the plotting and action felt messy certainly the villain of ahmed never really compelled me even though there was potential with the climate change parasitic human angle the motivation and fleshing out of other characters apart from eddie fell victim to hectic plotting and general madness hardy as the symbiote and brock is immensely likeable so this pulls the film through for me if i had to briefly sum this one up it would be as ultimately underrated but not great
Apr 1 2021,positive,i get why critics didnt like it but the acting and dark humor works tom hardys eddie brock is fantastic what the movie lacks in origin cannon it makes up for it in originality and i can visualize how the story is playing out
Apr 1 2021,positive,it was really good movie  i cant what for venom let their be carnage to come out
Mar 31 2021,positive,this movie was fun i thoroughly enjoyed this film enjoyed it more than the last few spider man movies which i find to sappy
Mar 31 2021,negative,the first hour was so bad i almost gave up horrible pacing horrible editing horrible acting horrible writing the last hour was okay but with all the same problems
Mar 30 2021,positive,such an amazing movie and what a fresh take on eddie brock by tom hardy australian theatres missed out on the head bites but at least we got the full glory on bluray so excited for let there be carnage
Mar 29 2021,positive,a fun and entertaining film but not the venom movie we wanted
Mar 28 2021,positive,i think it was very good but extremely dark the darkness is why it got such a poor score people dont like dark stuff
Mar 24 2021,positive,venom is definitely not a perfect movie but i just dont see why the critics hate it the characters are very well developed and i kind of like this new superherohorror genre that people are starting to make
Mar 18 2021,positive,this movie is good it has a simple plot but it is entertaining its effects are good and the character design is incredible
Mar 18 2021,negative,this movie is the literal antichrist there was obvious editing mistakes terrible writing and some of the worst acting ever put on film i cant believe that a studio greenlit this and oscar worthy actors agreed to be in it the postcredit scene is also shamefully bad with a horrible cameo of woody harrelson doing his best carrot top impression
Mar 18 2021,negative,this movie was not good i love the character and tom hardy but this was a dumpster fire dont know why this was pg13 it made it super awkward especially when eddy had to shove his whole head inside the toilet to avoid showing onscreen vomit halfway through the movie my son broke out in an awful rash and i had to take him to the bathroom briefly to rub ointment on him that bathroom break felt like a gift from heaven the whole time i was in there i prayed that god would give my eyes my sons rash before we walked back into the theater but god is cruel also carnage looked like annie and now humanity deserves covid
Mar 17 2021,positive,venom is probably the best so far spiderman villain standalone movie ever venom looked so scary and sounded so scary i liked how they treated the villain as they should the music however the soundtrack didnt sound like it belonged there the music mostly sounded like it belonged to an actual spiderman film i am going to give venom a b
Mar 15 2021,positive,very entertained much better than some highrated disney movies lol
Mar 13 2021,positive,good enough ive seen it more than once what more has to be said than that
Mar 12 2021,positive,this move is pretty well constructed the plot is great and its filled with action it definitely meets my expectation of one of spidermans worst enemies venom
Mar 9 2021,negative,in the comics it was about the tragedy of eddie and how hes being taken advantage of and manipulated by venom for its personal gain in the movie they just play buddy cop its a shame how a complex and cool character was used in such a poorly way
Mar 8 2021,positive,yet another reason why to never pay attention to critic reviews  i watched because the audience reviews were so good  this movie was so fun  tom hardy was amazing as eddie brock  the character venom was amazing  i cannot wait for the sequel
Feb 23 2021,negative,the plot is lackluster but the action is okay couldve been helped by an r rating tom hardy doesnt have a lot to work with but is fine given the circumstances venom is at times quite entertaining but his motivation which on paper is interesting enough is not built up properly riz ahmed also poses a very generic and boring villain riot is a little better but also lacks proper buildup venom and eddie brock are set up well for later films but the road there is hardly worth revisiting
Feb 23 2021,positive,tom hardy joins the marvel universe as eddie brock gritty reporter based in san francisco who gets inadvertently bonded with an alien symbiote which transforms him into venom  i hadnt heard anything good about this however i didnt find it that bad sure its not as great as most of the other marvel offerings but hardy does a good job and is surrounded by great actors such as michelle williams and riz ahmed
Feb 15 2021,positive,it wasnt a good movie but its fun especially  if you want to watch a dumb cheesey action movie to kill some time
Feb 15 2021,positive,i loved this movie it had action comedy fantasy science fiction it was a super movie good lead actors
Feb 14 2021,neutral,venom is the definition of ok
Feb 13 2021,positive,people that do these reviews have to be the ideology of the 40 year old version when your review is a quarter of what the standard watches rates then you are a nit picky pathetic of shit
Feb 8 2021,positive,surprisingly good action hero movie with a real shittylooking tom hardy even has some jokes built in very entertaining
Feb 7 2021,neutral,disaster except for tom hardys eyepopping performance
Feb 5 2021,positive,cheesily entertaining
Feb 2 2021,positive,it doesnt matter whether its a spinoff or a remake its worth watching anyway   venom is a superhero film directed by ruben fleischer it is based on marvel comics  it stars tom hardy as edward brock michelle williams as anne weying and rizwan ahmed as dr carlton drake it was filmed in atlanta and new york venom was released in the us on october 5 2018  it is the first film in sony pictures universe of marvel characters the film has ranked r because there are a lot of fights and blood but there is humor too    the film is about 2 aliens that were delivered from deep space to earth for research   they are simbiots they have not got their own form and should be integrated into the human body  one of them riot wants to deliver all simbiots to earth and capture all humans   another venom integrated into the body of journalist eddy brock wants to stay the only unique and most powerful creature on earth    this film is different from the rest because there are confrontations between evil with more powerful evil  if you like special effects superheroes and black humor i strongly recommend seeing this film  we are venom
Jan 29 2021,positive,amazing the only thing that i didnt like is all the cursing and the first about 42 minutes are kinda boring in my opinion i would definitely check out this movie if you havent already
Jan 23 2021,neutral,theres mindless marvel movies that are entertaining and then theres these off marvel type movies that are just bad for only being two years old this seems like a movie from 2012 everything about this movie screams budget and mediocre but these movie people dont have to try when they use source material already with a following and a base of a story directort screenwriter etc everyone should be embarrassed
Jan 23 2021,positive,tom hardy super cool
Jan 19 2021,negative,tom hardy putters and sputters around as eddie brock which is terrible because the actual character of eddie brock is nothing like his portrayal its just not believable in the lesst the lines are poorly written the pacing is terrible and there are no real interesting moments the fights are ok but the whole hero vs villain with same powers thing is too heavy in the fight scenes
Jan 17 2021,negative,sad yet predictable turn for the marvel franchise a movie with some great special effects but little else doesnt deserve to exist unless it makes a killing in the box office this one had a cume of 856 million worldwide until that changes expect more films like these to be made
Jan 13 2021,positive,the recreation of the character is very well worked scenes well made the only problem is that in this movie venom is a good guy and that throws away all thats good no one forgets that venom is the foe
Jan 10 2021,positive,a fun and chaotic movie
Jan 2 2021,positive,better than i anticipated it being from the messy trailer and the meh fan reception dont get me wrong this movie is still a mess especially while trying to make the origins of the character up in the absence of spiderman but this was better than i thought it would be going into it tom hardys accent is surprisingly tollerable given how i usually cant stand his attempts at american and he puts in a solid performance the cgi was janky at times and the action in general is pretty dark and dull and boring but hey it could be worse not bad but pretty much forgettable im writing this a couple of weeks after i watched it and im struggling to remember a whole lot of what happened would watch again but im in no rush to
Jan 2 2021,positive,the first 20 minutes were a bit slow but then the next 70 minutes really got me into the movie with a lot of action surprisingly good
Jan 1 2021,negative,awful venom has 20 minutes of screen time and the crunchy script just didnt help the pg 13 rating really made this movie null and void
Jan 1 2021,positive,god this movie is great sure its plot is kind of cheesy and contrived but tom hardy really went all into this role and frankly it makes this movie so much fun the monsterfucker rep we all needed and none of us deserved 1010 this is a classic i will watch forever dont watch if you want to be intellectual just watch to have some fun
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie is entertaining  funny in spots but is it good i dont think so  as a movie it is lackluster and all over the place  i could watch a garbage fire and be entertained this movie felt like that  the vfxs are good and hardys acting is the only thing that saves the movie  the first few minutes are nonsense and should have been cut the villain is not scary at all symbiote powers are inconsistent with unclear rules for bonding  and whos idea was it to have an allblack character fight a grey one at night  the character needs spiderman to be interesting and nuanced otherwise it is slightly better than fanfic
Dec 27 2020,negative,if only the story was as good as this stunning visual representation of venom
Dec 23 2020,negative,sorry i have to agree with the critics on this one
Dec 18 2020,negative,though it has some really cool effects and action venom is not the best written its characters and story elements that dont make a lot of sense and it honestly feels like its being forced at gunpoint to be more like other superhero movies than a unique film about an engaging antiheroic character
Dec 17 2020,positive,formulaic and unsurprising but an easy watch popcorn flick with a promising start and a plot that unravels in its messy third act
Dec 17 2020,positive,is the movie good the only problem is that events happen very quickly the script is not badly done because everything is well connected but everything happens very fast without time of emergence and development
Dec 16 2020,positive,i think this film has so much wasted potential tom hardy is great in it and theres a couple of fun scenes hopefully this can be built upon in the sequel
Dec 15 2020,positive,the trailer made me think this was gonna be scary and edgy but it came out as a very funny actionpacked and emotional film that is a mustsee
Dec 10 2020,positive,it was a good movie   even though it doesnt connect much to comic books it was a fun movie the relationship betweenw edie and venom was the best    the negative sides of the movie was the script could be tighter more character info on riot could have been there  the vfx and the climax action was average   other than these thingsall were good in this movie a 2 time watch for sure     355 stars
Dec 8 2020,positive,i found it enjoyable fun sure it can be cheesy some times but the action is amazing the chis okay there is one scrape i love though when he fights those fbi guys outside one of the buildings that was great i dont like the girlfriend she has bad dialogue but the actor that plays her is pretty good just the dialogue and the post credit scene was good
Dec 4 2020,positive,this movie makes an interest and something new
Dec 3 2020,negative,ugly special effects and a lame script its like watching a movie version of tekken street fighter with a story written by a 9 year old love riz ahmed and slate but theyre babies cast to play parts that are 27 years older than them
Dec 3 2020,positive,a very fun movie if you dont take it too seriously everyone is complaining about the first act but i found it ok if you like tom hardy youll get through it dont worry some very funny jokes along the way and the relationship between toms character and venom is really entertaining and dare i say even wholesome at times ill definitely watch it again with some friends
Nov 29 2020,positive,this movie is fantastic cant believe the negative reviews venoms comments were funny throughout the movie and it was action packed both my wife and i  loved this movie cant wait for the second one
Nov 27 2020,positive,this movie got great
Nov 27 2020,positive,i really enjoyed it its ridiculous and a bit cheesy and but i think that gave it a certain gritty charm  some of the humour was obvious and immature but having that be woven through the fight scenes and chase scenes made it incredibly amusing i dont laugh out loud at movies often but i did multiple times during this movie  it does have a little bit of a low budget feel in places which is a shame and its pretty obvious there were some reshoots that dont quite match up i would love to see an extended cut or a directors cut of this film  if youre looking for a funny kind of ridiculous dark humour action flick i think you could definitely do worse than this
Nov 24 2020,positive,the heck wrong with the critics tho
Nov 19 2020,positive,venom was such a funny and amazing movie i was a bit hesitant of watching this movie because of how divided the scores were but i decided to watch it an i had such a fun time watching it the comedy scenes hit the nail on the head the action scenes were very well choreographed and venom himself was an amazing herovillain the final battle was pretty good i think it could of been better but overall i think it was pretty good all the characters are amazing and the stan lee cameo was funny and well played there really isnt any bad lines or any scenes that make me cringe overall this is a fun and a very good film and i would highly recommend it
Nov 15 2020,positive,a good story of a chaotic hero as venom is not a villain nor a hero although not sophisticated venom is a great action movie that combines great fight scenes with a fascinating plot
Nov 14 2020,positive,cinematic masterpiece lol so fun so funny yeah the pacing is weird yeah theres some wonky cg but its a fun movie i can sit down and watch this movie without knowing anything about venom and still enjoy the film i loved that they dodged the jealous boyfriend cliche and made doctor dan a good person also the lobster tank scene is hysterical and i loved this movie
Nov 11 2020,negative,i understand that some people find it funny and entertaining i dont the pacing is so weird in this movie sometimes it feels like its going super fast and then too slow the characters are too one dimensional and the story is below average for a comic book movies it has all the clichés when it was supposed to be an anti hero film something different     and the third act is just so boring you cant even understand the cgi fight they made and i didnt even care for anyone for me it is a huuuuge disappointment and i love venom the character i just hope the second movie gets better but watching that people seem to like it as it is i doubt that we will get a strong writting or something like that so sad
Nov 9 2020,negative,just awful what were they thinking no script
Nov 8 2020,negative,movie had a ton of potential too bad they made it pg13
Nov 7 2020,positive,great action movie enjojable plot very good performance by tom hardy
Nov 2 2020,positive,venom is an amazing nonmcu marvel movie and its effects are amazing the lack of spiderman can be a definite turnoff but venom has always shown to be able to carry solo adventures without peter tom hardy as eddie brock is amazing casting and brock is one of the best versions of this character riot is a bit boring to the average viewer but to someone who reads the comic hes a nice pull venom also sets up perfectly for a sequel with the introduction of cletus kassidy and as a comic book fan i cannot be more happy with this movie funny intriguing and an amazing testament to the possibilities of sonys marvel movies
Oct 29 2020,positive,i thought sony did a fantastic job setting up venom in this movie they were able to create an amazing storyline for him that kept the audience tuned in throughout the entire movie and also succeeded in keeping a comedic aspect this was the perfect way to start their new universe and the fact that they were able to create a such an amazing story for venom without a dependence upon spiderman is even more impressive i also felt as though they did a great job setting up venom 2 and i cant wait to see what they have in store next    additionally the fact that eminem made a song for this was insane
Oct 28 2020,positive,i think that venom did a great job of making it feel crazy which is the main complaint about it but it is a movie about a reporter named eddie brock who has become the host for the alien symbiote venom venom changes brock and even starts to make him go crazy he hears all of these inner thoughts from venom and that is why the movie is supposed to be crazy venom is a fantastic crazy and actionpacked movie
Oct 27 2020,positive,mostly a ton of fun the city chase with exploding drones and superfluous dialogue was beyond ridiculous but a fun night overall
Oct 16 2020,negative,genuinely thought it was a comedy for most of the film but it was very easy to follow thanks to almost constant exposition
Oct 14 2020,negative,venom is disappointing now i am not gonna be crying because spiderman is not in it but rather that this movie is just all over the place it did not really need to exist especially without spiderman or better producers this movie had a lot of potential i like the writers and the director i just think this movie got ruined by the studio and the producers the movie is entertaining but nothing more than mindless entertainment the movie is filled with plotholes and the characters besides venom and eddie are boring and one dimensional the action is basic and the villain is very forgettable and very boring if this movie had a better villain i would have given this a higher score critics dont hate on this movie cause they were paid to they hate on this movie because it has very little character development and growth i really wanted to like this movie its just hard to like it with all the problems cause they are a lot the only positive i have are some of the jokes and eddie and venom everything else is bad and needs to be fixed so 410 should have made a movie with art in mind instead of toys
Oct 7 2020,positive,venom is a better film than i expected given the bad bad reviews some critics i was expecting the worst but the movie is enjoyable it starts off slow and takes a while to get going but once it does venom fans will probably have a good time theres lots of action and venom creates the comic book character well its not the best comic book movie out there some pacing issues and just average special effects but its still fun time
Oct 7 2020,positive,a good start for the sony studio to partner with marvel studios and make a crossover with the spiderman universe
Oct 5 2020,positive,i love it its a great action pack movie with a little bit of a horror theme to it its great to see venom back on the big screen
Oct 1 2020,positive,venom is a weird weird flick with a notable tonal change once venom actually comes on the scene and how you feel about the movie may depend on how you feel about that change
Oct 1 2020,positive,it wasnt that bad if they added spiderman or even just a cameo it wouldve been better
Sep 29 2020,positive,funny and entertaining excited for the sequel
Sep 25 2020,negative,so generic so boring and her wig is terrible
Sep 23 2020,positive,im not sure why venom isnt in more marvel movies the story is great and the visuals were awesome as well i cant wait for the next ones
Sep 22 2020,positive,rotten tomatoes you are against your own rules for you allow for you critics to insult and that is a violation against your rules anyway venom was good and just like most other superhero movies it wasnt even relevant to the comics so to you top critics rearrange your priorities
Sep 19 2020,neutral,this is a fairly runofthemill superhero flick that could have been so much better given that the character of venom is very much an antiheroic figure being an evil character i found the plot very predictable and the humour puerile this could have been a refreshing change but instead was a tired drab rehash of old ideas and situations ive said it before but theres just been way too many superhero movies now and we have all just grown weary of the output
Sep 18 2020,negative,horrible dumbed down dialogue the dialogue just keeps getting pushed farther and farther to the back at times it seems this movie is not even made for an american audience its lackluster unrelatable commentary is a joke and absolutely ruined the whole movie the main character i to lame and a wimp but headbutts a goo b while tied up things just dont add up another terrible new movie id skip it
Sep 15 2020,negative,what a nonsense piece of trash i will never get how these movies get a sequel totally idiotic no respect for characters not even respect for the simplest narrative rules or construction just a wild mess of vfx looking to awe an audience that has totally lost the ability to be critical
Sep 15 2020,positive,weird awkward and kind of perverted i like it
Sep 14 2020,negative,in general youre gonna have a fun and entertaining time but most entirely due to tom hardy and his outstanding acting skills basically everything else is forgettable the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese the supporting actorsactress has low to no impact whatsoever in the plot the villain is completely blend and pointless it does a constantine way to intro the villain giving flashes during almost the whole movie that hes coming but without any backstory or meaning for us the audience to be afraid of riz does a good job trying to give life to an unknown villain that nobody cares but i definitely blame the scriptwriters
Sep 13 2020,positive,a great popcorn flick thats actionpacked funny and visually mindblowing
Sep 11 2020,positive,very fun movie had great vfx and perfect casting with tom hardy as the titular  character  this is a fantastic but oddly made movie
Sep 9 2020,positive,fun movie really entertaining and tom hardy was a great casting choice in my opinion i dont get all the critics hate cause im not familiar with the original venom character from the comic books so i just loved it for what i saw wish this had a sequel and its own franchise
Sep 8 2020,neutral,once again sony has ruined a potentially great film featuring venom thanks to far too much studio interference while tom hardy is trying his best venom is just a mess that never really establishes a tone and wont commit to an actual consistent story it has its moments of good humor but the movie does little more than simply exist
Sep 8 2020,positive,as usual the critic reviews are completely disconnected with how much i enjoyed the film  yes there were parts that were predictable but its a superhero movie  of course they save the day  it was funny wellpaced and enjoyable  not the best movie ive ever seen but id recommend it
Sep 8 2020,positive,decent cgi plus tom hardy is refreshing in this new type of role the plot is not great but it was pretty funny and corny at the same time definitely not one of the best marvel movies but it is worth watching at least once
Sep 8 2020,negative,actor sick plot fuck
Sep 8 2020,positive,its entertaining enough without taking it too seriously
Sep 8 2020,positive,not necessarily the best film out there but its a fun movie to watch and as per usual tom hardy is amazing the ending goes a bit off the rails but again you will enjoy some of the thrills at face value
Sep 6 2020,positive,its not a good movie but if you turn your brain off and have some fun with it youll have a pretty good time
Sep 6 2020,positive,i for one enjoyed this movie a good cast and not so bad story line i feel it could have been better however i enjoyed the movie once it got going
Sep 6 2020,negative,i give it a 1 star because tom hardy is my favorite otherwise i would give it a zero star its so terrible even worse than the original gozilla movie i dropped it after 40 minutes
Sep 5 2020,negative,its like fleischer had always wanted to shoot a motorcycle chase scene in san francisco no it doesnt belong in the movie but hell its sonys money who cares oh yeah all the people who had to watch this at least eminem got a track in
Sep 5 2020,negative,an incoherent mess that manages to waste michelle williams and riz ahmed tom hardy only starts to act in the last 45 minutes or so which are slightly funny
Sep 5 2020,positive,impressed with this movie it has loads of amazing action and everything
Sep 5 2020,positive,i dont know why the critics rated so low i thought this was a great movie other than the cgi being only mediocre and falling the same fate as the end fight of wonder woman and black panther just like the wonder woman movie it has a great everything else
Sep 5 2020,positive,special effects 10sound effects 05acting 05story 10
Sep 4 2020,negative,this movie sucked wow like im impressed how bad it was 81 by the audience haha thats embarrassing
Sep 3 2020,negative,absolute garbage 20years waiting for a venom movie and they create this mess 0 for dialogue 0 for character continuity best thing was seeing carnage at the end hopefully they get a better script writer
Sep 3 2020,negative,i expected venom to be at least serviceable but it really wasnt the plot was terrible predictable and has been done before many times the acting was below average certainly not tom hardys best the villain was very generic and felt fake and the other characters were uninteresting and unoriginal then the writing was flawed all over the place with there being various ridiculous plot points on the other hand the stunts were decent and the action was acceptable the visual effects werent bad the cinematography was fine and the soundtrack was ok this film is an example of whats wrong with superhero movies namely that theyre almost always nothing new just a rehash of old material
Sep 3 2020,positive,this movie shows the flaws in rotten tomatoes critics went in looking for a masterpiece audiences came in for a good time and thats what we got is it not enough to see tom hardy act completely unhinged and be entertained for two hours
Sep 3 2020,positive,tom hardy carries this film brilliantly
Sep 3 2020,positive,totally watchable hoping for a sequel as good as spiderman 2 with doctor otto octavius
Sep 2 2020,neutral,this was a  very disappointing film but it was okay at best it wasnt as awesome as i was hoping for it to be
Sep 1 2020,positive,venom actually felt better to me when i saw it for the first time in the theatre now i rewatched it and its not that good anymore but still tom hardy played everything out of this role maybe the second one will get better still an enjoyable ride for nearly 2 hours its actually pretty short for a superhero movie cause they mostly have a running time from over 2 hours  rating 33
Aug 31 2020,positive,very average movie it felt very corny and less engaging than other films of the same genre the type of film that tried to cram romance humor action and sci fi into one yet ticks none of the boxes watched it because it was endorsed by tom hardy felt let down due to the plot without giving spoilers away
Aug 31 2020,negative,belief was suspended when a hypersonic craft crash lands and remains partially intactwtf  riz ahmed is no baddie he was just as unbelievable in bourne the picture is as mad as a bag of frogs just nuts i think there may be an omission from tom hardys resume along with capone  and now a venom sequel  needs to be careful with his career hes following the payday and not the craft imho he hasnt had a star turn since the drop
Aug 31 2020,negative,if it had either had a bigger connection to spiderman or had gone for an r rating i might have forgiven this movie a bit more but as is its corny thinly scripted and dull
Aug 31 2020,positive,i liked venom a lot and think tom hardy was a great choice excited for number 2 and carnage
Aug 30 2020,positive,being a mcu fan was not sure of this after the last 2 sony spider man films  however both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised by th one
Aug 30 2020,positive,before i get into this review ill be talking about spoilers and my thoughts right before this film in the theater right before the movie i really was hyped and before when i watched the trailers i wasnt hyped at all but for some reason right before this movie i was hyped great fantastic fun sony marvel movie starring tom hardy and michelle williams so first five minutes of the movie were really really dumb and almost ruined the movie for me i dont know whos idea it was too but that in the beginning but if your curious just watch the movie for yourself tom hardy is amazing in this and pretty much steals the show every scene that hes in im really invested in eddie brock and tom hardy s portrayal is perfect i cant picture anybody else in that role venom is cool as well and i thought that all that cgi would ruin him but nope its good and spoiler warning when he takes over michelle williams s character annie its amazing its hilarious this movie had a ton of jokes and i dont know if they were intentional but it didnt feel forced or flat at any time it felt very smooth but in every movie their is always a bad part or bad characters the villian sucked and his motivation is cringe and whats the big deal about second fake rip off venom  i wanted carnage to be the villian but well have to wait for the sequel
Aug 30 2020,positive,this movie is hot garbage i love it
Aug 29 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this film the effects were pretty good im hoping for another one 
Aug 28 2020,positive,while its story is very straightforward and the acting can be pretty bad at times venom definitely makes up for it with fantastic visuals and a decent approach to the source material
Aug 28 2020,positive,hardy gets into a alloutpowerful plot but gets in conflict with a idiotic misterious and dark character which the audience thought would be much darker and with a far better language the script is so badly written for the actual character venom that leaves him as being between a dork and a mentally stupid being  while the plot is ambitious they didnt exploit the full potential of it
Aug 28 2020,positive,critics  take the broomstick outta yer arses lol i mean its funny and good fun    as much a comedy as an action movie if you watch the trailer you can hardly be thinking this is going to be any kind of serious movie    hardy is good as the lead    dont feel the need to watch it again but there are plenty worse ways to spend time on a wet grey and cold day
Aug 28 2020,negative,dull and formulaic plenty of crash bang wallop but no substance
Aug 28 2020,positive,rewatched the film on netflix i have to say i love the film good introduction to a new character in the marvel universe i found it on par with deadpool similar but not the same in the mode of the antihero its a fun film ok the plot is not outstanding but as i have said its a introduction film to the character got high hopes for future venom movies
Aug 27 2020,negative,weird that in a post mcu world such a throwback to the superhero films of the early 2000s can feel almost original sadly that does not stop this film from being pretty pretty bad i did not like it at all
Aug 27 2020,positive,the best venom movie yet
Aug 27 2020,negative,weak plot and corny acting tom hardy slightly better than rest of cast
Aug 26 2020,positive,when i went to watch the movie i expected spiderman and some more marvel characters but it was still a really good movie with its own storyline regardless venom is a great actionscifi movie that shows that even the most real people can have a different side that is just as murderous as joseph stalin the plot really added to the movie as there were hundreds of ways to make this movie but this was one of if not the best way the main character is venomeddie brock who was just a regular guy until he got attached to by the symbiote known as venom who gave him great powers but also has the ability to take over eddie at will and can force him to do any number of things including eating live creatures to satisfy venoms own hunger the range of camera shots and animation is top notch as it would just be a regular guy doing regular things but because of the animation and special effects eddie is able to do some seemingly superhuman feats of strength and endurance the best scene in the movie in my opinion was when eddievenom was in a dairy and some guy was trying to rob them but then he turned into venom gave the guy a lecture threatened him to all hell and finally killed the guy before walking out and explaining to the cashier ive got a parasite the most memorable bit from that scene was when the thief asked what are you and venom split his face so that half of eddies face was showing and then they both smiled in unison and menacingly said we are venom i would recommend this film to anyone that wants a fresh new actionvillain movie with a couple of old characters but done in an entirely good movie this movie is related to most other marveldc movies because it shows that no matter how well you know a person you probably dont know everything about them
Aug 26 2020,negative,what a load of crap am i right guys
Aug 26 2020,negative,its a pretty good film but from the first introduction of a symbiote i keep getting a sense of familiarity and as the film progressed i came to realise that it felt familiar because it was the entire film is a poorly westernised recreation of parasyte and copies all plot related to the aliens exactly the only difference being they ensured they could ring as much money as possible out of it by choosing to use a cliffhanger ending instead of parasytes dignified and well written one
Aug 26 2020,positive,awesome looking forward to the new one
Aug 26 2020,negative,just bad i turned it off after carlton sent his goons to get eddie and commited drone warfare in a us city in reality a cia black ops team would find carlton take him to guantanamo bay and torture him for the serious terrorist attack he commited other ridiculous things include cars  jumping off bridges without even a scratch or bumper damage let alone suspension problems dont bother watching
Aug 26 2020,positive,it would have been good to be a part of the spiderverse but pretty good on its own
Aug 23 2020,positive,venom gets a little cliche at times with over the top cardrone chases but this movie was so enjoyable tom hardy does a fantastic job selling the crazy guy with alien voice in his head act
Aug 21 2020,positive,it has some really great parts and ideas and a lot of lame action scenes the first chase is great but feels seriously copied from into the spider verse
Aug 11 2020,negative,im honestly personally insulted that any spiderman fan can sit down stomach this movie and then come out of it saying it was anything more than garbage as far as i know only those who dont know much about spiderman nor the series even liked it which is probably why the audience score is that unfathomably high i wish this got shot in the knee and didnt exist because i really looked forward to this for years only for it to be horribly edited produced the story to be garbage venom to be ooc and there be no spiderman  in a venom origin story  this is not how you start a universe the critics are perfectly justified and i have no hopes for the next movies wish sony had the actual guts to tell disney no and make a proper universe spiderman has been besmirched for too long when will he ever return to glory when horrific movies like this are being made in his name
Aug 10 2020,positive,venom entertains you from the beginning to the end you will never be bored watching this movie  you can really get connected to venom and feel his sympathy it makes you realize some people are just evil
Aug 7 2020,positive,not a bad film if you ask me sure into the spiderverse is even better than this movie
Aug 4 2020,positive,lovable protagonist and an antagonist you love to hate some lines were cliche but its a superhero movie so no harm no foul a good time and well worth the watch
Jul 27 2020,positive,love this movie tom hardy is amazing wouldve been even better if they incorporated spiderman but they did a great job with a complicated origin story
Jul 22 2020,positive,the critics have gone bonkers over yonkers
Jul 17 2020,positive,way better than expected the villain was kind of lame but since theyre bringing venom vs carnage into the mcu next im sure the second one is going to be near perfect
Jul 15 2020,positive,way better than expected i dont know which movie the critics have watched but venom is really good you got a little bit of love comedy drama a lot of action and the feeling of a powerful duo that could destroy everyone and everything in sight is working in this movie for real fans who like their venom brutal and unstoppable this movie might dissapoint them a bit but for casual fans this should be an amazing movie adaption and for people who never read a comic this movie is still amazing for action and alien fans
Jul 14 2020,positive,i think that this by far has to be my favorite movie i am so excited for the new venom to come out it was an excellent movie
Jul 8 2020,neutral,its focused and knows what its doing the special effects and technical wizardry are on full display and the acting is okay except for the lead actress who is very unconvincing and just stands out like a sore thumb in this  basically though its just a kinda heartless movie  theres just little point to this movie beyond it being one mans struggle with himself and most people have their own struggle with their own self to worry about  maybe its because the main character isnt the one fighting the main villain in the end rather his symbiote parasite or alter ego is but i dont think this movie works beyond anything more than a footnote in the mcu or a basic popcorn flick    2 12 of 5
Jul 7 2020,positive,despite its crazy and clearly unintentional roller coaster of tones and intent the film is genuinely fun it has a couple of long wellplanned action sequences and tom hardy is unleashed
Jun 28 2020,positive,i sincerely dont get why people hate this movie
Jun 24 2020,negative,im pretty sure there are a lot of people out there who wish this movie was never made
Jun 22 2020,positive,no way venom can be bad it is a great movie to spiderman
Jun 22 2020,neutral,this movie was very disappointing but it was okay at best it wasnt as awesome as i was hoping for it to be
Jun 21 2020,neutral,yeah that wasnt good it wanted to be it tried really hard but it wasnt tom hardy also has the worst ny accent i have ever heard ok concept meh execution
Jun 21 2020,positive,venom hit all the checkboxes for being a great movie it was riveting suspenseful and had a sense of humor that makes me laugh the cgi was well done and the acting was on point i loved the development of the plot as venom adventures through earth and the contrast between the seriousness of the antagonist carlton drake compared to eddy brock tom hardy
Jun 20 2020,negative,tom hardy is one of the few bright spots of venom the filmmakers andor studio didnt want to commit to the more intense horror elements of venom and instead we get a watered down pg13 tension free cgfest that wastes a talented actor
Jun 20 2020,negative,i can honestly say i was not going to see the film with a smile on my face and a song in my heart the trailers left me cold and the dialogues sounded horrendous however some of my friends had seen it and were praising it so there was a bit of hope that it could be like deadpool and help me forget how i dislike the original comic book character    since venom like other spiderman supporting characters is still owned by sony pictures he is set apart from the marvel cinematic universe and runs no chances of ever meeting tom hollands spiderman in fact it is set in a world where peter parker and his alterego have never existed in a way it can feel odd like making a doctor doom movie without acknowledging the fantastic four or a catwoman movie without batman who would think of doing such a thing to a comic book fan the film feels like a bit of a cheat although the script by scott rosenberg jeff pinkner kelly marcel and will beall goes at length to make the narrative work without our friendly neighborhood webslinger one of my friends told me it reminded him of the superhero films from the late 90s and sure enough there is a certain simplicity to it which harkens back to those bygone days no hints at a shared universe with other costumed crimefighters streamlined borderline simplistic narrative  it certainly has shared dna with a film like spawn 1997 mark az dippé for instance not surprisingly both spawn and venom were created by todd mcfarlane    a good opportunity may have been missed when the decision was made to make the film pg13 since the very idea of a symbiotic parasitic alien taking over bodies has all the trappings of a good body horror movie and could have added a bit of bite to a film that is neither spectacular enough to compete with the superhero blockbusters that are all the rage and not scary enough to please horror fans    the movie still works as entertainment though and is mindless enough to sell plenty of pop corn the action scenes while not reinventing the wheel are inventive enough to keep us interested in particular a fun motorcycle chase however we are treated to yet another duel of the hero versus his evil doppelganger a by now rather tired trope of the superhero genre and the midcredit scene featuring a cameo by a certain former bartender is more than hinting at yet another symbiote confrontation certainly the films opening weekend recordbreaking boxoffice makes that sequel a certainty    there is a mix of horror and comedy that sometimes work pretty well thanks to director ruben fleishers affinity with the genre with his 2009 zomcom zombieland  the casting of tom hardy is an inspired one as he portrays eddie brock as a somewhat sympathetic sad sack who while imbued with a certain moral sense is far from being a hero he brings a lot of humor to the role as well as physicality his loss of control at the hands of venom who takes over his body at times brings back memories of steve martin in all of me 1984 carl reiner albeit in a more sober way the internal dialogues between the two is also often quite entertaining yet brings to light some major lack of character developments especially in venoms motivations and his progressive appreciation of earth and its people    most likely the grinning drooling nature of the creature leaves little room for pathos or subtlety in its emotional range in the mcu one can guess that the filmmakers may have tried to humanize the symbiote somewhat but here its character arc feels forced and unconvincing venoms comment about being a loser on his own planet comes off as a laughable attempt at making him more sympathetic    in the comics it took a while for venom to go from villain to antihero but he is here left with little time to achieve this and it never really rings true not that i expect a hell of a lot of depth from a snarling alien monster but it might help making it a bit more relatable somehow    the movies success and the overall popular trend of superhero movies pretty much insures we will have a sequel to venom one can only hope that there are more interesting directions to go for the character although i cant really imagine where as i still have a rather deep antipathy for venom and the film did little to sway me    overall a highly forgettable but still quite palatable entertainment not deserving of the vitriol it is receiving from critics but neither worthy of earning a prized spot in our collective cinematic memory
Jun 19 2020,positive,if youre a fan of the comic youll love it
Jun 18 2020,negative,i keep thinking on how many you are welcome were said
Jun 12 2020,negative,a complete wreck of a movie i love tom hardy but even he cant save this movie it is boringly shot has truly cringeworthy dialogue that almost made attack of the clones seem like shakespeare poor perfomances wretched boring vfx and no idea what kind of movie it wants to be or the story it wants to tell it attempts to be serious campy and funny and succeeds at none of it worst of all it is just plain not fun to watch which is related entirely to it not picking an identity and sticking with it venom as a character simply does not work without spiderman and this is painfully clear when you consider how terrible the villain is wooo the big finish is two blobs trying to outblob each other theres a good choice i cannot believe this movie made me wish for the days of topher graces rendition and that was garbage but better than this garbage tom hardy is so much better than this movie he didnt even seem to know what to do i feel bad for him the fact that this is getting a sequel just shows how idiotic most of the movie going public is worst comic book movie sonce elektra
Jun 11 2020,positive,this movie was amazing action packed amazing story and from my prospective its a must watch
Jun 9 2020,positive,venom is funny good special effects and breathtaking action scenes but the movie could be better and have fewer mistakes in the story but i recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it
Jun 5 2020,positive,so when i first heard of this movie i wasnt very excited about it and believed what the critics said id only heard how terrible the movie was so i had really low expectations and a very negative outlook on it i was sure i was gonna hate it i watched it late at night cause i was exhausted from school and bored  but after watching it i honestly loved it eddie felt like a real person reacting to venoms sudden intrusion in his life venom despite having some terrible lines sometimes honestly also feels right like its obvious venom has no concept of earth culture and is just trying to fit in as best he can they felt real and their dynamic was amusing and fun the movie gets a lot of negativity that it just doesnt deserve i loved it its got some interesting real characters a decent plot and some great dark comedy plus venom fits in with my characterization of him from the comics so overall 1010 would and have watch again i even recommended it to some friends who all liked it too so definitely go and enjoy the movie
Jun 4 2020,positive,tom hardys performance as eddie brockvenom is perfect and such at talent that needs to be in the mcu with tom hollands spiderman
Jun 4 2020,positive,honestly the movie was great hope for a second one
Jun 4 2020,neutral,this movie was not great for some reason audiences and critics disagree a lot on the quality of the movie venom as we know him was barely in it the villain was very predictable and dumb they pulled of the same trick as iron man iron man 2 captain america the first avenger and antman but this movie was not fun unlike the others the only thing lifting this film up is the strange connection between eddie and venom but all together not really great
Jun 3 2020,negative,its not spiderman 3 but why cant they just translate venom from the comics the supporting characters were useless the story weak and the social outcast venom cringeworthy
Jun 2 2020,positive,fun i enjoyed it and had some good laughs
Jun 1 2020,positive,those who loved joker a gritty portrait of a man that was a landmark in the supervillian subgenre will find that venom is quite different darkly funny ripe with action weird and with a hilarious performance from tom hardy as eddie brock venom is the type of movie like shazam that is styled like an average action flick but is instead quite offbeat visually terrific and another solo sony spumc not to missed venom is a movie that critics just dont understand
May 31 2020,positive,it was nice to see tom hardy let loose and play a somewhat lighter role than what were used to seeing him in
May 29 2020,positive,i enjoyed venomwasnt sure what to expect but in the end i thought it was goodthe plot is silly at times but it suits as the whole idea is kinda silly and i think it takes that good humoured larger than life tone and makes it almost into a comedy at timesobviously tom hardy was going to nail it and he didnot sure about the bad guy thothe ending didnt really make sense to me but nevertheless and enjoyable film and looking forward to a sequel
May 25 2020,negative,the symbiote venom looks really cool here but thats just about all the film gets right
May 25 2020,negative,a film with a good performance by tom hardy sadly that is about all that is good about this comic adaptation all the visuals were well just visually boring noise the writing was not good the villian was as dull and unterrifying as i had seen in quite a while in a any superheroantihero movie although some fans may find things here and there peppered in to as little nuggets of interest there isnt much elsr to be interested about
May 20 2020,positive,good mindless entertainment laughs and action
May 15 2020,positive,its a more accurate representation of the iconic comic book character and has a talented cast but it has messy visual effects and a convoluted script that ultimately makes it a flawed but entertaining film with a campy tone and unintentional laughs
May 5 2020,positive,full entertaining movie excellent must watch
May 3 2020,positive,tom hardy saves it from becoming a disaster brad pitt couldnt
May 1 2020,positive,tom hardy really gives it his all and it ends up with some really good moments the relationship between his chracter eddie and venom really did bring out some chuckles the ending was predictable but it was a very good take on the antihero movie
May 1 2020,positive,i dont know why the professional reviewers didnt like it i found it extremely entertaining  it sure doesnt need more spiderboy it sits quite comfortably on its own nice cgi understandable plot great humour and fish out of water moments  plusi like the monster
Apr 30 2020,positive,well it just goes to show that the critics dont get it they wen in full of expectations wanting it to be one thing but as ever with the marvel films they put a different twist on it fantastic movie
Apr 30 2020,positive,it was a fun experience and tom hardy is excellent the first half hour is slow though
Apr 30 2020,positive,critics can eat my tomatoes  this movie is very entertaining  be it the actingstory line the action scenes the light comedy  everything was good i didnt find any desperation to spiderman association as some critics say
Apr 30 2020,positive,the movie was fun the acting is good  tom hardy is great as eddiebrock  i watched it only for him and he didnt disappoint it was enjoyable and i am looking forward to seeing venom 2  sn it isnt even a quarter as despicable as the critical reviews say it was surely it is not the best but it is good
Apr 29 2020,positive,was an enjoyable watch pg13 hindered the movie rather than helped some dialogue is a bit funky but definitely rewatchable
Apr 25 2020,positive,i dont care what anyone says i thought the movie was amazing
Apr 24 2020,negative,too fast paced with little to no actual plot the climax was extremely cheesy it reminded me a lot of the 2000s kids movies like shark boy and lava girl and spy kids cgi was syfy channel quality and i really didnt like what they did to the character i want a good venom movie rated r with him just being a bad guy give us that venom movie not whatever this was
Apr 24 2020,positive,i dont care what critics say you cant be like the comic characters in the wrong way there is a reason they have their own movie  venom was great  the story was great  tom hardy was great  the cgi wasnot great  fights scenes were great their spin on antihero venom was great
Apr 22 2020,positive,i myself was a little afraid of watching the movie for i am not a horror movie fan but i finally down to watch it today and i loved it there are many reasons why i love this movie there as followed first the cinematography and visuals were breathtaking especially in the end fight scene second i liked that it explored the psychology behind both eddie and venom and not just venom illustrating that eddie isnt nothing without venom and vise versa thirdly tom hardys performance of eddie brock and voice acting of venom was awesome to see on screen fourthly the plot was concise and not discursive by using every second to continue the plot and not using short moments that hint at something but goes nowhere i really enjoyed venom 2018 but words cant describe a movie so go watch it yourself youll enjoy it unless your a critic
Apr 22 2020,negative,this movie wasnt terrible but it also wasnt good the movie had no idea what kind of movie it wanted to be the tone was all over the place and it was really hard for me to connect with the characters since there wasnt just one or two defining traits of eddie or any of the other characters for that matter in fact the only real character i connected with was venom and that was because he was easy to understand and also kinda fun the screenplay and layout of the film however was messy but thats because it was developed by five guys yep it took five guys to do the screenplay for this movie the movie didnt know whether to be dark and violent or fun and upbeat that made it confusing there is also a bunch of little things in this movie that bugged me but those little things really add up the only good things that were in this movie was the acting and the chemistry between venom and eddie but other than that this film is a complete mess so i feel that giving this movie a 2 out of 5 is a very generous thing to do
Apr 20 2020,positive,fantastic and entered into the exclusive all time favorite list this deserves more ratings it is extremely extraordinary memorable entertaining amazing fantasying comedic action loved the spectacular movie
Apr 20 2020,positive,the story is a off but its enjoyable venom looks pretty cool
Apr 19 2020,positive,i liked it not great but fair to good 25 worthy rewatch
Apr 11 2020,positive,while the effects are appealing to the eye of a marvel fanan updated story and gritty approach could warrant a five star for me
Apr 10 2020,neutral,the pacing was terrible the dialogue was terrible the whole thing was incredibly embarrassing to watch there are so many plot holes and lack of reason in the movie the villain felt like a pretty one dimensional bad guy what were his motives really to do illegal scientific experiments for the sake of doing so he didnt exactly have an end goal here the whole thing felt like an inde movie the cgi was painfully bad venom was kind of annoying once again the dialogue wasnt in anyones favor
Apr 9 2020,positive,surprisingly good shouldnt have believed tomato meter and spent money in movie tickets hope we see more of such movies later
Apr 8 2020,positive,its a great film and is no spider man3
Apr 8 2020,positive,not only great action hilarious and who couldnt love eddie brock and venom while at the same time hating carlton drake plus that dick head of a neighbor of eddies in his apartment reminds me of mine
Apr 6 2020,positive,i liked the relationship between venom and eddie i think it wouldve done a lot better if this movie was more violent and actually showed the full brutalities of venoms kills
Apr 4 2020,positive,its true that venom contains a number of exciting and thrilling action scenes but its lack of a solid story is something that even hairraising action sequences cannot make up for the biggest problem i had with venom was eddy brocks tom hardys character carelessness of keeping his identity a secret i mean he reveals his identity a million times during the movie and still no one seems to be aware of the fact that he is the monstrous venom wow
Mar 31 2020,positive,im shocked at how low this scored its hilarious actionpacked and fun
Mar 28 2020,positive,underrated by critics well done sony
Mar 27 2020,positive,tom hardy is so over the top in his scenes that it never makes venom boring the vfx overload make several sequences difficult to watch and make out nonetheless its enjoyable junk food for brain and tom hardy rendition is certainly better than topher graces attempt
Mar 27 2020,positive,funny and simple i hope the second one is better
Mar 27 2020,negative,meh story was predictable seemed rushed and was sloppy the film is basic not overly indepth or insightful its an underdog that over comes adversity type of story that wants to be silly while being dark taken serious the story really doesnt make sense except that its sole goal is to establish itself as another hero saga it has a good cast its just that the story sucks everything is forced the time to develop a foundation is rushed 
Mar 24 2020,positive,i have no idea why it has such a low score its a great movie now i dont watch marvel and dc religiously and i can see why people who do would think the movie is bad i researched it a bit and venom in the comics seems like much more of a villain but this is a great movie none the less the same concept goes for joker that movie is revered for being revolutionary but its not even close to the original joker    tldr i loved the movie
Mar 24 2020,positive,felt fresh and funny  could have been even better had it been rrated
Mar 23 2020,positive,i thought the movie was fun and had comedic elements i definitely enjoyed it because i stayed up on a sunday night until 12 am to watch venom i think a lot of critics took this movie too seriously it was interesting the plot was well received and understandable i did not get bored to death like i did with captain marvel which got much higher ratings than venom the only problem i had with the movie it could be a bit corny at times but it wasnt enough to make me cringe i definitely would recommend this movie and hope the sequel with woody harrelson will be even better
Mar 23 2020,positive,one of my absolute favorite villains antiheroes of the marvel universe and a movie so great that i never get tired of watching it an incredible mix of action scifi and comedy featuring great graphics and even better character development this is honestly a movie i think most people will enjoy as it beautifully combines a range of genres while still maintaining the standard marvel movie feel great execution by the creators and a must watch for any comic movie or hero fanatic
Mar 23 2020,positive,1 very good story not absolutely new yes but pretty well told  2 very good acting tom hardy particularly of course  3 excellent balance between action and characters development  4 a lot of humour  so a very good marvel movie  between 4 and 5 stars for sure
Mar 18 2020,negative,i guess as a movie its fine enough i appreciate hardys attempt at being eddie brock the action while bad had room for being worse and the effects are decent enough but as a movie about one of marvels most loved villains boy this movie is an insult as a person who never had the chance to read the marvel comics since they dont get published in iran i obviously liked this movie on my first viewing but then i watchedread a bunch of online reviews and saw that this movies actual potential is 100 times bigger than what we got and about the scene where venom says on my planet i am kind of a loser i didnt recognize its stupidity until a light came for guiding me thanks critics the villain is also uninteresting and when you combine that with onedimensional motivations and the fact that hes actually a fun character in the first act of course people or at least critics are going to hate it all im saying is this movie missed what made venom the badass and popular villain that he is and since an upcoming sequel is already confirmed by sony i personally hope that they focus on the right things because they did not do that in this one
Mar 15 2020,positive,gotta give an applause for this crew enjoyable
Mar 13 2020,positive,dont listen to the hate if you want to be slightly captivated for 2 hours and experience a few strained laughs give venom a try
Mar 13 2020,positive,the venom movie is far better than you might expect the critics from time to time get the odd movie very wrong and venom is a good example of this venom is surprisingly a very likeable character tom hardy plays eddie brock as a sort of humourous bumbling idiot and is quite entertaining overall a good movie
Mar 7 2020,positive,a great antihero standalone origin movie of coarse venom gone to eddie before spidey but that isnt a dimension were spidey is the main characer venom is  think of it as a parallel universe were things playout differently because an infinite number of dimensions are created by possibility like change 1 little thing in the past leads to a different present to a new future were venom is a deadley cool antihero like deadpool
Mar 3 2020,negative,how the hell this has 80 audience score is flabbergasting this movie is horribly written horribly directed and horribly shot outside of 1 fight scene inside of an apartment every other fight scene looks legitimately like a stunt show at universal studios theme park also whoever came up with the genius idea to have the climax fight between 1venomcgi black goo blob and 2cgi dark grey goo blob outside at night should never be allowed to make a movie of this size and budget ever again     this movie is so bad i didnt even have fun in a goofy haha thats terrible type of way its just sooooooo boring i would literally say to someone who has a choice of this movie and anything else never bother watching this movie it is pointless and one of the most dull actionsuperhero movie ive ever seen
Mar 3 2020,positive,great movie when youre blasted and on cloud 9 literally however dont expect too much of seeing venom he only appears 23s in the movie terrible dialogue and over the top acting makes it a total win still a terrible movie
Mar 1 2020,positive,i renjoyed this film  a bit slow initially but then origin stories often are in places a bit weak as minor characters just accept whats going on around them without really questioning or being freaked out the fight and death scene towards the end was confusing and badly done and the reasons given were again weak yet despite this the film was enjoyable the heroes interesting and the skirt distractingly short and one can see that a sequel should be excellent
Feb 29 2020,positive,i really liked tom hardys take on the venom character one of my all time favorite marvel characters
Feb 27 2020,negative,not a good movie at all bad antagonist terrible romance and just bad plot structure overall this character deserved much better
Feb 25 2020,positive,the movie was awesome i love it
Feb 24 2020,positive,master piece best movie of the decade every one must see
Feb 24 2020,positive,i dont care that a lot of people hated this movie i love this film and i am excited for venom 2
Feb 23 2020,negative,ok tom hardy is great in this but other than that its a terribly boring film with awful cgi and a lame script leaving it with absolutely no personality and utterly forgettable
Feb 23 2020,positive,dont ever listen to the critics  this movie was pretty good
Feb 18 2020,neutral,meh another disappointing sony attempt at a marvel franchise 
Feb 18 2020,positive,great action great bond between eddie and venom just a good movie
Feb 17 2020,negative,i didnt enjoy the movie
Feb 17 2020,positive,tom hardys venom is awesome and the action and humor with him is sick but when thats the only thing this movie has going for the rest feels gone
Feb 16 2020,positive,even though the movie is not so faithful in describing the events that involve eddie brock  venom for instance spiderman makes no appearance in the movie the movie itself does manage to entertain the audience thanks to tom hardys brilliant acting performance furthermore if this movie is watched as an action movie instead of a cinecomic movie youll get fully entertained by the story and the action scenes the movie provides
Feb 15 2020,positive,amazing cant believe i waited so long to watch i wont make that mistake with the next one
Feb 15 2020,positive,i have a strong appreciation for tom hardy  i think thats what got me through that first hour which did start to lag quite a bit before the full version of venom was revealed i like that they gave venom a personality without making him an outright good person they did the antihero turn very well the music and special effects were especially on point in this its not the best superhero movie plot but it felt fresh and intriguing
Feb 12 2020,negative,it sure is a shame when a film like venom comes out and at best its generic and at worst its boring a film that seems to have been written in the 90s desperate to keep a lower budget a pg13 and a wide audience so it doesnt bother being a good horror a good antihero movie or a good scifi it sort of manages to be a passable buddy movie but only just and probably due to a bonkers tom hardy who is clearly having the time of his life   theres so much in the idea to have unlimited potential and yet its a holeridden lilywhite superhero film with only marginally more actual venom than raimis spiderman 3 and all the beats of a run of a mill early superhero film unfortunately since deadpool a venom movie would have to have upped its game sometimes its fun most of the while its depressingly by the numbers
Feb 7 2020,positive,i love anything tom hardy touches
Feb 7 2020,negative,i truly welcome stylistical diversity in the bloated tired genre of comic movies but that aint it despite horroresque top layer the rest of the movie doesnt differ much from your typical empty dumbed down popcorn flicks it sucks as much as the song promoting this pile of garbage
Feb 7 2020,positive,i feel spoiled to live in a time where marvel is able to make this movie
Feb 6 2020,positive,not the best story but great action and acting
Feb 5 2020,negative,you have to do stuff for dont wanna do bc it takes forever
Feb 5 2020,positive,this movie was awesome and funny tom hardy did an awesome job as eddie brock aka venom the rest of the cast did a fantastic job as well the plot of this movie was really good and it was really cool seeing what the symbiotes can do once they bond with the host it chooses the special effects in the movie were amazing and the fight scenes were awesome everyone would enjoy this movie go see it if you havent
Feb 2 2020,positive,this is a good relax kind of movie i recommend it for a good time with kids my boys really love it
Jan 29 2020,negative,an ugly cynical miserable excuse for a movie  even at a moderate under 2hour runtime venoms dark and dreary visuals pathetically uninteresting story and relentless scenes of two interchangeable blob monsters punching each other make it a slog to get through  unless you really care to see one of the most distinguished actors of this generation splashing around in a lobster tank you might want to give this one a skip
Jan 25 2020,neutral,while exploring space for new habitable worlds a probe belonging to the bioengineering corporation life foundation discovers a comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms the probe returns to earth with four samples but one escapes and causes the ship to crash in malaysia the life foundation recovers the other three and transports them to their research facility in san francisco where they discover that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygenbreathing hosts which often fatally reject the symbiosis investigative journalist eddie brock tom hardy reads about these human trials in a classified document in the possession of his fiancée anne weying michelle williams an attorney preparing a lawsuit defense for the life foundation brock confronts life foundation ceo carlton drake riz ahmed about the trials leading to both brock and weying losing their jobs consequently weying ends their relationship six months later drakes symbiosis trials are closer to success though one of his symbiotes dies due to carelessness brock is approached by dora skirth one of drakes scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to expose him she helps brock break into the research facility to search for evidence and he learns that an acquaintance of his a homeless woman named maria is one of the test subjects brock attempts to rescue maria but the symbiote possessing her transfers to his body without him realizing leaving her dead brock escapes and soon begins displaying strange symptoms he reaches out to weying for help and her new boyfriend dr dan lewis discovers the symbiote on examining brock drake exposes skirth to the remaining captive symbiote killing both this leaves the symbiote inside brock as the only known surviving specimen drake sends mercenaries to retrieve the symbiote from brock but it manifests around his body as a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers it later introduces itself to brock as venom and explains that the comet is searching for planets where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants venom offers to spare brock if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal and brock comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote imbues him with    rotten tomatoes critical consensus reads venoms first standalone movie turns out to be like the comics character in all the wrong wayschaotic noisy and in desperate need of a stronger attachment to spiderman reviewing the film for variety owen gleiberman called it a textbook case of a comicbook film thats unexciting in its hohum competence and even its visualeffects bravura he criticized hardys performance as acting like a stumblebum method goof and felt the film spent too long on venoms origin story when it should have been what a sequel likely will be he added that the film may not be as bad a start to a new shared universe as the mummy 2017 but it could turn out to be a similar case of a franchise kickoff that doesnt fully attain franchise liftoff ty burr of the boston globe scored the film oneandahalf stars and said it saps the life force of almost everyone in it including hardy williams and ahmed whose performances he all criticized he also criticized fleischers direction as unfocused and libatiques cinematography as some of the dingiest of 2018 but did feel that the scenes where hardy and venom talk while sharing a body were reasonably amusing mark daniell at the toronto sun criticized the films tone effects and characters compared it to a rejected superhero film treatment from the 1990s and said it was the worst marvel film released since elektra 2005 like burr soren anderson of the seattle times also gave the film oneandahalf stars calling it perhaps the worst marvelderived origin story ever and criticizing the close to an hour of tedium before venom appears in the film anderson also said that hardy was usually excellent but not this time and called the action sequences generic    i have no real relation to venom as a marvel comic character but this film is not making me interested to explore the character to be honest tom hardy is playing this role in a way i dont like at least he is normally a safe card but he is not in form here and venom never really takes off if you ask me its a very generic and average film within the marvel universe    trivia in the comics the venom symbiote was initially attached to spiderman peter parker during the secret wars event in 1984 when he realized his costume was alive and was controlling his body he disposed of it it would later come in contact with eddie brock and the two would be bonded together to form venom    the last film featuring a stan lee cameo to be released during his lifetime before his death on november 12 2018 he filmed two more cameos that were released after his death captain marvel 2019 and avengers endgame 2019
Jan 24 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the chemistry venom and eddie have it was nice to see them grow and click with each other it made the whole journey fun for me
Jan 23 2020,positive,being a long time spidey fan it is a bit hard to swallow a venom movie with no spiderman connection however this was still an entertaining movie that got a bit of a bad rap from critics my noncomic book reading wife enjoyed the venom symbiote enough to want to see the movie twice before we returned it and thats not typical for her with any movie tom hardy did a good job with what he was given though i have to agree that the movie pacing and some of the script choices werent ideal     i dug into my comic collection and pulled a few of my venom titles and considering how often he was written as a blunt instrument they actually wrote eddie brock and venom fairly well in that regard anyway dont be fooledit may not have been ideal but it has entertainment value just keep your expectations low and you might enjoy it
Jan 21 2020,negative,a waste of time 
Jan 20 2020,negative,maybe its just me but i thought this movie was super corny listening to venom talk to his inner person the whole time just made me chuckle i couldnt even take this movie seriously 
Jan 19 2020,neutral,good it worth watching
Jan 19 2020,positive,i enjoy marvel movies and venom is a lot of fun however the fx can get very cartoony as can the writing a bigger budget and more emotional realistic characters could have made it great it also should have been rated r like the deadpool movies that said by not going for a hard r they leave it open for a spiderman crossover and that gets my spidey sense tingling over all not great but well worth a watch or two and of course tom hardy shines
Jan 18 2020,positive,funny and entertaining i was not expecting this but the movie was fun to watch
Jan 13 2020,positive,the best movie ever has the best story and clear plot with a ton of funny moments and action that will make your heart skip a beat
Jan 11 2020,positive,great blockbuster by sony that is enjoyable and simple  the only problem i have with this film is the amount of censorship this was clearly made to be a r rated movie and would have succeeded if it added darker undertones and more detailed violence as he is a antihero but it cuts when anything is supposed to happen i would laugh my fucking ass off if venom cursed but we dont get it still very enjoyable though and kept me glued to the screen every moment
Jan 9 2020,positive,i really enjoyed the movie it became epic after joined with the symbiote
Jan 6 2020,positive,i love the venom movie including the symbiote it was what i expected 1010
Jan 6 2020,positive,a more dark superhero movie that tom hardy manages to make awesome with his take on eddie brockvenom who are the stars with fun moments i was able to watch this movie with enjoyment with how fun it was which is what i was looking for
Jan 6 2020,positive,pretty good origin story of venom as he comes to earth
Jan 5 2020,positive,i did not think much of the movie at first but venom ended up being such a bad character i ended up loving the film critics need to change its score
Jan 5 2020,positive,idk why rotten tomatoes is so obsessed with relating this movie to the comics its a good movie period they shouldnt give it 29 because it isnt just like the comics i no longer trust rotten tomatoes because of their rating for venom
Jan 3 2020,positive,sony cant do liveaction without raimi or feige involved venom shouldnt have been rushed
Jan 2 2020,negative,i dont know very much about the character of venom but i thought surely anything would be better than what we got in spiderman 3 but i was so wrong i wasnt disappointed necessarily because i didnt set any expectations for myself before going into this but extremely underwhelmed even frustrated is how i felt i love tom hardy he is a very capable actor who has proven himself to be great in the past and to be fair he was pretty good in this movie but his character was just bad he was unrealistic and kind of dumb in a silly cartoonish kind of way i felt nothing for him but i really wanted to venom is heavily underutilized in a movie that shares his name he didnt mesh with hardy very well and i can hardly even see him because he is almost exclusively shown at night he really doesnt have anything to do with the plot other than the fact that there is an evil version of him thats trying to destroy the world we needed more backstory and a personality added to him he is so lifeless and nonpresent riz ahmed was pretty bad as the villain he was so cliche and boring and he doesnt even fit the bad guy persona he doesnt change anything about himself for this role he was really sloppy in this film the extremely lackluster antagonist is one of the main faults of this film jenny slate was a scientist who i didnt care about either her character didnt do anything in this movie michelle williams is also a proven actress who has plenty of talent but she is so subdued and nonchalant about everything its like she didnt want to be their or care at all the romance of this film was not good but not terrible the script is almost as bad as the amazing spiderman films and those are awful movies they give us as little venom as possible but they wont build up or deepen the characters that we are stuck with throughout this whole movie ruben fleischer is such a novice director he has only directed a handful of movies and they are all raunchy ratedr comedies his direction is very bad he was clearly not the right person for this movie they should have just stuck with its ratedr version so that way it would at least be entertaining on the gore and profanity side that most    casual people look for the reshoots and outtakes are very evident they jumbled this movie around so much to make it pg13 that it makes this movie a complete mess not exactly a disaster though i am reaching for things at this point that i liked about this film but not a whole lot worked for me sony put out 2 spider man related movies in 2018 one was how to make a great spiderman movie and the other was how to make a terrible spiderman movie this was the terrible one this was so disappointing go see into the spiderverse instead its a thousand times better
Jan 2 2020,positive,as a long time venom fan this is all i could ask for  maybe a rated r venom would be cooler but this movie was pretty pretty cool
Jan 1 2020,neutral,another average to below average comic book movie it isnt a bad movie just not one that matters there was no character development and the story was very weak and when you consider eddie brock is a journalist who can only get his story out by going to a major news organization you know it is just a movie the guy could go on youtube facebook or twitter he doesnt need to be a journalist at a news organization i know it is a little thing but it is also one of many little things 
Dec 31 2019,positive,it was cool however i was grossed out by that scene where the female venom literally ate the bad guys head off but there was no blood so i stepped out of the theatre for a little while before coming back in but after that i was excited so good work to them
Dec 30 2019,positive,loved it even though the chances the symbote origin 
Dec 29 2019,positive,maybe one of the first marvel movies ive actually enjoyed it is not by any stretch of imagination a master piece but i do think that it was very very enjoyable
Dec 29 2019,positive,way underrated film well worth a watch
Dec 29 2019,positive,dont get me wrong it wasnt that great but its humor was surprisingly shocking and good and along with its decent action sequences this movie turns out not to be half bad
Dec 29 2019,positive,awesome film funny action bit of everything reckon every will like it
Dec 28 2019,positive,more entertaining and solid than the critics reviews would suggest funny in parts good action tom hardy always good value solid entry into the antihero genre 
Dec 26 2019,positive,exact rating 5710    venom is an overall accurate representation of how sony has finally begun to learn from their previous mistakes but also shows a lot of room for improvement the acting was overall excellent presenting all of the needed emotions for each of the characters the characters were mostly well written presenting a variety of personalities that all blended together well and helped the pacing and entertainment value of the story the villain however played by the very subtle but great actor riz ahmed was just kind of well there he wasnt given enough depth for anyone to care about him he was the stereotypically poetic villain that is just there as a last resort bad guy the storyline was well very iffy the overall storyline was very entertaining yet it was formulaic and disorganized it was entirely predictable from beginning to end and several of the subplots were ineffectively scattered the visuals were overall okay presenting great lighting and beautifully shot scenes but with video gamelike cgi the bits of marvel humor felt very forced with only one or two jokes actually coming through as funny overall it shows a lot of potential for how the series will be able to improve while also presenting a decent third start to sonys marvel universe i recommend this movie for anyone whos looking for an excuse to see tom hardy being a badass and for people who are looking for an okay venom attempt
Dec 26 2019,positive,i liked it it was fun and entertaining michele williams was imo kind of pointless and unlikable but the rest of the cast was good movie felt like it was over quickly
Dec 25 2019,positive,action scenes were good the movie could be done better
Dec 24 2019,positive,extremely good movie it has those classic hero scenes with the cool lines that build hype also the dynamic between venom and eddie although rushed is pretty good the movie is definitely a mustsee for anyone whos into this kind of movie
Dec 23 2019,positive,im not sure what movie the critics watched venom was a hell of a lot of fun
Dec 23 2019,neutral,as far as a venom film goes it captures the character and the effects are great there are genuinely fun moments the villain was forgettable and the film overall was choppy and rushed i think audience goers were so desperate for a  decent iteration of venom that the reviews were much higher than the film deserved there needs to be a spidermanvenom movie and shareholders need to step back from media this film is a commercialized and rushed film it shows that sony is in it for money and not art tom hardy does a fantastic job but is in a relatively forgettable film
Dec 22 2019,negative,yikes felt like it wanted to be rated r due to many of the out of place jokes and set pieces what a weird performance by hardy
Dec 16 2019,negative,the movie was so fucking boring it was terrible i wanted an action moivie that made me move to the edge of my seat but no the main charcter has to be a pussy ass little bitch boy who was scared of literaly everything i couldnt watch past 20 min of this trainwreck you can barely call a movie because i would pass out from being so disapointed it was an amazing concept and so poorly executed it looked like an amazing action filled sci fi movie but insted you get a terrible actor who just cries and complains the whole moive i swear to fucking god i will never again watch a venom movie or a movie where tom hardy plays the lead
Dec 15 2019,positive,way better than teen titans go to the movies
Dec 12 2019,positive,loved it funny as hell critics are dead from the neck up tom hardy was perfection
Dec 9 2019,positive,this movie wasnt that bad i enjoyed it
Dec 9 2019,positive,venom to tom hardy is the mitochondria the scientist has the chloroplast tom hardy is animal and uses fists and the scientist has all plant and weed weapons such as velcro and seeds it is the endosymbiosis in eukaryotic cells venom is the hero and protagonist and spiderman is just an aspect of a male silk moth that was a cheater so has to make its own webs all organelles are endosymbiotes mitochondria and chloroplasts are bacteria that donated themselves so that the eukaryotic cell can survive after making itself too large for energy transfer venom is a altruist and his host is a mutualist the scientist is commensal and his friend when the venoms touch they recombinate through digestion its animals eating plants and plants eating animals through enzymes they compete need and rely on each other there is no winner the next movie is about silver oxide or mirrors that is the makeup of the sun the earth is made of the element lead    animals gets venom or toxin synonyms through the enzymes from plants they eat poison is a neurotoxin for amphibians and snakes that eat cold blooded prey have neurotoxin from the prey they eat this is not venom venom is a coagulant that makes blood clot so that cells cannot receive oxygen it is not the same genetics as the animal injecting it and it is a symbiotic relationship of the lethal toxins love for its hosts protection example source of poison is mint and of venom from citrus acid enzymes are ribosomes we receive in our eukaryotic cells through endosymbiosis or uptake
Dec 8 2019,positive,great entertaining and fun
Dec 8 2019,negative,the audience reviews for this movie are impossible  there are those times where somehow the critics pan an amazing movie and the audience reviews are accurate but i am convinced sony has paid for these audience reviews  this movie is painful to sit and watch  there is not an ounce of understanding of basic human motive zero sense of logic or reason  how does a horribly acted antagonist swoon subjects into hypnotic obedience whoever that actor was he is terrible  if he needed a silvertongue it should have been andy serkis  how in the world does an entire staff of tepidlyloyal scientists complicitly allow multiple human sacrifices  for god sake how do they even try to make a scientific genius of an employer lack any basic scientific method  youre pulling out your hair at the dumbness of it all before the movie even begins to warm up  this movie takes impossible licence with characters they dont spend 30 seconds establishing with the audience leaving you to sit there arms crossed asking really  really so many times it makes your brain hurt  from the very first second you are forced to ignore so many holes or lack of holes in the case of symbiote spikes passing through clothing to murder a flock of people and leaving the clothes unscathed that it takes you so far out of the movie through sheer effort of knowing how much you are being asked to ignore  i simply cant understand how this movie could entertain anyone unless they were watching it while under the influence of some sort of minddulling drug  now more than ever im convinced audience reviews can be paid for and manipulated  but i felt obligated to post my first review ever on rt to do my small part to try to correct this hijacked review section of a garbage movie  do not watch this movie  save yourself
Dec 5 2019,positive,fun film obviously its not the best but at least its enjoyable
Dec 4 2019,positive,it left me wanting more any fan of superhero origin movies would like this one just as well  an r rating treatment would have been the icing on the cake i hope the squeal they hinted at in the post credit ending comes out i really think the reason many critics were so hard on this film was because the bad guy was an immoral liberal nut seems to be the pattern around these parts
Dec 3 2019,positive,amazing movie the hate in my opinion is dumb because this was just perfect the design the story and pretty good for a marvel sony movie
Nov 29 2019,negative,the plot makes no sense
Nov 26 2019,positive,ive seen the reviews and they kept me from watching this jewel of movie it was nonstop excitement to watch but it also kept the mind occupied with a compelling story it was mixture of humor action heartbreak i think this movie was poorly marketed a star wars movie gets 10x the hype and delivers 110 what this movie does
Nov 26 2019,positive,yeah its what you expect
Nov 24 2019,positive,really well made  i loved the special effects  and while i knew the basic story  i enjoyed this telling a lot
Nov 23 2019,positive,i think a great movie  the next part may be with blood meat maybe horror its a wonderful movie thread adult audience wake up move makers seek us look us they want to give us a cool movie give a rating 
Nov 23 2019,positive,better than the critics proclaimed it to be a good time not a great one but passes time i saw it at home too lol
Nov 22 2019,positive,im not a big tom hardy fan  but he was awesome as eddie brock its one of those characters that you can relate to i like the intervention between brockvenom real good action with comedy
Nov 21 2019,positive,this movie was wonderful awesome amazing i cannot believe critics bombed it noisy i am the queen of despising too much action noise but this film was so enthralling i did not take notice of the action noise 80 liked this movie according to rotten tomatoes the people have spoken
Nov 20 2019,positive,this movie was actually better than everyone said it was the acting was really good the only thing i have to say is that they could have done a few things differently this movie was excellent and they even left an opening for a carnage movie
Nov 19 2019,neutral,the venom character is the only entertaining bit but not on screen anywhere near enough 
Nov 17 2019,positive,i cant speak to whether this comports well to the original comic book story but i thought that this was a much better movie than the professional critics give it credit for  i frequently watch movies and say to myself been there done that but this movie has a great deal of entertaining moments  it is quite original at times with both with humor and action sequences  i was nicely entertained  there was of course a little cheese but thats to be expected  it was off to a somewhat slow start and i think that it could have been better condensed toward the beginning without losing anything  great performances and acting  i could definitely see myself giving this a second watch  nice job
Nov 12 2019,negative,its as if a 1st year media student made and edited this film its truly terrible
Nov 9 2019,positive,tom hardy is so over the top in his scenes that it never makes venom boring the vfx overload make several sequences difficult to watch and make out nonetheless its enjoyable junk food for brain and tom hardy rendition is certainly better than topher graces attempt
Oct 28 2019,positive,amazing lacked blood
Oct 27 2019,positive,though not the best of marvel movies its definitely miles from the worst venom does just exactly what it sets out to do  provide some really good entertaiment for 2 hours
Oct 26 2019,positive,better then the spiderman 3 venom
Oct 26 2019,negative,a very good cast that is wasted away in a movie that never could find its own identity the venom character is written  presented on screen as a complete joke
Oct 26 2019,positive,tom hardy outstanding as the titular venom 
Oct 25 2019,positive,an unexpected take on a classic antihero some dodgy moments but a storming performance by tom hardy
Oct 24 2019,positive,no spoilers you have to see this movie critics will complain about it trying to be so many things at once but thats one of the best parts theres something for everybody and if you dont like a certain thing there isnt a lot of it the humor is hilarious and the chemistry between eddie and venom is outstanding the plot holes critics mention have solutions that only take a basic level of thinking to understand the writing is some of the best ive ever seen in a movie and hardys performance is simply amazing overall its a fun adventure with some darker elements thrown in to keep it from just being joke after joke after joke masterpiece of a film
Oct 24 2019,positive,cgi good movie good story good music good but could of added blood
Oct 22 2019,positive,it was fine nice plot even if predictable it suffers from the same problem the marvel movies do though the grey villain problem the fights were really difficult with both protagonist and antagonist being greyblack
Oct 22 2019,positive,good production well made for a sequel tom hardy is lit
Oct 21 2019,positive,sometimes the cg could have been better and i didnt really care for the ending
Oct 19 2019,positive,of all superhero movies i have seen this would have been the blandest but with tom hardy as the lead it was funny and weird venom is such a fun character that this movie itself is so much fun this movie is similar to godzilla king of the monsters 2019 critics dont understand movies like this
Oct 19 2019,positive,i liked it just because i was smoke weed
Oct 19 2019,positive,good movie on a great idea and a decent plot
Oct 19 2019,positive,this would would have received a higher score but tom hardys accent is all over the place and it was distracting 
Oct 18 2019,positive,amazing and entertaining i honestly didnt expect to like it as much as i did
Oct 18 2019,negative,never really cared for mcu and they are not going to earn a dime off of me ever again after this
Oct 17 2019,positive,the critics need to remove the heads from their backsides
Oct 17 2019,positive,i was very skeptical on this due to the fact that there was no spiderman in this if you know the story venom is technically created through spiderman as an alternate universe standpoint i was thoroughly impressed by this movie the characters are written well great storyline and just the right amount of humor is added this is an interestingly different take on venom and puts him as more like an antihero i truly expected to hate it but i came out smiling and satisfied with the film enough to look forward to a sequel 
Oct 17 2019,positive,excellent film that proves you dont need the spider to tell a compelling symbiote story 
Oct 16 2019,positive,venom the antihero superhero story that puts you on the edge of your seat venom is actionpacked funny enjoyable and fun its kind of like a superhero detective story the movie is a bit dark but its venom the movie is about getting the clues to know what the villain is doing and then fighting him its a very good story and i love it
Oct 16 2019,positive,the camera work was a bit sloppy and some of the scenes were cut in odd places but overall this was a very fun and exciting movie i loved the humor and toms acting was wonderful
Oct 12 2019,positive,i have no idea what the critics are talking about  this movie was freaking awesome antihero edgy visceral infiltrating doom and theme song by eminem icing cake canonise this shiznit
Oct 11 2019,positive,this movie was awesome critics are obviously biased because venom isnt very pc
Oct 10 2019,negative,great actor terrible movie please try to do better
Oct 8 2019,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Oct 6 2019,negative,tom hardys excellent performance almost makes you forget about the dull characters dumb story lackluster action and the fact that this movie wouldve been way better had it been rated r 410
Oct 5 2019,positive,its better than most gave it credit for 
Oct 5 2019,positive,it was a bit short and i didnt like the vilain that much but toms performance and the venom character brought it together had fun watching it
Oct 5 2019,positive,i dont understand the hate this movie gets from critics genuinely entertaining and enjoyable to watch
Oct 5 2019,positive,an awesome movie a franchise a classic 
Oct 3 2019,positive,funny  well paced origin story really enjoyed the banter between symbiote and host  wasnt sure how i would like a venom movie without spider man but nothing felt missing 
Oct 3 2019,negative,horrible film worst acting by hardy and the rest of the cast cgi was as bad as transformers it made lots of money in the same markets that transformers did asia hopefully the sequel will be way better
Oct 2 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes should be ashamed of itself hustlers gets 80 and this gets 30 one of the best of marvel clever well paced great baddies 
Sep 30 2019,positive,rewatched this one today and still love it tom hardy is a good choice for eddie brock and the humor between him and venom make intense moments have a little spice to it 
Sep 28 2019,positive,loved it the critics have no idea how to rate sometimes
Sep 28 2019,positive,when i saw all these trailers about venom i thought that it is going to be as chef ramsay would say roten but i still saw itand then againand again to sum it up i think that venom is a fantastic movie that had a disasterous marketing because of the horrible and i mean horrible trailers
Sep 27 2019,neutral,it could have been better but it also could have been worse 
Sep 23 2019,positive,very pleasantly surprised  the story  was slow at the start but after a solid 25 it picked up thats typical origin stories  tom  hardy and michelle williams were really good  but the real chemistry was between venom and eddie brock  had some great lines at key parts of the movie
Sep 23 2019,positive,what can i say its awsome well made good story spectacular visual effects and amazing actors
Sep 22 2019,negative,as a comedy i give it a 45    as a movie based on one of the best and most well known spiderman villains i give it a 155    and to think that these are the people who are going to be making another spiderman reboot god help peter parker god help us all
Sep 22 2019,negative,i went in to this with very low expectations and was still surprised at how bad it was a proper turkey on every level
Sep 22 2019,negative,this movie is bad its not wellwritten its not technically wellmade and it is stupid however i actually enjoyed it a little most of this movie i found to be slow and kinda dull it takes a while to get going but when it does i started having fun this movie is at its best when it is being crazy and overthetop however there isnt a lot of that in the movie that only really happens in the middle of the movie it takes a long time to get going it goes for a little bit and then it just kinda ends abruptly before it even really begins its very poorly paced probably because of the reedits i thought there mustve been more to this movie i was only 90 minutes into whats supposed to be a 110minute movie but nope that was it there are no joke 20 minutes of credits thats including two postcredits scenes but you can just turn the movie off after the first one the second is just a clip from into the spiderverse nothing special i heard there were about 40 minutes of footage cut from the final film and yeah it shows overall this movie is a hot mess if youre in the mood for garbage give it a watch its like one of those lessthanwonderful 70s and 80s b horror movies if you like that sort of thing youll like this if you want an actually good movie with a similar premise however watch upgrade instead
Sep 21 2019,positive,slow start but toms performance is awesome 
Sep 21 2019,positive,venom is really powerful and people should give more tomatoes
Sep 21 2019,negative,for fans of venom prepare to be let down by a story that does not do the beloved character the slightest bit of justice  no spiderman no carnage no new york all that means is not venom    the eddie brock character portrayal was a weak point in the tom hardy portfolio the story was just as weak possibly weaker  i so wanted this film to be much much better than what was presented the venom story arc is one of my favorites and they let down the true fans of the character
Sep 20 2019,positive,this is a pretty good comic book movie though it was a little slow and not at all accurate to the comic it still was a legitimate good film one of the biggest problem is the characters acting is pretty bland the only actor that gave some effort in the movie was tom hardy but this is likely because he is given more screen time and more character build
Sep 20 2019,positive,  venoms first standalone movie turns out to be like the comics character in all the wrong ways  chaotic noisy and in desperate need of a stronger attachment to spiderman
Sep 20 2019,positive,i want to see more symbiote other than venom and riot in the squel
Sep 19 2019,positive,you can ignore the pretentious critics on this one folks although it lacks ties to spiderman venom takes the audience on a journey to understand that bad guys have a storyline too 
Sep 18 2019,positive,one of the better superhero movies around has a very strong straight male caucasian lead which he delivers a great performance 
Sep 18 2019,positive,i may swim against the tide but i really enjoyed this movie since its dark and funny at the same time
Sep 17 2019,positive,i can relate the eddie  venom relationship similar to the one in the parasyte anime and it works wonders for the movie and the action doesnt come out of nowhere but a forgettable villain with an insane and careless plot blows the movie below surface level
Sep 17 2019,negative,this is my first time rating a movie and unfortunately it is due to how bad it truly was the writing was poor and the ending was anticlimactic to say the least i am going to save my time and not waste my money on the day sony tries to bring this garbage with spiderman we have now grown to love from marvel
Sep 17 2019,neutral,with expectations low you may even have a chuckle
Sep 16 2019,negative,the only thing entertaining about the movie was venom himself but even he had problems sudden changes in motivation made for a lame plot development
Sep 16 2019,positive,the story was pretty good it did fit eddies character since hes a reporter the way eddie and venom were together i enjoyed seeing other symbiotes was cool riot was a good villain not the best but far from bad the action was really fun to watch i didnt think venom was really hard to see like some people say my only problem really with the movie is i think it needed some blood differently is weird when theres no blood where blood should be
Sep 16 2019,negative,total garbage unless youre 9 save your money
Sep 10 2019,positive,incredibly enjoyable movie with the best portrayal of bromance ive seen in a while tom hardy is again phenomenal and yetwhen is he not
Sep 10 2019,positive,went in with very low expectations because of critics but essentially it was a very fun entertaining movie it doesnt have a deep plot but thats not what its meant to be does what its supposed to do and does it very well 
Sep 9 2019,negative,i think this is the best anyone could do without having access to the actual universe these characters are supposed to exist in  venom suffers from the same issues that most of these types of movies run into inconsistent characterization because your standard studio executives are too stupid to realize that the original character is more interesting than the hybrid they want to create  if you dont want to spend the time visually recreating someone elses ideas than just create your own  
Sep 9 2019,positive,tom hardy really made this movie watchable otherwise it was pretty basic in terms of plot with an overwhelming feeling of beentheredonethat 35
Sep 9 2019,positive,was it silly of course but was it also fun absolutely
Sep 9 2019,positive,at first i didnt want to see the movie now month later i watched it and i do like it good humor and acting cgi is well done
Sep 8 2019,positive,funny and well paced
Sep 7 2019,negative,great work with the cgi venom but  a r rating is what defines him
Sep 7 2019,negative,horrible movie even tom hardy was terrible in this 
Sep 5 2019,positive,i was pleasantly surprised  it was good hardy did a great job talking to himself incessantly and venom was portrayed in a nicer way than the comics did it  i still think a venom without spider man is like a birthday without cake but that is me thus it is just meh good enough to rent for a few bucks  nothing more nothing less
Sep 5 2019,positive,love tom hardy funny script and dialogue werent great and probably worth a rental later
Sep 4 2019,negative,this was unfortunately rushed didnt take itself seriously in any way and could have been so much better  good cgi but left me feeling that tom hardy and venom have been squandered
Sep 3 2019,positive,spiderman universe venom look of comic book stories will not a disappointed
Sep 2 2019,positive,i really liked this movie  hope it goes further in to their journey living together
Sep 2 2019,positive,love this movie tom hardy is such a good actor and it turns out to be such a beautiful story
Aug 31 2019,positive,i loved this movie  wished they did every marvel movie although dc will always br my absolutely favorite
Aug 31 2019,positive,must watch and awesome movie of the spiderman universe
Aug 31 2019,positive,looking at the ratio of the tomatometer to the review score its obvious that this one resonates really well with fans of the character but not with critics even though i still think this character needs spiderman to really make him work for the most part they really got venom down to a t its objectively not great but very enjoyable for fans of the character
Aug 31 2019,positive,storyscreenplay 355 this story belongs in the comic book genre and compared to some of the other marvel or dc superhero films this story rates lower than those  however as a standalone product it was still mostly entertaining and sporadically amusing    durationtempo 355 at 1 hour and 52 minutes its an average length movie that felt short  well paced with lots of action intermingled with occasional humor    cast  crew 355 tom hardy performed very well  riz ahmed was solid    summary 355 the story and cast were good and the film felt short  a thumbs up
Aug 30 2019,negative,no depth to the characters no plausible plot points
Aug 29 2019,positive,sony doing his job 
Aug 29 2019,positive,this movie is hilarious in my opinion loved it
Aug 28 2019,negative,bad story bad writing  disappointing overall  
Aug 28 2019,positive,pros  decent enough cgi  moments of genuine humour  boring charactee actually given life by tom hardy  decent enough fight scenes    cons  paper thin story  paper thin antagonists  other humour scenes were poor lobster scene notibly  other actors kind of stale in performance
Aug 27 2019,positive,a decent superhero movie that is different from the standard formula that disney uses for their marvel movies but marvel fanboys hated the idea of a spiderman related movie not in the mcu before the trailer even came out and are falsely calling this the worst movie every without ever seeing it disney is also know for paying reviewers to give their movies high critic scores and give other movies low scores    all in all just a fun popcorn flick that you can watch without thinking to much
Aug 26 2019,positive,funny and better than i thought itd be
Aug 26 2019,positive,a bit little disappointing but symboit makes the movie gr8t 
Aug 25 2019,positive,disclaimer i have not read the comics so my opinion is strictly based off of watching the movie    the movie kept me hooked and attentive during  scenes where there wasnt any action the plot was  good but not explained that well  we only really got to see the story from the perspective of venom and eddie     the lead up to the climax was longer than falling action after the climax and the plot i feel was resolved too fast     the cgi was good except one scene where a car got flipped     the movie was certainly worth watching  
Aug 25 2019,positive,i watched going in with no expectations but was surprised to find an entertaining piece of work very interested in a sequel 
Aug 25 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this
Aug 25 2019,positive,really good film cant wait to see the next one when it comes out just hope its as good as this one 
Aug 24 2019,positive,venoms main appeal is the fun buddycop feel that eddie brock and venom have you care about eddie brock but not really about anyone else unfortunately a generic villain and some pacing issues dont make for a perfect superhero film but the film makes up for it with great comedic elements and some mostly solid action
Aug 24 2019,positive,im more of dc guy but i was impressed and loved venom
Aug 23 2019,positive,it was good movie but need more strong story in venom 2
Aug 23 2019,positive,another movie that needed to move along the first act  it took forever  i was expecting a little more explosiveness  liked the portrayal of venom more than i liked the character of eddie brock  need to put in a little more effort
Aug 23 2019,negative,i was soooo excited to see this and in the first 30 minutes im over it this is not what venom is about with out spiderman having the black suit that we eventually learn is the symbiot and the rage it has when spiderman rejected it and the anger eddie brock has against spiderman makes the venom character he was a villain turned anti hero in the lethal protector run which is what this is going for all in all this just falls flat in its face im glad i borrowed this from the library so not a single penny of mine went to it
Aug 23 2019,positive,the action was amazing the wishy washy tone of the movie was done well the only downside was that it wasnt rated r i think venom needs more gore especially since theyre bringing in carnage
Aug 22 2019,positive,not perfect but a good start for the lethal protectors own films more than makes up for the disaster of the venom characters first appearance in movies dispite what rt may think venom needs no connection to spiderman to work well
Aug 22 2019,negative,im pretty sure that if i had to pick a physical representation of how bad this movie is it would be a flaming dumpster fire thats full of 6 month old dirty diapers  rotting animal guts this movie is absolutely awful the effects are horrendous when i could actually see them this movie is so poorly lit the acting is flat which is an absolute shame because i like tom hardy as an actor the villain is a boring 2dimensional cutout the writing is beyond juvenile and the direction was just awful i am a huge fan of venom but i can tell you that this is not the venom i know  love hes not a goofy loser hes the physical embodiment of what happens when peter parkers world collides with spidermans world  in all honesty hes inherently scary despite having somewhat goofy moments from time to time sony was swearing for months that this was going to be a r rated horror movie and if any comic book character can benefit from a horror setting and an r rating its venom but instead we got this steaming turd dont watch this horrendous reminder that we had a dark age of movies from 19962001
Aug 22 2019,negative,outdated for todays superhero genre special effects cheap plot cheap should have come out but with spiderman in the late last decade
Aug 21 2019,positive,overall a really fun movie
Aug 20 2019,negative,bad writing and bad special effects venoms character and abilities are inconsistent with established rules and lore in the comic books and other source material
Aug 19 2019,positive,so many funny one liners and tom hardy is awesome this is one of those that the critics hate because theres nothing artistic about it but its a good movie and very enjoyable   i dont know anything about the original venom so that didnt bother me ive been told it may bother some marvel fans though the characters are likeable and believable its nice to see characters driving the story rather than other way around as so many marvel movies do these days 
Aug 19 2019,positive,i absolutely love this movie as a big time spiderman fan since i was a kid this movie was a dream come true for me just wish they made it rated r and not cut so many scenes but other than that great movie 100 recommend
Aug 17 2019,negative,having your own parasite is arguably more enjoyable
Aug 17 2019,positive,i dont get all the negative reviews venom is a fun ride from villain to anti herogreat action scenes and enough tomfoolery to keep you howling   see what i did there lol
Aug 17 2019,positive,tom hardy is one of the best actors of our time he can go from serious to comedy in a blink
Aug 17 2019,positive,very fun and off the walls great to watch with friends
Aug 15 2019,positive,not intellectuel or anything but great effects and fun to watch not to heavy
Aug 15 2019,positive,dont get me wrong this isnt a perfect movie by any means but for the enjoyment i got out of it and the surprisingly effective humorous bits im giving it an almost perfect rating i saw this twice in theaters and bought the bluray as soon as it came out i have to add that i am a huge fan of venom and grew up reading the spiderman vs venom comics so that gives me kind of a bias already bias aside tom hardy gives a great performance here and deserves an a for effort
Aug 14 2019,positive,this was terrific dont know how i missed it in theaters tom hardy was perfect
Aug 13 2019,positive,sick af  dope  awesome 
Aug 12 2019,positive,it lacks the chilling vibe of a superhero movie but its still entertaining for the 00s based prequelspinoff
Aug 12 2019,positive,i really like and enjoy this movie
Aug 10 2019,negative,to be honest i didnt want to watch this moviethe only reason i saw this movie was because they invited me to see it and several people told me it was a wonderful movieand when the movie end i ask to my self did the people who told me it was a great movie saw the same movie that i sawi just can belive that a t of people like this moviethe movie is so boring and predictible i mean everything is so forcedthe eddies boss send eddie to survey to a evil businessmanwhat did the boss expect that eddie would behave when the boss knows he is a journalist he always goes to the bottom of matters and then his boss fires him and his fucking girlfriend leaves him because they also fired her because of him i mean if his girfriendreally loved him it could have forgiven him because the true love forgive everything rightwell  and his exgirlfriend is so bitch that few days later has a new boyfriendwow thats what i call a bitch and  the way in which eddie and the scientist infiltrate the laboratories with shitty security is very stupid the entired scene is stupid a security guard ask to the scientist what are you doing here and she answer something stupid like science never rest o my god what a stupid phrase and one more time the movie show us that the lab security sucks with a scene with eddie breaking a glass of  a maximum security cell with a fire extinguisher and then eddie gets the symbiote and we get scenes of tom hardy making fool of himselfthen we get unnecessary action scenes and my god all the movie is stupid a scene that i want to emphasize because it made me laugh is when venom is is close to a plane in full flight and goes crazy because of the noise because those who know venom know that loud sounds affect it in short the noise of an airplane usually generates 140 decibels then venom is literally put down of a rocket that is about to take off and do you know how many decibels a rocket generates the answer is 190 decibels and venom did not affect the noise a bit and that is like whaaaaaahahahaat  well i can understand that a little boy may like this movie because when we were all little we had a movie that we loved to watch and when we grew up we realized that the movie is crap in conclusion venom is super bad super mediocre and predictable and  i think im being quite generous giving him a 310
Aug 8 2019,neutral,venom is an uninspiring take on the popular symbiote straight out of marvel comics that being said there is fun to have in the mindless action scenes although it should be said the interactions between eddie brock tom hardy and venom itself are memorable and perhaps the best part of the movie venom plays it safe and as a result is a pretty harmless movie with wasted potential the saving grace however is tom hardys performance as eddie himself hardy as always gives his all to the role and as a result deserves recognition despite critics reviews
Aug 3 2019,positive,its better than most people give it credit for
Aug 3 2019,negative,that was stupid and totally random in the wrong meaning just like the fast and furious
Aug 2 2019,negative,this is not venom its a movie about an alien that takes human hosts its so bland from start to finish has no connection to spiderman universe somehow venom becomes the goodguy and defeats an even worse venom how this movie has an 80 on rt is astounding  venoms host is centralized in san francisco and personifies a heroine addict that you would actually see today the only people that find this as a good movie are those meth head antifa people who get free syringes in san francisco
Jul 31 2019,positive,im not a critic im just a normal person this a good entertaining movie just that if you are just a normal persona and want to have fun watch it
Jul 29 2019,positive,it is not related to the comic but this fact goes into the background because the film is really very beautiful and well done with an articulated and elaborate plot i really enjoyed the interaction between venom and the protagonist
Jul 29 2019,positive,i didnt ever have the urge to watch this film until it landed in my lap for free  i actually quite liked it though i wish the creatures were more creaturelike their bottom halves were too humanlike  looked like a costume but the action was pretty fair  i love me a tom hardy
Jul 29 2019,positive,proof critics dont know dk when it comes to ratingreviewing movies
Jul 28 2019,positive,amazing love tom hardy
Jul 28 2019,positive,tom hardy and his interactions with venom made the movie
Jul 28 2019,positive,very entertaining and fast moving  cool effects on the venom character but the jokes are a little corny
Jul 28 2019,positive,had its moments but that third act is a total mess still i enjoyed it for the most part
Jul 26 2019,positive,i watched this movie four times while it was still in the cinema because it was so much fun to see i loved the relationship between eddie and venom it was also so refreshing to see the trust between eddies ex and her new boyfriend when eddie needed help the new boyfriend didnt even hesitate to help and there was no possessive stay away from my girlfriend moment overall id say this movie was awesome
Jul 26 2019,positive,this was more sad to watch than logan pauls apology video
Jul 26 2019,positive,good entertaining flick critics must not have been paid enough
Jul 26 2019,positive,it has venoms design from the comics and its funny seeing tom hardy toying tom hardy
Jul 26 2019,negative,cast only tom hardy is pretty neat   venom vfx looks good sometimes   overall thats the only 2 good points 
Jul 25 2019,positive,really good actually tom hardy does well talking to his symbiote buddy i wanna see more 
Jul 25 2019,positive,i didnt think it possible to tell an entertaining venom narrative with the absence of spiderman but here 2018s venom has proven me wrong  its a simple movie characters are simple their motivations are simple the set design is simple the cinematography is simple so on and so forth venom is not a technically impressive masterpiece what it succeeds in however is giving us one of the best interpretations of its title character ive seen in any medium  the chemistry between tom hardys eddie brock and michelle williamss love interest character may be dead on arrival but the back and forth eddie brock has with the symbiote is some of the most entertaining fun outright bizarre and enjoyable dialogue ive seen in any recent film  the film technically has two antagonists one of which being a symbiote whose early scenes in the film basically act as what if the terminator could possess people scenes and those are entertaining they dont add much in the way of plot or character development but when youre here to see a movie about alien creatures bonding with human hosts it should honestly be excused venom isnt pretending to be the harbinger of quality storytelling  which is apparent when it comes to the films central villain carlton drake hes cartoonishly evil and riz ahmeds performance leaves a lot to be desired by the films third act the giant monster battle between venom and riot becomes one of the films least interesting moments on top of being messy and not well produced the characters and motivations simply arent deep enough to back it up  most of the supporting cast throughout does a good job but again its all very simple jenny slates performance was respectable and reid scotts character has an entertaining viewpoint on the happenings of eddie brock as a doctor trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here but theres nothing that notable its supporting cast really does theyre serviceable though and sometimes thats all they need to be  with flaws considered whats good here is still good tom hardy is having a blast with this character and it shows the writers knocked it out of the park with the dialogue and the bizarre touches like venoms affinity for tater tots is sure to stick with you  at times funny frightening action packed and flaccidly romantic venom is a tonal rollercoaster its also a lot of fun if you strap yourself in for it  theres also a scene where venom does a sick superman seat grab on a motorcycle why did critics hate this again
Jul 23 2019,positive,it was a great movie why did the critics hate it it makes no sense
Jul 23 2019,positive,very fun movie but the plot has problems 
Jul 22 2019,positive,pretty dang good movie tom hardy was fantastic 
Jul 22 2019,positive,how can this be critically reviewed worse than captain marvel it was way better than captain marvel and a surprisingly entertaining  funny film
Jul 21 2019,negative,met my expectations for the most part in terms of being some cheesy action to pass the time        i found tom hardy playing as brock questionable beforehand and the small amount journalist bits he did have were kinda crappy but serviceable although the actual action bits which to be honest was the main selling point of this he fitted that role well as he always does so made sense in the end       expected a bit more character development between hardy and venom and while fun at times the film barely scratched the surface and venom motives at the end were laughable in a bad way     feels like this is just a setup for more films
Jul 21 2019,positive,i honestly dont understand why venom is so hated i thought that it was a great movie its not high art but high art isnt what im looking for when i go to the movies
Jul 20 2019,positive,the message was really dark and demonic movie was ok
Jul 20 2019,positive,have to disagree with the critics a fun film great sfx and a good performance from hardy and a good storyline
Jul 19 2019,positive,great movie better the nore times you see it
Jul 19 2019,negative,pretty awful  story was written in about 30 minutes  zero depth or complexity to it  another lazy comic book adaptation  really disappointing
Jul 19 2019,positive,it was fun and charming in a way that allowed me to ignore or forgive any flaws it had 
Jul 19 2019,positive,personally one of my favorite romcoms yet
Jul 18 2019,positive,venom was funny did not lack action and some kinda creepy parts creepy things are what i live for
Jul 17 2019,positive,the story has some holes in it but the antihero characterization is perfect seriously underrated 
Jul 17 2019,negative,most of this movie is a turd in the wind
Jul 17 2019,negative,one of our favorite comic book supervillains ruined by one flat origin story
Jul 16 2019,neutral,decent and fun movie the action scenes were good but the writing and acting was shoddy at times this movie was also unexpectedly funny which i liked i think a sequel has potential to be really good
Jul 16 2019,negative,decent thought animation was tacky and story felt glued together also could been better casting but the actors put out what i expected from a super hero movie would not see again didnt miss much of you havent seen it 
Jul 15 2019,negative,halfway through i just didnt care some good action sequences but by the end this movie falls flat 
Jul 14 2019,positive,could have been better
Jul 14 2019,positive,fun and entertaining   far better what i expected 
Jul 14 2019,positive,although this movie started slow it picked up as time went on and was a good time tom hardy is a good venom and cant wait for venom to show up in a new spiderman movie
Jul 13 2019,positive,some of u dont like this movie because u hate fun and it shows 
Jul 13 2019,positive,solid movie very entertaining 
Jul 12 2019,positive,this was probably one of the times ive ever had the most fun at a movie theatre myself and 6 of the guys in our circle we are all huge comic book fans and when a venom came out we went to see it as a big group this is the type of movie you wanna watch with a group because so many elements of it are really good and so many elements are so corny to the point where they become good depending on the environment you are watching this movie in it was a great time loved the movie for the most part critics rated this way way too low tom hardy is unreal and the main catalyst for this movie the fact that tom hardy was eddie just made the whole movie that much better this is a good fun movie that gets enhanced depending on the environment you are watching it in its not a bad movie by any means the cgi and visuals were amazing as well really really good time i honestly cant wait for the next one 
Jul 11 2019,positive,a amazing marvel film great actors and brilliant role played by hardy very witty character which i loved and a must watch
Jul 11 2019,positive,movie is great has its flaws but still holds up critics like most of time are wrong they probably thought sw tlj was good 
Jul 11 2019,positive,the motorcycle chase was exciting tom hardys performance was great with some funny moments but the last fight was awfully shot
Jul 10 2019,positive,i wasnt sure exactly what to expect  but i have to say that i enjoyed the movie   it had its moments of fun and all in all  was pretty good 
Jul 9 2019,positive,good special effects
Jul 8 2019,positive,it was a silly movie but i like action humor 
Jul 8 2019,positive,excellent movie great ending very enjoyable 
Jul 8 2019,positive,this was a solid movie tom hardy gives a great performance and the movie is well worth the watch for any spiderman fan comedy action in a more mature setting this movie works but the villain is usually venom and it feels a little strange seeing him as a protagonist 
Jul 6 2019,positive,clever plot interesting characters and great acting i really enjoyed this movie not sure why the critic score was so low on rt  this was a very entertaining movie
Jul 6 2019,positive,bathroom scene when heard voice was exactly right on couldnt believe how true to life that was son loved the chase scenes and that he was an antihero  not completely good or bad believable character super scary face
Jul 6 2019,positive,gripping action film with stunning visuals first marvel film i have seen i loved the way venom talked to eddie
Jul 6 2019,positive,awesome and chaos
Jul 5 2019,positive,so good i love venoms voice and the relationship between eddie and venom love the fight scenes too
Jul 4 2019,positive,i honestly dont think its that bad it has an interesting story villain and a well written relationship between eddie brock
Jul 4 2019,positive,the best parts of the movie are when venom is on screen everything else is pretty underwhelming
Jul 3 2019,negative,a pathetic attempt at creating a franchise based on a supporting character with little personality or weight on their own who thought this would work
Jul 2 2019,positive,this was actually really good
Jul 2 2019,negative,one of the worst comic book movies ever made the plot acting action sequences and timing were all horrific would rather watch a kid running around in a venom costume on the street than watch this again
Jul 2 2019,positive,its a pretty good watch tom hardy was great as always
Jun 30 2019,neutral,tom hardy  as both eddie brock  especially venom  is a lot of fun but the antagonist is a toothless cliche the first 30m felt unnecessary couldve been condensed to about 510m while the ending felt rushed
Jun 30 2019,positive,really liked this movie it wasnt what i was expecting
Jun 30 2019,positive,i thought it was fun and entertaining granted there are a few missteps but honestly i enjoyed the action sets and the banter between brock and venom 
Jun 28 2019,positive,this movie is incredibly enjoyable dont get me wrong it certainly has its faults but the relationship between eddie and venom toms acting sells this heavily is a wonderful core
Jun 28 2019,positive,sports a barebones plot an overwrought first act and few interesting characters but eddie and venom pull through by the end the result is an antihero tale of a man whos got nothing left to lose except for his sanity and yes these types of men tend to be dangerous  
Jun 26 2019,positive,absolutely amazing in every aspect i adored the acting as well as the intense work that went into the cgi truly an astounding film 
Jun 26 2019,negative,that michelle williams made this within the same year as her masterful work in fosseverdon is really mindboggling to me was she just kinda bored when the offer for this came across her desk ill never understand it     from conception this spiderman spinoff with no acknowledgement of spiderman present has baffled me and id happy forgive the lack of spiderman if this was good on its own but its not even close its bizarre from start to finish but isnt bizarre enough to be actually intriguing it just kind of oddly exists for an hour and some change before reaching an abrupt and lackluster climax id rather have my head bitten off than watch this again 
Jun 24 2019,positive,i really like this venom movie to be honest even though its not really the great success movie thats how silly was venom in this movie but tom hardy was freaking amazing as venom i cant wait to see second movie im just hoping it doesnt get worse
Jun 24 2019,positive,this movie was fun and funny hubby  i enjoyed it and laughed quite a bit
Jun 24 2019,positive,much better than anticipated very entertaining
Jun 23 2019,neutral,this was entertaining but it feels like this movie should have been made 10 years ago in there era of the mcu venom feels clunky and old fashioned the cgi was ok but not great i recommend to someone that like action films but i dont recommend to fans of the comic sony keeps striking out with comic book character movies sony just doesnt care about the subject matter or the fans it feels they are just checking off a box and then on to the next lifeless movie  sony please sell the spiderman characters to disney so we can have a good movie also ask universal to sell the hulk characters so we can have good hulk movie thanks
Jun 23 2019,positive,it was corny but i really liked it
Jun 23 2019,positive,eh im not gonna compare this venom to the venom from spiderman 3 i mean i kinda like the revamps and all to venom and stuff to be  honest it has a good outro and all and others 
Jun 23 2019,positive,great movie only disappointment was that it was not accurate to the comics but it was still enjoyable
Jun 22 2019,positive,loved it fun film great cgi dont take these films so seriously guys just enjoy them love the end introduction to carnage woody harrelson will play that brilliantly  hmmm that wig though
Jun 22 2019,neutral,in recent years deadpool and logan have proved that there is a place in the market for rough and violent comic books although they were rated r which limits their viewing age and therefore may reduce their commercial potential they crushed the hmos and opened the door for others to follow suit  on his face venom is exactly the hollywood hit that should have been done after all one of the darkest characters in the world of comics stands at the center the image of a filthy vulgar and bloodied parasite from outer space that forces humans to serve as hosts and becomes their animal alter ego but the film which came out at the end of last week is doing exactly the opposite it is as clean as possible and as it should be honored in the united states with the environmentally friendly pg 13 rating maybe the studios chose this because the product belongs to the expanded universe of spiderman which in its last incarnations is directed primarily to brigade students so childishness is obligatory  indeed in the commercial screening in which i was present most of the audience were children at a class exit in this respect there is no doubt that sonny sonny did what he was hoped for in onom but the price was heavy  according to reports and this is indeed felt during the viewing many segments were cut from the film to soften it his star tom hardy even said that his favorite forty minutes were left out and when the lead actor himself said something like that it was hard to enter the hall with enthusiasm  a successful comic film also needs juicy sublime characters but here they are all casual  michelle williams who has already made a nonrespectable performance in feeling a bomb this year is also wasted here it is difficult for the hero to find time for others when he is engaged in dialogue with the alien parasite which is already a builtin problem of venom which may otherwise have been impossible to solve in comics or in any literary format conversations between character and inner voice are acceptable and even effective but in visual art like cinema it just does not work and its strange to watch tom hardy talking to an invisible entity with an irritating tone
Jun 20 2019,positive,held off on seeing this due to the bad reviews from various sources this movie was one of the better superhero movies in a while not sure why the critics hated it so much
Jun 20 2019,positive,i cant wait for venom 2
Jun 20 2019,positive,wellenough to make me happy
Jun 19 2019,positive,in order to keep this film great we need to keep shevenom from becoming hentai
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie was great the only reason why i put  4 star is because there is no orgin from where the symbiot came from in the movie if you want orgin go to spider man 3 insted  but otherwise it was great
Jun 18 2019,positive,i loved this movie all of the performances were good and the cgi was amazing too venoms design was fantastic they also got venom right even though thwre was no spider man the story was engaging too and eminems song at the end was really good
Jun 18 2019,positive,fun popcorn movie not in any way a genius masterpiece but offers solid entertainment
Jun 18 2019,positive,i love it when the critics hate a movie but the general public dont care i dont usually watch movies like venom but when i saw the cast i was intrigued im glad i decided to give it a watch is it was refreshing the movie isnt ashamed to be over the top and occasionally very silly at the same time the plot is interesting enough and the acting is mostly very good the casting director deserves huge credit as the actors have managed to make the film a brilliant watch amazing affects and a solid score underneath im looking forward to seeing the sequal 
Jun 17 2019,negative,very generic movie with lame acting and action this movie was a snoozefest that brings nothing original to the table highly overrated movie and very boring the plot and storyline are mediocre but its not the worst movie ive seen before its not terrible its just bad
Jun 17 2019,positive,i dont care about what the critics say this movie is not for them if you go to see a movie like venom for the plot and the story then you are obviously gonna have a bad time venom is not about that venom is a fun action movie he doesnt have to have spiderman in this movie this movie is not called spiderman and also venom this movie is called venom because he is the main character and the main focus of the film tom hardys performance was fun and energetic you can really tell that he loves what hes doing in short venom is a great movie it just isnt the kind of bland pandering underwhelmingly unoriginal and utterly boring movie that critics love to see over and over again watch venom youll have fun
Jun 16 2019,positive,underrated well produced acted and directed hardy is always good yes parts of the writing could have been better but for fans of venom or tom hardy its a great ride
Jun 15 2019,positive,awesome marvel film better than the usual cheesy carp low score on here from the usual superhero geeks hanging out spidermans ass living in their mums basement 
Jun 15 2019,positive,great film well paced enjoyed the story good action and acting
Jun 15 2019,positive,having read many reviews i wondered if i should watch venom but i glad i did the film is entertaining and is a must watch in my opinion tom hardy is brilliant as ever this film will keep you entertained
Jun 14 2019,negative,utter garbage like the rest of the marvel movies thought this might be different what are the pathetic voices all about 
Jun 14 2019,negative,dreadful on account of the makers going full out with cgi weak script poor actors and political correctness noise without substance
Jun 14 2019,positive,it wasnt bad it could be have been better 
Jun 13 2019,positive,could have been so great missed potential rushed cgi rushed soundtrack  the only reason i gave it 3 is because i love the character please can someone else remake this movie  
Jun 12 2019,positive,goodfunny movie its horror and overall tone would benefit for an r rating 
Jun 9 2019,positive,venom was amazing they did him well with such a talented actor
Jun 7 2019,negative,the movie had potential but it flopped  michelle williams who i think is a wonderful actress came off looking like it was her first acting gig  we can blame the director and writers for that  and tom hardy who i love also came off like a first gig acting job  the whole movie was silly  though we laughed because it was so stupid  it doesnt need a second movie 
Jun 7 2019,negative,writing this comment at the 20minute watching mark how does a script this stiff tired and predictable get a studio to greenlight a huge budget i would think that the vetting process would have to pass through several layers of intelligent and savvy producers and execs yet anyone could have read this thing and known it was a dud at best wonder who got fired
Jun 6 2019,positive,the movie is awesome  the visuals are stunni g  characterisation is wonderful
Jun 5 2019,positive,i had watched the movie the think i dont like about it is it doesnt have spiderman but for making a new universe from a movie this movie is perfect ill recommend you to watch it on higher resolution and watch everyone this movie is perfect with its own concept
Jun 5 2019,positive,wellpaced chaotic comedy with surprisingly three dimensional characters much better than i expected
Jun 5 2019,neutral,you may be wondering wow finally a venom review well hold your horses there because i actually did see this back in october when it came outkinda i fell asleep actually so i didnt think it was true to my nature to review something that i only remember through some half glimpses and such but i went back and knocked it out and yeah it was about what i was expecting venom is the story about eddie brock tom hardy a journalist living in san francisco that always digs deep even when its controversial to get the truth after he disobeys his boss and calls out carlton drake riz ahmed a techno billionaire think mark zuckerberg like eddie is fired and his fiance anne weying michelle williams leaves him months later eddie is jobless and just kinda bumming it around when he gets a lead that can have him finally expose drake for what he is really doing something to do with killing lots of homeless people to control a symbiote apparently soon enough eddie reached drakes lab but in the process has one of the alien symbiotes attach to him therefore creating the antihero venom the symbiote gives eddie super strength and in a way meshes with his own personality im gonna stop there since really thats the gist of the whole movie it has some pretty cool action but just falls so flat with story i often asked myself during the time watching it why do i even care because thats just it no one is likeable in this movie hardy is trying but has an accent that comes in and out michelle williams character is utterly useless here and forgettable and the bad guy overall just isnt that menacing its a movie that reminds me of the mid 2000s super hero films the bad ones like fantastic four 2005 elektra 2005  hulk 2003 lots of flash but just everything else is really terrible this is worth a rent at the very least but for most people this one just doesnt get it done
Jun 5 2019,positive,good popcorn moviei had you all wrong venom this whole time
Jun 4 2019,positive,fun chaotic and wild all in all one of my favorite movies despite some plot holes as the comedy makes up for it
Jun 4 2019,negative,tom hardy was pretty good the venom design looks pretty great some funny lines aaaaaaaaand thats it that is what venom has that pleased me
Jun 4 2019,positive,its a great movie mixed with comedy and action i love it
Jun 4 2019,positive,gotta love the bad guy
Jun 3 2019,positive,a crazy ride that is exciting and fun the biggest thing this movie suffers from is trying to avoid an r rating
Jun 2 2019,neutral,venom is a fun ride its just a shame the whole middle third of the movie is missing
Jun 2 2019,positive,awesome great action and effects great pacing 
Jun 1 2019,positive,critics got this one very wrong my friends coworkers and i all loved this movie
Jun 1 2019,negative,terribly acted and cheesy 
Jun 1 2019,positive,the best movie  i hope the next part will come out soon 
Jun 1 2019,positive,really surprised me  loved it have high hopes for the sequels 
Jun 1 2019,positive,loves the movie it is both action and comedy
Jun 1 2019,positive,i honestly enjoyed the movie if you in expecting to see a venom from the comics well let me tell you its not the best interpretation however i loved tom hardys acting the new venom is awesome 
Jun 1 2019,negative,venom  called so because marvel movies have none geez its not 2004 anymore film features scifivfx driven plot for secondary marvel character a symbiotic alien that looks like spiderman except with giant teeth the venom character was created by todd mcfarlane before he opted to leave marvel comics group and promote spawn essentially spidermans head drawn on top of dr stranges flowing cape movie is worth seeing for cgi effects elements choppy forgettable story otherwise 
May 31 2019,positive,very good movie  i hope venom 2 will be better with more venom 
May 30 2019,positive,all around a fun movie with lots of action and humor a great venom another reason to ignore critic reviews sure the plot isnt all the great but it still manages to be a fun ride the whole way through
May 30 2019,negative,real disappointment  story line was a far fetched mixture of alien turns humans into transformerlike creatures with the boring typical story of coming to earth to devour our resources while one alien decides to rebel  when the aliensorganisms voice took over i knew i should have ended the movie  cant believe this script passed muster and that the execs believe they could have a sequel postcredits
May 30 2019,positive,i thought the movie was awesome im a little disappointed that the movie didnt follow the original origin of how venom came to be however it was a great movie over all  i loved the cameo appearance of cletus kassady at the end of the movie i hope the sequel introduces carnage in a way that does the character justice 
May 30 2019,positive,just all around disappointing what a waste of an amazing character as well as terrific actors tom hardy michelle williams jenny slate lazy and nonsensical plotting wouldnt hurt as much if the dialogue and scenes were actually interesting but it squanders its entire premise its at least 30 minutes into this hour and a half long movie before venom even venoms its also kind of funny how strongly the first action sequence reminds me of the action in the awesome 2018 movie upgrade made way funnier because that movie stars discount tom hardy yet ended up being way better than the actual th movie the plot inconsistencies are too many too count from insanely serendipitous encounters to stupid decisions along with so many ridiculous things like the symbiotes killing everyone they match with that is not a perfect hostexcept for eddieand his girlfriend and that dog and drake oh and the malaysian lady and the emt worker at the beginningoh and the little girl  complete with a 3rd act cgi mess of a final villain this movie adheres directly to the code of the bottom of the barrel superhero releases of the 90s and the era before marvels mcu this movie is essentially this generations spawn
May 30 2019,positive,dunno why critics hate it but for me the movie is enjoyable though critics these days are dumb somehow last jedi garbage get 90 and this movie only get 29 which is bullshit
May 29 2019,positive,eh could be better i guess liked the parts about climate change and overpopulation parasite is cool guy 
May 28 2019,positive,great movie tons of action just enough character development 
May 28 2019,negative,there are 2 postcredits scenes    compared to other movies in the mcu this deserves about a 175 to 2  compared to regular super hero movies its a 25  im a huge fan of tom hardy but i dont think he was the right choice to play eddievenom for one he has a very hard time sticking with the american accent all the way through  the movie has a lot of action but on a meta level its totally predictable even the postcredits scene  its a cgi filled movie which is unfortunately where the mcu is heading  the story is ok at best and gets boring at times there are definitely pacing issues  mcu fans will likely come away impressed but anyone else may struggle to find this appealing
May 27 2019,positive,i dont like this movie but i love it 
May 27 2019,positive,popcorn blockbuster for watching with friends its actually good movie but it is not that type that ill watch during the long winter evening 
May 27 2019,negative,since when was venom sarcastic this was a very poor attempt and really ruined a lot of quality action scenes
May 26 2019,negative,have you ever watched a movie so bad that you start feeling embarrassed of how bad it is thats this movie what a total turd nugget 
May 26 2019,positive,very entertaining movie dark but funny i like this dark superhero as it brings different perspectives of superhero to the audience 
May 25 2019,positive,i thought venom was a really fun movie to watch they really humanised eddie as a character and it was a really fun dynamic between him and venom it wasnt the best movie made but it was fun to watch and the mix of tone when it came to humour and suspense was really interesting i liked the lack of cliched characterisation of eddies exs boyfriend and it was an enjoyable watch even if i hated the cgi of the symbiote by itself
May 24 2019,positive,better than most marvel films
May 24 2019,positive,this movie was great ive watched it about 5 times and its really good critics are wrong
May 23 2019,positive,startedup slow but then the action was terrific scenes of san francisco were true to form forget the professional critics  it was fun entertainment
May 22 2019,positive,beat my expectationsgood fun
May 22 2019,positive,so bad that its good i am not sure if the director wanted this movie to be stupid but i love it nothing makes sense dialogue is terrible and the dialogue edited in for venom was so obviously a voiceover that it was hilarious this whole movie was hilariously bad so here sony have 3 stars
May 21 2019,positive,never trust critics venom 2 will be amazing
May 20 2019,positive,yes its silly mindless popcorn stuffbut i personally enjoyed the ride
May 19 2019,positive,in my personal opinion this movie is beau
May 18 2019,positive,awesome  id definitely recommend it im not sure why the tomatometer has it so low though
May 16 2019,positive,fun movie critics were wrong about
May 16 2019,positive,great movie rotten tomatoes is retarded lol
May 14 2019,positive,the movie starts out very iffy but soon changes course and gets much better movie critic score is way off base much closer to 80 imho im hoping the can make this into a much better series of films
May 13 2019,positive,it was a really good movie i never expected i would enjoy the movie this much must try
May 12 2019,positive,venom was good i dont understand why the movie snobs hated this movie so much venom was dark but entertaining my fav scene was williams turning into shevenom at eating a head for herself i wouldwill definitely check out a sequel
May 12 2019,negative,the movie was so bad
May 11 2019,negative,stupid naive boring example high security lab with no cameras example2 my boss murders people so i dont go to the police but find this shady drunk reporter i was not able to finish watching it sorry
May 11 2019,positive,this is the movie venom needed he is big bad and loud all the movie critics got this film wrong they sould read the new venom comic books venom doesnt need spidey he is good and bad it would be hard to make another venom film that is as good as this dont forget venom is dark
May 9 2019,positive,i love this movie venom is sassy and i know its not it the classic venom but its amazing if you give it a try
May 9 2019,positive,loved it while it started slow it was still hilarious to watch
May 9 2019,positive,i do not grasp the professional critic review as this was by far the best comic based film i have seen since nolan it nailed the character hardy was incredible and for once created a legitimate and likable antihero my only regret is not seeing this in theaters loved it
May 5 2019,positive,lovwd this movie ï 12âï 12ï 12â
May 5 2019,positive,i love this movie at the begging ill admit it was pretty boring buttowards the middle that was when all the characters truly shine and i love venoms new design stayed true to the comics my only issue was the cringe worthy acting from riz ahmed sadly he just didnt make the cut for example during the car chase scene he was suppose to have acertain mix of authority pride and anger but instead it sounded like a whinny teenager if i had a choice for a one time villian in this movie it would have been   deckard shaw his sarcasm bluntness and authority once hes entered a room wouldve been perfect for this movie    alsoeddies ex girlfriend she needed to do more than just push a button in my opinion she shouldve blown something up but instead she was just another side character sigh     ps love venoms attitude and stan lee cameo at the end   nice job sony i partially forgive you for getting rid of     spectacular spiderman     you have a fraction of a fraction of my forgiveness as ui shaggy would say 0001    overall great movie cant wait for carnage please dont mess him up or i wont forgive you    coolbeans375 over and out
May 5 2019,positive,i understand why many critics hate this movie i respect their opinions personally i like it very much and find it very entertaining
May 5 2019,positive,it was a great film dont know why people are hatin but i loved it it was fun to watch and it was very injoyable i definitely recommend it this gets an a
May 4 2019,negative,venom is an awesome character and this movie does him no justice  the acting seems mediocre in how this movie is put together  maybe im used to seeing the way marvel magically puts together its movies in such a fantastic way  this movie could have been great  i do believe however that marvel should be in charge of all marvel characters  id like to see universal and sony either sell the rights back or lend them out for these movies
May 4 2019,negative,boring terrible acting lame dialo venom is reduced to a buddy cop dynamic 
May 3 2019,negative,holy mother of christ this is an epic pos acting is bad plot is bad writing is bad the titular character doesnt show up until 59 minutes into a 111 minute movie what the bad guy has no motives the protagonist has no motives i just dont get it this is why marvel needs to be in charge way to drop the ball on what could have been a great movie sony
May 2 2019,positive,this was a great movie in the mcu i do not like hardy as an actor but this is his only redeeming role i watched this movie with my kids and other than some small potty words this was a great movie two thumbs up
May 1 2019,positive,yeah this movie had a lot of problems but i enjoyed it so so much  i would give it like an 88 out of a hundred the pacing was way off but there were times that made the movie funnier eddie has a parasite for 4 hours and gives up on life  hilarious   venom met eddie and in one day decided yup this is the loser im going to live with forever    loved it  i saw this movie in theaters twice because it was just so nice to watch     when i saw trailers i had no interest in seeing the film because it looked like every other dark and edgy film out there but seeing it was like an alien romcom buddy cop movie amazing brilliant nothing else like it
Apr 30 2019,positive,the movies not a total wish there is enjoyment in it
Apr 30 2019,negative,wow what a tremendous mess the audience score for this film is not flattering not in that it speaks poorly of the movie more in that it speaks poorly of the audience this entire movie is just a pile of disparate ideas it is tonally all over the place moreover what is there isnt particularly well stitched together i imagine a lot of important stuff was left on the cutting floor as vemon often has a jittery janky flow if it wasnt the editing then it was truly poorly scripted     so what are the problems then well for starters it is ugly as sin it is hard to imagine a worse looking movie with a budget that high it is truly baffling venom himself look fairly decent sure he has that claymation look but that isnt untypical of cg it is everything else that looks really rocky we are officially at the point where our best looking videos games are starting to look like our movies at least the ones that stumble with their effects sad days     oh and hardys performance what a truly odd choice he made i dont think he is a bad actor so his performance just feels baffling to me everything from his mannerisms to his accent are odd this performance is certainly the low point of his career       beyond the movie looking bad flowing poorly being tonally inconsistent and having a poor lead performance i can truly say that the movie buried underneath these problems is painfully dull if they were to have polished venom and worked out its various kinks it would have just been another very bland super hero movie    it isnt a good movie guys it just isnt
Apr 29 2019,positive,great take on a tired concept  walk right on past the tomato score and take a gander at what the audiences thought  dont let the politics fool you  venom is worth the watch
Apr 29 2019,negative,10 years of marvel scripts have showcased characters sharp wit as well as some admittedly cheesy moments however the writing for this movie is nothing short of appalling this fine cast are reduced to little more than a running commentary on the obvious this combined with some blurry visual effects result in a movie experience that you may enjoy for all the wrong reasons there is possible redemption in that the door is wide open for a sequel that lets face it surely must be able to offer more than this movie was able to
Apr 27 2019,positive,not great by any means but manages to be a fun ride
Apr 27 2019,negative,on of the most atrocious cliche formula superhero movies ever atrocious junk
Apr 27 2019,positive,dont bother with the critics rating of the movie this is a good movie over all the beginning starts slow with tom hardys character being a screw up but the movie gets exponentially better as time goes on tom hardy does a great job as venom and brings his usual dry humor as well i thought it was a great movie especially if you are into comic books or marvel in general i really hope they make a venom 2
Apr 27 2019,positive,great movie ignore the critics they dont have a clue
Apr 26 2019,negative,this movie just reiterates my confusion why do people like tom hardy at least they cover him up with cg from time tl time i never thought anything would make me utter this sentance but topher grace played a better venom
Apr 25 2019,positive,thos great critics dont know the audiences taste i was about to miss the movie by all of you i and all the people that i know liked this movie you all really  dont know what we want to see in a superheroes movie this page is for us and not for show your tastes
Apr 25 2019,positive,there were some holes in the plotit was still fun to watch the characters arent like in the comics but their journey throughout the movie feels right and not forced the relationships between the characters are very refreshing
Apr 25 2019,negative,cgi was decent wouldnt use the film to wipe my bottom otherwise tired of these guys re writing the stories of well historied comic characters it destroys pop culture history its bs no mention at all of spider man or venoms true origins as the black spider man none at all nor any mention of eddie brocks rivalry with peter parker much less venoms with spider man not to mention the fact that venom was actually a villain once upon a time but hey no one needs to know these things right whatever thanks for the turd and ignorance
Apr 25 2019,positive,i actually liked this show a lot more than the tomatometer liked it i find this movie to have a big bad jaws like movie score that fit the symbiote comic substantially this movie should have raised more eyes than it did 45 out of 5
Apr 24 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movies great acting from the main character and worth the watch
Apr 24 2019,positive,venom is not one of the best superhero movies of all time its no dark knight trilogy or infinity war basically but however it is a movie that shows what eddie and venom really is i enjoyed my time with venom and i think not only its a good movie but its definitely a movie worth seeing
Apr 23 2019,positive,not sure why movie snobs hate this movie after reading the critics reviews i was expecting an atrocious attempt at bringing one or marvels best antiheros to life needless to say i was pleasantly surprised overall i just felt it wasnt enough time to develop the complex story but they did a good job with what they had tom hardy was the perfect host and i loved the dry comedic twist he brought audience score is 80 agreed     would i have been disappointed if i had  paid to see it at the theaters maybe but if i went to see it at the theaters i would have been a superhero geek to start with i paid to watch streaming and felt like it was pretty damn good
Apr 22 2019,negative,awful cgi not so very floppy dialogues
Apr 20 2019,neutral,i really hope that the sequel is better haha
Apr 20 2019,positive,despite the critics panning it this is one of the best marvel movies ive seen in a long time its fun and funny
Apr 20 2019,negative,wrost of the wrost this should have never been made it was just a unnecessary cash grab i just dont understand why sony make this after they made deal with disneymarvel i was hoping they would cancel this movie
Apr 20 2019,negative,subpar writing and directing and some confusing editing even the special effects werent all that great did anyone at the studio care at all i was very disappointed with a movie i was looking forward to as venom has always been one of the interesting comic book characters the only thing that saves this movie is a few well timed jokes and the performance of the always excellent tom hardy
Apr 18 2019,positive,good movie not really fun movie extremely dont take it too seriously and youll be able to enjoy yourself if im actually critiquing this the plot is rushed especially the first 20 minutes way too much to cram in without explanation but the relationship between eddie and venom is pretty cool and most of the jokes land well
Apr 17 2019,positive,amazing thrilling and heartfelt 5
Apr 17 2019,negative,i wasnt able to believe how bad it actually was the pacing reminded me of a clip show rather than a movie
Apr 16 2019,positive,this was a decent movie critics sometimes get it wrong i rarely go by what critics rate movies and check audience score
Apr 16 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes you suck  i find that this movie is underrated and for some nobody actors thay did a really good job so i dont know what you critics over there smoking but somebody should go and fire you ï 12 12ï 12âï 12 12
Apr 15 2019,negative,new hellboy is much better than this horrible movie
Apr 14 2019,positive,cute and unexpected i want a second
Apr 14 2019,positive,its pretty cool sfx and directing are really decent also the characters of venom and brock are quite convincing and combined they make a very interesting antihero the movie is a nice watch and id love to see this version of venom integrated into the current mcu the only thing that bothered me was the fake chemistry between the main character and his girlfriend
Apr 13 2019,positive,while it does have its story issues and inconsistent cgi venom is an incredibly fun film from start to finish that i would love to see more of
Apr 13 2019,positive,i dont know but i liked it very much showing venom as hero is what driven me towards the film loved the film the high intense action with high intense background music just wow
Apr 13 2019,positive,one of the funniest marvel movies
Apr 12 2019,positive,amazing the effects were awesome
Apr 12 2019,positive,you might not like me for saying this but i think it was a great movie with a great origin i have no idea why nobody likes it great beginning great middle great end best movie of october
Apr 11 2019,positive,this movie was so extremely close to crossing the line of good it is quite average which means its still fun to watch the first time and for some maybe a second time it was so close to being good im sad it didnt cross that line the first half of the film was just above the line but it started to slowly drop down until it basically plummeted in creativity at the end the end credit scene makes me happy though
Apr 11 2019,negative,what an absolute shit show with next to no redeeming quality how this has anything but a 0 on here boggles my mind the audience score shocks me even more    maybe i missed something but i wasnt a fan hardys terrible accent the below par cgi and i could go on i really dont understand what drew people in to see this    the story was messy the only high point at all was the interaction between brock and the symbiote    im not even going to go on here i dont want to waste peoples time anymore than the movie has how this is getting a sequel is beyond me
Apr 10 2019,positive,i loved this movie it was so goofy and a fun movie ill take this over spiderman3 any day
Apr 10 2019,positive,what does it tell you when you see a huge gap between critics and audience on rotten tomatoes it tells me that by definition critics are useless literally
Apr 10 2019,positive,loved it funny and crude
Apr 10 2019,positive,i enjoyed it dont listen to the negative critics it was fun
Apr 10 2019,positive,slow opening finished strong
Apr 10 2019,negative,you know it has its moments i did kinda enjoy the weird relationship between eddie and venom theyre lucky they managed to snag tom hardy  god knows how  because its him that keeps this from being a complete trainwreck and there were enough action sequences to keep you from being bored but for the most part its really not good the overall tone is like a strange mishmash of ang lees and louis leterriers hulk films except with a little more cringeworthy humour and dialogue thrown in for good measure  turd in the wind come on and the story and characters are terribly written with littletono depth to either of them     yes its a ridiculously shallow film where its clear the main concern was how much money itll bring in all it really does in the end is accentuate just how far superhero films have come since marvel established their cinematic universe
Apr 10 2019,positive,even if the plot wasnt the exact same from the comics it was still an amazing movie
Apr 10 2019,positive,its really good tbh
Apr 9 2019,positive,marvel does it again great effects but okay story would love to see the sequel
Apr 8 2019,positive,this was one of the most entertaining movie ive seen i a long time i had a lot of fun watching it eddie and venom are so much fun to see together
Apr 8 2019,neutral,this movies storyline is a little slow and rushed but the characters in this movie is great and tom hardy did a good job at acting
Apr 8 2019,positive,sony did this peoplemarvel studios had nothing to do with this moviecmon yall should know that the actual movie was awful but venom himself was incredible he looked goodsounded good and i wish he was in the mcu lol tom hardy is amazing but again the actual movie was pretty bad give him back to marvel so he can be properly put on screen
Apr 7 2019,neutral,some parts were ok but the terrible eddie brock accent and overall demeanor and plot holes really hold it back from being a good movie 
Apr 7 2019,positive,its a shame the critics were so tough on this it was a fun watch
Apr 7 2019,positive,i have not seen this movie so i can not give a rating but the difference between the audience score and the tomatometer is a huge difference which should say how inaccurate the score is
Apr 7 2019,positive,venom was oddly satisfying with the dark tone mixed with humor and action as well as body horror elements i enjoyed it but its not for everyone though at least marvels winning unlike hasbro and dc
Apr 7 2019,negative,this movie is undeniably bad its cheesy and has some of the worst diologe i have seen in a box office film that being said i couldnt stop watching it even dispite wanting to what kept me in was entirely venoms voice and tom hardys charm and good looks thats it
Apr 6 2019,positive,didnt expect much but i was entertained  i liked the unexpected humor
Apr 6 2019,positive,good movie but visably not a marvel studios production
Apr 6 2019,positive,adrift from its supposed character purpose it sets up on what you should expect from a spidermman movie without any positive resemblance mostly focusing on a character individualism creates more character development driving it away from its story complexity
Apr 6 2019,positive,4519 really good fight scenes kind of funny watched with my baby
Apr 6 2019,positive,the beginning was a little rushed but really it wasnt that bad of a movie 
Apr 5 2019,positive,this movie is better than it has any right to be its by no means a classic origin story but its not bad if you want a nice rental where you can throw your brain out its fun theres a few cringe worthy lines but overall its not the bomb people thought it would be solid c plus superhero movie
Apr 5 2019,negative,marvel back at it being safe rather than great should have been darker than watchmen and more brutal than the punisher instead we get a generic marvel movie trying to appeal to everyone with a safe pg13 rating and horrible cgi marvel has new murants coming out in 2019 if they fail me again they have lost my patronage for life
Apr 4 2019,positive,awesome movie must watch
Apr 4 2019,positive,entertaining movie i especially like the way venom develops a relationship with his host
Apr 3 2019,positive,didnt actually want to see this movie because i had an idea it was like alien and its dozen of sequels and remakes  but i watched it and actually it wasnt that bad  not academy award worthy but not bad   it was kinda funny too   its a good rainy day b movie
Apr 3 2019,positive,the cgi and acting are superb no plot holes no one left in confusion even if you know nothing about the universe every character no matter how little screen time is given has a personality something a little of superhero movies fail at these days and from the amazingly witty jokes of eddie brock to feeling the same attachment he does to venom throughout the movie the emotional ride is great its just so amazing if you havent seen it you really really should the worst reviews are movie critics who cant understand film is changing and so are its standards
Apr 3 2019,negative,this movie was unbelievably bad it could have been great too other than the fact that the film is really messy and chaotic the film is also just really stupid venom is a movie that you laugh at the whole way through and not in a good way
Apr 2 2019,positive,what makes me disappointed is why is the scene cut in 40 minutes for others its good
Apr 2 2019,positive,is venoms voices by kang or kodos
Apr 2 2019,negative,another adaptation of the marvel universe nothing new very visual effects cgi action without surprises history more than predictable waste of time
Apr 1 2019,positive,rotten tomatoes did this movie dirty shame on them i actually loved it and apparently so did the audience
Apr 1 2019,negative,i hate this movie because it is a waste of money to make the movie 
Apr 1 2019,positive,let me start by saying i love tom hardy so i am partial to all of his work venom was not what i expected i thought there was be some sort of tie to spiderman which except for the plot being new york there was no tie at all i also thought it would be a bit dark and even borderline scary but i found myself laughing hysterically at times tom hardy and riz ahmed were brilliant in their  roles and ultimately i enjoyed this film very much
Apr 1 2019,negative,silly boring and nonsense better wait to stream it on netflix once its available or rent it dont even bother in buying the dvdbluray edition
Apr 1 2019,positive,i was a fan of the film tom hardy wasis amazing my only complaint is that the plot didnt really come out until the last 20 minutes of the flick but overall great flick 
Mar 31 2019,positive,how are the critics so out of touch with the audience venom was great  so funny
Mar 31 2019,positive,i genuinely enjoyed this film it reminded me of transformers due to the relationship between the creaturerobot and the main character it is funny thrilling and very enjoyable it keeps you on the edge of your seat while keeping you entertained i would recommend it for fans of marvel and superhero movies it is highly underrated and i advise watchers to see for themselves whether they like it or not as reviews are not always accurate
Mar 30 2019,positive,not usually the type of movie i would watch but it was actually pretty good
Mar 30 2019,negative,its mostly as cruddy as the reviews suggest 
Mar 30 2019,positive,overall thought it was an entertaining movie with the relationship between venom and eddie offering a cool dynamic oftentimes not on par with most marvel movies but also didnt think it deserved the hate it received im hoping theyll make a sequel and improve on this first installment because venom has plenty of potential as a character
Mar 30 2019,positive,i thought effects were great  i have been a huge fan of venom since the comics and beyond i enjoyed the movie and hope they will do another
Mar 30 2019,positive,wtf rotten is a bich
Mar 29 2019,positive,while not a perfect film it certainly gave most audiences myself included what we wanted tom hardys range over the top combat and spectacle and the titular critter   critics tend not to know what theyre talking about and if theres one thing that shows it its this result
Mar 29 2019,positive,wasnt nearly as bad as i thought but definitely didnt feel needed tom hardy does a great job and i love the relationship between him and venom the other cast felt useless riz ahmed plays a generic villain that feel useless and has nothing to do they completely dropped the ball with michelle williams and she had nothing to do and the script was awful at times but overall its a fun movie with fun moments but still just felt like it didnt need to happen
Mar 29 2019,negative,just a horribly made movie which thinks its good because it contain jokes like venom calling eddie a pussy and has a thrid act that starts and ends just like that
Mar 28 2019,positive,this toms best movie by far and one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time i believe the ratings it got do not give it justice at all
Mar 28 2019,positive,i went into this movie with extremely lowered expectations and from that perspective i actually had fun with it  lets make one thing clear this is not a venom movie  in fact its kind of despicable how irresponsible it isnt a venom movie  its more like the superhero movies we got in the 90s where they only had a vague connection to their source character and were never tied to any larger universe  however from that perspectiveyeah the movies actually quite a bit of fun  its stupid as hell but it is fun  a big part of that is the weird bromance between tom hardy and the symbiote  its not venom at all but it is a helluva lot of fun to watch and hardy totally sells it  hes going all out with this weirdass performance  it didnt always work but it was consistently entertaining  the action scenes are pretty fun and creative too  yes the final one does fall back into two cgi creations banging into each other but his apartment takeover at the beginning is fun and the motorcycle chase with tons of practical explosions both are creative and cool  venom is a dumb movie but its the right kind of dumb  theres a part of me that hates it for denying us a legit venom movie with spiderman and carnage and maybe an rrating but i cant deny i was pretty damn entertained through most of it  i cant really call it a good movie but id be lying if i said i didnt enjoy it

Mar 25 2019,negative,this movie is not only one of the worst of 2018 it is also one of the worst movies in the marvel universe franchise  there is nothing to like about this movie  the acting and dialogue are just plain terrible  tom hardys constant screaming and moaning were annoying beyond all belief  the character of dr carlton drake was nothing but a combination of all the stupid and tired old cliches we see in a movie villain  the whole thing of him taking homeless people off the streets to do secret experiments on them is so old and tired its not even funny  michelle williams is completely wasted in a throwaway role  dont waste your time with this piece of noisy and chaotic garbage  trust me you will not regret missing venom
Mar 24 2019,negative,4 4 4 5 5 6 3 3 3 3  40  my life is wasted  324 2019
Mar 24 2019,positive,it was enjoyable for some parts but it was not actually good this will be one of my guilty pleasure films
Mar 23 2019,positive,not horrible medeoker still good though
Mar 23 2019,positive,another day another comicbook movie when will it end    so after the somewhat dismal iteration of venom in spiderman 3 sony went back to the drawing board initially plans seemed to revolve around having venom get in on the action in the rebooted the amazing spiderman franchise but that failed there were ideas to have venom kickstart his own franchise which would share the same universe as other marvel characters there was also an idea to have venom in spiderman homecoming there was also an idea to have a low budget adult version whatever rumours or stories we can all agree that for some reason the powers that be really wanted a venom movie    so eventually we got this movie whilst on a deep space mission a corporation led by the evil carlton drake riz ahmed manages to discover a comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms bringing four specimens back to earth one escapes and causes the shuttle to crash which unleashes it in the meantime drake starts to experiment on humans trying to get the aliens to match with a host the aliens need an oxygenbreathing host to survive    as you might imagine eddie brock tom hardy eventually gets into this corporations hq with help from an employee and is accidentally taken over by one of the symbiotes we then follow brock as he adjusts to the alien inside him drake and his goons coming after brock and eventually the last surviving symbiote taking over drake resulting in riot    now im not up on every marvel character so i dont know how accurate this movie is to the original source material im guessing there have been many changes but i do have some large queries the symbiotes are looking for a planet with hosts they can take over and consume ok so what exactly is their plan of action for earth eat every human and then what is this all they do     at the start of the movie we are led to believe that its hard to find the correct match for the symbiote drake is going through loads of human test subjects trying to find a human that will bond with the symbiote ok thats fine but at the same time the symbiote riot seems to be jumping from human to human no probs at all add to that later on in the movie the symbiote venom seems to have no problem taking over brocks exgirlfriend and a dog riot also takes over drake no problems too i dunno if i missed something but this just seems inconsistent because we are led to believe that its hard to find the perfect match for the symbiotes and when venom finds brock its treated like a shocking breakthrough    i also found kinda odd that the aliens have names from our human language i thought in the comics brock came up with the name himself once combined with the symbiote  but in this movie the symbiotes seem to already have their names i also thought venom changed its mind way too quickly about earth and humans the symbiote seems to take the choice of betraying its own very easily purely based on liking brock and it had only been combined to brock for a day or so maybe not even that far too convenient for me    aside from that the movie is generally incredibly dated in style and outcome this breallyb feels like a movie that came out in the 90s it looks like a movie that came out in the 90s the cgi ranges from really sweet lookin to really terrible lookin closeups of venom are great most everything else is bad most of the action sequences are woefully bad in both execution and visuals the stunts are clearly stunts there are tonnes of obvious greenscreen shots venom looks rubbery at times and plastic at others when venom fights riot its an indistinguishable cgi mess and the bad guys are astronomically cliched this is the present day spawn    yet despite all that for some reason i kinda liked this i like that they tried to make this somewhat dark and gritty and for the most part they succeeded the start of the movie is quite eerie playing up some horror tropes and hardy definitely helps with his unhinged dirty druggieesque performance personally i think they should have gone for broke with an all out r18 rated flick because the head biting scenes needed to be seen as they stand its stupid because theres no blood or gore and im pretty sure onlookers would be more horrified the asian shopkeeper at the end much    but yeah cant quite put my finger on it but i sorta liked this kinda reminded me of the trashy mid 90s flicks id see at my local odeon on a wednesday afternoon its not a good movie its legitimately bad with pooreverything truth be told still in an odd way this is justdumb fun
Mar 22 2019,positive,too bad they cut out 40 minutes 
Mar 21 2019,positive,as a popcorn no thinker its good but think about the impauseable senerios too much and the movie plain sucks
Mar 21 2019,positive,good film take it with pinch salt you will have a good movie night    only thing wrong is there was a quick change of heart but no reason to why this happened
Mar 21 2019,negative,a pg13 version of venom enough said
Mar 20 2019,positive,much better than i anticipated
Mar 20 2019,negative,this movie was complete and absolute garbage its actually inconceivable to me that anyone read the script and decided to move forward with it it is trash in so many ways i wish it would just cease to exist when time travel becomes a reality the first thing we should do is erase this turd from the annals of history
Mar 20 2019,positive,yet another movie where i find myself shaking my head at the critics this movie was entertaining from beginning to end with humor thrown in here and there the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the car scene was longer than it needed to be otherwise the action was great tom hardy was fantastic much better than the last venom and the overall story was fantastic i would recommend this movie to anyone
Mar 19 2019,positive,good film not great but good
Mar 18 2019,negative,from the start did not feel that i was gonna like this whole movie seemed boring to me and i felt uninterested only liked last scene at end of movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,boring didnt go all the way with the r rating so nothing of note there are 2 or 3 really cool scenes that could have been way better without the censure the only decent thing about the movie is eddie interactions with venom the bad guy is forgettable wtheck with the times jump and the cg avatar is 10 years older and still has better cgi than this movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,this is one of my favorite marvel movies to date better than deadpool tom hardy was awesome and on point i cannot wait for the sequel
Mar 16 2019,positive,venom is a flawed but fun movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,amazing main actor really good movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,this version of venom is a lot better than when topher grace potrayed the character in this movie venom proved itself to be a much more powerful symbiote than the one in spiderman 3
Mar 15 2019,positive,great fun this was so much better than i expected based on the negative reviews id read  tom hardys performance was terrific  i was particularly impressed when i learned that he provided the voice for venom as well
Mar 14 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  i didnt miss the connection to spiderman  i think it worked well on its own
Mar 14 2019,positive,a good movie   thought it wouldnt be too goood but it was actually interesting and i actually liked it
Mar 14 2019,positive,i remember when this movie first cane out and i saw the low numbers start popping up i was disappointed to say the least venom has always been one of my favorite comic characters but then i saw the audience reviews and it gave me all new hope which inspired me to leave this review   venom is a great comic book movie because it doesnâtmt take itself too seriously while not making a joke out of the movie eddie and venomâtms relationship is ridiculously funny because of the absurdity of it and the fact the venom has absolutely no filter some things in the story feel rushed due to the last minute shortening of the movie but it is still easy enough to understand and sets up great moments for the characters i went with friends to see this movie and we all got a kick out of it while i wish i could see the original movie in itâtms full rated r glory i just canâtmt see telling someone to pass up on this movie if you grew up watching marvel cartoons or even if you enjoy the lighter hearted side of the new marvel universe    oh and a side note the cgi is really impressive with a character like venom it was pretty much inevitable but unlike the climatic scene of black panther venom looks like heâtms supposed to and they take the cgi to itâtms limits with venomâtms weird body movements stretching and the face that does basically whatever it wants to iâtmm really looking forward to seeing a second venom movie that isnâtmt hit by last minute huge tweaks
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was not as bad as the critics say  this story is sloppy but it is solid enough and of course entertaining  but with that being said i hope disney create their own version of venom and let this movie be a solo sony film
Mar 13 2019,negative,venom is a complete mess    letâtms start with some positives shall we this movie feauters one of the best action sequences of the year so far nothing compared to anything in mission impossible  fallout but still impressive where eddie brock hardy escapes his persucers on a moterbike aided by the abliities of venom after a pretty slow bulid up this scene really beagn to peak my intrest and get me ingaged in the film despite obvious cuts around the more violent moments this was a real highlight    itâtms a shame that the rest of the film cannont live up to this however the paper thin plot moves at a snailâtms pace any attempt at horror is lost in the edit and the massive cgi mess of a finale is extermly difficult to follow and extemly dull to watch    riz ahmed is terribly miss cast as a suposedly threatening villain and michelle williams plays the same shell of a character that she has been stuck playing for years this cast desevers so much better than this and so does the character    i really donâtmt have to much else to add about this film itâtms just pretty boring honestly just watch spiderman 3 again
Mar 12 2019,positive,i personally thought this movie was a great take on venom the way tom hardy portrayed eddie brock is top notch i could not of asked for a better actor to play him most marvel movies are very predictable so it is nice having the villain as a movie
Mar 12 2019,positive,the measure of value i give a movie is my level of enjoyment watching this movie i never felt bored during it i understand the complaints that people had in this movie but i could not help but love this movie hardys performance is batshit and i loved it the whole time it has that x factor that pulls it above some of the marvel schlock
Mar 12 2019,positive,good fun except for one scene of bad cg
Mar 12 2019,positive,sony failed spider man 3 as we all know tried to make us forget by rebooting something it didnt need  but overall decent movies until once again failed  now with venom it seems they got a grip of what they want to do and there direction is headed towards a good direction the movie was fun with a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy lets just hope they dont fail this one as well for its confirmed sequel
Mar 12 2019,positive,this movie is amazing
Mar 12 2019,positive,initially didnt know if it deserved the full 4 stars but 35 was lowballing it so i think it deserves 4 because it exceeded expectations was more hilarious than i expected hardy and venom were a great duo and venom himself was a badass plenty of action scenes definitely give it a go 
Mar 11 2019,positive,nice special effects faithful to comics some funny scenes really enjoyable maybe the story could have been better written but it is good
Mar 11 2019,positive,i it a good but its fun to watch
Mar 11 2019,negative,this wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but definitely wasnt up to par with other movies of this genre
Mar 11 2019,negative,venom seemed to rely heavily on comedy rather than storytelling some of the flaws for me was from the acting and the predictable arc between the protagonist and the antagonist i remember certain aspects of the fight scenes but nothing stands out to me and i will not be rewatching it in the future
Mar 11 2019,positive,i absolutely loved it but i admit im a massive fan of tom hardyi loved the voice of venom and i found the film enjoyable enough to watch numerous times
Mar 10 2019,positive,venom 62   i thought this was a good movie and i fall between the critics terrible and the audience amazing on this one the first 30 minutes of this movie is pretty disappointing but once venom comes on the scene the entire trajectory of the movie switches to a much more entertaining and fun movie tom hardy eddie brock is really the only actor who puts on a good performance everyone else is pretty forgettable the dialogue between venom and eddie brock is scintillating but the rest of the dialogue between everyone else is trash i liked the plot and story overall but the absence of a good villain was very apparent throughout the movie overall the hilarious and enjoyable combination of eddie brock and venom overcomes the dull and stunted rest of this movie to create what is a fun enjoyable time at the movies if this is your cup of tea then i would suggest seeing it
Mar 10 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic i loved it didnï 12tmt go off of spiderman like the comics which iï 12tmm sure they wanted to make it his own thing which worked out great
Mar 10 2019,positive,really enjoyable comic accurate tom hardys performance is brilliant as usual his character is realistic  if anyone found an alien bonded to them i doubt their reactions would be dissimilar to his portrayal highly recommend it very enjoyable although must agree it was slightly choppy and may not be easy to follow for a venom fan also no spiderman 
Mar 10 2019,positive,great movie and appealed to everyone in the audience
Mar 10 2019,neutral,good movie but it wouldve been better if it was rated r
Mar 10 2019,positive,tom hardy played eddie like he was a real person not some ken doll version of a man this movie was amazing and i keep going back go watch it again
Mar 10 2019,positive,was exactly the type of film i expected very enjoyable
Mar 9 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was a pleasant surprise
Mar 9 2019,positive,very fun movie i liked the dialog between venom and its host
Mar 9 2019,positive,this was a fun movie to watch people should check this movie out i hesitated to rent it because of all the negative reviews but i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it
Mar 9 2019,positive,tom hardys character is somewhat different from the original eddie brock seen in the comics but has an established identity of a down on his luck guy that coincidentally stumbles upon a murderous alien lifeform to bond with the movie does lack in the gratuitous violence comic fans were accustomed to for r rated films such as deadpool and logan but there is still enough action and violence to keep viewers entertained the humor was also very welldone with quips such as venom explaining to eddie that theyre both losers which makes them a perfect symbiotic pairing it is not an academy award winner by any means but this is at the very least an entertaining movie and good spin on the venom character we can look forward to further watching on screen
Mar 9 2019,positive,tom hardy pulls this roll off well this movie isnt going to win awards but it was damn entertaining the banter between venom and eddie is outstanding worth watching just dont bring any kids under 10 it might be a bit much for them
Mar 9 2019,positive,loved this movie it was amazing
Mar 9 2019,positive,people need to understand that sony is separating themselves and not keeping it closelytied to mcu and that venom is based off on the more recent comics ie lethal protector the movie is great lots of good humor and graphically pleasing
Mar 9 2019,positive,dient expect much of the movie just watched it as tom hardy was venom and i really enjoyed the movie i was actually blown away how good it was   it really exceeded my expectations
Mar 8 2019,positive,this super hero film follows my favorite spiderman villain venom overall enjoyed the film but think it should have been done more like a rated r horror film where a man cant control his body and turns into a monster and eats peoples guts while they beg for death unfortunately we got a buddybuddy super hero film amd yes venom is a hero film not an antihero film its a good flick but could have been amazing    pros  venom looks like how he should  good action  tom hardy as eddie brock did a great performance  the villain thats built up for the sequel has one of my favorite actors cast for him    cons  not an antihero story  no gore  not enough violence  not enough terror
Mar 8 2019,neutral,honestly not a bad movie just a little slow tom hardy is great as always but what the story lacks is a great villain the villain is bland at best and the action is nothing special the first half alone is a chore to get through and the second half isnt good enough to make the first half worth it average movie tom hardy is good and venom is cool but story is meh
Mar 8 2019,positive,it was certainly entertaining and i like most of the character venom my criticismit is also underwhelming and empty in parts of the plot and venom should have been much more diabolical and sinister in his intent and actions plus eddie brock is supposed to be vengeful  also its another movie purposefully made pg13 that feels like a half flat soda pop rather than letting it all out if it were an r movie with more excitement for adults overall its entertaining but i think it could have been brilliant just make it r and let venom be full evil and unload rather than being held back at pg13       7510
Mar 8 2019,positive,this movie sits in a golden area between awful and okay where the writing is so unbelievably cheesy and weird it pioneers a new kind of comedy while the action and special effects are genuinely interesting and fun to watch not good just really fun
Mar 8 2019,negative,weird in an indescribable way
Mar 8 2019,negative,this movie sucked and rotten tomatoes keeps removing my review  i guess they dont care about actual opinions and just want to take bribes to promote shitty movies  this review will be removed by disney in about one day
Mar 8 2019,positive,its a good entertainer
Mar 8 2019,positive,a refreshing view on a superhero movie
Mar 7 2019,positive,extremely entertaining had an awesome time in the theatre
Mar 7 2019,positive,i watched the trailer and did not expect much but decided to give marvel a chance it was not a mistake although they could have done better
Mar 7 2019,positive,ignore the critics  crazy fun movie some great  dark comedy  good special effects 
Mar 6 2019,positive,the movie was surprisingly decent for a pg 13 rated show i wonder how much more elevated it could have gotten if it was the ratedr cut
Mar 6 2019,positive,unplug the brain and enjoy 
Mar 5 2019,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time sarcasm dark humor   and great fight scenes
Mar 5 2019,neutral,this movie never sets a genre but it is not as bad as the reviews say  it is a good movie for marvel fans but definitely not the best
Mar 5 2019,positive,i thought it was a great origin story  why you need spiderman in this like some people have said i cannot fathom as i am sure future films will cover that relationship  great fun to watch loved tom hardys performance which included a good american accent  he definitely got in to the roll more as film shooting continued  great bad guy performance from riz ahmed  i hope you all enjoy this film a decent sound and video system would be a bonus as the graphics are complex and the sound track is worth the listen
Mar 5 2019,positive,as longtime fan of venom i have very few complaints about this movie honestly my biggest complaint is listening to the critical reviews and not doing myself the service of seeing this movie in theaters
Mar 5 2019,positive,although the script is not the best this film is entertaining and fun to watch with some funny scenes and good action sequences
Mar 5 2019,positive,venom was a fantastic movie the action sequences were incredible but it was a pretty short movie
Mar 4 2019,negative,watch our drink along review here      i cant for the life of me understand how such a mediocre movie like venom did so well at the box office was it that weird marketing tactic that made it look like a romantic comedy were fanboys really curious to see if they pronounced symbiote correctly do people really like tom hardy that much when his most recent memorable rolls imo were a muffled speaking bane or a barely speaking mad max    well answer those question and ramble on more in our drink along review of venom check out the video on youtube crack open a cold one and prepare for some complaining xd    for the review i was influenced by the dvd release of the japanese zombie movie wild zero a special feature on the disk was a drinking game that prompted the viewer to take a drink any time certain stipulations appeared on screen like fire shooting out of something or a zombies head blowing up this always followed me and i finally got a chance to incorporate that aspect into what i call a drink along review
Mar 3 2019,positive,great spin on venom tom hardy played very well great action and comedy
Mar 3 2019,negative,waste of time just another transformers with a stupid plot and typical boring repetitive effects
Mar 3 2019,positive,this is a good movie as room to grow
Mar 2 2019,neutral,the script was awful isnt the script the first and most important element in film how did this pass
Mar 1 2019,negative,felt flat male driven cgi action lacking motivation of charachters key choices terribly written female chatacters no nuance in character backgrounds
Mar 1 2019,positive,thought it was fun and a good watch
Feb 28 2019,negative,42 it seems to me that instead of picking a genre and executing it well they tried to do five or six different genres and neither one of them very well fleshed out
Feb 28 2019,positive,despite popular consensus deeming this film a marvelous failure a bizarre and useless movie to me venom is the perfect satire and mockery of the common marvel film formula
Feb 28 2019,positive,nothing short of fantastic best movie this year by a lot
Feb 28 2019,positive,i dont know why critics hate this movie
Feb 27 2019,neutral,tom hardy is in the role of eddie brock who is a modern journalist that has his own news show he gains superpowers after being bound to an alien symbiote whose species plan to invade earth itself now going into this film i kinda had mixed emotions going out of it i still have mixed emotions this is a somewhat unique comic book film that doesnâtmt have a lot going for it story or character wise yes we do end up caring about the main character and his internal conflict there couldâtmve been some great mini subplots involving some random characters that brock jumps into during the film that mightâtmve progressed the film more also our main character doesnâtmt really make the best decisions until the symbiote has encountered him in fact there are some really dumb character decisions made here the villain carlton drakeriot played by riz ahmed was really not intimidating all he wanted to do was to experiment in these symbiotes and he was so desperate and eager but he wasnâtmt hands on about it nor scary until he became one with the symbiote riot a lot of the dialogue here is a little cringeworthy some of it was even laughable thereâtms one line from tom hardy âhe has one up his a tooâ donâtmt get me wrong there are a couple of funny moments here i did laugh often but there are some lines in here that made me just sigh like what were they thinking then the voice of the symbiote venom was a little overused but it was still very humorous and fun lastly the film did get a bit boring during the second act i tried not to fall asleep honestly my biggest issues with the film is its tonal shifts and screenplay the film doesnâtmt know how to balance a somber and humorous tone because of its script the script is all over the place for the most part it has its shining moments but itâtms still a bit clustered the action scenes are pretty entertaining but itâtms not like we havenâtmt seen fight scenes like these from a technical aspect before the fight between riot and venom reminded me of black panther and killmongertom hardy was great in his role as eddie brock heâtms scared determined yet blunt and humble thatâtms the only performance that stood out to me everyone else was just fine the special effects are actually topnotch the symbiotes were especially believable the cg for venom was awesome the fight between venom and riot looked very raw and flashy even with its derivative orientation the whole concept of venom brought into this film is original and sort of innovative the music score by ludwig gãransson is awesome  a bit catchy the movie has a unique look to it loving the bright color tone presented here as i said before i did laugh often it actually was very funny in some places there is a lot to like about this film but there is also a lot to dislike about the film when it comes to the technical aspects itâtms very competently made but as an introduction to venom on the big screen i found it to be a bit lackluster glossy âhollywoodusedâ and things couldâtmve been done way better also eminemâtms venom song starts blasting at the end of the film and was sort of annoyingly catchy grade c or c
Feb 27 2019,negative,enjoyable enught but the villain was just poorly writtenâ all that missing is a guy doing jazz hands saying evil every time the bad guy does something evilâ then it would at least have been self ironic    a proper bad guy needs better motivation this is just sloppy and disgraceful
Feb 27 2019,positive,ok itâtms all i really wanted tom hardy is still amazing
Feb 27 2019,positive,chaotic noisey and doesnt need spiderman to slow him down forget what rt says go with the audience score its more in touch with what the public want fun filled film for a late night watch good special effect good acting go watch
Feb 27 2019,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing no matter what anyone says tom hardy is an amazing actor and his version of eddie brock is pretty hilarious
Feb 26 2019,positive,kind of funny kind of interesting
Feb 26 2019,negative,not connected at all with the mcu no spidey or new york no symbiotes classic origin and a story told by force the aesthetics or design are good if we talk about venoms black body texture big mouth or jaw and the living jellylike way of covering the host it goes fail when you get to know about the lack of the spider in chest and back and not shooting webs from the top white zones of his hands they basically gave us a weird version of him unprovided of all the things we would have loved to see we could say its an entertaining movie if we dont see it as a marvel produc at all if you put the house of the ideas into this everything loses colour meaning
Feb 26 2019,negative,the character venom himself is a good watch the movie venom overall falls flat in the midst of its mild amusement
Feb 26 2019,positive,venom is seriously under rated gem which does not use grey mcu formula and does not retell story from the 80s which is overused  something fresh something new  jingle balls its hilarious and witty and have great writing  but the best thing  was pg rating and casting choise 
Feb 26 2019,positive,loved it hope we get to see a part 2
Feb 26 2019,positive,i loved the movie while a strange take and a little diluted i enjoyed matt hardys version of eddie brock   venom itself was fun to watch even as a fan who questions the route they take
Feb 26 2019,positive,the movie was fun and the dynamic with venom and eddie was the best part  were there dumb dialogue scenes were there plot holes of course but it didnt stop me from enjoying the movie
Feb 25 2019,neutral,looked like the ending of black panther not good and the story wasnt very good but tom hardy was good as ever
Feb 25 2019,positive,great movie would recommend watching
Feb 25 2019,positive,this is yet another movie that provee the critics study the walls of their colon and love movies that no one else watches no itï 12tms not a drama itï 12tms a fun movie that shows a good guy beating a bad guy      these critics are just upset that the actor isnï 12tmt a ï 12fill in the blank with your favorite member of an alleged marginalized groupï 12â if not that theyï 12tmre upset that the writers didnï 12tmt take a current event and sloppily make the movie a veneerthin analogy     no itï 12tms not oscar material  yesitï 12tms a fun movie that i bought and have watched a few times
Feb 25 2019,positive,tom hardy was the right choice for venom he nails it  the movie was fun to watch and clearly one of those that can be rewatched multiple times
Feb 25 2019,neutral,kind of messy but hardy was a lot of fun here
Feb 25 2019,positive,it was amazing i donâtmt understand the criticism this movie gets
Feb 25 2019,positive,enjoyable surprisingly hilarious
Feb 24 2019,positive,best romantic comedy ive ever watched venom was really hot and him and eddie deserve to be happy
Feb 24 2019,positive,i expected it to be not at all appropriate for children i was pleasantly surprised and allowed my sons to watch it they loved it and thought it was hilarious this movie was much better than expected
Feb 23 2019,positive,seen this movie 6 times now always loved the character and the back and forth banter between eddie and venom is gold
Feb 23 2019,positive,it feels rushed for most of the time but i still had fun with this movie  i thought the acting was good especially tom hardy  i thought it was funny a lot and i loved how venom looked it looked very realistic   i wished this movie was rated r though 
Feb 23 2019,positive,really cool to see venom in the movies he did just fine without spiderman
Feb 23 2019,positive,as a film in a artistic way this film is rubbish but as a source of entertainment itï 12 12 12tms famtastic
Feb 23 2019,positive,entertaining movie great action and funny over the top moments i just wish they aimed for a higher rating most of the fight and actions scenes look almost made for a gory movie but they dont show any of that because a lower rating  more money
Feb 23 2019,positive,really fun movie to see simple old fun
Feb 23 2019,negative,just rented this and wish i could get my money back  just a terrible steaming pile  how it has an 83 rating just tells me most people dont have a clue about what makes a good movie
Feb 23 2019,positive,venom was a highly anticipated movie it is another movie where the supposed villain turns out to be the hero when we first meet brock itï 12 12tms pretty obvious he is going to be the protagonist but venom is a villain in the ï 12 12spidermanï 12 12ï 12â comics several other movies like this are despicable me beetlejuice and couple of the xmen movies   the movie begins carlton drake riz ahmed and the life foundation find aliens in space their ship crashes and one of the aliens called symbiotes escape later eddie brock tom hardy gets an interview with carlton drake and as a consequence of his questions he loses his job his girlfriend and his apartment six months later the life foundation begins human trials with its symbiotic aliens dr dora skirth jenny slate doesnï 12 12tmt like what drake is doing so she asks brock for help he breaks into the life foundation takes pictures and accidentally gets infected with the symbiote venom   eddies exgirlfriend anne weying michelle williams takes him to the doctor when he acts crazy in a restaurant at home eddie gets into several fights anne takes him back to the hospital and he loses venom the life foundation has killed or lost all its symbiotes so it is desperate to get venom back anne brings venom back to brock it turns out the escaped symbiote made its way to the life foundation and infects drake eddie and venom battle against drake and his symbiote riot   venom was an excellent movie i feel the movie was cast fittingly tom hardy did such a good job at playing eddie brockvenom that i didnï 12 12tmt know he voiced both parts until i looked it up he also did a good job at showing a difference between when he was healthy and when he was ï 12 12sickï 12 12ï 12â riz ahmed truly looks like a rich snob he does amazing at concealing the threats in some of his lines ï 12 12think about your kids hey how are your kids letï 12 12tms begin human trialsï 12 12ï 12â drake says when a scientist questions his decision to start human trials i thought the main characters were suitably chosen and acted expertly  although the main characters were cast extremely well i think the supporting characters could have used some improvement treece scott haze and his bodyguards i felt didnï 12 12tmt react enough although those characters were hardened fighters i feel they should have acted more surprised when brock started talking to himself ï 12 12iï 12 12tmm not actually talking to youï 12 12ï 12â eddie says or when he turned into a giant black monster with huge teeth at least one of them should have screamed it seemed very artificial   the technical aspects of venom were practically perfect the movie had a large amount of cgi that was handled beautifully venom and riot looked like a very real part of the world rather than something that was inserted the music was well used during the spaceshipï 12 12tms crash the music played was creepy rather than exciting giving the proper setting for an alien movie overall the technical aspects of the movie was done expertly  although the cgi was amazing there were a couple of things that would have made the movie more realistic first off when venom bit somebodyï 12 12tms head off there was not even a drop of blood there was some unusual yellow something but no blood also when eddie brock got hurt there was a circle of blood but it didnï 12 12tmt spread like blood should and looked very fake the only cgi that didnï 12 12tmt impress me was when venom jumped out the window and pulled them towards another building that scene looked very fake   i personally enjoyed venom i liked the fact that there was an interesting while still giving enough fighting to make it fun some parts of the movie seemed predictable but it was still entertaining to watch i liked that eddie brock was not super strong or a superhero his humanism made the final fight much more thrilling i found the movie very exciting and enjoyed the whole thing i recommend you see it
Feb 23 2019,positive,i found this to be quite funny a lot of the time  although the way that they portrayed the characters was quite strange  you never really get a feel for tom hardys character by the end of the movie youre kind of questioning where he gets all this charisma from i guess the same could be said for venom    overall this is a good movie to watch if youre looking for something that doesnt have much character development  and has a really quick and confusing timeline for when all of the events occur  still pretty funny though
Feb 22 2019,positive,ya i dont like marvel movies but i like this
Feb 22 2019,positive,i say it was really good critics dont understand the concept of a superhero movie that just pisses me off
Feb 22 2019,positive,i donï 12 12 12 12 12tmt care what anyone says this movie was doooope   geeks aside tom hardy is hilarious and kills it as the clueless host i enjoyed every minute of this movie and you should all give it a shot   marvel meets the mask is all i can say  enjoy
Feb 22 2019,positive,saw this 3 times       everyone i took loved it only thing i could ask for is more blood we all bought merchandise we all laughed we all went silent we all got feelings    sorry this is not a liberal agenda film this is clear when you see the leftist critic reviews vs actual human beings with common since and actual values    amazing movie  will deffinenetly see the sequal
Feb 22 2019,neutral,i already knew spiderman wont be in the movie although i was hoping marvel would surprise me with a cameo didnt happen i can forgive that also tom hardy is far way better eddie brock than topher grace but as a marvel fan i just didnt like how venom the alien was portrayed in the comics venom was scary as hell in the movie the venom was cracking jokes eddie brock almost immediately accepts it and that female venom kissing sceneno no no i am so disappointed with this
Feb 21 2019,positive,this is other than deadpool my favorite marvel movie by far awesome writing and acting couldve used a hotter girlfriend with a little bit of a womanly figure but i have no complaints about this movie i have watched it over and over again
Feb 21 2019,neutral,while i liked the interactions between eddie and the symbiote it was unnecessarily long ive only seen venom in the 90s spiderman cartoon which is the best depiction in my opinion so this side of him doesnt make sense eddie makes many stupid decisions in order for the plot to advance which is painfully obvious while venom is apparently making him almost a cannibal in some weird sense     a lot of things put me off though  eddie didnt seem to care much that venom kills or eats people even if theyre criminals youd think this would shake him and venom talks like a goof while suddenly liking earth for no reason other than roaming around with eddie for a day or two  eddie doesnt even talk him into it    overall it was kind of a mess even if venoms design is the best live action one ive seen so far
Feb 21 2019,positive,apparently i have a parasite lol cool movie
Feb 21 2019,negative,wacky for the wrong reasons this film is very badly written mostly forgettable acting and another forgettable marvel villain but there are some diamonds in the very rough tom hardy was fun to watch with venom their chemistry was enjoyable if not a little phony at the beginning and i my opinion venom looked like venom except for the absence of the copycat spider symbol overall the movie is bad bottom line  dont watch watch spiderverse or aquaman
Feb 21 2019,positive,loved the movie i dont get how the rating of this movie was 29 tom hardy was the perfect actor for this role venom was extrmely well done and the fighting scene was mamazing
Feb 20 2019,negative,not even tom hardy could save this lackluster movie
Feb 20 2019,positive,wish it had spider man could have used miles but i still really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it specially if youre a venom fan
Feb 20 2019,positive,great back story cant wait for the next in the series
Feb 20 2019,positive,we are venom critics are hating becuase its not marvel
Feb 20 2019,positive,better than expected  would like to see an editors cut 
Feb 20 2019,positive,i had to make this account simply to defend the film me and my girlfriend watched it on blu ray last night and really enjoyed it venom is a likeable character and tom hardy is brilliant in this lots of kaughs and the action is superb cant wait for the sequel
Feb 20 2019,positive,this is a fun movie it isnt movie magic  but its a lot of fun  its fairly dark but otherwise it really keeps you watching and manages to make its ludicrous premise seem believable
Feb 19 2019,positive,really was truly exceptional the way eddie brock and venom work together and the comedy is definitely a plus and the sneak peek of carnage was something to behold
Feb 19 2019,positive,even if its not from mcu the movie is really funny and entertain me
Feb 19 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie it had a good plot and many hilarious scenes such as the dialogue between venom and eddie i was extremely surprised that it got such a low score venom shouldnt have to be a copy of the comic in order to be considered worthy
Feb 19 2019,positive,the film entertained me much the action and comedy scenes were fabulous
Feb 18 2019,negative,why is it rushed itï 12 12tms not spider man 3 and eddie brock is suposed to be a jerk not a nice guy insults comics for existing
Feb 18 2019,positive,why did this movie get such bad reviews from critics its what the fans wanted
Feb 18 2019,positive,the usual cheesy comic book action
Feb 18 2019,positive,critics are dumb about what the average film goer wants venoms trailer make it look like it might be dark and creepy instead its a symbiosis see what i did there between a hilarious performance by tom hardy and badass effects that put that shit from spiderman 3 to shame really eric from that seventies show as eddie brock you must be joking this film wasnt what i expected and was better than i wanted even if it is just another cgi action movie watch it
Feb 17 2019,positive,really enjoyed this film much better than i thought and a lot better than a lot of the marvel films disney is churning out venom is really the saving grace in this film sinister with a hint of pure brilliance and the lines are hilarious way better than both the deadpool  latest spiderman films which are friggin awful 
Feb 17 2019,positive,had a strong start but started to lose me towards the end wasnt very well written but i thought tom hardy did an excellent job with what he was given not tone of the best superhero movies by any means but definitely not one of the worst either
Feb 17 2019,positive,really enjoyed venom its no oscar winner but tom hardy was great and it really feels like a comicbook movie was disappointed when heard it was going to be pg but actually didnt think  film suffered for the rating and the kids really got into it son is drawing scary venom cartoons now and daughter was asking if there was a venom 2 out yet
Feb 16 2019,positive,i know this movie gets a lot of hate from the critics at rotten tomatoes but i thought it was a really good movie definitely would recommend giving it a chance if you are considering
Feb 16 2019,positive,i donâtmt like marvel movies but i do like tom hardy  this marvel i thought was good
Feb 16 2019,positive,overall it was an entertaining movie
Feb 16 2019,positive,i loved this movie with a passion i do not understand why its recieved so much negative backlash but i suppose we all have out own opinions at to what makes a good movie
Feb 15 2019,positive,fantastic movie  i waited a long time to see it because it seemed like the reviews were mixed big mistake  me and my boys absolutely loved it  tom hardy is a great actor  cant wait for the sequel
Feb 15 2019,positive,we loved it my grandkids have watched it 3 times already
Feb 15 2019,positive,while the script does leave a bit to be desired venom still manages to coast on by with plenty of action humour and an allout performance from star tom hardy if you are looking for a good comic book movie that isnt tied down by connections to other movies this is the one for you
Feb 15 2019,positive,why all the hate yes this movie is not your typical superhero or anti hero movie but in some ways it doesnï 12tmt need to be venom looks amazing tom hardys acting is fantastic as always yeah they are a few problems but what film doesnï 12tmt have problems i went into this move with no expectations and it completely blew me away this film is funny action packed scary romantic and everything in between this is an example of a film that shows you canï 12tmt always believe what critics say this film is great
Feb 14 2019,positive,personally i love this movie not because tom hardy did a great acting but because of what venom should be like bulky deep voice violent anda little bit of humor too the cgi is awesome and better than spiderman 3s venom they showed that when venom attached on eddie he was confused and being totally wild woody harrelsons carnage in the midcredit scene was absolutely amazing i give it a fresh tomato this movie doesnt deserve 28 rotten tomatoes
Feb 14 2019,positive,a good superhero movie and a great science fiction movie and proof that modern critics are either bought or idiots well written well paced funny and heartfelt
Feb 14 2019,positive,slow start but gets really great if you wait 10 minutes  if you get the dvd watch the special extras for sure
Feb 14 2019,positive,21419 rj owned dvd wsh
Feb 14 2019,positive,decent movie not perfect but enjoyable looking forward to more movies in this universe for sure
Feb 14 2019,positive,a super fun movie that long time spidey fans who are familiar with venom would enjoy a lot but at the same time caters to the needs of newcomers
Feb 14 2019,negative,very lazily written with missing sceens that were left out to cut the movies run time  horrible cgi drones dumbed down to get a pg13 rating in a day  age when a  rating will not deter movie goers or income revenue
Feb 14 2019,negative,everyone see upgrade instead its a much better version 
Feb 14 2019,neutral,its fun sometimes considering eddie and venoms relationship but other than that its pretty dull i was pretty disappointed
Feb 13 2019,positive,i watched it knowing nothing about venom or the spiderman universe and absolutely enjoyed the humor and messy story after i learned about the comics and the real story and became a big fan in short time i was slightly disappointed nevertheless the new scenery for venom and eddies relationship makes up for it it is promising and shows a new personality of the symbiote
Feb 13 2019,positive,i thought it was good
Feb 13 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it is so cool to see the real venom on the big screen after spiderman 3 overall i thought this movie was great
Feb 12 2019,negative,audible sigh  so eddie brock tom hardy is a reporter with integrity  when he tries to overturn a rock that was better left untouched he faces the consequences for it and when he tries to right the situation again a symbiote attaches to him and he gains the ability to become a new entity venom  i really dont know what is going on over at sony at this point  the animation department is at the top of their game and into the spiderverse is something i want to see 6  10 additional movies for  i cant say that i know what they were thinking for trying to start a side franchise about a spiderman villain that doesnt feature spiderman but what i do i know  this was the sixth highest grossing movie of 2018 worldwide so like it or not we are going to get a bunch of sequels for this  the most striking thing about this movie is just how dated it feels  it almost plays like a time capsule movie like something you would get in 2003 between spiderman and spiderman 2  it just feels like they ignored that last 11 years of superhero movies and took it back to a day when you just didnt have to try as hard  you have a pretty bad soundtrack so much so that i was surprised that nickelback didnt make an appearance for a number  the biggest offender of this would have to be the generic script though  it is really just superhero template 4 and it gets the plot from point a to point b in the most nonexciting and predictable way as possible  and these are not untalented actors that they got for this either in addition to tom hardy there is also michelle williams and riz ahmed  the fact that they managed to make everybody here look like amateurs is just a testament to how stale the writing is  the best thing about this is well that would have to be the postcredit stinger where they just show five minutes of into the spiderverse but the second best thing about this would have to be the fact that it isnt boring  once venom finally has a voice it basically turns into a romantic comedy and im not exaggerating all that much  it is two people learning how to live with one another and they step on each others toes with plenty of bickering but ultimately realize they need each other to get by  honestly everything this movie strives for is done better in upgrade and there is just no reason to watch this unless the sequels we are getting happen to be unexpectedly competent
Feb 11 2019,negative,ultimately works best as a comedy
Feb 10 2019,positive,tom hardy did a great job  it had good humor dont listen to the bad reviews  it is a great movie
Feb 10 2019,neutral,venom really is a mixed bag of a film when the film focuses on the relationship between eddie brock and the venom symbiote it is entertaining with tom hardy doing a great job in the role and there are some good action sequences as well that go someway to showcase the power and brutality that has made venom one of comic books most popular villains but on the downside the supporting cast are often left feeling redundant in a story that feels it needs them but cant really find reason to make proper use of them its also fair to say that the story also drags in places its a shame really as with a bit more refinement this could have been a lot better than the mediocre offering we got    i also cant help but feel that the studio bottled going for the 15 certificate and instead plumped for the 12a rating deadpool and logan have shown that 15 certificate superhero films can make big money so its disappointing that sony went for 12a as it makes venom feel a bit watered down and doesnt really deliver the levels of brutality i would expect from a venom solo outing with carnage being implied as the inevitable sequels villain sony really need to reevaluate that decision
Feb 10 2019,positive,it was so poorly rated i only rented it as my wife is the tom hardy fan  but i bought the bluray today as it is definately worth watching again    shows how much the critics knowout of touch
Feb 10 2019,positive,not bad slow in the beginning glad i only hired as did try to buy but all my local shops where sold out but checking cex website i found a load for sale second hand i wonder how many more people found it just ok
Feb 10 2019,positive,this was a good movie 
Feb 9 2019,positive,people act like this needed to be high art its not a movie about a space monster and tom hardy riding a motorcycle order a pizza and enjoy it was a lot of fun
Feb 9 2019,positive,critics are great at bashing and hating on a movie that was really good  tom hardy plays a great eddie brock and venom if the critics knew the source material then maybe there opinion would be validated but instead they rate the movie poorly
Feb 8 2019,negative,the only reason to watch this is for fans that love a venom story one of the worst screenplay ever written in superhero movies the dialogue and many story line doesnt even make sense to 10 years oldboth story line and characters are horriblecasting tom hardy is a good choice and some venom fight scene are cool so two stars
Feb 8 2019,positive,the movie was amazing it really did venoms design justice and it had a great plot all these people who are booing it probably didnt look too deep into the movie itself for me i like how it explains the backstory of where the symbiotes came from the people who dont like the no spiderman connection are impatient this is the first movie after all and its clearly obvious that theres going to be another movie right i think its also been confirmed not sure and we know itll have carnage so maybe spiderman will be in there and even if hes not the movie isnt going to completely follow the comic books so they might meet later on if they make a third movie hell there might be a series of movies i just really loved the movie its one of the best ive seen in awhile honestly
Feb 8 2019,positive,you know this wasnâtmt halfbad sony and marvel usually struggle together but this movie about the beloved antihero turned out okayâand thatâtms not a total disappointment the best part of the whole movie was tom hardy he did a great job portraying the main character who struggles with a parasite living inside of him his mannerisms and emotion are really good and funny he puts some good work in it making it very entertaining sadly tomâtms acting doesnâtmt start getting good until the middle the first thirty minutes was just plain boring yes it did set up the story which was meh but it could have been executed better when venom actually fuses with eddie that is when things got good the action was another positive of the film it really showed how powerful venom is and the stuff he does was pretty badass the villain was disappointing he was just there and did not help with the story speaking of which the story was also bad stuff just happened with no explanation and the falling climax went very fast basically if they made the boring beginning ten minutes and added more venom it would be a better movie but it is not horrible
Feb 8 2019,positive,i saw the movie over at a friends house and i must admit i was pleasantly surprised venom and eddy brock have great chemistry the filmdespite being depicted as a serious film in the trailers was full of humor the villain actually felt like a real threat and had real motivation rather than the usual evil for the sake of evil villains weve been getting from the early days of the mcu movies i definitely recommend any fan of super hero movies to give it a watch
Feb 8 2019,positive,these critics gave it a bad rating just to be assholes
Feb 8 2019,positive,this movie was amazing for the audience and just goes to show that in the end movies are made for the audience not for a couple hundred critics it was balanced and enjoyable fun and action packed and appealed to all of us i recommend this movie to everyone
Feb 8 2019,positive,this movie was amazing i dont see why thee critics are feasting on it like turkey  the  movie was so good that i had to watch it twice good acting good  the movie was good just every thing was in good terms for me and just remeber we are venom
Feb 8 2019,positive,i said knock knock let the devil in amazing film
Feb 6 2019,positive,if you like venom for venoms sake and are not just a spidey fan this is a great showing of the character eats brains and chocolate and is an excellent character  no good guys here just a pretty good bad guy
Feb 6 2019,positive,wish the critics would open up a comic this is the best adaptation of the character with some plot holes but doesnt every movie now
Feb 5 2019,negative,tom hardy playing some random assortment of character ideas here that dont make any sense isnt the biggest problem in fact thats kind of what makes it entertaining to a degree its just the overall lack of commitment to this universe as a whole that essentially made me numb to anything happening
Feb 5 2019,positive,i actually liked this movie a lot more than i expected i would good action and the relationship between venom and brock was humorous and charming 
Feb 5 2019,positive,venom is a huge character in the comics  in the multiverse we can found a lot of versions of every character so in behavior is not rare that venom do whatever he wants but i didnt liked that is controled by eddy it seems to be that venom is weak
Feb 5 2019,positive,incredibly fun and entertaining saddens me to see so many critics forgot how to have fun while watching a movie cant wait for the sequel
Feb 4 2019,positive,through its short96 mins and 2 extra scenes makes 112 minsi must give 3 stars for brilliant cgi and the sound effectbut this movies 132 has no venomits all his soundit makes me disappointno bloody images1 star  i think its just a damn romantic movie1 starso i give 3 stars
Feb 4 2019,positive,the film suffers from uneven editing in the beginning but by the second act it starts getting better fantastic action and acting from tom hardy definitely a fun little comic book flick looking forward to venom 2
Feb 4 2019,positive,not the best movie but it was fun to watch
Feb 4 2019,positive,dont know what the critics have against this i loved it dont be put off by the reviews give it a go 
Feb 4 2019,positive,venom needed more screen time to explain more of venom and his planet and it is ok altogether and needed to explain how venom didnâtmt die
Feb 4 2019,positive,it was very good and emotional actor playing eddie portrayed a confused and heartbroken drunk very very well 1010 would and probably will watch again
Feb 3 2019,positive,obviously most of the critics are out of touch here
Feb 3 2019,positive,well played moviei love it
Feb 3 2019,positive,wasnt nearly as bad as i thought but definitely didnt feel needed tom hardy does a great job and i love the relationship between him and venom the other cast felt useless riz ahmed plays a generic villain that feel useless and has nothing to do they completely dropped the ball with michelle williams and she had nothing to do and the script was awful at times but overall its a fun movie with fun moments but still just felt like it didnt need to happen
Feb 3 2019,positive,love it canâtmt wait to see the next one tom hardy was great in it
Feb 3 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie but it does have some flaws eddie the main character is almost critically flawed in a hellenic drama way he seems really good at most things like a classic greek hero but cant seem to let a story go this ends up being the flaw that both causes the main problem and drives the plot the special effects are on point except for the classic scene where half his face is revealed those are relatively sub par the main villains are obviously set up to make way for future sequels although they dont get in the way and are perfectly fine with interesting reasoning and nice characterization     one of the most outstanding ways the movie shows the relationship between venom and eddie is through this weird voice in his head which is perfectly shown through both eddies reaction and venoms dialogue and deep gravelly voice
Feb 3 2019,positive,enjoyable and fun will happily watch again and looking forward to the sequel
Feb 2 2019,positive,typical that the official critic douche nozzles would rate this baller ass film poorly this shiz was off the hizzal
Feb 2 2019,positive,best super here film since spiderman 2004
Feb 2 2019,positive,no idea why critics reviewed so badly  its great fun and cant wait for the sequels
Feb 2 2019,positive,loved this movie  dont know why rotten tomatoes gave it 24
Feb 2 2019,positive,amazing movie and the effects are stunning
Feb 2 2019,positive,really surprised by how much i liked it not boring at all fun and humorous cant wait for the sequel
Feb 1 2019,positive,an amusing take on the antihero venom lazy and chliched at times while not offering anything new to the over saturated comic book adaptations but the comedy landed and some good action sequences the villain was the biggest problem as he comes off as nothing more than a spoiled rich kid with a massive ego with nothing to make him stand out
Feb 1 2019,positive,venom is kinda just weird the cgj really needs some work but this film is still not as bad as critics say it is tom hardy nails it as eddie brock in this film even though this film is still pretty messy i still had a fun time with it the bonding between eddie and venom brings a lot of fun into the movie and also a lot of laughs
Feb 1 2019,positive,this film was very good and i was pleasantly surprised by the uk 15 film rating there was a good balance of dark humour and classic comic book action with good dialogue and character interaction  the character of eddie brock was well balanced as the well meaning honest reporter who falls foul of corporate power his life spirals out of control but when faced by doing the right thing eventually follows his conscience i recommend this movie and do believe it should have carried the 12a rating
Jan 31 2019,positive,honestly as a teen watching this you get all the correct vibes great humor amazing character design hands down my favorite movie of all time
Jan 31 2019,positive,cute movie loved the dynamics between eddie and venom the plot could have been a bit more thorough however seemed a bit bland and rushed if this movie had been released almost a decade ago before the modern super hero genre took over it would have been fantastic
Jan 31 2019,negative,visually appealing but thats about it
Jan 30 2019,positive,grate action movie music is about meh really could have used some rock music i feel it really brings venom to life much better then the venom in spiderman 3 though i would like to see him cross over with spidie and dawn the white symbol and be able to shoot webs over all an awsome movie bit meh here and their long intro but that is not a suprise as it is an origin story sorry about bad spelling i have dyslexia and my phone does not understand me
Jan 30 2019,positive,great movie its almost every genre rolled into one it also has a great cliffhanger
Jan 29 2019,positive,i was thouroughly entertained with this movie as a stand alone character i love the hits to the makers of the the orignal comics and characters origin plus the pilot that brought in the symbiote in the first place if you are a true fan or just being introduced you really get a feel for this terrestrial wit and dark humor cant wait for more    poor rotten tomatoe critics for giving it a 29 the character was successful in its own comic series it can be a fantastic movie series
Jan 29 2019,negative,besides the amazing rap song by eminem the movie fails to deliver by using the average formulaic script i came to this movie with high expectations i did not like any part of this socalled movie
Jan 29 2019,positive,enjoyable but could get confusing but works due to the talent of hardy still confused if venom is bad or  kind of bad well shot and the villain is just perfect a good winter rental 01262019
Jan 29 2019,positive,first half was like a made for tv movie second half was almost as good as all of the other marvel movies i laughed out loud and enjoyed how the plot came together i would watch a sequel 
Jan 28 2019,positive,funny and action packed loved this move it was actually really good
Jan 28 2019,positive,they picked a great actor for it comedy sprinkled in
Jan 28 2019,positive,this movie was really good i suggest that everyone should see it its not scary it is funny u also liked the ending
Jan 28 2019,positive,excellent film loved it thought tom hardy was perfect for the role
Jan 28 2019,neutral,tom hardy is way too much of a bad boy to be playing eddie brock this movie should be rrated it looses a lot of gravitas without it however it is good entertainment if you dont think about it too hard
Jan 28 2019,positive,a very enjoyable film i am not sure why the official critics disliked it so much it is entertainment
Jan 27 2019,positive,its an average superhero film that being said its fun to watch as long as you dont go into the film expecting something complex or anything venom is a ridiculously fun charector to watch and his byplay with eddie brock makes the movie worth watching just by itself its a mindless action movie but thats not a bad thing
Jan 27 2019,positive,very good movie do not listen to what critics say about this film great acting and a lot of action the only thing is there is no plot venom has no goal in the movie
Jan 27 2019,positive,super entertaining a fun movie to watch not pretentious not stuffy just fun to watch
Jan 27 2019,positive,this was a action packed movie and funny to boot  i give it five stars just because tom hardy made the movie one of the best marvel universe movies  some people like serious action packed in which this movie is not for you  i like funny action packed so if you do then this is the movie for you 
Jan 27 2019,negative,venom   venom isnt the greatest marvel movie but it had some good parts the beginning of this movie will bore marvel fans expecting an actionpacked classic the main character eddie achieves symbiosis with venom about at the halfway point of this movie when he does he becomes unstoppable to much so venom is shot with over a hundred different bullets and guns in this movie he is exposed to the atmosphere in a scene where venom clearly burns away yet at the end of the movie venom and eddie both come out fine what is the point of an unstoppable character this movie isnt all bad though there is an awesome motorcycle chase scene and the second to last fight scene with carlton drakes sword handed symbiote is great on an ending note both end credit scenes were terrible and the spiderman one felt like an ad
Jan 26 2019,positive,a lot of the top critics on here try too hard give venom a try it is not as bad as a lot of people say dont follow the wave of hate but watch it and decide it for yourself
Jan 26 2019,neutral,well this movie wasnâtmt that good the script and overall plot was sloppy but i liked the character venom tom hardy did a good job for a stand alone movie but the movie still desperately needs a spiderman
Jan 26 2019,negative,total disgrace venom has a bipolar issue the script has it also and the cgi is no great at all sony please quit trying  a really bad film i hated it as a comic fan my girlfriend hated it as a movie
Jan 26 2019,positive,critics got this one wrong  audience were right  just like tlj
Jan 26 2019,positive,yet again the critics got it wrongis venom perfect no of course not but even the best movies are not perfect but i am glad i decided to ignore the critics and watch this moviei really enj the interaction with eddie and venom and enjoyed the action in thisthe only issue i have is that i found the villain to be weak but besides that i found this movie to be truly entertaining and all i can say is dont listen to the critics they seem to hate movies that the general audience like but give high scores to movies most people hate so ignore the critics because it seems like they dont like entertaining movies
Jan 26 2019,negative,better than expected but expectations were rather low
Jan 25 2019,positive,i fucking love this movie guy
Jan 25 2019,positive,i want venoms tongue in my ass
Jan 24 2019,positive,honestly a lot better than i actually expected it had a similar feel as deadpool in my opinion which made me love it
Jan 24 2019,negative,what a ridiculously stupid movie
Jan 24 2019,positive,to be honest i can see where you could see big problems with this movie shallow characters weak theme but this movie kept me interested and happy with how they portrayed venom and eddy so not a perfect movie but id definetly recommend it and its a very enjoyable experience
Jan 24 2019,neutral,why would you make one of marvels greats villains into a hero this is spidermans greatest threat as well mankind this is not a good guy get back in the box
Jan 24 2019,positive,its definitely not the best movie ever the story could use work the fight scenes where short and sometimes a little cheesy but the jokes where nice the effects where decent and the story was great considering they couldnt use spiderman in this universe i dont understand the great divide between the average movie goer and the official critics
Jan 24 2019,positive,all of you guys have misunderstood this   its an ode to 90sera cheesy scifiaction movies    6510
Jan 24 2019,negative,one of my favorite villains ruined by a horrible storyline
Jan 24 2019,positive,a good film but it lacks a decent plot and the script is all over the place you go from one scene of  tom hardy uses an aquarium as a bath to one scene of tom hardy giving his best performance of the film in his scene in the kitchen its reveal at the end that the sub villain of the movie is actually riot and with the actors trying there best with the dreadful script provided it is a decent but disappointing film
Jan 23 2019,positive,one of my fave movies rn
Jan 23 2019,neutral,venom is an adventurous and creative take on a classic comic book character as it searched to find a unique place for itself in an industry full of comic book films it struggled to find one identity to own i could not tell whether the film wanted to be a horror superhero or a monster movie while the trailers make it look like it has its sights on a horrorsuperhero vibe the superhero hurts its positive horror attributes the quick immature banter that takes place in a dark and serious settings takes you out of the narrative speaking of being immature i do feel the movie would have been exponentially better if it had committed to a rrating the final item i felt the film came up short with was eddie and venom chemistry and relationship itâtms entertaining and gets the plot where it needs to be but we donâtmt get more than surface level interactions       while venom is not shy on flaws you are never bored watching this film tom hardy carries the film with his great talent and has you wrapped in and thatâtms before his monstrous alien counterpart is on screenonce we did get venom itâtms a roller coaster of fun watching the battles unfold i felt like i was watching a monster movie with a beast destroying everything in its path i was worried the heavy use of cgi would end up looking bad or cheesy it never distracted from the experience with it racking in over 200 million at the box office we will hopefully receive a stronger and more refined rated r horrormonster venom sequel
Jan 23 2019,positive,an exremely entertaining movie and tom hardy is great but bad cgi and a plot thats both inaccurate and dull venom is an okay movie
Jan 22 2019,neutral,venom is a fun movie to watch once as comics movie it lacks almost every thing but the name venom and eddie brock the only thing about this movie is tom hardy and how he manages his relationship with venom although it is a fixable franchise which i see future in good writing and directing
Jan 22 2019,negative,shockingly bad cant believe tom hardy agreed to star in this
Jan 22 2019,positive,granted its far from academy awards i honestly loved the comedy mainly venoms one liners and i adored the overall cgi of the symbiotes and tom hardy does great
Jan 22 2019,positive,loved it tom hardy makes the character excellent edition to the mcu
Jan 21 2019,negative,i found the whole movie to be very awkward especially tom hardy hes usually great in everything else ive seen him in so maybe thats just how his character was supposed to be 
Jan 21 2019,negative,lame better watch upgrate
Jan 21 2019,positive,underrated needs more gore tho
Jan 21 2019,positive,im not a comic book fan and all i want from thee films is to be entertained for 2 hours id avoided this film as the trailer made it look like a horror its not not at all i like tom hardy so i thought id give it a go its brilliant funny quick well done and an enjoyable 2 hours just what i wanted
Jan 21 2019,positive,not a perfect movie but hardys performance is worth the price of admission
Jan 21 2019,positive,movie was amazing and gave me a lot of emotional feelings so i loved the movieï 12âï 12ï 12â
Jan 20 2019,positive,yall critics need to get out of here because this movie was great
Jan 20 2019,negative,i am venom and you are mine    this is not a superhero movie or a antihero film this is a love story    its funny how tom hardy has more chemistry with himself than he dose with michelle williams    venom is an absolutely mess of a movie but theres never a dull moment the acting from everyone is really bad and the action scenes are poorly filmed still its fascinating to see a movie thats so all over the place with talented people involved hardy climbing into a fish tank is a remarkable sight    we are venom more like we want money
Jan 20 2019,positive,dispite what everyone has been saying its an amazing movie i did not watch it because people told me it was very bad but its great
Jan 20 2019,positive,as of today 20012019 this film stands at 29 critics  84 audience almost the same score for season 11 of dr who wtf is happening with the critics they seem to have become slaves to ticking the boxes of the equality checklist rather than reviewing something for the enjoyment it gives once it got going venom had a great unpolished anarchic spirit that romped along and i really really enjoyed this film critics you suck off with your head
Jan 20 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and the cgi was something else i thought tom hardys acting was excellent but the story line seemed to move to quickly and it just didnâtmt work i loved the relationship betweeen him and venom but seeing venom turn into the good guy it didnâtmt really seem right
Jan 20 2019,positive,cool action scenes just a mediocre villain
Jan 20 2019,positive,the critic score is pointless as far as im concerned i always ignore it and skip down to what the audience has to say anyways and im glad i do cause this movie was so enjoyable if you relax and have a good time and dont take it too seriously would go see again
Jan 19 2019,positive,this movie is a gift from god
Jan 19 2019,positive,this is a good film its low critic score baffles me but then again they gave doctor who series 11 a golden tomato despite it being a pile of turds covered in frosting this isnt even the first example of a genuinely good movie getting this treatment from rt
Jan 19 2019,positive,this was such an awesome movie seriously what is wrong with everyone else on here stupid i literally started an account on here just to say how awesome this movie was  10 stars
Jan 19 2019,positive,venom is fun the dialogue is not always the best but itï 12 12tms a very solid film that people should enjoy
Jan 19 2019,positive,great movie  dirty funny laugh  kick ass
Jan 19 2019,positive,by no means is this movie going to win an oscar or be the next avengers but i had some laughs and tears i had a fun ride in the movie until the very end where they pulled a fake death and didnt explain why or did i miss something i feel like the movie left out an important point maybe a few important plot points regardless of the movies flaws it was enjoyable to watch 
Jan 19 2019,positive,a great story that goes through eddie brockâtms tom hardy experience with the symbiote and coming to terms with losing the love of his life by forming a symbiotic relationship that will last a life time
Jan 19 2019,positive,fun movie excited to see whats next
Jan 18 2019,positive,i thought this movie was really good awesome family movie
Jan 18 2019,neutral,i had very high hopes for this movie but it fell short to me it tried to copy the deadpool vibe too much would watch a squeal because venom is cool
Jan 18 2019,positive,great flick this was the venom we all wanted to see when he came out in the 80s
Jan 18 2019,positive,thought the film was brilliant really enjoyable film to watch
Jan 18 2019,positive,i loved it i do not understand the dislike on this movie
Jan 18 2019,neutral,its still fun i love superhero movies or villain whatever plus tom hardy even though at the normal cheesy parts it seemed like they were reading from cue cards the graphics action and story are good enough sure its not amazing but i enjoyed it if you like comicbook stories then youll like this one
Jan 18 2019,negative,dear tom hardy blink twice if you need to be rescued from whatever this is
Jan 18 2019,positive,despite tom hardys best effort to bring this antihero to life venom still struggling to find its footing and ended up being a messy and loud movie without anything climatic
Jan 18 2019,positive,enjoyed this movie and i do not usually like science fiction movies where aliens pop in and out of people it was funny i had deep belly laughs several times watching this fun for the family
Jan 18 2019,positive,the critics must have felt particularly grouchy when this one came out    venom is a treat an antihero movie that surpasses suicide squad and is on evens with deadpool    the black humour is on point and time has been devoted t fleshing out characters and backstory which is such a luxury with a feature film and usually seen only with series the pace feels unhurried and natural    those who feel that venomï 12tms motivation was a shallow and sudden backflip missed the point in true antihero fashion venom is in it for selfish reasons that may in time come good amongst his peers he is a loser as wis eddie but here he can be something more king of the dung hill anyone    this film is filled with dark glee and irreverence watch it and ignore the critics for a moment
Jan 18 2019,positive,legit one of the best movies i have seen
Jan 17 2019,positive,i went into this expecting a big dumb fun superhero movie and thats what i got so im happy and i enjoyed it sure its cheesy the villain is paper thin riot is glossed over and way too similar a color to venom so the audience barely has any idea whos winning in a fight and the shevenom part is just bizarre but it was a fun time and i liked the eddievenom dynamic i loved looking at venom the cgi was really cool and fun to watch and was 100 times better than spiderman 3 the turd in the wind and pancreas lines are just stupid though but i laughed enough times in the movie to cancel those out
Jan 17 2019,positive,i prejudged this movie a bit too soon when i finally saw it i was so happy how it turned out yes it had a few areas of opportunity but hey who doesnt ammirite its ok though im gonna get mcu and sony in a room with me and make sure venom is used correctly going forward venom davebacon watchme walkaway
Jan 17 2019,positive,the rotten tomato critics are the worst they wouldnt know their ass from a hole in the ground every decent or good movie gets a bad rating and every boring shity movie gets a good rating im pretty sure the last jedi got a good rating and thats one of the worst movies ive ever seen black panther was not a good movie but it got great reviews because of the culture i like the culture part of it  but thats all i liked about it as far as it being a superhero movie it sucks venom is what i would call a fourstar movie but im going to give it 5 stars just because of the idiots that have given it low stars venom is exactly what its supposed to be groundwork something critics dont seem to ever understand they did the same thing with iron fists as well i think people should be the critics ordinary everyday people because the ones who claimed to be critics actually dont know shit
Jan 17 2019,positive,a pretty fun movie to watch
Jan 17 2019,positive,best movie ever tom hardy was amazing
Jan 17 2019,negative,the only reason the studio has the rights to this film is because they own spiderman so lets water down a complex character market it as a spiderman spin off then write spiderman out such huge potential lost could have been up there with dark knight now its just fantastic four
Jan 17 2019,positive,venom 2018 is a fun ride from start to finish tom hardy does an amazing job at bringing humor and humanity to eddie brock tom hardys acting is almost top notch bringing sheer amazement to his newfound abilities and confusion in his own skin in a very convincing manor although not the greatest movie in the world and while it is littered with cookie cutter characters with limited motivation venom 2018 is a fun ride that will leave most audiences with a sharp grin after the viewing
Jan 16 2019,positive,dont believe the critics this is such an amazing film if venom was real he should bite off the critics heads 
Jan 16 2019,negative,i think that tom hardy is stupid
Jan 16 2019,positive,while yes it is messy venom is probably one of the funnest movies of 2018
Jan 16 2019,neutral,it was pretty okay and watchable
Jan 16 2019,positive,this was a very very good movie i dont understand why it has such a low rating
Jan 16 2019,neutral,this movie was way too dumb but was a lot of fun the critics nor fans really got it right its got some fun elements to it but its slowed down by a terrible first act eddie brock and venom are a lot of fun the villain is cheesy and overthetop but it fits the film as a whole all the side characters kinda suck i like how dan isnt super jealous of eddie or vice versa because thats just overplayed at this point the third acts pretty great but the second act is okay i would honestly have said for the film to be longer primarily in the second and third act
Jan 16 2019,negative,what a mess of a movie best described as a high budget b movie michelle williams was so plastic i wasnt sure if she was cgi or not 
Jan 16 2019,positive,a lot better than what was said enjoyed this
Jan 16 2019,positive,venom needed a good script a director who could give all the essence of the symbiote as in the comics  tom hardy saved the tape of absolute disaster  at this point everyone forgot this illadapted black liquid
Jan 16 2019,positive,i feel this movie was entertaining and humorous at the same time the visual affects are breath taking and also tom hardy plays the role perfectly i feel the casting was brilliant and the storyline is good   always seeing venom as a villain has been nice to see him at a hero q
Jan 16 2019,negative,utterly bad expected a decent marvel movie
Jan 16 2019,positive,very fun movie was a little sceptical at first but a very enjoyable time watching this film
Jan 15 2019,positive,amazing and gotta wait for the great end credit scene
Jan 15 2019,positive,gotta sayive watched every marvel moviefrom the first spiderman to the latest of mcualthough there were some plot holes and things that werent answered i have to saywhat movie doesntthe tone was greata darker storyline with some humorous toneseveryone is entitled to their own opinioni loved itwhat do you think
Jan 15 2019,positive,first off i loved it venom is such a complex character you have to understand nothing is going to happen like the comic books in the new movie universes a lot of hardcore venom fans are going to get a little crushed over this i know i did with gambit the famous like we are venom gave me chills i loved the comedy to it i absolutely enjoyed the real bike stunts  i understand spiderman should have been involved in much of the plot for venom i cannot wait to see how this version will tie him in  waiting to see more and glad i bought it
Jan 15 2019,positive,venom is a solid 9 out of 10 movie i deduct one point for one reason and one reason only that reason is because tom hardys favourite scenes were cut from the final product i have high hopes that they will stick closely to how tom hardy wants venom to be in the 2nd movie but now to the real review venom unlike all of the mcu movies is a fresh start and a wonderful take on an antihero not really sticking to its source material as venom is initially a villain but maybe as time progresses and we get the 2nd movie we may begin to see venoms more psychotic side but until then this movie was absolutely fantastic contrary to the fact that it missed out on some of the source material tom hardys performance as eddie and the symbiote was fantastic and passes as probably the best eddie and venom voice acting to come yet this film pulls comedyromance and action
Jan 15 2019,positive,best movie i have ever seen i really do think you should try this movie out
Jan 15 2019,positive,loved it cant wait for venmo 2
Jan 15 2019,positive,venom as it failed to reach a balanced point the chemistry between eddie brock and venom raises various kinds of feelings however it is just another good part there is an emotional connection between the two characters the visual effect is like watching a messy blockbuster or any bad michael bay movies the brutal tone with comedy penetrated smoothly in the pg13 rating it ruined one of the most famous antihero comic book characters tom hardy with quite a fantastic job other than that michelle williams and riz ahmed also do their average performance the interconnection between the three characters then unites in my opinion that didnt work so much obscurity is there just love the postcredit scene where they introducing carnage as venoms next enemy eventually thats the part im waiting for even though i dont know why
Jan 14 2019,positive,obvious errors aside this movie was fun to watch and thats whats really important right  maybe they didnt quite know how to get where they were trying to at first and it shows but they did know how they wanted it to end
Jan 14 2019,positive,i am sure it is not faithful to the comic and for those who are looking for that i am sad for me venom was wonderful tom did a great job and it was a fun watch no issues here
Jan 14 2019,positive,i was actually super impressed iï 12 12 12tmm looking forward to the sequel     not going to detail the film as anyone can possibly read the comics relative to the film and learn about venom i was concerned that the cgi would turn me off and that i would be distracted by the quality  but neither was i turned off or distracted  if anything i was actually startled at particular moments in the film the film moved in a great pace and i really enjoyed it  as with any good action film i craved more action so i look forward to a sequel
Jan 14 2019,positive,venom was a great action flick this is what venom should of looked like in spiderman 3 it had some comedy and kept me glued to my seat 
Jan 14 2019,positive,i am mystified as to why the critics seemed to so unanimously abhor this film in my view it perfectly dovetailed satire with gravitasit reminded me a bit of deadpool hardy did a stellar job
Jan 14 2019,positive,this is the best film of 2018 i highly recommend it because you cannot tell weather it s good or bad 5 stars perfection
Jan 14 2019,positive,its entertaining to me it did not have any boring parts 
Jan 14 2019,positive,its entertaining to me it did not have any boring parts 
Jan 14 2019,positive,whoever didnt rate this movie at least 4 stars clearly didnt see the same movie i did it rocked and cant wait for the next one
Jan 13 2019,negative,3 words mediocre superhero flick
Jan 13 2019,positive,loved it  i am so tired of all the same shit boring marvel movies  this had me laughing which was a breath of fresh air like deadpool  i am really hoping a second one comes out  to get this girl wanting to watch a super hero action movie let alone excited for a second one means it was good because all the rest that have been coming out where horrible
Jan 13 2019,positive,a good example of when not to listen to critics good acting writing direction story not flawless but better than another spidie reboot
Jan 13 2019,negative,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the comic accurate portrayal of eddie brockvenom and their on screen chemistry the rest of the movie was a dumpster fire the tone and story was all over the place and it just could not decide whether it was a horror film or a romantic comedy or just a straight up action flick and also the editing was very poor so poor in fact that in one scene where eddie enters a convenience store in the daytime and when he walks out its night of course all the negative proints of my review are due to sony butchering the script into a family friendly pg13 film instead of the rrated horror film like it was originally intended to be
Jan 13 2019,positive,total popcorn movie there are some problems but overall its a fun time
Jan 13 2019,neutral,rather than the script a surprisingly enjoyable dynamic between hardys character brock and venom propelled this movie forward
Jan 13 2019,neutral,tom hardy unsurprisingly shows us a great performance especially in his conversations with venom however the movie unfortunately cannot be rated solely on one mans performance venom is a pretty straightforward comic adaptation with not much surprising elements there is not much of an originality to be seen in the movie which is in my opinion something very important in todays vast sea of comic book movies this adaptation does beat topher grace version of venom in spiderman 3 however that was not a high bar to overcome   its key flaws might be appealing to some though because the movie is rather short quickpaced easy to follow and not much of a movie that rewards highly attentive viewers so if you are looking for a movie to relax to after hard day or have as a background to some other activity go ahead and watch it it definitely isnt as bad as some feared given the absence of spiderman and sony production
Jan 13 2019,positive,as good as a stand alone venom move can be
Jan 13 2019,negative,atrocious on every level i do not understand how movies like get made 
Jan 13 2019,positive,venom fuses humour horror and tom hardy for a fun superhero experience that you cant take too seriously when your antihero snacks on faces 
Jan 13 2019,positive,i liked it a lot fun cool movie
Jan 13 2019,positive,humorous and enjoyable kept me on my toes looking forward to future installments 
Jan 13 2019,positive,i did like the movie but the cgi wasnt that good some of the attempts at comedy were weak i hope the sequel is much better
Jan 13 2019,positive,good movie critics need to get a hold
Jan 13 2019,positive,ready for the second one
Jan 13 2019,positive,the last time i saw a critics vs audience percentage this huge was for the garbage that was the last jedi go figure     anyway venom was great
Jan 13 2019,positive,its a great romcom between man and alien and all of you can fight me this movie is great critics know nothing hahaha
Jan 12 2019,positive,venom was a very exciting movie the relationship between venom and eddie is hilarious and eddie is overall a very likable protagonist  unfortunately it is strange to see the tone switch from romance to intense action to a buddy comedy between eddie and venom
Jan 12 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies i wasnt sure id like it but it was very entertaining 
Jan 12 2019,positive,such an action packed thrilling movie
Jan 12 2019,positive,definitely has some issues but still fun to see and would love to see a sequel and hopefully a video games based around venom
Jan 12 2019,neutral,as an honest review its a fun movie to me it just needed an extra push on the directors behalf to make me feel like i watched the greatest movie of my life likeblack panther or the greatest showman
Jan 12 2019,positive,i really enjoyed watching this movie tom hardy is the perfect eddie brock
Jan 12 2019,positive,honestly  who doesnt love  tom hardy but this is actually one of his first movies i didnt think would be good at all but my husband and i watched it last night and it was actually alot better than what i thought it would be  i personally thought tom hardy as an actor was too good to play venom but again i was surprised how good it was  it was very entertaining and tom hardy just makes the movie come to life   cgi could be better and  the movie itself needs a longer storyline im hoping the next movie will have a longer story line and they need to make it more interesting by making it rated r
Jan 12 2019,positive,i liked it didnt like the casting of michelle williams character but still an entertaining movie once you realize its a typical plot
Jan 12 2019,positive,long time rt lurker that made an account just to rate this movie     hollywood has turned trash over the years with marvel superheroes paving the way in spite of its history and the lack luster trailer venom has undoubtably reignited my dwindling faith in marvel this depiction was not only enjoyable but it gave me a deeper understanding of the symbiote i once thought was just a one dimensional villain tom hardy is a fantastic actor and perfect fit for this role   i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again hoping to see carnage vs venom in a future movie
Jan 12 2019,positive,good but movie is so short
Jan 11 2019,positive,where was thonos and spadermon this movie didnt have enough romance that female venom was hot i loooove parasites
Jan 11 2019,positive,very humorous and not given any amount of exceptions and praise that it deserves by the official reviewers on rotten tomatoes
Jan 11 2019,positive,venom remains one of the best marvel antiheroes and its no wonder why professional critics gave the movie a 28 if its mainstream and highly anticipated they usually give it a lower score than one of the lower films not many people know about sadly their criticism isnt very credible being that more than 80 of people that watched it liked it the people that liked it wanted to see it and give it a chance while the critics assumed it to be terrible due to the few trailers that were released to the internet even if they watched it in theatres or not their criticism remains their opinions not mainstreams i myself quite enjoyed the movie and it added to my love for the lethal protector i hope that people will continue to give it a chance especially since we are once again anticipating a new movie for carnageto those who havent watched it yet do it its kick ass
Jan 11 2019,positive,this movie was great and needs a second one now i wanna see carnage
Jan 11 2019,negative,started out ok but when the alien venom gets inside his body and starts talking to him like he was possessed it through me off bad i mean the alien knows english
Jan 11 2019,positive,my adult son and i liked this movie  it moved at a great pace and had great special effects    again the critics say it is awful but we actually enjoyed it  that is why we watch movies
Jan 11 2019,positive,to be honest i liked the movie but in i had to forget that there was a comic to enjoy it  the acting was really good i liked tom hardy as venom the car chase was good even though its really hard to mess up a car chase  in a notch a decent movie
Jan 11 2019,positive,these critics are out of their mind this movie was great comedy and action plus tom hardy is amazing me and my wife both loved it how ignorant were these critics who rated this movie so low its a must watch in my book and make sure you watch it all the way through the credits lol you dont want to miss anything wink wink
Jan 11 2019,positive,once you gotten over the initial disappointment of what this couldve and shouldve been its really not all bad its a pretty fun popcorn movie the conversations hardy has with himself are hilarious theres lots of fun juvenile humor some cool action pieces and it moves along quickly its a junky film but its fun junk
Jan 11 2019,positive,while not generally being a superhero movie fan tom hardy combined with antihero had my interested enough to pick this up being a huge tom hardy fan it was puzzling why they would choose to cast him for a superhero role after watching however it became clear while clearly limited by the writing which is clearly limited to the source material and the formulaic narrative of all superhero movies  hardy brings to life what really is a surprisingly complex role couple that with fluid and visceral special effects enough standard deviations from the normal marvel linear story which i cant get into without spoiling but theres some interesting concepts at work and just enough well timed humor make this a pleasant surprise and an overall good movie if you can get yourself past the shortcomings which as i stated feel more genrespecific then venom specific
Jan 10 2019,negative,the goofiest movie of all time
Jan 10 2019,positive,is this movie good no did i enjoy it more than i should have its a terrible mess but goddamn is it a good time anyway its like eating a sandwich with pickles peanut butter and bacon its probably actually shit but it sure is an experience
Jan 10 2019,positive,it may not be marvelï 12 12tms best but it was still a great watch takes off a bit slow though
Jan 10 2019,positive,i think it would have been better with an r rating and just a little bit more serous truthfully though i would watch another if it were to come out 
Jan 10 2019,positive,another hit from marvel  pros terrific actor tom hardy really shows his talent with this one fun fact he also does the voice of venom it has great visuals and storyeven if it does deviate from the original story of venom the new things it can do is also amazing like healing a person completely    cons   i found the main villian in the story riz ahmed to be a little to radical he felt like he was just playing evil to be evil   like rushing the human trials killing his own staff just didnt fit with an actual multimillion dollar boss  i do wish that they would have based the design off of spiderman though   like have 5 minutes of parker in there with his suit and venom likes the design or something to that effect just would feel a tad better    rip stan lee his last cameo for marvel
Jan 9 2019,positive,loved this more the 2nd time because it was an awesome visual spectacle with enough humorous oneliners to make the pg13 rated dialogue tolerable  and of course yummy tom hardy and riz ahmed and enjoying all the shots of my hometown of frisco  hoping this will set the stage for todd mcfarlanes longdesired spawn reboot to draw a huge worldwide crowd since he drew the most kickass version of venom in comics and spawns visuals are somewhat reminescent of venom in a fleshly tendrils flailing way awesome alien comic creature flick which i would have preferred to be rrated but then pragmatically it probably wouldnt have made sufficient dough to warrant a sequeland i cant wait to see carnage battle venom in the sequel  m   m
Jan 9 2019,positive,i loved this movie it was funny and suspenseful 
Jan 9 2019,negative,couldve been better
Jan 9 2019,neutral,with tom hardyâtms brilliant performance as eddie itâtms not enough as the films narrative is very poor and suffers
Jan 9 2019,positive,if you enjoyed ghost rider spirit of vengeance youll enjoy this too both are fun to watch but are mediocre when compared to the greats like spider man 2 blade the dark knight and now aquaman 
Jan 9 2019,positive,the huge gap between audience and the critics confirms once again that critics are a joke and not to be trusted
Jan 9 2019,positive,this was a great way to spin venom i really enjoyed it and felt like it added depth to the character definitely deserved higher than 28 from the criticsjeez 
Jan 9 2019,positive,was really good brought venom to a whole new light was so good end up watching 5 times
Jan 8 2019,positive,this is proof that any movie blasted by critics is actually a great movie critics say its awful because it wasnt done the way their gay fantasies imagined itd be sorry that venom didnt bring spiderman in for an orgy while listening to sophisticated music and eating a purely vegan diet but lets get real this movie was awesome it had its flaws as most movies do but for me they involved all the metal in the room with the mri and the scan that magically appeared after 10 seconds of the machine being on with a guy flailing inside it hollywood needs to consult medical professionals when incorporating this kind of stuff in movies however the majority of the world would think nothing of these issues so i dont think itd be fair to reduce the rating of this movie over it if you like movies with action suspense and a good amount of comic relief youll like this movie its definitely worth watching more than once in my opinion cant wait for venom 2
Jan 8 2019,positive,this movie was just plain fun
Jan 8 2019,negative,it was such a terrible movie i kept asking myself is this supposed to be funny eddie is portrayed as a clumsy stupid useless loser only children would find most of the jokes funny so the rrating may not have helped as much as you think qualitywise it reminded me of the ed norton hulk movie
Jan 8 2019,positive,surprisingly good flick the critics get further and further away from the mainstream viewer each day maybe because they watch too many movies
Jan 8 2019,positive,great movie to watch and enjoy just donâtmt have super high expectations
Jan 8 2019,positive,critics may say its really bad because of the script problems but most of the fans dont even care of this its a really fun movie that shows a real vemon not tike the one of spider man 3 but its not perfect fans will love it and critics will hate it they are both right but still its really enjoyable
Jan 8 2019,positive,started a little slowly but kept getting better
Jan 8 2019,positive,this is really fun i really dont care about tomatomer i belive in audience
Jan 8 2019,positive,i thought it was a rather enjoyable movie with unique humor and a plot that gets you invested at least for me definitely did not bore me during my watch
Jan 8 2019,positive,loved this movie cant wait for the sequel slight points taken off since there wasnt more blood hardly any at all but otherwise it was awesome now i want to see all the deleted scenes to get more 
Jan 7 2019,positive,i loved this moviethe acting is greatthe effects are like nothing ive seen before i cant see why people hate this movie
Jan 7 2019,neutral,this movie plays best as an eddievenom buddy movie overwise nothing special
Jan 7 2019,positive,very good but could and should have been better
Jan 7 2019,positive,enjoyed this movie very much  great characters action and humor
Jan 7 2019,negative,as enjoyable as a kick on the balls
Jan 7 2019,positive,venom is a well acted well written clever film  my favorite superhero film to date it may sound like im writing a review for another much better film but im not  this is a review for venom and yes im serious on surface level venom does seem like a weird film not on the same level as most modern superhero films  but look beneath the exterior and youll see that venom is actually quite good  though some may disagree with me  i actually found the characters to very cleverly developed  the majority of characters even ones which only appear for one or two scenes are at least slightly developed  for example you can tell that mrs chen the one who owns the grocery store in the film  and eddy have developed close mother son kind of relationship since eddy had split up with anne  another example is eddys boss  we can tell he is a stern some what arrogant man whos always trying to keep eddy in check these arent even the only examples  though the description of these characters are simple most movies wouldnt develop characters who appeared throughout the film like this  a lot of characters like this are just there  which is fine  but venom actually does doesnt do this which does elevate the film and shows the writers werent being lazy  there are other points  im not done yet i will write the rest later 
Jan 7 2019,positive,movie is superb people are idio they just misunderstood movie  venom is an independent character not only spiderman villian  as venom has his own origin story
Jan 7 2019,positive,by looking at reviews for countless movies it seems as though rotten tomatoes is wrong on most every movie rating as the public majority outrules him every time it appears as though his ratings do not count for much when its just one persons movie preference against thousands of others so my vote is onve again against rt cause venom was incredible
Jan 7 2019,positive,definitely worth the watch excited for the second installment
Jan 7 2019,negative,chliche boring even tom hardy couldnt make this watchable
Jan 7 2019,positive,i dont think ive ever actually left a review for a film but the amount of bad press this movie has for the quality of it is so distorted i wanted to add a review thats not just utter rubbish pushed out by people that i suspect would never have seen this film if they were not forced to do so by their job familyfriends     given the current popularity of comic book films its hard to see why theres so much hate for a film like this it doesnt follow the now almost usual marvel mass heros assembling style and is very different from the other iterations weve seen of venom especially on the big screen however given how awful spider man 3 was i dont think anyone is too sad about that    many people seem to be under the mistaken impression that  an action film cant be funny and a comedy cant have this much action in it and trying to deal with this has lead to some kind of internal explosion that comes out as vomit in review form    without too much more ado however my actual review  i really liked venom shocking right however there wasnt much in terms of story line call it what you will basic formulaic its not winning an award for best original story is what im getting at okay  despite this though the actions scenes are really good which even the critics seem to albeit somewhat grudgingly acknowledge the performance by tom hardy stands out as he generally does the rest of the acting isnt oscar worthy perhaps but is certainly good enough to keep you enthralled in the cinema even when youre not watching a frankly fantastic cgi antiheroslavering monster run around biting peoples heads off    for me personally where this movie really shines is in the comedic timing and yes symbiotic relationship between action and comedy similar to the relationship that deadpool has with wade wilson venom has the feel of an often hilarious though entirely insane comedy duo thats almost entirely for the sole hearing of the watchers    both are comic book heros and the humor is similar which shouldnt be too surprising what is surprising however is that given how similar they are to the comics and how popular the comics are and have been that the critics in this case seem determined to bash the film for it despite likely not being the targeted audience for such comedy and failing to realize that the targeted audience will likely find this movie just as funny as i have  spoilers  in particular i will say that the joke that was leaked in the trailer whilst venombrock are in the corner shop and threaten to eat a robbers legs arms and face the joke in the trailer kind of falls flat a little its confusing and makes you little unsure what the hell is going on it is kind of intriguing and makes you want to watch the film but not especially funny once in the film though you have to wait what seems like forever for and are rewarded with the same scene which after all that introduction to venom is actually kind of hilarious it was really funny to the point i laughed even in the cinema quite loudly and wasnt alone and id seen the scene before    on the whole i really enjoyed this film and by looking at the audience ratings you can see that most people who went to see it enjoyed it just as much ive given it a 7510 as ive said it has its issues but its definitely worth a watch and the reviewscritics for this are absolutely worth ignoring
Jan 7 2019,positive,critics are out of touch these days this movie is really good funny and actionpacked
Jan 7 2019,positive,critics really over analyze everything sit back and enjoy the movie its a great watch 
Jan 6 2019,negative,the most entertaining part of the movie is the end bad acting direction and script across the board make for a fumbled mess tom hardy tries but just cant elevate such a mess
Jan 6 2019,positive,really awesome movie fun action packed and funny
Jan 6 2019,positive,funny and action packed venom is an interesting film where the main character and an alien combine to save the world after the alien turns good after seeing the effects his species plan will have on the earth
Jan 6 2019,positive,way better than it deserves to be on the surface this movie should be terrible yet somehow this movie cobbles together bad humor censored violence and visual effects into a form that entertains and feels oddly faithful to the source material in tone and approach despite itself    this shouldnt be a good movie but i enjoyed it and that fundamentally is what makes a movie good or bad in the end
Jan 6 2019,negative,after about 10 minutes my friends and just ripped into this bad movie we are all fans of marvel action movies fyi all character development was weak acting was week is seriously pass unless you just want to yell at the screen 
Jan 6 2019,positive,this movie was brilliantly done it showed what venom truly is loud chaotic yet still an antihero the lack of spiderman is a good thing it allowed venoms character to be built up and allowed him to be the main focus of the movie instead of spiderman taking the spotlight
Jan 6 2019,negative,a so bad it is good type of derivative trash
Jan 6 2019,positive,i loved it  great humor   hope they make a sequel
Jan 6 2019,positive,an overall good movie tom hardy plays brilliantly the only thing that seems a bit off is venoms dialog that borders on the lines of tacky sometimes but also with a couple of perfectly delivered retorts
Jan 6 2019,positive,excellent whats wrong w rotten tomatoes stupid reviews
Jan 6 2019,positive,because of the bad reviews i watched this with low expectations but hey that meant that i was easily impressed the plot is nothing to shout about its the same every single superhero transformation story but i like the effects and tom hardy
Jan 6 2019,positive,this is one i disagree with the critics very much enjoyed it rated it lower because of the slow start but it had to introduce us to the origin i dont think its a hot mess like some believe but think its an all around good venom origin story with action and humor
Jan 6 2019,positive,the ratings make no sense   76
Jan 5 2019,positive,its funny and light and a great sunday night movie with the family sure if itâtms intricate and serious you want not the movie for you and the car chase was a bit long and tiresome but all in all a nice watch
Jan 5 2019,negative,one of the worst movies of the year how were the dialogues so horrid
Jan 5 2019,positive,i liked it may was not approach to the real history in the comics but he did a great job representing our venom maybe the next movie catch more close the real history in the comics  anyways i give 4 stars just for all the fan boys 
Jan 5 2019,negative,its so stupid its funny 
Jan 5 2019,negative,although vemon was an action packed introduction movie it was action packed in the wrong ways and lacked plot we can hope that the spiderman and venom run in would be more entertaining and have a better cast for this one lacked skill
Jan 5 2019,positive,slightly above average film but only just not up to most other mcu movies
Jan 5 2019,positive,it was alright i get why people didnt like it cant wait for the sequel
Jan 5 2019,negative,bad film and has comedy
Jan 5 2019,negative,bad screenplay cheesy lines tom hardy played well but thats about it so disappointing
Jan 5 2019,positive,i thought the movie was awesome good action interesting story and the back and forth banter between tom hardy and venom added well placed humor anybody that complains about this movie too much going on jumbled all over the place action sequences bad cgi are just fooling themselves into thinking theyre some knowitall critic if youre looking to sit back and enjoy a great movie based on comic book character do yourself a favor and watch venom like seriously go out and buyrent it now stop reading go  now
Jan 5 2019,positive,enjoyed with the wife from beginning to end i loved the script tom hardy does it again is there anything he cant do
Jan 5 2019,positive,awesome movie acting from tom h is unreal was not a fan of the girl or the human villain     the best thing about the movie is the venom and tom hardy relationship man this good     my biggest regret for the movie is that it did not go longer could have watched another hour easily     unique entertaining tom hardy and venom are sensational best movie of the year
Jan 4 2019,positive,awesome movie tom hardy delivers eddie brockï 12 12tms character very well portraying him in a better light than the classic vindictive and vengeful parker hating reporter venom is showcased with all of his madness and humour finally allowing for his character to take his throne in the marvel universe in addition the movieï 12 12tms villain helps us to understand what and who venom really is an alien symbiote 
Jan 4 2019,positive,goes to show that most of the critics are good for nothing dung nuggets
Jan 4 2019,positive,awesome movie tom hardy is incredible
Jan 4 2019,negative,just dreadful worst movie ive seen in a very long time boring cheesy overlong terribly acted this is just awful
Jan 4 2019,negative,make no mistake venom is not good however if you are a fan of venom the character youll probably have a decent time watching the film there are some funny moments sprinkled throughout and tom hardy is perfect as eddie brock but for the most part it just stinks the cgi is bad the dialogue is laughable the story is not cohesive and it just feels soulless in all honesty the best part of the movie was the postcredits scene if youre a fan of the character i say give it a rent if youre not a fan of him this one is a skip 25
Jan 4 2019,positive,it was a grear mobie but some acting could use work but the comedy was funny and the action was great
Jan 4 2019,positive,great great movie nothing to complain about
Jan 4 2019,positive,stupid fun film tom hardy is an amazing actor loved the relationship between eddie and venom
Jan 4 2019,positive,in a attempt to be just a dark edgy superhero film venom manages to rise as a weird comedy for millennials and genzers that happens to be about a dude that one could call a superhero even though venom is visually dull and has a notsogood pacing its an entertaining movie especially the second half
Jan 4 2019,positive,way better than the critics gave it credit
Jan 4 2019,positive,again just like with star wars the last jedi rt has faild dear critics please leave your ivory tower and come back down
Jan 4 2019,positive,the movie was better than i expected fun entertaining and plenty of action
Jan 4 2019,positive,i immediately lokked up to see when the 2nd one was scheduled during the movie because i knew itd be ending soon and i didnt want it too
Jan 4 2019,positive,i liked it the personalities of venom and eddie  definitely not a masterpiece for the ages but one of those movies you can enjoy in the background while youre fiddling around the house
Jan 4 2019,positive,forget what rotten tomatoes are saying this is a good movie ive watched it like 5 or 6 times tom hardy was a great choice for the role 
Jan 4 2019,negative,i watched this movie earlier this year when it was called upgrade
Jan 4 2019,positive,the critics are being overly harsh on this movie i am relatively hard to please but this was a fun movie it is an action anti hero movie and funny as well it was a worthwhile watch just dont over think it and have fun
Jan 4 2019,positive,fun movie hope this continues
Jan 4 2019,positive,a lot left to be desired but fun ride for while it lasted captured venoms personality and presence perfectly and reinvented eddie brock great flick imho
Jan 4 2019,positive,they couldve done way more with it but its ok for what it is
Jan 3 2019,positive,it was a good movie just hope if you guys make another one make longer and use more characters like different venoms 
Jan 3 2019,negative,made for a 5 year old horrible simple plot with huge holes terrible dialogue and the most boring cliches you can imagine this trash heap should have been straight to video watch upgrade instead thats a clever smart action flick man even the cgi was horrible what was marvel thinking
Jan 3 2019,positive,awesome canï 12 12tmt wait for v2
Jan 3 2019,negative,really didnt like this
Jan 3 2019,positive,not exactly the run of the mill marvel movie  like a 5050 split personality almost spiderman transformational thing
Jan 3 2019,positive,im addicted to watch this movie its my first time i like marvels anti hero movie the cgi the venoms character and the players especially tom hardy are awesome i hope there will be next sequel
Jan 3 2019,positive,great special effects no corners cut  good storyline  the characters are believable and well acted  the young conscienceless villain from india very believable
Jan 3 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this more than i thought i would
Jan 3 2019,positive,my second favorite film of the whole year mixes great action scenes with amazing comedy tom hardy is excellent as both eddie brock and venom a must see
Jan 3 2019,positive,very good interpretation of a complicated comic story well acted and directed visual thrill ride 
Jan 3 2019,positive,the wife and i really enjoyed it there were a few clunky transitions but overall we loved it sometimes i dont understand if the critics even like movies 
Jan 2 2019,neutral,this movie is a bizarrely wonderful disaster masterpiece does that make sense i dont know venom himself jenny slate and a cameo by woody harrelson are all great riz ahmed and the script are absolutely awful
Jan 2 2019,positive,loved it it kept me hooked throughout the movie and the struggle eddie has to go through is very real for many people i though the movie was fantastic and iâtmm hoping for a second one
Jan 2 2019,positive,venom was a great movie people just dont understand a great movie when they see it the movie made perfect sense the end credits gave me motivation to the next film venom 2 and they really excited me with the iconic rapper eminem at the end of the movie at the end credits
Jan 2 2019,positive,movie isnt great but tom hardy makes it worth watching and fun
Jan 2 2019,positive,this movie was very funny and interesting
Jan 2 2019,positive,this movie is fun  yes it can be silly at times but its a nice change of pace to other superhero movies  good special effects and lots of comedy to keep the viewer entertained  im hoping the sequel is as much fun
Jan 2 2019,neutral,it sways back and forth between comedy and tragedy where the writers attempted to continue the marvel comicbook vibe but only to drop the ball nonetheless the movie wasnt a complete mess the laughs made the trip to the theater worth it
Jan 2 2019,positive,an amazing and fun movie canâtmt wait for the sequel
Jan 2 2019,positive,entertaining and comical
Jan 2 2019,positive,went in not knowing what to expect came out loving it  even my wife loved it and that is saying a lot not a superhero but  definitely not a villain  plan to get the bluray on this one  definitely plan to see venom 2 if they come out with it  tom hardy did a great job in pulling off venom dont get me wrong here there was room for improvement  i did find the movie comical and entertaining it was the story that could have used some improvement but overall i loved it
Jan 2 2019,neutral,i went in with really low expectations seeing how it is pg13 and not a pg13 character despite the fact that tom hardy is one of the best actors in the business and seems to do no wrong  at least he is very good and fun to watch in everything whether it is great or just ok i walked away feeling like it was a fun albeit messy ride and at least it felt different than the overdone feel of marvel movies this character has so much potential for a great movie but i think the restraints on the team to make it pg 13 ruined their opportunity to make it a great film
Jan 2 2019,positive,not sure why this has gotten so much negativity i thought it was damn near perfect and somehow still only pg13
Jan 2 2019,positive,love it  was expecting to hate it based on the fact that this is one of my favorite characters and i was worried about the story but i am so happy  great movie
Jan 2 2019,positive,we really enjoyed this movie love tom hardy and michelle williams really enjoyed the comedy in the movie and found this venom to be a likable and endearing character i hope they include tom hardyvenom in future marvel movies
Jan 2 2019,positive,about as expected id hoped for more some cameos but a bit of a stretch vemons humor was good and enjoyable some of the animation was a bit much to process making things difficult to see overall a good one 
Jan 1 2019,negative,movie is very cringy as the kids say im surprised the audience score is high and the critics score low after all the virtue signaling in this dumpster fire if you havent seen it dont bother its 2 hours youll never get back 
Jan 1 2019,neutral,venom isnt a terrible movie i just think its too short personally i feel like the pacing of the movie is lightning fast and therefore causes you as the viewer to be scratching your head because they arent answering any questions one specific one is they never explain why venom isnt killing eddie at one point they say hes a perfect host but then in the doctors office it shows that eddie is in fact dying then at the end of the movie just no mention of it i thought tom hardy did a great job but thats nothing new hes an allstar
Jan 1 2019,positive,good flick cant wait until the next one
Jan 1 2019,positive,i really liked the movie i felt that tom hardy was able to express the perfect amount of emotion involved in that experience throughout the movie you were able to understand how freaked out he was i loved venom the symbiote as well he was able to add a nice amount of comedy to the movie and his oneliners had me laughing a lot i overall loved the interactions between eddie and venom throughout the movie
Jan 1 2019,positive,yes it is different from comic book venom but i enjoy this venom movie they make venom as a good guy here which may offend some fans and you dont need to read comic books to understand this movie which is a good point imo    i am pretty sure we wont see the sequel though you can only enjoy this movie if you are superheroscience fiction movie fan otherwise stay out from this
Jan 1 2019,positive,much better than the 28 splat 
Jan 1 2019,positive,great movie critics like ign sucks
Jan 1 2019,positive,if people who hated the movie understood that it seems like this takes place in the earth 616 universe the story makes a lot more sense the banter between eddie and venom an appearance of shevenom and an awesome battle between riot and venom definitely made this movie better as a huge venom fan i was skeptical of this movie at first but after seeing it i really enjoyed it and i really hope the green light the sequel because i would love to see woody harrleson go wild with cletus kasady and carnage 45 from me ï 12
Jan 1 2019,positive,dont understand why this is getting such bad reviews  its somewhat similar to deadpool and although nowhere near as well done doesnt warrant that low of a score to me ive always liked the venom design but i thought the story seemed a bit inaccurate
Jan 1 2019,negative,i dont know what they were thinking with this movie  its not even a straight to dvd movie in my opinion  if you liked it great  but for me there was no plot and i should have stopped watching after the first 15 minutes  quantity not quality is how marvel shoots and they have done well for the most part but this was and epic fail
Jan 1 2019,positive,audience score is spot on  venom has teeth  clean fun great chase scenes tom hardy is perfectly cast  doesnt need to attach to spiderman  this can stand on its own  whole fam gave it 85
Jan 1 2019,positive,flawed absolutely but still pretty entertaining lower expectations for this film but its not as bad as the critics would have you believe that said i dont think its as good as the audience score indicates either
Dec 31 2018,positive,i normally hate superhero movies but really enjoyed this  screw the critics  they thought the last jedi was a masterpiece
Dec 31 2018,positive,the storyline of this movie is very cool
Dec 31 2018,positive,im just saying the money comes from the general audience mostly positive and not the critics i am a normal guy and i enjoyed the movie
Dec 31 2018,positive,i have absolutely no idea the hate generated towards the movie i enjoyed watching it i love it and would absolutely 100 recommend it to a friend
Dec 31 2018,positive,itï 12 12 12tms just awesome to see sony pull their heads out of the boardroom finally listen and colaborate with marvel and make a character movie that actually pays tribute to the character obviously the the critics hate the movie that i s a good thing that means it was a great movie with minimal agenda driven narrative that the public is completely sick of
Dec 31 2018,positive,overall a good movie story line a little slow to start and ended too quickly hope ro see more in the future
Dec 31 2018,positive,refreshing fun  loved it
Dec 31 2018,positive,not great but definitely good fun and enjoyable to watch 
Dec 31 2018,positive,a very nice surprise almost great
Dec 31 2018,positive,its a great movie iï 12tmve watched it like 400000 times
Dec 31 2018,positive,it had a slow start but other than that a very enjoyable movie
Dec 31 2018,positive,was the story line the best hell no but this movie was fun i laughed and enjoyed seeing tom hardy in this type of rile glad i did not base viewing this off of the tomatometer
Dec 31 2018,positive,tom hardy delivers an solid performance to a film that does make some miss steps all being said venom is a fun and entertaining film that is definitely worth the watch
Dec 31 2018,positive,it was enjoyable for sure hardys clash with venom is great however terrible cinematography and a weak villain leave this film with a 35
Dec 31 2018,positive,i was pleasantly surprised it entertained me all the way through it
Dec 31 2018,positive,i really like it a lot waiting for second masterpiece
Dec 31 2018,positive,in association with marvel venom is an entertaining action flick l with a unique specimen a pretty good plot and enough of a thrill to keep the audience watching
Dec 31 2018,positive,not a perfect movie it has serious plot holes such as the sloppy security a silly fun action movie worth a watch
Dec 31 2018,positive,ya know there is no reason for this movie to have gotten such bad reviews its not gonna change the world or anything even by superhero movie standards but cmon its a good time its funny engaging and totally enjoyable the disclaimer is that this film takes a lot of liberties with the venom character  its a reimagining of the character if you will  so its best to leave everything you know about this character from the comics or the abomination that was spiderman 3 at the door in this iteration eddie brock is a good guy and venom is kinda well neutral i guess hes mostly just hungry i especially enjoyed the first twothirds of the movie when the plot makes reasonable sense and eddie and venom are getting to know one another the movie is at its most entertaining when the two arent really getting along in a very steve martinlily tomlin kind of way but if there is one reason to see this movie its tom hardy he owns this role his charm and swag totally sell the character and you are with him all the way even venom also voiced by hardy is funny and surprisingly likable for a quasievil symbiote this is not really an actionheavy movie but there are some decent action scenes and an awesome car chase that i am looking forward to seeing again the problems come mostly in the last act when the already thin story becomes thinner still and starts to fall apart by the climax the plot is so riddled with holes that it collapses in on itself culminating in a cacophony of indecipherable cgi the film also feels choppy at times which makes me think that a good chunk of what would have made the plot comprehensible ended up on the cutting room floor but at least the end result is a good length and it never gets boring other than a plot that doesnt hold together the worst thing about this movie by far is the villain sony has always struggled with developing good villains take a look at their 5 spiderman movies for reference and sadly this one is no better riz ahmed does the best with what hes given but this character is so categorically evil its beyond ludicrous so yeah the movie has its troubles but its still fun in the end im glad i ignored the critics and saw it on the big screen though you arent going to lose anything by waiting for home viewing either
Dec 31 2018,positive,theres an epic blockbuster movie somewhere in there i honestly love the   movie
Dec 31 2018,positive,venom looked bad ass but it took forever to get to him and besides seeing him and him i didnt care about the rest of the story 
Dec 31 2018,positive,the script the plot and pretty much everything in the movie is rushed as the film goes on you can tell they didnt try as hard as they could have tom hardy was the only really good thing about the movie overall in venom there are a lot of bad things about the movie but they some how succeeded to make a movie about venom without spider man
Dec 31 2018,negative,totally missable not that great a story very forgettable
Dec 31 2018,positive,mindless fun  its nothing spectacular just solid popcorn entertainment without heavyhanded preaching or pretensions to poignancy  which these days is actually pretty spectacular
Dec 31 2018,negative,this might be the 2nd most clumsy super hero movie i have seen in a long time and more proof that most comic fans cant actually be objective and will pay for what ever is shoveled at them
Dec 31 2018,negative,i personally wasnt a fan of this everyone else that i asked the movie about absolutely loved it and wasnt disappointed but i even fell asleep in the theatre because it really wasnt all interesting to me and it felt like they tried to add so much into the movie that it just didnt make much sense to me 
Dec 31 2018,negative,how is it a 2018 marvel movie be this bad everything about this movie is just seems off and the castings good lord riz ahmed is hot and all but having him to play boss villain drake is just unconceivable eddies role definitely feels more towards timidtopher gracesvenom rather than burlytom hardy
Dec 31 2018,neutral,not great but not horrible either well acted and directed 
Dec 30 2018,positive,good movie for someone who likes comicslike me tom hardy was a weird fit for the role at first but you get used to him being american and funny i would see it again 
Dec 30 2018,positive,tom hardy is likeable in this and gives theovie some sort of uniqueness the action sequemces arent bad but the plot has been done a million times before as he becomes a better man blah blah blah
Dec 30 2018,negative,this couldve been a monster hit     its meh
Dec 30 2018,positive,venom was an awesome movie i want a sequel with carnage
Dec 30 2018,positive,a movie you can admit is bad but still really enjoy brock and venoms interactions are the high point by far but the film still falls short in a few important ways
Dec 30 2018,positive,much better than the reviews but then a very predictable and standard story line
Dec 30 2018,positive,i would rate venom around 35 stars the first positive in the movie is how venom looks and how he is portrayed venom is the product of very good cgi the cgi makes the character of venom look like he could be a living thing in the real world venom is portrayed differently from the comics this doesnt matter though because he still is portrayed very well a nice touch added to venom is how he can talk to eddie through eddies mind this movies portrayal of eddie brock was also done well the actor tom hardy puts a nice spin on the character and plays him differently then a lot of the past renditions this was a nice revival of the character since the spiderman 3 version of the character eddie brock there are also points the movie missed its mark on for instance there are multiple times where it feels like a scene was cut from the final movie these missing scenes makes us guess what happened another thing that they missed their mark on was the change in venoms character it felt like venom wasnt changing over time and instead he changes in a matter of minutes over all i think venom is one of the best sony liveaction marvel movies that we have seen in a while and if you have the time you should watch it
Dec 30 2018,positive,7810    youll enjoy this film if you arent a boring dork who goes into every movie over analyzing ever piece of character development tone and plot points     the ending was kinda weird though
Dec 30 2018,positive,venom is precisely what you would expect from a movie based on this source material its entertaining throughout i truly hope this is the beginning of people realizing we dont need critics anymore 
Dec 30 2018,positive,it was a very fun ride loved it
Dec 30 2018,positive,awesome movie its like you are watching a comic not only a movie about a comic the viewer really sympathizes with venom and makes me wanna know more about his past and his future
Dec 30 2018,positive,loved the film a fun actionpacked superhero movie which doesnt take itself too seriously tom hardy is a perfect eddie brock while some of the story line and character development is written poorly the film is so entertaining you are willing to overlook these i really hope their will be a sequel
Dec 30 2018,positive,i honestly love this movie and to the critics venom never was supposed to have anything to do with spiderman
Dec 30 2018,positive,feel good kick ass movie with just enough of a plot to to be able to enjoy
Dec 30 2018,negative,venom was about what i expected to be it was flashing it was moderately interesting and it was a decent amount of fun but it wasnt much more than that sure i can see there being potential for a better movie in the same franchise being made i like the way they wrote the interactions between venom and eddie and i think the casting for cletus kasidy carnage was pretty good even if the wig looked a little over the top but the place is the movie fell flat tended to be its storytelling and character development which is to be honest where most movies have an issue a good example is near the end of the movie venom is talking to eddie about wanting to stay on earth with him and that he has changed his mind about wanting to destroy the planet he says that its eddie who changed his mind this is strange and out of nowhere because not only did we just learn about venoms want to destroy the planet but weve also never seen anything in his interactions with eddie that would make us think his mind would be changed by him in fact just before this he got mad at him and left him for dead in the hospital room why would venom has his entire world view changed by eddie at this point in the movie its things like that that occur multiple times throughout the movie rather than actually having a character arc they simply state that the character has grown but never show is the growth happening the movie was good enough to make me interested in a sequel but not good enough for me to call it a good movie it was only okay 410
Dec 30 2018,positive,rating 78 i find the action sequences pretty good and the interactions between eddie and venom are hilarious its just there are so many plot holes and odd dialogue that its just weird anyways its a very fun movie
Dec 30 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it
Dec 30 2018,positive,ruben fliechser had the perfect plot for this movie    the backstory is perfect and surround sound has good design and the game is really good
Dec 30 2018,positive,you can view this movie in two ways if you go into it wanting a great revolutionary superhero movie you wont like it  if you keep a open mind however this movie is great
Dec 30 2018,positive,loved it i thought the origin story change worked really well  hardy and the symbiote banter was class and i actually liked that it wasnt a gore fest it meant my oldest kid could watch and enjoy it really cant get my head around the poor critics  reviews will definitely be watching this again and again
Dec 30 2018,positive,this movie was so amazing
Dec 30 2018,positive,all in all i thought it was a good movie i liked the way they built the relationship between venom and the main character i look forward to the sequel
Dec 30 2018,positive,enjoyable antihero romp from the marvel franchise
Dec 30 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the film i thought it was a good mix of humour and serious
Dec 30 2018,neutral,definitely better than critics say but it wasnt great either
Dec 30 2018,negative,pros  some cool fight scenes  got venom origin right    cons  acting is all over the place  michelle williams felt miscast  villain tries to hard to be a villain  a few moments where you are like uhh how did that person get here so fast
Dec 30 2018,positive,tom hardy plays a great venom hopefully this intro film gets all the story build up out of the way and the next movie can focus more on the better elements
Dec 29 2018,positive,very good film and tom does a great job 
Dec 29 2018,positive,a good all round movie
Dec 29 2018,positive,so so so good too different for bland critics to appreciate but us peasants understand the mastery that is this movie venom is incredible and im v proud of us as an audience pulling through to get a high score for it hoping itll be enough to get a second one w carnage
Dec 29 2018,positive,i loved venom i am not that old as i am still a minor but i have seen quite the few marvel movies and comics it had the perfect amount of funny and action and you do not see that much in todays age when i saw the movie it was amazing i had never been so thrilled about a movie before it was so good and there are plenty of critics saying its bad but i dont see it it was so great definitely my favorite movie now and its ok if you think i am a silly child but everyone has there own opinion and in my own opinion it was the best movie i ever saw
Dec 29 2018,positive,very enjoyable romp through the venom story it was a nice twist on the comics that could have stood on its own
Dec 29 2018,positive,when venom was introduced in spiderman 3 he scared the shit out of me but i love tom hardy so i decided to see it and fell in love venom is such a creepy possessive romantic heart eyes
Dec 29 2018,positive,totally missing something but i cant put my finger on it not a total flop by any means but also not the best the plot was super weak and some of the cgi wasnot great enjoyed it overall but probably wontseek it out to watch again
Dec 29 2018,positive,i thought the movie was great it was funny and i was not expecting this movie to be as good as i thought i would rank this movie as  as high as most other super hero movies he does a great job and i enjoy the venom acter
Dec 29 2018,positive,seeing jenny slates dramatic side was enough to satisfy the entire movie hardys venom was equal parts funny and dramatic and an interesting if somewhat disappointing foray into marvels darker side
Dec 29 2018,positive,a fun ride of a comic book movie
Dec 29 2018,negative,we watched this because it is a marvel movie but i was pretty let down by it everything seemed so forced and fake in this one
Dec 29 2018,positive,never listen to these critics just saw this on bluray 4k this movie was not bad  it was entertaining the action sequences were good so as the plotthe casting for the human antagonist was bad  lame bad guys tom hardy and the rest were great at their roles go see it worth the time and cost
Dec 29 2018,positive,it wasnï 12tmt to bad i personally liked the movie it was different but overall a great movie
Dec 29 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie very much it was super funny and never gets dull tom hardy did a great job selling the conflict with venom inside him would love to see a second movie with more shevenom
Dec 29 2018,negative,terribly written
Dec 29 2018,positive,i get the critical hate but i was absolutely entertained by this movie perhaps it was the low expectations perhaps it was tom hardys wacky accent and buddy coup routine with the symbiote dont get it twisted folks this is a buddy cop comedy with elements of scificomics yes riz ahmed is wasted as a villain but that is because of the writing definitely not his acting go see this movie you may not come out of this movie with a deeper understanding of life but youll walk out happy and grinning
Dec 29 2018,positive,not adding anthing new to the superhero actioncomedy genre but overall a good movie
Dec 29 2018,positive,super funny movie people need to get away from the fact that not all venom involves spiderman
Dec 29 2018,neutral,started out very slow but the last 45 minutes was good
Dec 29 2018,positive,i know that the controversy is heavy on this movie it does start out kinda wierd but once venom is on the screen its a fun ride aslo the reason spiderman isnt in this is because i think marvel has some plans with that in the future
Dec 29 2018,positive,wow once again i am stunned at the absurdity of the top critics affecting the tomatometer of venom this movie was made for a younger and less pretentious audience and i feel that this movie demonstrates a more clear difference between what the audience wants and what the critics think we want venom was funny when it needed to be emotional when it felt right and above all it was a story that leaves the audience wanting a sequel bravo tom hardy and the rest of the cast cant wait for 2
Dec 29 2018,positive,i did not have high hopes for venom and i my expectations were met but that was it overall the film was kind of boring and although a lot of people found the interactions between eddie and venom very funny i just thought it was fine tom hardy did a great job in the role and so did the rest of the cast some of the problems were that the villain was generic and the love interest was not great also it take about 30 minutes for venom to actually show up and before that the movie felt very slow after that it picks up a bit the final battle was but because it was hard to tell what was going on overall it is not great movie but there is some entertainment to it    5510
Dec 29 2018,positive,for what it was fun popcorn movie
Dec 29 2018,positive,much better than expected it had good action scenes and humor
Dec 29 2018,negative,bad movie it seems more like a comedy than a movie about a villain many plot holes
Dec 29 2018,positive,this is a bad film when that is said it is a enjoyable ride of entertainment rather have a bad entertaining movie than a boring good movie
Dec 29 2018,positive,great movie i cant wait for the next one love tom hardys acting his character is really endearing and so is venom surprisingly
Dec 29 2018,positive,although it can be slightly cheesy i loved this movie so much i love venom as a character and i love the way sony did this movie the rest of this review is spoilers so if you havent watched i would stop reading now anyhow this movie was great this is exactly how i see venom in different universe where spiderman isnt in the picture spiderman is what made venom venom to many viewers but only people who know the comics or who have played literally any of the spiderman games excluding spiderman ps4 know who half the characters are from the comics including the side antagonist riot and of course cletus kasady the main host of the carnage symbiote what people dont understand is this is a different universe that we can assume spiderman is not in eddie brocks life in this universe eddie ruined his own life unlike his blame of spiderman in the raimi films this venom never bonded with spiderman therefore never saw him as a perfect host and saw eddie as his perfect host people are nitpicking about how venoms eyes are like spidermans and how he can sling webs and climb walls first off this is a completely different universe and possibly a different mcu altogether if spiderman was there to stop venom he wouldve done so before venom literally beat a swat team to death with   their own men this move is awesome and although there are some silly moments it really helps take away from the darkness of it as it really is a great movie venom is supposed to be chaotic and noisy thats what makes venom the character he is would you want to see a venom beating people to death crushing cars and eating people for an hour and a half or see him sipping tea humming to himself i think tom hardy along with the rest of the venom cast did and outstanding job venom was never a villain venom was molded by brocks hate for peter parker we dont have this in this movie which is why venom leans closer to good despite him barely knowing a difference in conclusion venom is a total bad ass in this movie and i cant wait for the second movie which is sure to come in 2020 because then the critics wont know what hit em
Dec 29 2018,positive,honestly i see gold in this one venom feels like its lacking 30 minutes worth of content and was hastily chopped up for the final cut with some great parts laying on the cutting room floor the pacing is ungodly fast throughout the entire film which only adds to my speculation that some higherup really didnt want it to cross the two hour mark its funny dark exciting but lacking in just a few places if there ever exists a directors cut of this film i can almost guarantee its a more enjoyable experience    the cg was fine i dont really have high standards to begin with but your mileage may vary the characters were developed enough enough to make some sense    though again this lack of characterization and motivation feels unintentional like it was supposed to be there but just wasnt    in short venom needed more time to keep its pacing down and characters sufficiently grounded otherwise its actually quite nice and tom hardys performance couldnt have been better    45 simply due to my own little theory about this films production it really does feel like a genuinely good movie that got ripped apart in post
Dec 28 2018,positive,critics can kiss my ass this movie was the best goddamned movie i have ever watched
Dec 28 2018,positive,absolutely loved this movie they did an excellent job bringing venom and eddie brock to the silver screen where previous attempts had been comparatively unsuccessful 1010 will see again
Dec 28 2018,neutral,as a fan you can appreciate a light hearted take on the character however it comes off a little cheesy in the sequel i want to see more of the villain
Dec 28 2018,neutral,trashy as much as it can get but overall a entertaining comedy not sure if it was the directors intention to be so funny especially since the trailer was so dark and it presented as a horror dramma
Dec 28 2018,positive,funny and has nice action momments but the cgi is not the best and its sometimes confusing but is a good movie sometimes
Dec 28 2018,positive,not marvels best work but not its worst its like a midnight horror movie trying aimlessly to be a superhero movieits fun and the bad scripting is mainly to be blamed for the movie failure amd the ending was like a last minute idea 
Dec 28 2018,positive,very silly and the script but view this as a dark romantic comedy and its hilarious  hardys performance when creating the brock venom dynamic is brilliant
Dec 28 2018,positive,i just watched this movie and i loved it although it was not the original story line and i wanted to see tom holland do at least a cameo it was awesome i found that venom was funny and not too dark plus it was kind of sweet ending it left so many potential movies to come so i am excited to see what is next the acting was great
Dec 28 2018,positive,long and thorough setup too little time establishing the symbiosis and relationship between venom and eddie
Dec 28 2018,positive,what the hell is wrong with you critics  this was a great movie
Dec 28 2018,neutral,rated r wouldve made it all 5 stars
Dec 28 2018,positive,i mean it was good i enjoyed it a bit of humour which was great took me a little bit to enjoy tom hardy in the role felt awkward at times but overall a fairly enjoyable movie
Dec 28 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics
Dec 28 2018,positive,the script is all over the place but i enjoy the fight scenes and tom hardy gives another amazing performance
Dec 28 2018,negative,talk about a terrible movie the actors hardy and ahmed where completely miscast you could tell everything they tried do act was forced and unnatural hardy couldnt walk down the street without it looking awkward the movie had potential but quick descended into poor character development and a plot that was well laughable too much time is spent trying to convince us that hardy can act and its obvious he cannot as for ahmed they throw him out there as the head a big pharma company and yet hes down in the weeds in lab making life and death decisions speaking of these labs omg this is supposedly a hightech company and yet there is not even one security camera in the lab  on multiple occasions ahmed asks where is my and of course had there been any security cameras that would be obvious dont get started and the drone scenes or the inaudible venum voice this movie is just plain bad
Dec 27 2018,positive,look the movie is very dumb and badly written but somehow is fun i can see why critics score it so low but is honest fun if you dont overthink it
Dec 27 2018,positive,great movie dont believe the haters this movie was very much like a japanese movie which i love japanese movies
Dec 27 2018,negative,wholeheartedly agree with the critics on this one all the worst parts of venom no one liked paired with writing and dialogue that frankly fell flat
Dec 27 2018,neutral,stupid but fun i enjoyed it both for what it got right and what it got ohsohilariously wrong
Dec 27 2018,positive,eddie brock is a dumpster fire and i love him almost as much as vemon does
Dec 27 2018,positive,i had a blast with this movie i went in with pretty low expectations  but was pleasantly surprised with fun action sequences and a few good laughs
Dec 27 2018,positive,absolutely loved it
Dec 27 2018,positive,enjoyable as a dark hero movie
Dec 27 2018,positive,the script couldve used another pass particularly in the first half but this film is a lot more fun than the critics gave it credit for
Dec 27 2018,neutral,not horrendous but also not enjoyable
Dec 27 2018,positive,itï 12 12tms fun movie  donï 12 12tmt look for something that isnï 12 12tmt there  he ainï 12tmt no captain america out to save the world  think clint eastwood in a few dollars more
Dec 27 2018,negative,worst sht ive seen for some time stif actors by probably bad directing in flat story with stupid characters i did not enjoy anything in this movie the worst thing is they already have an established character with lots of good stories and they decided to do this i mean come on
Dec 27 2018,positive,i give it to you the people believe the public score very entertaining and isnt just an endless series of action scenes al la transformers moveies    ok the motocycle chase scene is terrible but it doesnt last too long and there is a bit of a continuity problem with the symbiont dynamic on a few occasions but you know  i actually really enjoyed this movie    ok perhaps i you could watch a two hour softreboot movie of the magic roundabout if tom hardy was the main protagonist brian the snail but anyway the critics have fkd up again give this a watch
Dec 27 2018,positive,no idea what rotten tomatoes is on but this is a great fun movie watched it twice now and prefer it to the avengers
Dec 27 2018,positive,okay the movie has a lot of flawsright but its so entertaining that you dont see any of them so definitely worth watching i really dont understand the critics
Dec 27 2018,positive,great turn on the spider verse venom and giving it a new name wont regret watching doesnt bore you at certain points always fills you with well written well directed scenes great movie
Dec 27 2018,positive,the critics got this one wrong 
Dec 27 2018,negative,venom fails to escape from the noisy asylum that traps the audience and the characters in a messy and imbalanced plot
Dec 27 2018,positive,with more emphasis placed on the relationship between ego and host over the circumstantial banality that surrounds them the film succeeds in creating a dynamic that surpasses whatever else the plot tries to throw at the proverbial dartboard and what a dynamic duo  it becomes evident that brocks effusiveness infuses with his bromantic symbiote allowing the latter to engage in more personalized banter than any typical typedup cgi would  if this keeps up granting more than quickie conspiratorial throughlines in the symbiotes own travails spiderman may eventually face his greatest enemy ever an antihero everyone likes
Dec 27 2018,positive,loved it i dont know why critics didnt like the movie though
Dec 27 2018,positive,very enjoyable this was the best of the recent marval or dc movies  the critics are seemingly upset that it didnt convey the correct political messages though and rated it accordingly  ignore them
Dec 26 2018,positive,the critics were wrong
Dec 26 2018,positive,unbelievable these critics have zero ability to judge a film with out complete bias i sat through aquaman which recieved a 64 freshness rating wtf that was such a poorly constructed mishmash of a dozen convoluted subplots and poorly written dialog and poorly directed derivative mess  i donâtmt get how so many of the critics here on rottentomatoes reivewed and decribed venom as such but gave praises to aquaman       this venom film was an excellent depiction of the comic book venom the best venom film version so far  the cgi venom was done so well humor horror and great physical stunts tom hardy gave us a great character and the symbiotic nature pun intended of brock and venom relationship was really fun  i wish these critics would take their heads out of their asses they are wrecking the movie watching film industry as folks will not buy tickets when films get planned on rottentomatoes i typically wait until video because of these bad ratings  i paid a hell of a lot of money on aquaman that i now regret  and rented venom  it should have been  the reverse  critics you are driving movie watching public away from watching films in the theaters which damages the industry we all love  your simply taking a piss in our pool we just saw homes and watson  4 on rottentomatoes are you freaking kidding me  we are not watching art films  or academy award winning film contendors iâtmm not a full hater of aquaman but iâtmm just sick and tired of listening to crap reviewers and their contradicting opinions
Dec 26 2018,positive,good performance by tom hardy a typical sony superherovillain movie in that it is average in most facets welcomingly venom had a bunch of funny side comment to tom hardys character
Dec 26 2018,positive,i thought it was good no not over the top great but good it had action comedy and a tad bit of romance sure some of the movie could have been better still worth the time to watch it
Dec 26 2018,positive,was a decent foundation to build onexcited to see where this can go
Dec 26 2018,positive,being completely honest the movie was just alright  dialogue seemed forces  cgi wasnt amazing in some spots  i did think however the performances from tom hardy and michelle williams were quite solid
Dec 26 2018,positive,i loved it lots of comedy and good action i hope there is a sequel
Dec 26 2018,positive,i know the critics reviews are bad but i really enjoyed venom and would love a second one and further more would like if this is attached to spiderman in a way like a anithero somehow  plus i liked the comedy
Dec 26 2018,negative,named appropriately venom because youre left sick after watching it 15
Dec 26 2018,positive,i loved it the villain was a little over the top but loved literally everything else
Dec 26 2018,positive,i expected more out of this movie i didnt like how they portrayed brock but overall good story line
Dec 26 2018,positive,this movie was amazing one of my favs great job tom hardy
Dec 26 2018,positive,great fun movie dont listen to most of the professional critics on here they dont like whatever doesnt suit their pc agenda
Dec 26 2018,negative,this movie had bad pacing thats my only positive for the film 15
Dec 26 2018,positive,this movie was perfect in every way good action a nice parts of comady grate acting by tom hardy  and graet afects venom looked really good 1010 would recamend i relly hope tgey make a sequl with carnege
Dec 26 2018,positive,i debated seeing this because it scored a 28 but it was super entertaining  it started a bit slow but for me who is not a marvel or comic book fan it explained where the parasite came from and back history  i actually cant wait to see the sequel  my husband who is a marvel enthusiast also didnt want to see it but enjoyed it as well   tomatometer has it wrong  1st one in a long time for me in the wrong category  but thats why we all have opinions  hope you enjoy
Dec 26 2018,negative,failed attempt at comedy subpar action why is venom so soft and goofy huge plot inconsistencies
Dec 26 2018,positive,just barely fresh this movie was a mess and at most parts i wouldnt even say it was a good mess what made this movie work for me was tom hardy his performance made this film feel like it was just going nuts and made something memorable out of what would have been a rejected script form the early 2000s
Dec 26 2018,positive,its not as bad as everyone says it has some bad mistakes and actions but the action scenes make it worth seeing
Dec 26 2018,positive,58  tom hardy as venom in action is a wellrendered diversion but the script and direction lack any purpose other than to set up more films
Dec 26 2018,positive,got it for christmas on blue ray awesome just awesome love this movie
Dec 26 2018,positive,i like this movie a lot and so great to see stan lee
Dec 26 2018,positive,i thought it was brilliant
Dec 26 2018,positive,after seeing this i want more venom best movie about a villain 
Dec 26 2018,negative,worst movie of 2018 goddamn 
Dec 26 2018,positive,tremendously well made one of the best films of the mcu 
Dec 26 2018,positive,to me its like the marvel version of suicide squad no one is born evil just made evil and giving a second chance of redemption
Dec 25 2018,neutral,if you know venom you gonna hate this movie but if you dont know him you can watch on friday night whenever you got the flu
Dec 25 2018,positive,eddie and venom are the best gay representation in media this year
Dec 25 2018,positive,enjoyable with a sense of humour
Dec 25 2018,positive,this movie was one of the most entertaining movies of 2018 the plot the cast and the action makes this movie a great
Dec 25 2018,positive,good movie funnier than expected 
Dec 25 2018,positive,venom was great good storyline and loved venoms personality 
Dec 25 2018,positive,the special effects and technical requirements were amazing  the acting was great but the lines and overall story was mediocre venom is supposed to be this bad to the bone villain in this film hes portrayed as an anti hero which is fine but even in the film venom refers to himself a loser and even calls someone else a turd when i think of venom hes strong crazy and an overall beast the writers and storys did him only a little justice in my opinion
Dec 25 2018,neutral,it was ok glad i didnt pay to see it in the theater
Dec 25 2018,positive,i absolutely loved th
Dec 25 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie great action and good humor 
Dec 25 2018,negative,great visuals and action sequences only
Dec 25 2018,positive,contrary to what the critics say this was a great movie
Dec 25 2018,positive,tom hardys performance is a worth watching this movie is not perfect but still a lot of fun to watch
Dec 25 2018,positive,i cant believe i believed in all these bogus critics who shat on this movie i ended up not watching the film til now in my dads living room off the roku box i just finished it and holy ef all i can fantasize of is how much  disney probably spent on critics to shit on this this movie beats every marvel movie save maybe winter soldier save the disney humor way to go sonycant wait for round 2
Dec 25 2018,positive,an amazing movie a good job on effects and story a must see to me
Dec 25 2018,positive,better than ant man  loved the fact movie was completely standalone aside from spiderman  since infinity war rang the proverbial monte python bell to bring out your dead
Dec 25 2018,positive,not sure why this movie isnt getting the credit  that it deserves the action scenes were entertaining the back and forth dialogue between eddie brock and venom was great also riot being the big bad in this movie was a smart move in my opinion too because it makes the buildup for carnage that much better
Dec 25 2018,positive,critics dont know shit
Dec 25 2018,positive,i see the critics dont like the comic book movies like venom  it was better than expected  tom hardy is really good in this movie
Dec 25 2018,positive,a good entertaining movie story can drag at times but the action sequences make up for the poor story a fun movie to watch
Dec 24 2018,positive,highly underrated its got everything a marvel movie needs to foot the bill action humor jump scares and a loveable antihero that occasionally eats peoples heads the director nailed the edgy and dark antihero while managing to keep a relatively wide appeal
Dec 24 2018,negative,very enjoyable comic book movie a little slow to start but definitely worth watching
Dec 24 2018,positive,it one of best movie i see this year people who think is bad or stuck is dumb i mean come on story good it did it with out spiderman
Dec 24 2018,positive,really enjoyed the movie had way more humor than i expected i thought it would be more of a darker movie but still thought it wasnt very good 
Dec 24 2018,positive,amazing visuals captivating action entertaining dialogue and fantastic character development leaves some questions and there are some details that are overlooked a really great movie hoping for a second
Dec 24 2018,positive,loved it unexpectedly funny the action scenes were awesome and the characters well rounded
Dec 24 2018,positive,venom is sonys answer to the marvel universe tapping into a character only explored once prior in the spiderman universe this film starring tom hardy serves as an origin story of alien symbiote attempting to take over the host body of tom hardy eddie brock is a reporter attempting to break open a story about the evasive ceo carlton drake this leads him on a journey to the alien symbiote where the film explores which entity is in control    the element of eddie brock fighting with the alien symbiote created a refreshing origin story you only knew which one was in control by the fact eddie turned into a large drooling monster delighted with biting other peoples heads off tom plays the dual personality perfectly where eddie is just trying to uncover the truth with his investigative journalism but is afraid to take much of a risk in his personal life the monster attached to him has dark intentions and tom grapples with this urge of violence largely venom is intelligent but also subject to doing whatever he pleases without really caring about the consequences     this conflict shows us something we rarely have seen where there is so much struggle within to become what is necessary for the greater good tom works well with the split personality where he knocks the comedic notes out of the park and dives well into the silliness of the character his talent is undeniable as venom could be a caricature in less capable hands but here is intriguing as the other side of him i almost felt the seamless transition between the two characters and you really feel the symbiotic relationship   this movie moves along a familiar path but the film is so strange where it feels different than other pictures before it grounded by hardys performance the film is so much fun that you will not care the plot is fairly simple the ceo has been experimenting with symbiotes to understand if this can be weaponized he decides he needs to go after eddie when he finds the only one to seamlessly merge with the symbiote in the process the ceo becomes riot and controlled by the symbiote he has tirelessly attempted to control     simply you want to see more of venom and his dynamic with eddie brock the internal arguments never really fade and this adds to the allure as they understand their need for each other but also they can continue to have their differences venom needs eddies body to continue to live and eddie needs venom to survive onslaughts of opposition an understanding of sorts develops between the two but i enjoyed we have never deprived of the element of their squabbling as two brothers     the visuals are lacking and remind me of early superhero movies from the 2000s the slobbering mess of venom looks cool at times but the animation leaves some to be desired however the committed performance of tom hardy and the funny dialogue make this a film worth seeing the decidedly strange subject matter and delivery will turn people off this is a fun breezy movie which will not ask any difficult questions i loved the dynamic of venom and eddie brock which is more than enough reason to  search out the next installment of their saga
Dec 24 2018,negative,was expecting better just an ok movie 
Dec 24 2018,positive,ignore the critics this movie was fun had great action and was well acted
Dec 24 2018,negative,what is this but sheer cynicism overtaking the screen a protean and shiny sort of blackness here at last having wholly enveloped sonyï 12tms once earnest attempts at the spidey universe there is no overriding sensibility guiding the shift from renegade truthseeking hero to vigilante antihero itï 12tms just sheer survival and vengeanceï 12as much by the studio as by brock and the symbiote sharingï 12as sony must now do with marvelï 12is at best a necessary evil to embrace only to ward off atrophy and death which alienness whether from mainland asia or from an extraterrestrial comet inevitably brings to the idealistically egoistic an actual message about the existential threat facing all the globe is mere pretext for a slim formulaic utterly unmenacing villain whose much more urgent and real concerns are cast aside to satiate a hunger for personal revenge and heroic glory without even the hospitality and charity to offer the audience a decent action romp
Dec 24 2018,positive,itâs a good movie but itâs too fast and you canât understand evrything very well
Dec 24 2018,positive,great romp with some excellent dialogue
Dec 24 2018,positive,best movie of all times  love it can watch it over and over
Dec 24 2018,positive,critics opinions are more obsolet this movie is amazing
Dec 24 2018,positive,not a bad movie script could use some tweaks but tom hardy still delivered with a great role cgi was great only thing is venomâtms symbol wouldâtmve loved to see it
Dec 24 2018,negative,overated worst spider man related movie
Dec 24 2018,negative,what could have been a good movie is all over the place and the story ends abruptly with that said its got some nice visual effects and a sleek looking venom
Dec 24 2018,positive,messy script and you could tell they rewrote it to add riot but overall pretty good i would watch it again
Dec 24 2018,negative,much like tom hardys accent this film never found an identity beyond the awkward illstructured carousel which is more characteristic of dc
Dec 24 2018,negative,honestly wasnt my type of film it was more of a fluffy romantic comedy more than anything if youre into that then you will love this film if you want drama angst action and character development then this isnt for you 
Dec 24 2018,positive,it was nice and refreshing to see a protagonist openly how weaknesses and fear for once i absolutely loved tom hardys eddie brock his acting throughout brocks relationship with venom was hilarious and yet there was enough to show how frightening and wonderfully chaotic the whole ordeal was honestly for once i didnt at all mind the rather obvious cgi as i was busy enjoying the storyline and the relationships between characters as a person who hasnt had much of a clue of what venom was before i definitely am a fan now and i would love to see more of how this plays out in the future great movie
Dec 23 2018,positive,this film has a lot of basic problems both in terms of structure and performance but i have to say i really enjoyed it the high point of the film when it really took off was when the relationship between venom and his host eddie brock takes center stage these two characters really breath life into a film that without them would have been as dead as eddies journalism career its just too bad that the revelation of this relationship doesnt appear until well into the films first hour leaving the first act of this film feeling somewhat hollow i guess that just like eddie brock this film needed venom i wish the filmmakers would have looked at the title of their film and got the hint
Dec 23 2018,positive,would have been better if sony would have stayed closer to the source material or at least close enough to link it to all the spiderman universe movies and mcu universe cant wait for woody harlson in the sequels
Dec 23 2018,positive,while some of the script was very out of place and felt really bad the 85 of the movie that had good script and good action and good cgi was very entertaining venom changing heart didnt really make too much sense nor was it really explored and thats what keeps it back from being extremely good for me overall its a very fun movie and moving past the story hole and some of the dialogue its a solid movie for sure i cant wait to see how they improve in the sequel
Dec 23 2018,positive,so maybe i dont give this a 100 but i will say i 200 enjoyed the movie its not perfect but to be honest i loved like it wasï 12 12 12ï 12 12 12ï 12 12 12ï 12 12 12
Dec 23 2018,positive,a zillion times better than infinity wars  but whats michelle williams doing in this besides run around looking like somebodys catholic school girl fantasy
Dec 23 2018,negative,poor tom hardy who delivered a brilliant acting to a poorly script that was given to him the history has nothing to do with the real venom so i dont see what he has to do with that mess
Dec 23 2018,positive,while it is a formulaic comic book movie it is still a solid action action movie i may be a bit biased because i loved the venom and carnage comics growing up but like all action movies this one is a ride and a fun one at that
Dec 23 2018,positive,my favorite movie of 2018 by far
Dec 23 2018,positive,super good material to work with and the acting is good but some of the plot home are ridiculous
Dec 23 2018,positive,the first half of this film is an absolute mess but the second half is very enjoyable michelle williams has zero chemistry w hardy and prolly should of been replaced by someone else hopeful for the next film in the franchise
Dec 23 2018,neutral,would have been a great movie back in 2005 but the genre has evolved and so has cgi technology hardy is great but the rest of the cast falls flat the climax is a huge let down
Dec 23 2018,positive,venom provides funny humor and a big appetite but lacks a proper runtime its shorter than you think and character development
Dec 23 2018,positive,the movie was fun and better than spider man 3
Dec 23 2018,neutral,ehstory could have been better drawn out
Dec 23 2018,positive,i enjoyed venom great story and action  i saw the movie once but will certainly be watching it again  i am looking forward to venom 2
Dec 23 2018,positive,good movie to watch it was not perfect but was definitely good 
Dec 23 2018,positive,really enjoyable and more complicated than other marvel movies the story worked really well
Dec 23 2018,negative,i agree with the critics on this one what they said made me throw my cat across the room this movie had me questioning life
Dec 23 2018,positive,my favorite movie of the entire year it isnâtmt a life changing experience but it is just completely enjoyable every second the writing does a great job of staying darker for venom but adding in comedy without making venom himself seem less bad ass iâtmm so shocked by all of the bad reviews critics gave the movie because i am usually right next to the reviews on most movies not this one though itâtms a great movie and the only movie i have ever craved to watch again the second i left the theatre
Dec 23 2018,positive,very good acting by the lead great build up early on to grow the character   wish the venom voice was more articulate or had more interest
Dec 23 2018,positive,venom the comic book did not wealth of back story to the character i think it did rather well fleshing out the world he lives in
Dec 23 2018,positive,absolutely loved it the theme was a little bit uncertain of itself at times but the relationship between eddie and venom was a delight to watch tom hardy did a fantastic job the villain couldve been better but aslong as we get carnage in the sequel i dont mind i loved venoms dark humour throughout the movie it wasnt what i expected the movie to be like but that makes me love it more venom turned out to be a romcom with super powers and bromance if the second film focuses more on eddie and venoms back and forth banter locked down the kind of movie it wants to be and got better writers in we could be looking at a spectacular sequel
Dec 23 2018,positive,entertaining from start to finish venom comes home with funny mess of a movie that has good effects good action hilarious moments and a decent story it was worth the ticket to go see it in theaters and it was worth the rental charge to watch it again on youtube     venom isnt the best story ever written and honestly could have shown better in some aspects with an r rating though at that point it would have gotten pretty gruesome the dialogue between eddie and venom is priceless and it carries the movie venom accepts its quirks and shows them off instead of trying too hard and taking itself too serious     all in all i enjoyed the movie and would see it again and would recommend others to see it and at the end of the day thats what a movies for
Dec 23 2018,positive,not as bad as expected still cgi and villain were not that good movie is just fun to watch 
Dec 23 2018,negative,a junk miles away from the comic strip or from being a decent movie
Dec 23 2018,neutral,got a feeling of the japanese comic book
Dec 23 2018,neutral,this was not a bad film the only reason it gets 3 stars is because of the first 30 minutes that really were painful the rest of the film became interesting and the character of venom was true to comic nature the sad thing is where is spiderman its watchable but thats as far as it goes
Dec 23 2018,positive,donï 12 12tmt understand all the panning it was an interesting take on the character and hardy was awesome
Dec 22 2018,positive,critics underscored this i literally made this account just to rate this movie 5 stars hope they make a second one
Dec 22 2018,positive,not that great but not that bad either
Dec 22 2018,positive,this was a fun movie not perfect but no movie isi wish rottentomatoes would diversify their critics clearly by the disparity between audiences and their critics this should be a ridiculously obvious clue to review their process some of your critics are obviously burned out  numb  or on the take sick of seeing these gaps between audiences and tomatoes sorry  i dont respect you anymore you had your chance
Dec 22 2018,positive,not as bad as the critics made it out to be but still no masterpiece it was fun thats about all i can say i didnt want blow my brains out by the end but ill probably never watch a second time
Dec 22 2018,positive,damn good movie fun entertaining funny kind of morbidly adorable altogether great and these freaking critics are out of their freaking minds    this is not a clever deconstruction of some kind of greek story archetype this is a good movie
Dec 22 2018,positive,its not a disney movie it sucks                                                       biased critics
Dec 22 2018,positive,really fun movie ill watch it again only wish riot and his agenda had been made more a part of the plot also was strange overall that the people throughout the movie werent more terrified by venom lol
Dec 22 2018,neutral,theres some good parts to this movie but its clear sony cut up the crap out of this movie its too short and suffers an understandable story despite the cool gooey symbiotes
Dec 22 2018,positive,phomenal  funny interesting really good play on words  one of the best entertaining movies i have seen in a while  didnt want it to end do not listen to the critics  they are always wrong
Dec 22 2018,positive,definitely a lot better than i was expecting hardy looked like he had a blast 
Dec 22 2018,positive,loved it but i see the critics pov only i would of hated to see any spider man reference in this cant wait for a part 2
Dec 22 2018,positive,nice movie really fun 
Dec 22 2018,positive,throw back super heroes entertainment  no one in the mcu league though
Dec 22 2018,positive,rated r woulda been better but its great
Dec 22 2018,positive,awesome movie  super entertaining and fun  everyone that hated on this movie is a pretentious douche my only critique is how long the buildup took  the venom character was awesome and i wish there was more of him  go see this movie  youll love itunless youre a pretentious douche
Dec 22 2018,positive,bad ass aaaand just saying venom was noisy and chaotic
Dec 22 2018,positive,this movie had surprisingly good special effects bits of comedy and a decent story line
Dec 22 2018,positive,it was hilarious and weirdly sweet loved it
Dec 22 2018,neutral,dumb fun but the emphasis is on the dumb
Dec 22 2018,positive,missed this one in theatre but wish i had gone  really really enjoyed it  venom is the antihero that i never knew i wanted  cant believe i am saying this but im glad this movie didnt have spiderman
Dec 22 2018,positive,amazing but why did venom change his idea about earth in less than a minute 
Dec 22 2018,positive,surprisingly entertaining tom hardy has a lot o fun and is a bit more articulated than in his later blockbusters a very competent blockbuster with special effects ranging from good to awful a straightforward plot and overall quite enjoyable hey its already better and less goofy than spiderman 3 a fresh approach to the marvel fractured franchise not brilliant but way better than the negative hype might lead to believe
Dec 22 2018,positive,simply put if you know venom enough to view the movie from its point of view the movie totally makes sense and is a fun ride otherwise the critics consensus is understandable except for the their claim that it needs a stronger spiderman connection i think that statement is unfounded
Dec 22 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie in fact i will watch it again thats just how good i found it to be likely because the shape shifting of the creature is similar to the game by the name prototype i lost my interest in spiderman i think it has reached a dead point now where it simply becomes boring just my view and opinion i would certainly like to see another venom stand alone movie hit the scene soon
Dec 22 2018,positive,the movie is great the cgi confused me a lot idk why other critics hate it so much
Dec 22 2018,positive,hardcore fans of the comic book character will be disappointed but the casual going viewers and fans will definitely be entertained
Dec 22 2018,positive,at the time of writing this review the audience score is 85 and critics are at 28 this just goes the show the critics on this site live in an alternate reality this is a great actionscifi film it may not be infinity war but compared to the history of all comic book movies in the past 50 years its arguably in the top quartile
Dec 22 2018,negative,im highly upset i wasted 2 at redbox for this garbage i read the cocreator blamed the audiences ages for the negative reviews people in their 40s coming down on it im in my early 30s and both my 11 year old and i werent feeling it i hated it corny and predictable story graphics were crap minds well watched a cartoon if they arent gonna attempt to make it look real at all and now venoms some kind of hero im mad it had some form of success itll  make them inspired to create more poop like this
Dec 22 2018,positive,i went in with low expectations but really enjoyed the ride it was fun and built a good back story for the character of eddie brock and for venom i would recommend seeing this movie at least once and hope more people agree with me
Dec 22 2018,negative,i dont understand how people love this movie this was not a movie with good storytelling stick to the sources hyper there is only one thing that made this movie less horrible venom dialogue and tom hardy the rest of casts were pure garbage
Dec 22 2018,positive,i loved thisi dont know what people wanted i dont know what would have took it to a r rating but it was great as is and shiit tom hardy
Dec 22 2018,positive,movie was much better than critics consensus
Dec 22 2018,positive,great movie full of action and funny moments 
Dec 22 2018,positive,this movie had way to much wasted potential as the first standalone movie of its kind i can admire our main character tom hardys performance but unfortunately its not enough to save this trainwreck of a film the production failed on making an actual story line and procrastinated till the last twenty minutes to make an actual climax it was also unable to compensate for its inability to actually show us who the hell these brand new characters are and no amount of witty venom oneliners will be able to make up for that
Dec 21 2018,positive,i thought it was a great movie though it doesnt follow the comic to a t or word for word that is something that we should really be accustomed too i have not watched one comic book movie other than captain america be close remotely close to the comic they did a good job with splitting the time between eddie and venom good comic relief between the two characters is a plus im sure they are trying to hone a little big of deadpool style comedy all in all good flick and i would watch it again
Dec 21 2018,positive,wildly insane and ridiculousbut a hell of a lot of fun 
Dec 21 2018,positive,awesome movie loved it
Dec 21 2018,positive,this movie is a lot of fun and a joy to watch it does have some problems and some tone issues but venom and the duo between it and tom hardy is really enjoyable again not perfect but fun
Dec 21 2018,positive,this one classifies as fun bad the first 45 minutes of this drag and make no real sense but once venom shows up hardys dynamic with the voice in his head is very entertaining
Dec 21 2018,positive,by far the funniest marvel movie iï 12tmve seen havenï 12tmt seen deadpool spoiler alert issued  based on the trailer youï 12tmd expect this movie to be dark serious and creepy but the relationship between eddie and venom isnï 12tmt like jekyll and hyde  itï 12tms more like phil and jay modern family hereï 12tms some samples if you have seen the trailer you know what venom sounds like which makes it even funnier when he ï 12tauntsï 12â eddie    venom we need carlton drakeï 12tms rocket you remember him  eddie how do you even know about that  venom i know everything eddie  eddie you do  venom everything about you  eddie how  venom i am inside your head you are a loser eddie    eddie stares out through the broken window of the 17th of a building  venom jump  eddieï 12tms eyes widen jump cut to eddie pushing the down button of an elevator  venom pï 12ï 12ï 12y    eddie i canï 12tmt go with you itï 12tms not safe  anne get in the car eddie  eddie looks up at anne  anne in the back  venom i like her get in    venom if we do not stop riot he will come back here with millions more of my kind  eddie millions what you were gonna take the rocket and you were gonna come back here with an invasion force then what were you gonna do you were gonna go feed on a whole planet  venom yes but it is different now eddie i have decided to stay  eddie sarcastically wow  venom on my planet iï 12tmm kind of a loser like you    riot leaps through window  eddie oh jesus youyou can take this guy right  venom he has got st you have never seen  eddie what does that mean what are our chances  venom hmm pretty much zero  eddie oh fk it well letï 12tms go save the planet    riot narrowly misses venomï 12tms head with an organic ax  eddie holy st  venom told you    anne weï 12tmre not gonna tell dan about this okay  venom look at her she has no idea we are going to get her back  eddie no i donï 12tmt think so  anne sorry what was that  eddie weï 12tmre not gonna tell dan  anne eddie is there something you want to tell me  eddie nope  venom you belong with us annie    stan lee hey donï 12tmt give up on her either of you  eddie we wonï 12tmt  venom who is that guy  eddie leans down to pet stan leeï 12tms dog  venom wait this thing looks delicious    eddie i have absolutely no problem with you sticking around but if you do weï 12tmre gonna have to have some ground rules all right you cannot just go around eating anybody that you want to  venom i cannot  eddie no you cannot all right we need to we need to reiterate this there are good people in this world a lot of them and then there are bad people you have to tell the difference the deal is you will only ever be allowing to touch harm hurt and possibly very possibly eat very very bad people  it never ever ever good people all right  venom fine  eddie good  venom but how does one tell the difference    robber the paymentï 12tms due chen  mrs chen please i canï 12tmt keep doing this  robbers cocks his gun  robber now  venom bad guy right  eddie yep  venom disarms robber  venom you come in here again in fact you go anywhere in this city preying on innocent people and we will find you and eat both your arms and then both of your legs  robber fearfully no no  venom and then we will eat your face right off your head do you understand  robber please  venom yes so you will be this armless legless faceless thing wonï 12tmt you rolling down the street like a turd in the wind do you feel me  robber what the hell are you  half of venomï 12tms face peels away revealing half of eddieï 12tms face  eddie and venom in unison we are venom opposite half of venomï 12tms face reforms enveloping eddie entirely  venom on second thought  robber please  venom devours the robber before morphing back into eddie  mrs chen eddie what was that  eddie ohscoffs i have a parasite yeah night mrs chen  eddie exits the store  venom ï 12parasiteï 12â  eddie yeah itï 12tms a term of endearment thatï 12tms all  venom apologize  eddie no  venom apologize  eddie all right fine iï 12tmm sorry so what do you want to do now    when i watched the bonus features one guy said that venom was deadpool before deadpool was deadpool you be the judge of that on the other hand i donï 12tmt know what the critics were smoking when they watched this movie and the carnage after credit tease was a cherry on top  90 fresh all the way
Dec 21 2018,positive,wow ignore the critics on this one   another great marvel movie    i always enjoy the marvel humor in the movies that they make  sorry i missed it when it was in theaters but glad i rented the streaming option at home
Dec 21 2018,negative,this movie was worst than spiderman 3 the fact you have to wait for 40 minutes just to justify that there is only one good action scene that is not a good thing  thats terrible and the final action scene was soooo stupid you just get a headache from trying to understand whats happening and the side characters you cant  remember as soon as you walk away from the theater the only persons name i remember is eddie and venom btw in that 40 min of waiting for venom just to get attached to eddie i almost fell asleep and this movie is just riddled with all the clichés like so many of them final thought i think id rather watch batman vs superman than go back to this movie  least bvs had some awsome parts to that movie if i could this would get negative stars 
Dec 21 2018,positive,funny and a great story somehow an action  and a romcom at the same time thoroughly enjoyable
Dec 21 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie the tomato meter is broken on this one cant wait for the second one
Dec 21 2018,positive,dont listen to critics  this is a good movie really good and fun  good job sony 
Dec 21 2018,positive,im upset i waited as long as i did to see this i laughed alot the movie itself wasnt the best but i had a good time watching it
Dec 21 2018,negative,thy had 11 years to redeem venom tom hardy is a good venom yet they failed to do everything else this film completely wasted one of marvels best characters in a lazy movie that left me asking myself is that all
Dec 21 2018,positive,its okay tom hardy added an interesting twist the film lacked decent story telling for the circumstances the film was dealing with copyright boundaries the film provided a new idea for the character 
Dec 21 2018,neutral,the character and look of venom is done right here and theres enough action and humor to have a good time but i still think venom needs spiderman in his back story and in this world to make it feel more complete  its just not good enough to really recommend to anyone whos not already sold on the character and a character like venom deserves more than that
Dec 21 2018,positive,fynny easy to catch liked a lot
Dec 21 2018,positive,mediocre at its best
Dec 21 2018,positive,loved it saw it in theater just rented it to watch again 
Dec 20 2018,negative,dont believe the hype unless youre a sucker and just want a big dumb action movie avoid it like the plague or watch it  what do i care haha all i know is i waited for months to see this movie and was cautious of the hype both for and against it well i have to say it was way worse than i ever expected tom hardy normally such a great actor seemed like a first quarter drama student riz ahmed  michelle williams are both great too  but not here williams was phoning it in from frame one theres no real reason for the carnage that ensues either  its all just big dumb loud and graphic it would have been a hit in about 1993 but today  im sorry  it flat out sucks one  a half stars just cuz its kinda fun to see a character i grew up with and frankly he does look pretty good in a few scenes  not many but a few
Dec 20 2018,negative,not a terrible movie needed a few more month in the cgi slowcooker much like black panther but this was worse cgi  it honestly gets a 25 instead of a 35 because everything is in the trailer no surprises or cool scenes that i didnt already know about bad sony
Dec 20 2018,positive,i do not understand why tomatometer shows so low rating i liked the movie it was something new unexpected
Dec 20 2018,positive,this movie is awesome suck it haters legit this movie is funny has good action scenes and a plot that iâtmm cool with
Dec 20 2018,positive,wouldve been better as an rrated film but still fun in a 90s comic book film way
Dec 20 2018,positive,this movie certainly has it flaws but itâtms fun and enjoyable
Dec 20 2018,positive,with its chilling soundtrack astounding cinematography intense action sequences and great performances from tom hardy and riz ahmed venom knows how to keep the scares thrills and laughs coming regardless of what the critics are saying
Dec 20 2018,positive,it was surprisingly entertaining and not what i was expecting at all from what id seen in the trailers ill probably watch it again
Dec 20 2018,positive,i liked this movie better the first time i saw it back last year when it was called upgrade heheh i kid but look this isnt exactly a cinematic masterpiece or anything alright but what it is is tom hardy and company doing their level best to upgrade an overdone and underbaked franchise concept script into a creditable scifi thriller with bodyhorror overtones featuring an enjoyable hour and a half of cgi shenanigans followed by 20 minutes of credits and postcredit scenes dont let that 1 hour 50 minutes running time fool you
Dec 20 2018,negative,very long and drawn out with one likable relationship that should have been focused on a lot more
Dec 20 2018,positive,while it plays like a bogstandard comic book movie of the 00s this clunky explosion of a mess turns out to be a really fun one with a rather admirable central character
Dec 20 2018,positive,we are venom are you a fan of action pack movies then this is the movie for you tom hardy was a reporter and he was going to report an illegal lab he wasnt supposed to go in he finds that humans were used for testing for the venom syndrome that came from space he got caught and he got put into one of the cells and it only worked on him i will give this movie 45 stars because i love comics books and action pack movies and i will definitely watch it again the second reason is that the character is from marvel and i like marvel more than dc i will definitely recommend this movie
Dec 20 2018,positive,my review is on the movie venom venom is a good movie to watch for people that like marvel and superhero movies in my opinion its a comedyaction movie i rate this movie a 55 because its funny and made me laugh a lot and it was kind of intense i really liked it and it made me laugh at certain parts overall it was a great movie and i recommend you to watch it
Dec 20 2018,positive,its more fun than i thought
Dec 20 2018,positive,the metalest character there is deserves better than hiphop
Dec 20 2018,negative,so glad i could give a half a star this is not the worst movie ive ever seen but its damn near impossible to be any closer 
Dec 20 2018,positive,venom superhero or villain  in spiderman 3 venom started as villain and was the enemy to spiderman so jealous of spiderman on october 5 2018 a new movie came out it was the new movie of venom journalist eddie brock is trying to take down carlton drake the infamous and talented founder of the life foundation while investigating one of drakes experiments eddies body fuse with the alien venom leaving him with superhuman strength and power perverted scary and fueled by anger venom this movie is rated pg13 but i advise you if you dont like movies like this dont go see its waste of your time but i rate this movie a a this movie had very exciting scenes like very good parts in the movie i like the scene were venom  carnage fight because carnage is trying send  the aliens across the world sending this major thing and venom stops it now go see this movie
Dec 20 2018,negative,deadpool can only get two xmen and venom cant even get spidey to show up as a secondary character
Dec 20 2018,positive,to start i really enjoyed this film  oh  spoilers ahead    i didnt bother to see venom at the cinema my initial thoughts being its a standalone venom movie its not linked to the marvel verse theres no spidey tie in its made by fox whats the point    but the film was surprisingly good     with tom hardy playing a likeable eddie brock i guess not having that rivalry with peter parker from the comic book world allowed the character of brock to come through as a more sympathetic loser than the total git he was in comic books the supporting cast all did their jobs fine  the film moved along at a fine pace     some of the cgi well actually a lot of the cgi was too much cgi but then i have no idea how you show venom fight sequances without cgi    its a shame the film centered on a battle with another symbiote i dont know why films need to create a hero  then immediatly create a 2nd version but bad so quickly   it would have been equally entertaining to have spent more time with venom  brock on lighter humerous charachter building moments ala superman 1978    the end spoiler of carnage is a nice touch  i look forward to the next film  from a fanboy point of view maybe they can bring it a tad more into the marveverse
Dec 20 2018,positive,this movie is amazing
Dec 20 2018,positive,really love this movie creative twist on the super hero line 
Dec 20 2018,positive,i was skeptical of a venom separate from spiderman but i loved it
Dec 20 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it i had heard good and bad so i went into not knowing so maybe my expectations were lower but it was good funny and action packed
Dec 20 2018,positive,i would have given it 4 stars but the 29 by critics is just so stupid it starts a little slow to get going and the car chase scene is a bit long but other than that stellar movie
Dec 20 2018,positive,i loved that this film stayed true to the comic i cant wait to see everything unfold with upcoming film characters and what carnage will do
Dec 20 2018,positive,not bad should be rated r since heï 12tms literally biting ppls heads off   tom hardy carries the movie  65
Dec 19 2018,positive,i thought the storyline was really amusing the performances was all over the map the vfx are good and i think tom hardy did a great job
Dec 19 2018,negative,shit was str8 whack venom hardy is buddies with tasmanian devil 
Dec 19 2018,positive,having just watched this movie five minutes ago i have to say that this is an amazing movie the casting choices are great i wish anne weying was a bit better but even so the comedy is fun and the cgi was amazing seeing shevenom  cletus kassidy was great fun the cast  crew knew what they were doing and i appreciate this movie the final battle was one of the most epic climaxes ive seen in a movie this year its one of the best movies that has come out this year in my opinion all in all venom is a good movie and has amazing music editing cgi casting and humor but the negatives include the fact that the script wasnt perfect in some places i could have done without dan and the villain when he isnt riot is not all that compelling and the finale where venom is thought to be dead could have been done without since we all knew he wouldnt be all in all 910 would watch again and again
Dec 19 2018,positive,i made a rotten tomates account just to give this film 5 stars
Dec 19 2018,negative,featuring the highest levels of incompetence and incoherency ive seen since suicide squad as well as the most humiliating performance of tom hardys career venom is an appalling mess that functions better as a remake of the 1984 steve martin comedy all of me than a marvel antihero saga
Dec 19 2018,positive,i enjoyed that they stayed very close to real comics it was funny as well as action packed   great movie
Dec 19 2018,positive,average script everything else was awesome hardy is terrific
Dec 19 2018,negative,cannot believe that i have waited a whole year just to watch thisthe story does not make any sense sony never knows how to make good marvel movies
Dec 19 2018,positive,i actually really enjoyed this movie had awesome fight scenes a really cool take on venom as this alien thingy and the endingwhoooo im already waiting for the sequel haha
Dec 19 2018,negative,worst movie i have ever seen i love tom hardy but what a complete waste of talent this film made money but so what
Dec 19 2018,positive,some of us clearly saw a different movie
Dec 19 2018,negative,train wreck the only positive thing was michelle williams acting 
Dec 19 2018,positive,after watching the movie i gotta say it was good it doesnt need spider man though i would love to see that interaction   i am looking forward to seeing a sequel
Dec 19 2018,positive,critics be damned i liked it lots of action and it doesnt take itself too seriously venom was given a bit of personality rather than being a glorified sticky suit
Dec 19 2018,positive,ok well the venom movie was amazing i was busting out laughing and had a good storyline and it was actually really fun
Dec 19 2018,positive,great movie eddie was a very relatable character and his relationship with venom is unique the film was entertaining throughout i cant believe the  movie did poorly on rotten tomatoes i like how eddie was all over the place with his new identity hero or villain venom was great and i cant wait for him to eat more heads off in the future the new spiderman and venom would be hysterical together
Dec 19 2018,positive,although i was nervous about not having spiderman involved this movie turned out much better then expected
Dec 19 2018,negative,who thought up that super thin story
Dec 19 2018,positive,though it does technically fail at the many achievements venom tries to reach for there is enough hilarious entertainment to make it worth a view or two
Dec 19 2018,positive,the interaction between eddie and venom which imo is the most important part of the movie is perfect also my list of fictional men im attracted to has gone from one entry to two
Dec 19 2018,positive,many wrote this movie off  while the cgi could have been better tom hardy steals the show  the interplay between eddie brock and venom is awesome if you go in knowing that this movie in not a marvel movie you will have a good time  the jokes work  the villain is not great and the movie does suffer for not having spiderman in it  the sequel which teases carnage will hopefully show a better villain  tom hardy is great in this role and really redeems vemon from what we got in spiderman 3 if you love vemon give this film a chance and you wont be disappointed
Dec 19 2018,positive,venom was better than i expected lets face it the last time we saw venom on the big screen it was a colossal disaster to say spiderman 3 was a disappointment would be a huge understatement anyway i wish that they would have given us more insight as to where these symbionts actually come from my two digit score would be 79100 go see it
Dec 19 2018,negative,ohhh manwhat the frickin frack were they thinking this is such a bizarre twisted mess of comedy and horror the movie was just all over the place instead of being a good solid dark action movie along the lines of say predator 2 or even a buddy comedy with action bits like mib they made this weird as all hell creepy kinda sad and awkwardly silly    this is tom hardy just goofing off on camera given way too much freedom and misinterpreting a character wellat least the cgi looked pretty good but i could rant on this movie for hours boy they screwed up
Dec 19 2018,positive,nother movie were the critics fail as usual go off user reviews great popcorn flick
Dec 19 2018,negative,the movie cant decide what the arcs of the any of the characters are supposed to be but thats probably the result of making cuts to appease a more box office friendly pg13 rating ultimately the movies greatest sin is how boring it is
Dec 19 2018,positive,tom hardy shines with his performance as eddie while the plot is about as average as a store brand food item 
Dec 19 2018,positive,finally a proper venom
Dec 19 2018,positive,hell yeah
Dec 18 2018,positive,for being neutered at pg13 i was expecting this to be a trainwreck instead i was surprised by how much they got away with although not completly faithful to the comics it had enough for my friend who knows nothing about venom except for spiderman 3 to follow and get it i loved it and cant wait for the sequel this one feels short but hey its a fun ride
Dec 18 2018,positive,liked it but didnt love it  you can see how the critics panned it but the real audience the people actually like it like myself  also the last cameo by stan lee rip  this is why i dont listen to critics like i used to in their hey day  of the eighties and nineties  they are so out of touch with the people  sad  used to like watching siskel and ebert at least they were consistent and kept an open mind  the critics these days are useless  blu ray for sure actually wished i had seen it in the theaters
Dec 18 2018,positive,if you are a fan of the true character of venom he is portrayed perfect in this movie its what any real venom fan would feel they nailed his persona ididnt even care hardy was in it venom stole the showthe critics just want a movie full of political bsvenom was not that
Dec 18 2018,positive,its a mess of a film with some really awful lines a boring villain and too much time spent without the symbiote yet somehow it still works and thats largely due to tom hardys performance as brockvenom the two together make for excellent buddy comedy and hardys puppeteered movements are flawless and hilarious that and a few fun action scenes not including the dcesque cgi finale are enough to pull it through
Dec 18 2018,positive,fun ride that harkens back to old school comic book movies 
Dec 18 2018,positive,impressive cgi and plot about origins of symboite left one wondering an eager for sequel 
Dec 18 2018,positive,loved it  fun popcorn movie 
Dec 18 2018,negative,tom hardytisk tisk youï 12 12 12tmre better than this was that an american ï 12 12 12accentï 12 12 12ï 12 12ï 12â kudos to the cgi team but voiceover gets an f and screenwriting gets a big fat ï 12 12 12fï 12 12 12ï 12 12ï 12â venom isnï 12 12 12tmt compassionate or empathetic michelle williams really why iï 12 12 12tmd rather watch topher graceï 12 12 12tms venom that should speak for itself
Dec 18 2018,positive,it was ok they should have spent more time working on the story than the special effects
Dec 18 2018,positive,i would recommend to any marvel fan
Dec 18 2018,positive,cant wait for carnage
Dec 18 2018,positive,awesome action packed
Dec 18 2018,positive,great movie very entertaining and fun for all ages
Dec 18 2018,positive,i was uncertain if i would like the movie due to all the negative comments i heard about this movie but i ended up liking it the way eddie and venom talk to each other was greatly done
Dec 18 2018,positive,this movie is fantastic  fullof actionalot of fun these so called criticsshodbeshot for dissing this movie some movies are just fun like venom  rott tomatoes needss  new critics
Dec 18 2018,positive,this movie is millennial humor to the t tom hardy is what we needed for venom it was everything i wanted out of the movie and the critics are really out of touch with the audience on this one
Dec 18 2018,neutral,marvel finally put out a movie that wasnt that great the cgi felt rushed the plot seemed like it was drawn out there were cool sound effect and graphics but it was a bit of a let down for me
Dec 18 2018,positive,the critics were wrong this movie is amazing 
Dec 18 2018,positive,slow start but great once it gets going new story line unless i assume you have read alot of the comics etc
Dec 18 2018,positive,awesome movie dont listen to the critics
Dec 18 2018,positive,no regrets watching the movie it just felt like it was missing something
Dec 18 2018,positive,i think if anyone disliked this moviei think it would also be likely they did not read the  comic the movie accurately captures venom the way he is portrayed in the comic and the reasons why he is loved  if you did like that venom how he is written in amazing spiderman then you will gush over this venom  its like a dream come true the way it was written and portrayed and they made it even better like how dark knight improved on batman ive been venom fan from the time he was created and the i feel like the critics do not grasp the skill of directorwriter and actor in capturing the nuances of the comic book character and the human aspects and the quirky awkwardness of eddie brock a misunderstood good guy suddenly gaining this strange and devastating power that he did not know what to do with that made this comic such a great read i hope they make many sequels without altering their writing and production by these awful criticisms  this movie truly captured the essence of venom unbelievably delightful thank you
Dec 18 2018,positive,the plot is fast and full of black hole tom hardy hard carried anyway
Dec 18 2018,positive,i came in with low expectations i would get a couple of laughs here and there and that would be it sure it lacks in depth a bit but it is very entertaining i await to obtain this on bluray so i may watch it again and again
Dec 18 2018,positive,if all of america didnï 12tmt have a crush on tom hardy this movie would be a flop
Dec 18 2018,positive,very entertaining good humor but not for the little ones cant wait to see woody
Dec 18 2018,positive,a fun and exciting ride great performances from the actors and an interesting retelling of the birth of the mighty venom i loved this movie and will watch it again and again
Dec 17 2018,positive,good film held back from greatness by obsessing over the rating if they had shot the same film and instead approached every scene saying  what is the most rewarding way this can be shot it would have been a much better film best example for people that have seen the film last head that gets bitten off the framing of the next shot needed the body for context and continuity but it strangely disappeared    needed a better plot but the character development of venom and his host was really well done except for the change in motive for venom    they are making a sequel and the directors outlook on how to treat venom is a wet blanket on the possibilities of this spinoff universe even though the film itself was enjoyable just reading about how they approached making it made me cringe if sony wont embrace the dark then the next film will already show declining interest
Dec 17 2018,positive,not a 5 star but it was a pretty decent movie good action scenes storyline didnt derail no connection with the character as the storyline was going kind of fast
Dec 17 2018,positive,honestly just fuck the critics man i mean i do like 2 critics chris stuckmann and jeremy jahns but honestly the critics went overboard with the hate man maybe because this film didnt fit into their sjw identitiy politics agenda anyways venom is an excellent film and an excellent comic book film it was very fast paced and it was mostly pretty funny i mean there were a couple of parts for me  not a lot but a couple   that seemed to be grasping for laughs but other than that small nitpick this film is great im giving this 4 and a half out of 5 stars
Dec 17 2018,positive,this is a romcom disguised as an action movie and professional critics are too cowardly to see that im ready to spend my entire paycheck buying this movie in multiple formats i saw it three times in theaters tom hardys acting was amazing venom was hot
Dec 17 2018,positive,this movie is one of these movies that really show a divide between the critics and the general audience  was venom a perfect movie no of course not no movie is perfect there were a few loose ends here and there and maybe a few slow moments the first half in particular was a bit long and the movie would have benefited from introducing venom earlier and yet despite it being far from perfect i decided to give it a perfect score because this movie managed to do all im asking from a movie it entertained me for the entire duration of its runtime see a movie doesnt have to be full of drama and contemporary questioning on the meaning of life and aesthetic shots to be a good movie maybe its because im easy to please maybe im a simpleminded fool but if the alternative is being critical of every single movie i watch to the point of not enjoying the simplest story anymore then id rather stay a fool
Dec 17 2018,negative,this shows why superhero movies are shit just the same story as all of the other worthless marvel movies   only reason this shit show gets any likes is because of the fan boys that doesnt care about the product just the brand
Dec 17 2018,positive,i watch anything with tom hardy love his acting
Dec 17 2018,positive,although i have not paid to watch this film the pirated copy i got from youtube was very poor quality the graphics all looked blocky and the audio did not sound studio quality watch at your own risk  
Dec 17 2018,positive,feelgood romcom of the year great fun
Dec 16 2018,positive,hilarious and fantastic the firs half hour is a little slow but after that is stellar i dont know why people dislike this and this is now my favourite marvel movie ive watched it 4 times now
Dec 16 2018,positive,good first venom movie excited to see what the future holds for this spiderverse
Dec 16 2018,positive,great combination of comedy and action the casts performance was great the only problem was that venom sometimes looks really weird because of the way they animated him  97
Dec 16 2018,positive,amazing movie highly recommend  saw it several times in theaters
Dec 16 2018,positive,enjoyable start to a franchise  not a literal adaptation but really well done movie  cant wait for carnage
Dec 16 2018,positive,critics have been a little hard on this movie for high expectation and in comparison with recent spiderman movie but all in all it is an entertaining movie which satisfies comics fans and moviegoers overall
Dec 16 2018,positive,the one thing you can say about this movie is that its much different than anything else in the genre a wild ride with a wonky lead tom hardy is a force and carries the movie all the way worth seeing for a good time
Dec 16 2018,positive,i thought this movie was pretty good but i thought they didnt explain his origin story the right way and how can venom go inside everyones body and when he exits there body they die but when he goes into eddies body and exits his body he doesnt die maybe everyones body isnt the right fit for venom and eddies body taste good who knows
Dec 16 2018,positive,my favourite scene of this movie was when venom admits he too is a loser on his home planet just like eddie is here on earth and the selfish change of heart into a antihero he is thats what makes this character special its as interesting as loki is in the mcu or deadpool to the xmen   i wasnt suprised with critics not liking the movie as the character is skewed and is morbid not in taste with maintream super hero characters   only reason why this movie failed a few points was script plots regarding any of the antagonists and a boring car chase scene that was unnecessary and slowed down the plot but the character moments between eddie and venom and anne aswell were all amazing that was where this all worked for me besides anyone else is not really a future sequel type character and had they invested a bit more time with carlton drakes character but as is enjoyable nonetheless 3 12 stars out of 5
Dec 16 2018,negative,not the best superhero movie of 2018 but at lease vemon cool
Dec 16 2018,positive,this was an amazing film anyone who is thinking of seeing this movie yet are on the fence due to some online reviews ignore them and see this movie if you are a fan of venom lethal protector then you will enjoy it int has action a well written plot and the characters are no cardboard like most movies i see anymore
Dec 16 2018,positive,although the movie is enjoyable tom hardy need to be serious in this role and leaves the jokes to the supporting actors actress and its better to target a more mature audience in the next one
Dec 16 2018,negative,easily one of the worst movies of 2018 you took what should have been a good story with a great actor and destroyed it for the fans 
Dec 16 2018,neutral,toothy made me think brock had blackouts every time the symbiote swallowed someone
Dec 16 2018,positive,venom is a interested movie and the visual effects are great
Dec 16 2018,positive,ok really silly plot but that is also its strength  this film is good because it is fun has humor and does not take itself seriously not pretentious and filled with grand social statements like black panther  entertaining first and foremost
Dec 16 2018,positive,amazing movie literarely 
Dec 16 2018,neutral,entertaining movie that seems to be completely discoupled from the infinity mcu interesting action scenes but several plot holes that make the movie unrealistic for the times is set even under the movie fantastic circumstances
Dec 16 2018,positive,awesome loved it must see
Dec 16 2018,negative,just when i thought suicide squad was the worst the modern age of comicbook films had to offer sony had the balls to say hold my drink
Dec 16 2018,positive,providing good experience
Dec 16 2018,positive,just like the venom character this movie has no business be as entertaining as it is
Dec 16 2018,negative,complet trashing of the original comic story on par with how stupid the mandarin was in iton man 3
Dec 16 2018,positive,i honestly was really hoping tom hardy will do 100 better than the actor in spiderman 3 and when i saw it my wish came true
Dec 16 2018,positive,i did not expect to like this film as much as i did it is one you really need to see on the big screen to appreciate i think it will surprise you i cant wait for the sequel
Dec 16 2018,positive,so much more potential but it was entertaining enough for a watch
Dec 15 2018,neutral,a movie that doesnt really know what it wants to be tom hardy seems to be acting in a different movie to everyone else a lot of the humour falls flat the dialogue is cringeworthy at times and the villian is your typical onedimensional cliche moustachetwirling type the final battle was just a cgi fest which i felt had no emotional weight to it at all overall an ok mindless popcorn movie id personally skip seeing it in the theatre and catch it on streaming when its out
Dec 15 2018,negative,terrible the dialogue is the worst ive heard in a long time
Dec 15 2018,positive,easily the biggest guilty pleasure in a long time i wasnt expecting much from this movie just a good time and thats exactly what i got the eddievenom conversations add a great level of humour is it a great movie no but there is something about it that just makes you have a good time it probably couldve benefited from an r rating but i aint against fun
Dec 15 2018,positive,i felt like they did venom mostly right excited for another one
Dec 15 2018,positive,thought it would be better script was a bit weak they made venoms dialogue sound goofy as fluff the villain did a terrible acting job it was not great watching cgi monsters fighting half the movie was not very fun
Dec 15 2018,positive,really liked this movie it was funny and i am eager to see more venom the critics are shit when it comes to actual good movies
Dec 15 2018,positive,such an amazing movie it was hilarious and  so addicting to watch it was a good introduction movie canï 12tmt wait for more to come out
Dec 15 2018,positive,liked the movie however i donï 12 12tmt like the end bits changing what iï 12 12tmve grown up with venomcarnage cool keep with the comics not new pc stuff original stuff pls
Dec 15 2018,positive,pleasantly surprised hardy keeps movie all together acting dialogue is awful but i caught myself being entertained drawn to the main character enjoy the silliness of the movie didnt take its self so serious 
Dec 15 2018,negative,âvenomâ is just one huge mess while the looks of the symbiote are surprisingly good the story characters pace acting and yes even the sounds are all excruciatingly bad pushing this film way way down in the ratings
Dec 15 2018,positive,very good movie relate able characters and amazing acting those 83 critics that rated this fresh know whats up
Dec 15 2018,negative,i suppose you have to be a big fan of the venom comics to appreciate this and even then were you not hoping for somethingmore not one interesting or relatable character in sight a really odd and awkward sense of humor action scenes by the numbers mediocre cgi of ridiculously silly creatures there is no level on which this works and worst of all this was a big hit and therell be more the marvel cinematic universe does play in entirely different leagues than this drivel
Dec 15 2018,positive,its good if you understand whats  going on not if youre just seeing it to see tom
Dec 15 2018,neutral,venom is a very bad movie but for reasons i cant really explain its fun
Dec 15 2018,positive,wow great graphics and good story this is realy good i want to see venom 2 now
Dec 15 2018,positive,not as bad as everybody makes out theres some questionable scenes and dialog but its a film that zips along    main gripes is why does venoms head appear when talking to tom just stick with the voiceover and how come riot can body jump with ease but the others cant    for a similar film but better made watch upgrade instead    one last thing this should have been r rated
Dec 15 2018,positive,cool but predictable most people always predict marvel to make something predictable other than that they couldve gone two ways with the symbiote venom they could have made him really creepy and powerful or they could have made him a funny kind of goofy venom and again im not surprised that they went with the latter venom is not the best movie ever made but i liked it because i like superhero movies and venom was always one of my favorite antiheroes
Dec 15 2018,negative,nobody says that cliches and tropes must always a bad movie make and nobody says that a comic book adaptation that takes liberties with the character cant succeed however venom is a pile of bad jokes comic book film tropes and eyeroll inducing comedic misfires youll ask yourself at some point is eddie brock on the spectrum not because of the symbiote that he talks to but because of the choices tom hardy makes in playing the character by the time the film was reaching its climatic confrontation between venom and whatever the villain was called riot i guess i was reaching for my phone the way a person does when theyre trying to kill time waiting for their oil change to be completed
Dec 15 2018,negative,its 2018 and the animations were bad and tom hardy should just stick to minimal speaking rolls baneeames
Dec 15 2018,positive,i thought the movie did well for what it was would have liked to see some stronger scenes to get higher rating but in no way does this movie deserve the rating its gotten it is definitely worth more than 28 on the tomatometer i used to take this sites word for gold back in the day but seeing that rating idk what to think
Dec 15 2018,negative,terrible writing flimsy and shallow characters and cgi that just looks cheap spawn was way better and that was what 20 years ago
Dec 15 2018,neutral,i really really enjoyed watching this movie but it was really really flawed in every department also please dont cut an r rated movie to make it pg 13 not a good idea 
Dec 15 2018,positive,i have something to say about this film that no one else wants to admit movies nowadays are all just a single genre may it be actionromanceor even comedywellthis movie has it all all of the people rating the movie as a disaster arent getting mad about the movie it is because this film is actually goodand different and that they are mad that this film didnt meet their specific criteria about this movie that we all have dreamt about that being saidthis film was awesome and definitely worth buying and watching again
Dec 15 2018,positive,fun movie with lot of plot holes
Dec 14 2018,positive,truly sad that critics are so quick to downplay a genre that they clearly dont understand venom was a lighthearted take on the typical superhero trope by any means this is a love story and its lightness sets the tone so not to be taken too serious loved every last second of it as most did
Dec 14 2018,negative,the second screen iteration of my favorite spiderman villain  after the travesty that was 2007s spider man 3 gives us a movie that honestly should have been made 10 years ago  thats how bad this movie is it would have fit in perfectly in this old cinematic world of spidey where campy as fuck action and lines was acceptable and the norm    frankly im amazed at how a turd like this could get made  shout out to the movies trailer for putting that word back into my vocabulary  especially considering we live in a time of great comic book movies    tom hardy is easily the best part of this as his often scared and apologetic demeanor after bonding with venom and being completely taken off guard by the powers he now possesses is funny and both exhilarating problem is is that it really only makes up for  a third of the movie    the supporting cast is heartbreaking as oscar winner michelle williams and riz  ahmed are given a brutal script full of corny as hell unfunny one liners that try so hard to be funny that you could hear eyes rolling after they were delivered like these are two a list actors three including tom hardy who i think is one of the best actors working today and watching them try to salvage this movie is soul crushing    someone said to me the other day do you watch porn for the plot or those big ass symbiote titties and hey i wish those and the action could have saved this movie but unfortunately when all was said and done this hour and 40 minutes was painful  symbiote titties aside heres to hoping the sequel actually tries harder  hoping you go spend your money on first man a star is born bad times at the el royale  or fuck  even goosebumps 2 this weekend just not on this    grade  c 
Dec 14 2018,negative,while i loved the dynamic between eddie and venom it just felt kinda like a drag and i was sometimes even bored in the action scenes which isnt good for a movie like this
Dec 14 2018,positive,i actually really enjoyed this contrary to what i heard it was expecting
Dec 14 2018,positive,i love tom hardy but i think he doesnt portray a good broc there could have been more building of the relationship between broc and the symbiote but they dedicated almost about a hour of screen time to the selfloathing broc and carlton drake company life foundation where his management skills are not believable lol
Dec 14 2018,positive,this movie was fun from start to finish venom definitely became a lovable character by the end
Dec 14 2018,neutral,much like venom i fed off of tom hardys charisma id watch a full movie of him talking to himself
Dec 14 2018,positive,very fun movie but a few sloppy editing and story elements
Dec 14 2018,neutral,venom sonys nonspiderman spiderman film is a total mess that while entertaining doesnt really work  when disgraced investigative reporter eddie brock sneaks into the labs of carlton drake he ends up getting attacked by and bonding with an alien symbiote and is soon mercilessly pursued by drakes security forces who are intend on recovering the alien  tom hardy gives a fairly good performance as brock but hes kind of a hard character to get a handle on  and the story is rather convoluted and stupid pushing a lot of environmentalist and anticapitalist propaganda  the action sequences add some energy to the film and are pretty exciting yet there really arent any stakes as the aliens are pretty much invincible  darker than the typical marvel movie venom has a lot of problems and not much going for it
Dec 14 2018,negative,this is most bizarre movie which i have this year beside pretador 2018 part if you want to watch it then just do watch for yom hardy and venom action pathetic story no characters explained and in simple words they just made the movie to make money despartely need sipder man to get this movie right on top bside that venom character needs alot of improvement as well
Dec 14 2018,positive,nice fun movie despite the critics said when im here in rotten tomatoes i always check what is audience score not critics critics can be bought but not us
Dec 14 2018,negative,very crappy movie can i give it a half star
Dec 14 2018,positive,great superhero movie venom is a fun actioncomedy comicbook movie that makes you crave more cant wait for the sequel
Dec 14 2018,negative,the movie sucked because it was nothing like the comics and the actions was just random
Dec 14 2018,positive,it depends on how you look at the movie if you want an amazing venom movie then this probably isnt the one for you if you just want a good movie well then id recommend giving this a shot i like to watch it as just a movie and not a venom movie so that its easier to watch so it really all depends on what you want from this movie
Dec 14 2018,neutral,sort of fun tom hardy is the saving grace
Dec 14 2018,positive,i dont know why people didnt like this i loved it omg i was dying 
Dec 14 2018,positive,the plot and scene setting are really similar to spidet man the director tries to add some humor factor in the film and combine with the fantsy action it is not really successful but he made it even if its not a amazing or fantastic movie it also worth to watch it especially the end of movie made me so touched
Dec 14 2018,positive,an enjoyable terrible film that nails all you want from venom
Dec 14 2018,positive,i found it amazing it was great fun and tom hardy as venom makes up for the topher grace fiasco rather nicely its a new story but it feels true to the actual source material
Dec 14 2018,positive,not the best marvel movie but better than a lot of others
Dec 13 2018,positive,despite the low rating some people gave i beg to differ yes the plot was a little rushed even the character development but i fell in love with eddie and venoms chemistry on screen that is all idgaf
Dec 13 2018,negative,im a pretty big fan of the character and i just found the whole thing to be pretty stupid  tom hardy is the bright spot and seems to be the only one interested in being in this movie  all that said i did laugh quite a bit mostly at stuff not intended to be funny and venom looked pretty great  the post credits scene does give me some hope for the inevitable sequel
Dec 13 2018,positive,venom is a bad movie no doubt but its also an extremely fun one it has a particular strangeness that doesnt appear so often it maybe should have benefited from an r rating to better the story but the end result is still so fun and bonkers that it has to be appreciated
Dec 13 2018,positive,worth a watch if only they made it along the lines of logan and made it a hard r rating we can only hope for the sequel to be more gory and fun
Dec 13 2018,positive,its sooooo under rated its not dumb or trash its really good
Dec 13 2018,positive,loved the movie it was perfectly acted and was a great attribute to the venom series  really disappointed it wasnt r rated and went down that path as his character is comedic dark
Dec 13 2018,positive,beware post from russia with love but with much of mistakes  was so angry with its rating from criticsits not fairlooking at the horrible black panther with rating 90  venom perhaps the best film of the year for me the only one that i reviewed 5 times its cutedynamic and sexy now almost movies have so many clichethere are no interesting plot lines in them everything is beaten and understandablewe get something like oh the main character has a girlfriend they want to get marriedaw she is offendedeverything going wrong and in the end she will be with the main character and that will be typical trash happy endvery pleased with the lack of a love lineits very very boringthats dont give me an emotion while watching   venom looks nice fun and most importantly it gives emotions while watching of course i cant imagine what the film would do without the brilliant game of srtom hardy      and i really liked the sony pr company of it dvd release is brilliant only after understanding that the film gave on this hints i wanted to rewatch it i would very hopethat  sony will stay on course for a love affair in an identical situation in real life there would have been no other option  eddie and his alien together all timeso  why do they need third personfor what  in the comics we see how eddie loves venom calls him dear darling my love it would be cool to see something similar fresh and hot at cinemas in a sequel maybe marrieage of anne and drdannot with the main charactereddiejesus ch not traditional  couplewhich fell to each other more than familyhuman brain is fragile a person gets used quickly so imagine that this someone is always with youevery second        it 2018 shape of water does not afraid to show something unique but honestly i did not have sympathy for these characters i hope venom could find its unique nicheand can become the only one in the genre      this part not perfectits have typical movie stereotypes but they are not annoying despite the fact that the ending was clear from the beginning the dynamics of the relationships of venom and eddie  i can look at it endlessly a wonderful revelation of the character a very reverent attitude to the universe as a whole big up received such emotions  thank you
Dec 13 2018,negative,had potential if only they had not made such an idiot of the symbiont
Dec 13 2018,negative,boring doesnt represent the comic venor well
Dec 13 2018,positive,the plot is a little cliche and the villain is weak but tom hardy gives a charismatic performance as eddie brockvenom and there are some good action scenes and it makes for a flawed but entertaining movie
Dec 13 2018,negative,i dont like it as a comic fan i dont like the way of venom character is treated he most have to be more obscure and evil
Dec 13 2018,negative,this movie is a dumpster fire that is not a venom movie it is a romantic comedy that turns into a transformer film that also somehow makes me hate tom hardy and venom
Dec 13 2018,positive,this was a fun and funny movie  i loved how both eddy and venom were opposing each other at first but as they grew to know each other that both characters changed by the end eddy wasnt a hero who sacrificed himself for others but venom isnt crazed killer they find mutual ground and are able to work in a tentative alliance the female venom is stunning as well too many people based mouth this film and as such im making an account just for this review the movie isnt avengers but its a good movie and you should watch it yourself
Dec 13 2018,positive,not great and pretty hokey at times still enjoyed some of the dynamics of the origin but definitely needed spiderman to anchor the story
Dec 13 2018,negative,thought venom has some major plot holes and cringeworthy cgi it manages to provide a fresh breeze to the superhero movie genre however some of the punsplotlines seem forceful and boring to me it got some good performances from hardywilliams and fun elements but seemingly lacks of a clear message  goal its not a bad film its intriguing and quite entertaining     i cringed so bad after hearing the infamous wilhelm scream stock effect lol like its already 2018 seriously
Dec 13 2018,positive,great movie with a great story line the start of the movie took a little long to set the story but after it was all action packed and the story line was smooth a great addition to the marvel series and i cant wait for the sequel
Dec 13 2018,negative,i dont know how they managed to make the venom movie so plain and boring but they did what a lame movie
Dec 13 2018,positive,venom is the greatest marvel movie of alltime fuck avengers endgame venom 2 i need
Dec 13 2018,positive,best depiction of comic book
Dec 13 2018,neutral,for this movie i used the trick that i used with the predator i started watching with really low expectations for the latter however did not work for two main reasons 1 was amazingly awful 2 me and the character had a past together venom for me is new as i was not really familiar with the comic and i wanted it to like it because it looks amazingly cool and because it was creating a symbiotic bond with a bloody good actor also i loved riz ahmed in the series the night of and i was waiting to see more of him all this just to explain that i was really looking forward to see this film and that was difficult for me not to like it well they almost manage to do so the film is not terrible but it never take a stand it starts very clichey and disappointing but the action scenes are good and hardy does his best with the cards he has been dealt again i wouldnt call it a good movie but i did not feel the need to take my eyes out like after watching the predator either if the sequels  have a better and more elaborate story and they find the right tone to it it could find its place in the expanded marvel universe after all
Dec 13 2018,positive,it was a good movie entertainmend in the whole movie
Dec 12 2018,positive,i was put off by the reviews when it was in theaters but gave it a shit at home and actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie the concept was fun it was a little slow at first could have chipped out 5 minutes of introduction to the character but i wont take a star away would definitely see the next one carnage
Dec 12 2018,positive,these critics must be smoking crack one of the best movies ever
Dec 12 2018,positive,i love the cinematography and the relationship development between eddie and venom i donï 12 12 12tmt understand the critics reading on this van iï 12 12 12tmm does not need to follow spiderman completely i think itï 12 12 12tms good to develop venom so we understand him which will make more sense when spiderman is introduced into his story
Dec 12 2018,positive,amazing movie critics are wrong
Dec 12 2018,positive,loved it so funny and very entertaining till the end
Dec 12 2018,positive,i guess it must be an advantage in many cases to have never read marvel comics and just watches their superhero films on their own only with connections shown within the film or the credits themselves  i didnt recall any connection between spiderman and venom  in fact i wasnt sure it was a marvel film at all until the flipping pages showed up during the opening credits    so as far as i was concerned it was a standalone film  i also ignore most critics reviews  and buy them based on box office returns andor trailers andor the short synopsis on vudu im disabled and have to wait for digital copy releases although i buy some 4k and 3d discs    i thought venom was great  far more entertaining to me than the kind of depressing and downer black panther  i enjoyed the way the plot and relationships developed in the first half was stunnedconfused by the venom characters initially evil overtones  and ended up lmao as he learned how to be a good guy  was it a mess or chaotic as so many have claimed  not to me and again  i think thats where the ignorance of comic book tieins may be a huge advantage  in comparison i though guardians 2 was a messy chaotic and confusing film that undoubtedly does require additional information to understand or follow  but to me venom was an action film a monster movie and weirdly twisted buddy actioncomedy in one very entertaining package
Dec 12 2018,positive,its super fun i enjoy the whole time in the cinema
Dec 12 2018,positive,critics got it wrong
Dec 12 2018,positive,so i have seen venom got bad reviews and im curious what this based on because i watched it like most movies that get bad reviews and thought it was a good movie andrew now because some people paid to write what they think about a movie that was not for them wrote something bad they probably will not make another and this sux if they are basing it on ticket sales i would understand because my son is 8 and thought it was a scary movie and didnt watch it so maybe they didnt have the younger view sales so it got bad reviews idk but someone is a bad judge of movies because i be seen a handful of bad reviewed movies i thought were great thanks for your time sinserly a avid movie watcher
Dec 12 2018,positive,not great but certainly a entertaining few hours at the movies 
Dec 12 2018,positive,i feel like yeah they should have probably pushed for rated r all things considered if you allow yourself to submerge yourself into someones own artistic take on a character you will be surprised with what you find  i enjoyed the movie and feel the character development was great  if you spent your time paying attention to the story instead of thinking of what your gonna say about certain parts later to sound like an expert for click bait you saw a driven story even under the restraints of being pg13  think you for another great installment into the marvel cinematic universe
Dec 12 2018,positive,a slow start but it gets good 13 the way in fun and funny
Dec 12 2018,positive,better than captain america winter soldier a
Dec 12 2018,negative,just into these type of were did the villain come from movie its bland like a unsalted potato and boring 2018 action like all other marvel and dc movies have in it
Dec 12 2018,positive,me and every single one of my friends who watched it loved the movie this movie is proof that i must never take rotten tomatoes opinion critics seriously
Dec 12 2018,negative,shockingly bad should never have been made
Dec 12 2018,positive,venom is actually a solid movie it isnt as great as its box office would suggest while it isnt terrible either as the critics trashed it way too harshly the action is simply terrible for the most part and uninteresting for me the villain is disposable and the entire first act though well crafted is a dull overly prolonged origin story however the characters mostly worked for me the humor is very entertaining in the symbiotes cheesy oneliners tom hardy is reliably terrific in the main role and the relationship between eddie brock and venom is superb
Dec 12 2018,positive,definitely the weakest role of tom hardy 
Dec 12 2018,positive,i actually quite liked it itâtms impossible to think it would have been better being in the mcu with everything that that brings tighter script better jokes better cgi etc but it exceeded my very low expectationsmostly due to hardy having such huge screen presence
Dec 12 2018,positive,firstim really like this movie that chang of relationship between venom and eddiesecondlyits plot is smoothbright and finallyits a qualified popcorn movie
Dec 12 2018,positive,venoms critic reviews had me skeptical about how good it was going to be but seemingly all of those whiners had a crummy day before going to see it because the rest of the general population including myself thought it was awesome almost every yearnedfor marvel trait is there action suspense ingenuity humor wit and a top quality frantic performance from tom hardy venom succeeds where others have failed with only a few imperfections regarding some juvenile dialogue
Dec 11 2018,positive,this movie was awesome and im my opinion critics dont know how to rate superhero movies
Dec 11 2018,positive,great movie loved it much better than i expected
Dec 11 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie he is the worst reporter ever but he and venom have a cute relationship
Dec 11 2018,positive,tom hardy was really good in this surprisingly funny and relatable there were obviously cheesy bits and confusing plot points but it was entertaining and watching hardys performance was really fun he sold it  imo
Dec 11 2018,positive,although the movie has its share of flaws it is a very entertaining film and i highly recommend it to everyone
Dec 11 2018,neutral,average i liked the bond they made at the end of the movie but other than than didnt like anything particular about this film
Dec 11 2018,positive,i wasnt the biggest marvel fan before but this movie was my wakeup call very absorbing and enjoyable giving you all the feels and experiences and the welltoned plot makes for an even better chemistry now making venom not only my favorite marvel character but also my top favorite movie both like no other
Dec 11 2018,positive,this was an okay movie i was excited for it and i am glad that they tried to give eddie brock his own movie so that we could sympathize for him a little however this could have been amazing but it was just mediocre
Dec 11 2018,positive,venom is a lot of fun to watch however it is not the most memorable the plot was very simple and the pacing was a little off but overall a very enjoyable movie nothing about it screamed negative and there wasnt a time in the movie where i felt bored the villain was decent but also forgettable the relationship between venom and eddie worked well but there were a few plot holes and simplistic story telling that showed that the movie had been cut a little the movie did the most with the pg13 rating it was given delivering a great experience that felt like venom without being able to show too much but it could have benefited from a rrating tom hardy was the right choice for eddievenom and venom looked very accurate to his comicbook counterpart and delivered a voice for him that felt like venom overall venom exceeded my expectations which were low and made me feel good about it when leaving the theater
Dec 11 2018,positive,the film could have been better but overall ive enjoyed it
Dec 11 2018,negative,this movie sucked bad cgi horrible acting and action if it says in association with marvel just stay away
Dec 11 2018,negative,fun movie but whats up with the pacing it seems like i would watch a series every 4th episode the changes of tone and missing context kill the whole movie
Dec 11 2018,positive,the critics are idiots venoms standalone movie is just that a standalone it doesnt need any attachment to spiderman at all they made a good movie sticking fairly close to the source material and when others would add in spider man to bring in extra fans they made the antagonist some one else
Dec 11 2018,positive,its just an entertaining movie thats it
Dec 11 2018,positive,the character of venom is complex and sony had  ruined it once but have redeemed their trust with the viewers againbut overall the movie had a huge pacing issue as one plot element and is thrown off immediately for another one it feels like you are watching hideo kojima trailer that is a bit stretchedthe interaction of eddie and venom is great but the adversary is half bakedriz ahmed is good actor but has wasted his time hereon the other hand tom hardy fits into the role  but the characters around himnot so muchaction sequences are good but shortenedcgi aspect of the movie is amazingi expected more from the storythe case is similar to bvs
Dec 11 2018,positive,its funny at times would be better at a r rating but was still fun and had some good action and a good connection with the symbiote and eddie
Dec 11 2018,positive,this was surprisingly fun and entertaining the reviews were mostly bad among the comments tom hardy mumbles throughout the movie well hardy always mumbles and that has never prevented me from enjoying his performances i liked the backstory as for venom i rooted for himit more and more as the movie progressed if you love fun marvel movies like thor ragnarok you will enjoy venom 
Dec 11 2018,positive,look i know it isnt perfect and it seems to have a dual personality as a film but if you look past the bad dark superhero movie it was trying to be and see the funny dark comedy of a superhero movie it was also trying to be well heck it is really fun and enjoyable id watch a sequel id love to see eddie and venom synced up perfectly
Dec 11 2018,neutral,tom hardy makes this movie fun
Dec 11 2018,positive,overall tom hardy is awesome as a director and actor cheers
Dec 11 2018,negative,it was entertaining for the most part could have been better if it was rated r like originally planned even tom hardy said they cut a good chunk of the movie that were his favorite scenes 
Dec 11 2018,positive,destined to be a cult classic the critic vs audience currently 2885 already has it there scorewise as someone not emotionally invested in the comic book lineage of these superhero or antihero as it may be  flicks i thought this was hilarious its a bad movie with excellent humour from venombrock i didnt expect that going in so it was a nice surprise to find myself laughing out loud at some of the back and forth were talking low hanging fruit here folks but the tone and timing of the quips is what hit the spot id pay money to watch a brockvenom comedy series
Dec 10 2018,negative,story was on rails cliche predictable plot bad acting lame cg sony just doesnt get it the only thing that helped me through it was tom hardys performance 
Dec 10 2018,positive,i wanted to see a film about venom and thats what i got it was fun to watch and i enjoyed it i would recommend to fans
Dec 10 2018,positive,in an age where the most popular contemporary films are big screen adaptations of some of the most popular comic book story arcs from the 80s90s venom really does almost absolutely nothing new his origin story is a little twisted from the comics as anyone familiar with the content would know and for me venoms only redeeming quality is that they did not make the titular character 100 heroic plenty of action sequences and hardy is his usual charming smartmouthed self not a great film but if you enjoy the genre youll watch it again just like i will
Dec 10 2018,positive,i really love it i dont expected thad
Dec 10 2018,positive,venom is my favorite marvel characters
Dec 10 2018,negative,a cinecomic that try to approch the style of  marvel studios but fail   forced humor is one of the biggest flaws of this film   the effects are not bad at all
Dec 10 2018,negative,theres always been this desire by a certain generation of spiderman fans to see the webslingers villain venom portrayed on the big screen in the effortlessly cool yet terrifyingly fun way he was presented in both the comics and the nineties animated series that devoted an entire stretch of episodes to the stan lee and avi aradcreated story titled the venom saga venoms popularity has always been about little more than how cool the character looks as there is little else of actual depth to the character beyond the fact its a sludge from space that requires a host to bond with for its survival in the comics venom became most notable as one of spidermans archenemies after peter parker realized the insidious nature of what was referred to as the symbiote and trashed the suit only for the symbiote to then join with a second host eddie brock in the animated series brock was a wellmeaning guy looking for his big break who just so happened to view parker as a rival reporter needless to say in joining with the symbiote and becoming venom brock inherited the aliens enhanced abilities and felt a power for the first time in his life he wasnt going to readily give up so one can see howdespite the rather artificial intrigues of the symbiote in and of itself thatonce this liquidlike form joins with a human host who has their own personality and problems things might become more complicated and therefore more dramatically interesting right well consider that and then consider the fact director ruben fleischer zombieland gangster squad and screenwriters jeff pinker scott rosenberg and kelly marcel only have about half of those source material ideas to work with in order to create a fulllength feature around the character this is what 2018s venom was tasked with and thus why it turns out to be a mostly forgettable bmonster movie made in the vein of sam raimis original liveaction spiderman but with none of the fun or genuine thrills that movie packed in its a repurposed spiderman origin story but with a symbiote instead of a radioactive arachnid where the individual blessed andor cursed with these powers has to figure out how to control them and then decide how to use them for good seriouslyvenom the symbiote likes to bites heads off but tom hardys eddie brock is an outandout good guy with no shades of moral conflict leaving the film itself to not be the interesting antihero tale it billed itself to be but instead feels like a recycled spiderman movie from an alternate universe where the symbiote was brought to a world where peter parker doesnt exist at least for the time being and the titular character becomes by default the hero of the story in other unfortunate words venom adds nothing to these tropes audiences have seen countless times over the last two decades but is all the worse for it due to the promise of being a real scoundrels story    read the whole review at 
Dec 10 2018,positive,solid start better than expected so looking forward to next edition 
Dec 10 2018,positive,i dont know what to say other than this was amazing sure it wasnt the best but it definitely was not as bad as critics make it out to be this film made me laugh endlessly while managing to keep a serious tone definitely worth the watch
Dec 10 2018,positive,strengths the trailer for this movie was a huge success for one major reason the final shot of venom thatâtms because it looked fantastic and honestly most of this movie follows suit the main character is done with tremendous special effects work making for one of the more visually stunning superhero characters in film history tom hardy eddie brockvenom is pretty fun as the lead even if he is completely weird the action scenes are mostly well executed and with the film clocking in under two hours it never feels long once it gets going it moves along nicely due to some solid pacing for a pg13 take they managed to still deliver some violent scenes who canâtmt enjoy venom just biting the heads off bad guys    weaknesses the plot is super uneven venom goes from wanting to take over the world to deciding to stick around and save it simply because he likes eddie itâtms hollow and doesnâtmt have a strong enough motivation behind it we never feel that the eddievenom bond has become that strong making that chance of pace come from out of nowhere more time couldâtmve been spent establishing it the acting by most of the cast is pretty lackluster michelle williams anne weying lacks chemistry with hardy riz ahmed carlton drakeriot is over the top and jenny slate dora skirth is not believable the script doesnâtmt do any favors because the dialogue is cheesy and never feels real    overall iâtmm no fool while i enjoyed this movie it has plenty of flaws i know itâtms not great however sometimes i just want to have some campy wacky fun since this movie isnâtmt too long it manages to enjoyable throughout
Dec 10 2018,negative,no just no the story is an absolute mess with the director trying desperately hard to cover it with lame action scenes worse is the whole thing is simply too predictable did they even actually read the comics now thats not the worst yet theyve taken a villain and made him a whiney good guy what
Dec 10 2018,positive,do not believe the critics   its a really good over the top comic book film some of the dialogue is a bit ropey but the lines between eddie  venom are funny   if i had one complaint its that its not dark enough  its watchable and i was entertained
Dec 10 2018,positive,venom is well below marvel standards but with a stan lee cameo and a hilarious script this movie is definitely worth watching critics are known to be harsh but i believe they went a little too far with venom giving it a 28 when it deserved much better sure the story was uneven and the cgi was poorly executed but it doesnt change the fact that venom is immensely entertaining and enjoyable till the credits roll besides who wouldnt betray their planet for tom hardy if the sequel foreshadowed in the postcredit scene is indeed happening i for one will be on the lookout for it
Dec 10 2018,positive,wow no wonder the critics hated it  no pc or identity politics crap  no orange man is bad  no all white men are evil   all the things needed to appease the bottom feeding critics seem to be missing hence their hatred of it for that alone it is worth 5 stars  this was a surprisingly good movie if not a bit slow to start but once it got going it was a fun ride  on the whole i think sony have done a good job with this iteration of venom along with a decent job of the story arc most films that pitch the bad vs the bigger bad tend to leave us thinking meh however this movie seems to be rare in the fact that venoms story of why is believable you do need to overlook why venom still looks like spiderman even when spiderman is nowhere to be seen but that is easily done unless you just want something to hate on  i would be happy to see a second movie and hope they do at least one more before maybe a crossover with marvelsonys spiderman
Dec 10 2018,neutral,pretty crap venom was presented more like human without his characteristics attributes
Dec 10 2018,positive,good movie with some comedy 
Dec 10 2018,positive,as usual it looks like im the minority here  i loved this film took a long while to get started but i liked the set up too many films rush into the action without giving the characters a chance to get themselves known on the screen once the symbiote was introduced i liked the way the relationship grew together with one of them hardening  up and one of them softening creating a useful whole as any good symbiotic relationship should be hope theres more of this as i think it has a lot of mileage
Dec 10 2018,positive,this great movie is lots of fun with just a little bit of everything
Dec 10 2018,negative,the worst comicbased film in quite a while poor characters bad script terrible pacing and mediocre casting choices make this movie as much fun as pulling teeth
Dec 9 2018,positive,best marvel movie ive seen in years not cheesy at all just a solid movie with a good mix of humor and seriousness something marvel does not generally do well my girlfriend is a huge marvel fan and i was reluctant to see it but i was glad i did 55 would recommend
Dec 9 2018,positive,this movie is not the flashy type of movie were used to seeing from marvel tom hardy is an excellent actor and i enjoyed his contortions throughout the movie there is no hero in this movie although youre rooting for venom as if he was i would recommend this movie and i will watch the next movie that comes out in this series
Dec 9 2018,negative,makes no effort to be independent of other films with some parts of the acting being really bad especially the scene when he talks to his x girlfriend outside his former apartment there is no real emotion shown but gain points for the cool bits being shown
Dec 9 2018,negative,had massive hopes for this the trailer looked incredible the acting storyline and plot was a massive let down
Dec 9 2018,negative,this film is bad but it just has that funny bad that you can actually pull through the whole film without money being wasted but if it wasnt for tom hardys performance this would have been a terrible film as usual he saved what could of been a turd in the wind
Dec 9 2018,positive,i thought that this movie was amazing the humor the action was all great i was skeptical at first because of the bad ratings but i was so happy i saw it venom is probably in my top 5 movies of the year i would definitely see this again
Dec 9 2018,negative,not sure what the writers were thinking on this one or what happened rather the beginning was quite good entertaining even then it quickly fell apart into a rushed mess which led toward the credits
Dec 9 2018,positive,wow that was almost everything i wanted after venom was announced in sp3  how they made such an enjoyable movie after making such crap before is unbelievable
Dec 9 2018,neutral,this was a film with impressive visuals captivating action sequences effective acting and an energetic score from ludwig göransson on the other hand there were some major pacing issues in the first half of the film multiple scenes felt directionless and completely without meaning there were also some imbalances with the films approach to humor some instances were dark gritty and intimidating yet in other scenes that followed there were attempts at comedy that felt flat and out of place if done correctly amusement can serve its place in a film with an otherwise dark tone however this is a fine line to walk venom did not efficiently master this tightrope overall the negatives of this film outweighed its positive components based on my judgements
Dec 9 2018,negative,poor take on the character was not interested during the film good job elektra your movie moved up
Dec 9 2018,positive,this isnt an amazing film the rating of the film doesnt allow it do justice to the character of venom however tom hardy does do an amazing job as always id check it out if youre looking for a goofy comic book flick and tom hardy is always a win
Dec 9 2018,positive,i actually really loved it even though the beginning was slow but once eddie got venom it began to be awesome especially when riot and venom fought
Dec 9 2018,positive,solid movie as long as you can stand the omission of spiderman 
Dec 9 2018,positive,this was fucking hilarious i loved it
Dec 9 2018,positive,the only downside is the bit misogyny but the movie is good i donât understand rotten tomatoes reviews is someone paying you for the reviews seriously
Dec 9 2018,negative,its not my favorite marvel movie ive ever seen but it is my least favorite congratulations to elektra for finally moving up from the bottom spot
Dec 9 2018,positive,while not the best marvel film ive seen so far venom is a pleasant flick combining scifi action with superhero elements to make for a film thats a little different from your average marvel movie its funny and serious at the same time and tom hardy gives a very memorable lead performance alongside with michelle williams its everything youd expect from a big budget cgi fueled loud mainstream antihero pic and while its not flawless its a decent film that entertained me and im curious to see what the sequel will be like recommended
Dec 9 2018,positive,i went to this movie with low expectations but it was surprisingly well done i dig the humor and the pg13 violence was appropriate villain was a bit underwhelming tom hardys performance was solid i hope to see a sequel
Dec 9 2018,positive,this was an awesome moviesome of it kept you on edgesome of it had you screaming cant wait till the 2nd one to come out
Dec 8 2018,positive,loved it the action was amazing itâtms one of this movies you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it tom hardy is amazing in this film
Dec 8 2018,positive,very entertaining tom hardy does a phenomenal job with venom
Dec 8 2018,positive,good and great movie and i love it
Dec 8 2018,positive,these so called critics know absolutely jack about entertainment and acting yes some of the effects are a bit average but the story is stand alone which is a good thing not everything is about spiderman jesus get a life and let other characters thrive  some of us are bored of the wimpy turned muscly dogooders which have never reflected real people
Dec 8 2018,positive,very underated movie
Dec 8 2018,positive,venom delivers an incredible slow build that fails to deliver a climax worthy of such a slow burn tom hardy  as great an actor as he is  falls flat in his role as eddie brock leaving the comicbook persona far behind for this original version that tries too hard to be comedic and relateable it simply does not live up to the high expectations set by the mcu or the rest of sony picturesits not a bad film and the special effects are excellent but it does not provide much watch value
Dec 8 2018,positive,enjoyable and funny throughout critics got this very wrong 
Dec 8 2018,positive,i thought it was really good i liked the attachment between venom and eddie and venoms comedic side
Dec 8 2018,positive,enjoyed it more than i thought i would
Dec 8 2018,positive,its a good movie the critics were exaggerating tom hardys performance is as awesome as always worth to watch
Dec 8 2018,positive,enjoyable but hardy doesnt seem to fit the bill here not superhero material as i see
Dec 7 2018,positive,this was an interesting movie for me i mainly went because my son wanted to go i wasnt that excited well it is a really great movie we were both thoroughly entertained great special effects and loved the story a very different type of comic character cant wait for the next one i say go see it
Dec 7 2018,positive,loved it so much i saw it twice
Dec 7 2018,positive,amazing movie dont listen to any rotten critics this movie really made me beat my meat
Dec 7 2018,neutral,cheesy predictable script a total waste of tom hardy  michelle williams talent though i have to say they did save the movie with the onscreen rapport the rest is just overcgi crap you could find in any other action movie snoozefest even the cameo from stan lee could not save this one
Dec 7 2018,positive,the movie was great you have to keep in mind this is stand alone venom and not spiderman venom great actor selection for eddie  the flow of going from action horror and comedy is great it handles the changes from one to the other fluidly definitely can not wait for the next release
Dec 7 2018,negative,a funny venom that is not like comics a lot of deus ex machina during the film
Dec 7 2018,positive,great performances visuals and action but a little messy tone and too fast paced
Dec 6 2018,positive,waited so long to see it just because of stupid critic reviews some movies are supposed to be just fun and audiences are bored of the same boring formula used by marvel and dc movies venom is a breath of fresh air  entertaining
Dec 6 2018,positive,for those of us who dont read comics it is a little slow to start but does get going i liked it would have liked more banter between venom and eddie but over all if you fancy having a few beersbottle of wine some chocolate and just watching a movie where you dont have to think to much about the plot this is a good choice
Dec 6 2018,positive,not a bad movie not a great movie but worth watching tom hardy is very entertaining in the role 
Dec 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the plot was amazing and the characters really grow on you
Dec 5 2018,positive,i think the movie is awesome and the critics are idiots
Dec 5 2018,negative,it took me 1 month to finally watch this movie and god was it awful the pacing was terrible the plot was meh characters other than eddie were poorly written and their chemistry on screen was horrible complete scenes were useless cgi didnt even look good honestly the trailer was better than the whole movie certainly out there with the worsts superhero movies of all time
Dec 5 2018,positive,this movie was highly underrated and totally bombed by the critics but it is one of the better tellings of the venom story
Dec 5 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Dec 5 2018,positive,totally worth the watch fun and awesome experience trough and through
Dec 5 2018,positive,pretty good just took to long to get to the point but a good watch 
Dec 5 2018,positive,this is the movie of the year for all the wrong reasons the movie is funny has good action strong well defined characters and it seems like they all know their roles and how to play them even venom the star of the film is charismatic and makes you love him even when he is a villain this move is definetely not what i was expecting as a venom film but i was pleasently surprised tom hardy shines in this movie and his relationship with venom is unexpectedly well portrayed for a teen rated movie
Dec 5 2018,positive,decent movie cool effects great dynamic between the two personalities venom and tom hardy great casting
Dec 5 2018,neutral,generic plot that captures nothing of what makes venom an interesting character its only saved by tom hardys scenes talking to himself venom
Dec 5 2018,negative,i dont know where to start  maybe its the fact that i hate how sony handles superhero movies  maybe its the fact that it takes forever to get through the origins of venom  i simply found this movie the least captivating origin story movie out of all of the superhero movies out  id rather watch a my little pony movie than re watch this
Dec 5 2018,positive,its good but too many deleted scenes just make it a r movie and actually have the good scenes
Dec 4 2018,positive,29 you must be joking get a life critics
Dec 4 2018,negative,terrible movie and terrible acting from the supporting cast hardy was his usual fine self a movie laced with feminist nonsense with a number of pointless scenes only there to push feminist ideas on us a great chance to bring the venom character to screen ruined
Dec 4 2018,negative,i am a huge marvel fan and from the trailers this looked very promising also a huge fan of tom hardy so this film was set to be a winner for me unfortunately it didnt live up to the trailers and i am so disappointed my boyfriend also big marvel fan and i watched this together and were shocked when we realised we were over half way through before actually seeing venom for the first time i was genuinely bored watching this and ive never said that about any film with tom hardy or superheroes in 15
Dec 4 2018,positive,venom is a film that does not necessarily impress with its multigenre confusionbut it still does offer key elements of a good film such as the excellence of having tom hardy in the filmwhich is unfortunately not enough it also does contain unfavorable dialogue and needs a brief connection to spiderman to lift it up
Dec 4 2018,negative,i have never seen a movie as bad as this one with such a good cast what is happening in hollywood 
Dec 4 2018,negative,biggest thought on this first this is not a super hero movie its more of an antihero movie similar to deadpool if anything is it well executed that part is definitely debatable the very beginning is just absolute in my opinion feeling too rushed they may have done better having a second movie like a two parter for this and absolutely nothing made sense as to why it was all happening it felt like the beginning was the last part written however once venom and eddie brock become one the movie does certainly pick up quite a bit the action is subpar at best i feel mostly being held back by its pg13 rating if they allowed the film to be rated r like a deadpool movie sony wouldve had much more room to give interesting scenes instead we get people just getting knocked back by massive blades that should be slicing through them like a hot blade through butter the interaction though between eddie brock and venom is what makes the movie the funny little quirps that they have with one another it feels much more organic and i actually cared about their friendship a lot more than the horrendous relationship they try to force down our throats while michelle williams is a good actress anne weying is a terrible character the character simply comes off as shallow and onedimensional on a good day seeing eddie still lust for her is kind of like seeing your best friend going for that one girl thats cheated on him 3 times now but he still thinks shes hot so its worth it that guy is an idiot and so is eddie brock the fight scene was also kind of garbage at the end as it felt too condensed not sure if that makes sense rather the shots were just garbage it was just two goopy greyblack masses meshing with one another and while i will admit that is not something simple to show that still doesnt excuse the fact that the shots were terribly done     despite what i am complaining about is this movie worth seeing yea it wasnt terrible or boring really just bad director choices overall it makes you laugh and some scenes are fun to watch though you wont be finishing the movie thinking you just saw film of the year seems roma won that     but at the very least youll enjoy yourself and can be prepared when they very obviously setup for the next venom movie
Dec 4 2018,positive,great time to be had with this cool little freeinterpreted marvelpiece everything seemed just right to me only the usual annoying hiphopclicheish music bothered me a bit but all in all not much bad to be said
Dec 4 2018,positive,very interesting movie to watch
Dec 4 2018,positive,way better than i expected to see got me looking forward to the carnage movie which after all these super hero movies was starting to get played out
Dec 4 2018,positive,venom is slowpaced for the first hour but when venom arrives the action and the dynamic between eddie and venom are funny and have great chemistry even if the cast is likeable the film should have more time to understand venom and what makes venom an antihero b
Dec 4 2018,positive,damn good movie 810 one dumb part that didnt make much sense and a not amazing final fight but everything else was pretty good laughed out loud more than once liked the venom character
Dec 3 2018,negative,i dont quite understand why this movie has been so popular at the box office sure tom hardy is fantastic but the story line jumps all over the place there is very little story arc or depth and the climax wasreallywas that it the interplay between venom and eddie was brilliant but it was like that was all they had and they decided to try and build a movie around the rest damn good thing the captain marvel trailer dropped today to cheer me up
Dec 3 2018,positive,seems ppl are bashing this movie because its not the traditional super hero movie but venom isnt the traditional super hero good movie cant wait for 2
Dec 3 2018,negative,the action sequences in venom suffer from bayism in which the action all occurs at such a speed and in so few frames that you can hardly tell whats happening the bigbad and venom looked so similar that even if you could make out the action the characters were minimally discernible    beyond that the story line is criminally poor as is the dialogue    prior to watching this i read several reviews and comments in which someone derided the overuse of cgi i kept thinking to myself well youre just being unreasonable how else are you going to do venom right without cgi this is a movie you expect to be cgiladen and it should serve to create this character and yet somehow there is far far too much reliance on it    and even if you could look past all of that the action sequences themselves were boring during the motorcycle chase scene a scene which should have set up the character of venom and should have been our first real taste of what the movie has to offer in the way of action i kept waiting for it to be over as it wasnt interesting and it dragged on for several minutesas did every action sequence    sony really should have sought assistance from marvel on how to make this film as it stands this movie is bad not even laughably so its just not enjoyable    come back to me when this is rebooted in a few years with a better eddie brock and christopher nolan directing it
Dec 3 2018,positive,wired a mess but not with out charm and i loved it
Dec 3 2018,neutral,the peicula i do not like much and can not get into the marvel cinematographic universe and the story very empty
Dec 3 2018,positive,loved it but wouldve liked to see superhero cameos in it 
Dec 2 2018,positive,at first i had no intrested in seeing venom but after watching it it surprised me i took it for a new way away from the annimation story it was a great film very funny lots of action venom did not need spiderman he just needed the right host its the same story just spond a different way  the story still adds up with carnage at the end i cant wait to see the next venom film
Dec 2 2018,positive,great movie had a fun time watching it 
Dec 2 2018,positive,awesome movie totally awesome
Dec 2 2018,negative,all two of these stars im giving goes directly to tom hardy this movie was in short horrendous 
Dec 2 2018,positive,i love tom hardy so i love the movie lol sorry guys 
Dec 2 2018,negative,disgrace to the marvel brand it was boring i almost fell asleep at some point
Dec 2 2018,positive,the critics as usual are overthinking an entertaining movie if the average person on the street wants to see venom they will there wont be any discussion about editing or pacing its nearing 900 million dollars someone liked it i guess
Dec 2 2018,positive,hmm i dont get it  i dont get how socalled movie critics would give this 29 on the tomatometer   ignore them   its worth seeing
Dec 2 2018,neutral,underrated but i still think it is rotten i enjoyed the movie but i could not overlook it trying to be an action comedy while trying to be a serious movie plus the villan is extremely underwhelming the only performance i enjoyed was tom hardy
Dec 2 2018,positive,this is  a great epic superhero movie it had everything you want in a superhero movie and tom hardy is great as usual 
Dec 2 2018,positive,whatever what the criticism says this is the one of the best film in 2018
Dec 2 2018,neutral,i really wanted this to be good it started out interesting fell off and then started rising before falling face first into the sludge
Dec 2 2018,positive,never really imagined sony could handle venom standalone movie so well enjoyed every bit   we are venom
Dec 2 2018,positive,not entirely accurate to the comics and originals but still its a fun interactive story
Dec 2 2018,negative,horrible dont even waste your time worst comic book movie
Dec 2 2018,negative,absolutely awful the actors must have had a life debt to have to be in this ridiculous movie
Dec 1 2018,positive,that movie was great and the jokes were genuinely hilarious definitely going to watch it again hope they make a sequel
Dec 1 2018,positive,the so called critics really are bad at their jobs this is the first super hero movie in awhile that was good i guess they did not like it because disney did not pay them or there was not enough sjw content to choke on this is a good movie watch it at the theaters and donï 12 12 12tmt listen to the bogus critics scores
Dec 1 2018,positive,loved it great movie
Dec 1 2018,neutral,so dumb suffice to be the dumbest of all marvel movies 
Dec 1 2018,positive,good and interesting story hoping for a sequel
Dec 1 2018,positive,the film is a standalone and should be taken as such works with the source material and delivers fun funny jokes dark tones  and doesnt get bogged down over explaining itself bloody enjoyed this movie
Dec 1 2018,positive,awsome ok people this film is good it is dynamic funny and interesting well you know its just an amazing solo film
Dec 1 2018,positive,awesome take on venom and i was hesitant at first cause no spidey was said to not be in it but you took me by surprise and cant wait for the trilogy
Dec 1 2018,positive,great movie a nice balance of violence and comedy the critics dont know that they are talking about
Dec 1 2018,positive,didnt think i was going to like it i was glad i seen it i was a good movie
Dec 1 2018,positive,tom hardy gives it his all and there is actually entertainment to be found in this movie however its mostly unbalanced and murky tone as well as a cliched villain make the movie falter
Dec 1 2018,positive,it was a fairly entertaining joy ride performance by tom hardy makes you keep wanting for more even though the plot was weak the action sequence were great and i just wished it was a little longer
Dec 1 2018,positive,bit of a mess but is was entertaining enough tom hardy somehow gives a performance so bad and so good all at the same time 
Dec 1 2018,positive,honestly this movies plot terrible and the action was so exaggerated that it was laughable clearly the only thing that makes sense and makes you care about the movie is venoms character tom hardy is great as well and offers some madnness surpassing mad max fury road which is ironically funny and although the action and the plot was bad the humor stood out
Dec 1 2018,negative,this is dumb tom hardy really tries to save this but he is better in st nemesis than here
Dec 1 2018,negative,too dumb to be entertaining for the story cgi is to bad to be entertaining because of it apparently fleischer forgot how to direct over the years and these noisy clumsy unentertaining mess
Dec 1 2018,positive,i would say venom is a very good movie  so good i even saw it twice  i like the humor and there is a good amount of action  the special efects could have been better but the script makes it form me good   i love antiheroes movies
Dec 1 2018,positive,without shouting at the prodigy it was from the first iron man 10 years ago that i didnt find a cinecomic so intriguing perhaps thanks to the management of the marvel character not from the disney but the sony critics have panned because it would be a drift towards a now dated superhero model while im among those who appreciate this return to the origins an incredibly post or antimillennials return not for crybabies grown in the meantime but still dependent on the tarantinian pulp but for adults who face without avoiding the problems of our time and if behind tony stark it was impossible not to glimpse the geniality of elon musk here it is equally impossible not to glimpse into the antagonist the disturbing side of the south african entrepreneur or his silicon valley cronies  mauro lanari
Dec 1 2018,negative,relationship between venom and eddie brock is great tom hardy fits perfect in his role as eddie brock  the villain riot is very uninteresting and his character is bad written michelle william is totally unnecessary and there is missing creativity in some scenes
Dec 1 2018,negative,venom took me in a couple directions i wasnt expecting as i planned this review in my head in what was initially a planned piece about the opposite of positive hype for a film  in which there would be discussion on how negative reviews had set up for a hilariously bad film that in reality didnt deliver  soon had to be scrapped the moment tom hardys eddie brock comes into real contact with the titular venom     the criticisms you may have heard are all correct it feels like a superhero movie from 15 years ago the effects  especially the symbiote sans human host  look goddamn 90s garbage tom hardy once again showcases how toneimperfect he is with a performance all over the shop    what you might have also seen however is also true the film is fun in all the ways it doesnt intend to be venom is so hilarious and so unintentionally brilliant that its hard to despise while a good first third of the film is full of boring setup once we get to the meat of the film if you can even call it that you find its juststupid entertainment    let it be known that venom still isnt good by any degree its a sin on the eyes and everything makes you wonder what the fuck is going on whenever venom and eddie interact however is gold it made myself go what is this movie every single time it made me want a buddy cop movie between the two it made me want a romcom where venom tries to help eddie get back the girl it made me want venom being rehabilitated to the world of humans for an entire feature runtime    basically it made me want any movie other than this     theres something about a good bad film venom could have easily been another suicide squad it could have easily been bland and forgettable like fan4stic andsome other moviebut maybe venom just knew the trainwreck it was becoming and leaned hard into that i highly doubt theres a good cut or a serious cut out there releasethehardycut but the 23 of the film thats hammy hot trash has hardy piloting a film right into the sun and i am there for it     maybe ruben fleisher also thought this where he could have gone forgettable once again like gangster squad or 30 minutes or less again he instead went zombieland its still gonna be forgettable but goddamn i cant say i had a bad time at the movies     venom is a product of a different time with a different aptitude its recommended on pure funny hate watching alone because youre not gonna get anything else    but did you expect anything good in the first place     still its worth the trip because its the best comedy out in weeks
Dec 1 2018,positive,are u people crazythe movie is awsomefunnygood cgi  this is fing underatted
Dec 1 2018,positive,wow critics wow movie was actually good
Nov 30 2018,positive,too bright for a venom movie but since venom is my favorite marvel antihero i like it anyway
Nov 30 2018,positive,if you are looking for a silly comedy with some slapstick this movie delivers  but if you are expecting the same badass venom and eddie brock that existed in the comic books of the mid90s you will be disappointed  i was surprised how much i liked it despite the terrible wig on michelle williams and tom hardy channeling bobcatt goldthwait the entire time
Nov 30 2018,positive,love this movie excellent acting by everyone it is what it is  a marvel movie i really enjoyed this movie and i think if you give it a chance you will be pleasantly surprised
Nov 30 2018,positive,the movie gave me an exciting experience of how its so much better than spiderman 3 sony is stepping up a bit baby steps
Nov 30 2018,positive,better than expected i woul day at least 60
Nov 30 2018,negative,very disappointing for a tom hardy movie and a highly anticipated comic character majority of the movie it was like brock and venom had a weird relationship which needed some serious counselling but towards the end become best buddies weird movie overall 
Nov 30 2018,positive,i loved this movie  absolutely want to go watch it again  the only thing i didnt care for was the restaurant scene but thats only because i got massive secondhand embarrassment
Nov 30 2018,positive,this is a competent film in its category if youre looking for something that tries to take risks just for the sake of taking risks this isnt it if youre looking for a fun action flick that is enjoyable and uses its elements properly youre in the right place venom is fun actionpacked and relatable its everything you look for in a marvel flick and i cant help but feel an early 2000s spiderman vibe and pacing behind this flick which is awesome sometimes a deviation from the new marvel avengers formula is nice
Nov 30 2018,negative,what the fuck was this movie aside from tom hardy trying his best the movie was just plain bad with some of the worst dialogue ive ever heard in a comic book movie with some really bad cgi as well
Nov 30 2018,positive,awesome movie must watch
Nov 30 2018,positive,i think the movie gets less credit than it deserves i was skeptical before seeing it and i have to admit that it was more than i expected
Nov 30 2018,neutral,one really expects something majestic with marvel and tom hardy but gets disappointed quickly i loved the brutal aspect of the movie and i had a few laughs but overall it felt juvenile
Nov 30 2018,positive,in my opinion this was a very decent movie there are things to take into account before watching it like what are your expectations towards it i would not say that this movie is a horror movie far from it i think this is an actionscificomedy movie there is suggestion of gore without any actual gore on scene that i can remember which may have been slightly disappointing to some of the viewers considering the initial expected rrating    acting  the main actor does a great job he emulates venom perfectly and has a convincing personality that goes along with the main character however in my opinion he is the only actor that excels at his job in this movie the villain is overall generic and unconvincing with very little to no presence whatsoever which is saved a little by riot but unfortunately it is not enough to save his shallow acting jenny slate is the same acting feels a little bit forced and unconvincing    effects  i read many reviews that bashed the cgi and i honestly do not understand why maybe lately movies are lacking a lot and my expectations are too low or peopleâs are too high i honestly think the visual effects were very well achieved venom looks amazing and the best version of the character i have ever seen on film    plot  the plot is not complex and quite thin to be fair but the comedy take on the movie makes this flaw possible to overlook the scientific terms used and medical explanations and so forth were a little cringy to hear in all honesty i think there was a lot of potential lost in this movie regarding the plot    overall  a great acting from tom hardy delivers the best version i have seen of venom with visual effects that further it even more to deliver a great emulation of this character however a not so ambitious plot fails to deliver the movie the acting deserved nonetheless the comedy take on the character rescues this to some extend to deliver a very entertaining and funny movie suitable for most audiences also you people using the paraite word on your reviews you better rethink it
Nov 30 2018,positive,not related to the comic book and without any blood views but i realy enjoyed this movie
Nov 30 2018,negative,i just hope sony sell back all the right of spiderman back to marvel because they clearly dont know how to make a good movie from spiderman universe 
Nov 30 2018,positive,entertaining movie i like how venom is keeping with the recipe for success marvel has used by adding plenty of comedic relief i look forward to seeing more of the dynamic between brock and venom if done right it can be both hilarious and thrilling worth the price of admission 
Nov 30 2018,positive,an oddly satisfying instance of a film that starts critics and audiences colliding and going off on each other
Nov 30 2018,negative,utter garbage its not funny the action scenes are dark and dont look good the effects are soso bordering really really bad for 2018 the movie is boring as hell and it script feels rushed the only thing in the movie that ãs remotely good is tom hardy and jenny slate  its one of these for simpletons by simpletons movies retarted
Nov 30 2018,positive,great movie some visual effects wasnt great but the plot was very good im a marvel fan and this movie lack of some more action that a fan waits but the movie was great
Nov 30 2018,positive,the problem with this film is that it takes itself seriously its borderline ridiculous if it were self aware it would be perfect  tom hardy does what he can with a campy script and a thin script my hope is the sequel with fix what went wrong
Nov 30 2018,positive,great performance from tom hardy as eddie brockvenom and great movie all in as a comicbook movie it succeeds on all aspects whilst retaining an originality in the antihero
Nov 29 2018,positive,venom was funny and also the remake for his story went great
Nov 29 2018,neutral,despite the cheesy dialogue bad cgi and messy tone tom hardy turns in a hilarious performance rendering venom as campy entertaining garbage
Nov 29 2018,positive,this was not as bad as critics say the problem is that spider man does not appear and a lot of fans expected that the other is that eddie broke is not quite like in the comics its like is not very well defined in this script besides that the action the venom interaction with eddie is entertaining its just an ok movie if you are open to see a new venom not related to spiderman at all
Nov 29 2018,positive,pretty cool take on the villain tom hardy makes the marvel character more interesting and cool than he ever has been
Nov 29 2018,positive,pretty good addition to the sony marvel universe
Nov 29 2018,positive,i loved venom so much from the beginning of the movie i felt tense about the character venom but as the movie went on i started to like him and trust him what the critics are saying about venom in my opinion is completely wrong but what they say is their opinion
Nov 29 2018,positive,per usual the critics are opposite the people never read the comics and dont care to this movie was a very entertaining movie from start to finish in the consensus it says it need a greater attachment to spider man i say hell no i hated the spiderman movie and would hate to see this character turn out as lame as those if you liked john wick or the equalizer you will like this movie as those are 2 other good action movies the critics poopooed and the audience loved
Nov 29 2018,positive,movie was good the critics are way off on this one
Nov 29 2018,positive,fantastic way better then the spider man 3 venom
Nov 29 2018,positive,rotten tomatoes needs to get there head out of the gutters
Nov 29 2018,negative,it was ok it was like ghost rider bad but entertaining so 1 12
Nov 29 2018,positive,i dont know why most critics choose to poorly rate good movies this is why i prefer to actually watch the movie rather than follow some absurd individuals opinion    now for the movie i absolutely loved it the comedy was refreshing and not in your face venoms character was quite endearing to me and i just love the storyline    the only thing i can say was a con for me would be that the movie was a bit fast paced but it still found a way to get me attached    in conclusion i advise anyone reading this to watch the movie without the opinion of some high end critic who probably think they know better and if you come out hating it then at least it was your personal thoughts about the movie
Nov 29 2018,negative,tom hardy makes for an excellent eddie brock but the script is campy the villain isnt intimidating and the symbiotic protagonist antagonist occasionally borders on infantile
Nov 29 2018,positive,venom is a very silly antihero movie in which its lead characters seems to be doing a comedy act while getting towards a schizophrenic breakdown the problem with that is that its quite amusing to watch and gives you a old school 1990s vibe to a superhero genre that for most part had moved on from those ideas it was a pleasant surprise even though audiences will be divided
Nov 29 2018,positive,well its a good movie to methe action are awsome and really funnyim just happy leaving the threate
Nov 29 2018,positive,poor cgi with flawed narative then again the overall delivery is satisfactory and so does the casts   rooms of improvement that can be made please do better in its series and make it great
Nov 29 2018,positive,its become increasingly clear that the whole field of film reviewers rating films has gone terribly askew  29      i honestly dislike nearly all of the comic films universally  but logan deadpool the first one anyways and venom have managed to take the tired superhero cliches and wrangle something fun out of them      its more telling that the same fleet of comic book review nerds groveling over every boring superhero flick again and again cant seem to appreciate some actual risk taking and chaos with the formulas  these are the same devotees that seemed to think the new star wars films are operating far beyond the level they will be remembered for  rts meter just becomes more and more of a joke and its really hurting the film industry      its also great to see sf and the technototalitarian biotech horror show get the spotlight as the villain emerging in the world for a change  then again maybe thats who buys off all of these reviews      tom hardy riz ahmed and michelle williams gave  venom infinitely more personality than most marvel and dc genre flicks combined
Nov 29 2018,positive,its a great movie it has the right amount of humor and action that cater to everyones entertainment
Nov 29 2018,positive,you will love venom sentences funny film with a great tom hardy
Nov 29 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie am planning to buy it when itâtms available on dvd
Nov 29 2018,positive,this movie was enjoyable it had a few laughs but the acting was a bit wonky at times and that was the low point of the movie for me but i recommend that you see this movie if you wanna just chill at a saturday afternoon or some day of the week like that
Nov 29 2018,positive,dont fall victim to the green meter from the critics or the haters who wanted this film to be some tragic hero type of tale venom is hilarious and fun to watch its definitely more on the summer blockbuster side rather than a dark knightish type of film the movie may not follow the source material exactly but everything was translated so well onto the big screen for an exciting viewing
Nov 29 2018,positive,a very good movie  i had a lot of fun watching it and its pretty funny too the transition of venom into a semi good guy wasnt as smooth and logical as i wantedit was kinda sudden but still a very good movie
Nov 28 2018,positive,i thought this was good fun
Nov 28 2018,negative,i dont know what this emo dumpster fire is  some kind of retarded combination of deadpool and ewdard scissorhands
Nov 28 2018,positive,i was skeptical of watching this movie went with with friends and ended up loving it who would have thought you would like a maneating alien so much 
Nov 28 2018,positive,alot better than critics will have you believe but for everything they got wrong they were right that venom is a mess all over the place tone wise and story wise tom hardy is really great in this everyone else is like in acting class really terrible dialogue but when venom is happening and tom hardy is talking its really good
Nov 28 2018,negative,the plot was a bit like transformers got evil transformers except this time they need human bodies to survive a bit funny though
Nov 28 2018,positive,greatest venom yet hands down
Nov 28 2018,positive,this movie has been thoroughly underestimated its got a great cast exciting effects and although the plot might seem basic there is just something about the film that captures your attention
Nov 28 2018,positive,a movie that makes the sam rami trilogy proud its fun its funny as hell and seeing venom jump off the page and not the t grace version was worth the ticket of admission    dont listen to all these critics who cant sit back and enjoy a movie cuz they are too concerned with agendas like getting all marvel properties back disney  this movie was rotten by antman and the wasp was fresh agendas
Nov 28 2018,positive,absolutely loved it  so it might not be 100 accurate with the origin story but it is still an amazing film
Nov 28 2018,positive,it was awesome and funny 
Nov 27 2018,positive,this movie is amazingggggggggg
Nov 27 2018,positive,the critics have something wrong with their head if they dont think this movie is good he portrayed both venom and eddy brock perfectly obviously they didnt read the comics properly yes their was no spiderman which made it much more eery and less kid friendly which is what venom is supposed to be great movie in all ways possible and the second one is going to be just as good 
Nov 27 2018,positive,solid origin story but suffered from that typical thing that origin stories often do you have to show how they develop as a hero but also have them be said hero so the ending was typically clunky and smashed together 
Nov 27 2018,negative,mediocre and forgetable tom hardy walks with a slouched look the engire time was some funny moments but i watched this film about 2 hours ago and i cant remember much of it i must say the only good thing i do remember is the chemistry between eddie and venom its kind of disappointing but hopefully sony ever do release a sequel they can fix the pproblems with it to make it more enjoyable
Nov 27 2018,positive,the kids and it enjoyed the movie
Nov 27 2018,positive,venom is a bloody entertaining marvel addition i think the critics got this one wrong personally especially after giving some other weaker entries in the marvel universe great praise though there are plot holes especially in the second half this is a fun entertaining entry in the superhero genre and features a likable bromance between eddie and his symbiote 
Nov 27 2018,negative,this movie was trash the cringe worthy script and empty plot make it hard to notice descent acting and even harder to care about the over the topweightless action sequences truly a shame this character was not given the marvel studios treatment like in spiderman homecoming i would not recommend this movie wish i hadnt seen it and will not watch a sequel without a reboot
Nov 27 2018,positive,i love this movie and i cant  wait for the next one oh and fuck the critics as allways   rip stan lee
Nov 27 2018,negative,unfortunately venom just did not work because of slow and boring plot devolopment other than hardy the entire cast was miscast and annoying at times this could have been an epic movie but the writing was bad
Nov 27 2018,positive,didnt read the graphic novels so i had no expectations this was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie had some good laughs and great special effects plus the storyline was well written
Nov 27 2018,neutral,the build of characters are lame but the action is cool
Nov 27 2018,positive,i enjoyed it because tom hardy made it his own dark humour and all i think alot of people forget that the interactions we have with ourselves are very similar to the ones he has with the symbiote which is hilarious to say the least
Nov 27 2018,positive,loved this movie it rocked the rating is garbage from critics if you like superheros youll be down
Nov 27 2018,negative,pros and cons of venom  pros  tom hardy plays the role to perfection throwing himself fully into the role and plays it convincingly cons  the movie is terrible the effects are 10 years ago the story is convoluted and lets be honest the pg13 rating hurt terribly the venom lore is much more violent and a lot less funny this is not what venom should be as a comic fan since my early days i was very disappointed
Nov 26 2018,positive,i love this movie i am a new venom fan but man this movie got me exited to read the comics
Nov 26 2018,positive,i give this a solid 3 12 stars because while it was a bad film overall venom was entertaining as hell it wasnt bland in anyways and always kept me engaged the problem is the plot and characters are crap venom while he is goofy in the comics he feels too goofy in the adaptation the plot holes are stupid just like eddie but like i said entertaining
Nov 26 2018,neutral,this is a superhero movie that certainly has fun elements but the story  they dropped the ball plain and simple its so formulaic and so stolid that i actually felt sorry for tom hardy and michelle willaims forced to sit in the figurative baggage car of the marvel movie money train playing commercial scenes without any zest to them and yet despite the many many flaws it is a superhero movie with mucho cgi and so any port in a storm
Nov 26 2018,negative,this take on venom was confused if he wanted to be a hero or a antihero and it shows in its messy story and unconvincing characters
Nov 26 2018,neutral,spoilers     it was all over the place i didnt have any real engagement with it why were the symbiotes called riot and venom how are they alien names the venom symbiote was not scary due to its conversations with eddie what was the plot some symbiotes got brought to earth then decided to go back to space to get the rest then come back to earth to eat everyone and venom wants to stop this because hes suddenly decided he likes earth and hes a loser on his own planet ugh venom is supposed to be a terrifying murderer not some scary looking puppy who takes its orders from eddie and occasionally eats bad guys for food and why doesnt venom have the same skillset as riot and how did he survive the spaceship blowing up how did eddie and that carnage teaser does he already have a symbiote or will another show up later if youve never read the comics or seen raimis spiderman 3 then you will probably think its alright ps i wasnt expecting the stan lee cameo and that was bitter sweet the only point i was engaged emotionally with the movie
Nov 26 2018,positive,a captivating watch throughout venom is a technically wellmade film boasting very good action and a great turn by tom hardy certain themes in the plot and the outlines of the characters might be far from original but the makers know how to still make them exciting the biggest minus for me was that things were too convenient for the evolution of the story several times throughout thus shattering the illusion that youre watching something real yet the movie remains a lot of fun
Nov 26 2018,positive,i thought it was a good movieif youre looking for the comic book youll probably not like it
Nov 26 2018,positive,not great but very entertaining 
Nov 26 2018,positive,it was better than i thought dont know why the critics got it wrong as a comicbook reader and a die hard fan of marvel they did stick with the bible the movie just lacked spidey and it was because of some company issues other than spidey the movie was awesome and it deserves a four and a half rating
Nov 26 2018,negative,superhero films usually suck this is a great example of this
Nov 25 2018,positive,takes marvels blueprint and executes it better than disney great cast that all deliver great performances
Nov 25 2018,negative,not able to give zero stars i tried to enjoy it but im just not in to monster movies 
Nov 25 2018,positive,went in with a negative mindset due to all the criticism came out surprised how good it was
Nov 25 2018,positive,this was amazingly wierd this movie had balls to be itself and unlike other i liked the first half because it actually sets up venom and the symbiotes very well and plays with horror elements the second half s tone is lighter with very funny moments so its pretty balanced and not a tonal mess like critics say the only crticism i have is the pacing could be better but it was definitely an enjoyable decent movie and simple story
Nov 25 2018,positive,its a fun movie to watch
Nov 25 2018,positive,wow i dont know what movie the critics were watching but this movie was so much fun lots of humor and action the 2 of us couldnt stop talking about it and our favorite scenes 2 thumbs up
Nov 25 2018,positive,see tom hardy who you didnt expect to see as venom bring the laughs and exciting fighting scenes a really cool over the top action film and interesting characters riz ahmed is pathetic as the villian venom talking to tom hardy made the movie more exciting and loved it when eddie as venom scares his noisy neighbor and fighting the guys that work for riz a must see action packed funny movie for comic book fans forget the stupid critics tom hardy who played bane in the dark knight rises is also awesome as venom
Nov 25 2018,positive,1010 would recommend
Nov 25 2018,positive,enjoyable though very predictable premise
Nov 25 2018,positive,amazing movie it was funny and kept me very interested i loved the story line even if some people say it was rushed and the critics dont listen to them good move go see it
Nov 25 2018,positive,i love how tom hardy made every single movement and action possible here
Nov 25 2018,positive,venom review symbiosis achieved  okay first you need to know that im in love with tom hardy and that nothing he does in my mind can go wrong     i hadnt heard about this film until someone mentioned on facebook that tom hardy had been knighted or the like and questioned whether it was appropriate for the queen to love the star of such a gruesome film     i commented on his post whats there not to love based purely on the fact that im in love with hardy and nothing he does in my mind can go wrong     so i watched the film then while watching as i do used my phone to go online to read some reviews on rotten tomatoes it had received some terrible feedback with the mostly male reviewers not knowing whether it was a comedy or horror that there was no consistency and it was a terrible script     sometimes i think reviewers have two things in mind when they write 1 to follow the herd and 2 be as opinionated as possible     i actually thought the film was quite good it was sonys version of deadpool which is one of my favourite films of all time having watched the original three times and the second film twice to date like deadpool when the original dp film first came out it was like wtf is this a marvel movie like all super hero films it follows the same structure of hero being defeated and then decides to fight back in order to have justice truth and morality reinstated but it does so in a very off the cuff grotesque and cringeful way     we have to remember that the avengers films and the xmen films are done by different film studios 20th century fox having rights to xmen and sony and disney having rights to the avengers franchise     although the xmen movies are not as prolific or profitable as the avengers franchise the most recent movies logan and deadpool step away from the pg friendliness of the avengers logan was over the top gratuitous on the blood and guts which was great until the black farming family were the first characters to die upholding the long help stereotype that black people are always the first to be sacrificed in films and deadpool was over the top on gratuitous smut     so i can understand the intentions to have venom be outside of the avengers universe a standalone film one that tries to blur the lines between horror comedy and action i dont think they quite did it as successfully as deadpool although i like the venom character he is not yet in the same league as ryan reynolds but there is definitely potential there     like the majority of the reviewers who put the film down their one positive was hardys performance obviously i agree with their summation that hardy portrayed eddie well although his accent at times stumbled to american thug of the trailer park kind similar to his accent in another great film warrior i would also have liked to have seen him in some tighter tops and less product in his hair maybe cleaner cut but thats just my personal preference     i loved venom his appearance his voice and especially his dialogue     it probably would have been better not to spend so much time in the beginning on how eddie became infected so that there was more time to build a connection between venom and eddie as it did seem strange how venom suddenly turned from wanting to take over the planet to wanting to stay there was no real justification for this nor do i think the film explained adequately why eddie isnt slowly deteriorating like the other hosts     anyway i digress into some of the things that bother me when i think about it this is not a film where youre supposed to think too much its supposed to be fun and fast paced which it was if youre a die hard game of thrones fan you dont spend too much time pondering the fact that it took gendry next to no time at all to run back to castle black despite it taking them days to walk that same distance to then be stranded on a rock in the middle of a iced over lake and that for dany to fly her dragons back to said location took even less time we dont ponder these issues because we are not in it for the reality we are in for the fantasy    i think my favourite part of the film was the gratuitous killing of dozens of men in black commando gear falling in on each scene like confetti at a wedding brandishing black semiautomatic rifles and driving black suv vehicles youve got to love the simplicity       on the whole i would give it a 7 out of 10
Nov 25 2018,positive,great movie for action fanatic tom hardy performance was good the plot is different from the comics version the parasite back story behavior and storyline is very similar to a certain japanese animation made in the 90s named kiseijuu sei no kakuritsu which makes the movie a little bit unoriginal but if you dont know the anime you will love this movie and might even look forward to a sequel   ps  this version of venom the parasite is dope
Nov 25 2018,negative,just hate bad writing
Nov 25 2018,positive,this is a great funny movie cant wait to buy it and see it again if your going to watch a movie see this
Nov 25 2018,neutral,venom for what it was  it wasnï 12 12tmt bad was it great no could it have been better  absolutely if you wanted intense high action throughout all of the movie then this should be your type of movie to see but if you were hoping for them to develop the character venom and show his progression throughout the movie then donï 12 12tmt get your hopes up it seems like this movie forget to add the background information for people wanting a full background story of venom or at least a better understanding of who he is donï 12 12tmt go in with high hopes for a good outcome of this movie you will be leaving the theater highly disappointed
Nov 25 2018,negative,i went into venom cold no reviews no youtube insights nothing and its the first marvel movie i was totally disappointed in i see everyone praise tom hardy but i was even disappointed in his character no depth
Nov 25 2018,positive,so much fun that is what this movie is a hilarious roller coaster venom is awesome
Nov 25 2018,neutral,weak start good ending venom is fun eddie not that much
Nov 25 2018,negative,venom is getting a lot of unwarranted hate i liked this film not based on merit obviously but i was entertained i apply the same logic that critics did for tom cruise it stoically held my gaze for two hours and i didnt feel like i wasted money on a ticket
Nov 25 2018,neutral,venom is a weird movie its clearly an r rated movie that was cut into a pg13 movie in order to sell more tickets and it drags the movie down despite this i still enjoyed the film mostly due to a gonzo performance by tom hardy i wish that his relationship with venom was the main focus of movie hopefully they get a better writer for the next one 
Nov 25 2018,negative,tom hardy puts his all into what he is givenand it shows just how weak the story and direction are too many elements from more successful marvel movies are mashed into nothing more than a mess save your time and money
Nov 25 2018,positive,really fun and intresting movie i liked the movie it was funny and had some good action in it and it was able to keep me awake and intrested in it unlike other movies
Nov 24 2018,positive,love this movie funny and action
Nov 24 2018,negative,have to say im with the critics on this one  this film doesnt know what it is and as a result just feels like a mess the comedic moments dont hit the mark barring one very basic joke part way through the cgi on venom looks very comic book but not in a good way the final fight is well just disappointing watched at the cinema wont be viewing again
Nov 24 2018,positive,i think that movie is great and dope
Nov 24 2018,positive,the movie was entertaining sure it had a terrible story and was kinda choppy with no character developments but the action was great  if a movie can entertain you its not a bad movie like the critics are telling you so 35 stars
Nov 24 2018,positive,i honestly really like this movieit could have been a little vomit better either then that i liked it
Nov 24 2018,positive,this movie is highly underrated by critics sure the plot is a little ridiculous but that doesnt stop it from being a good movie the venom in this movie is way better than the one in spiderman 3 more serious and less dumb this is entertaining movie even if it does have gore and lots of cursing too bad it isnt part of the marvel cinematic universe
Nov 24 2018,positive,though venom has a terrible story and is full of plot holes it is still one of the most enjoyable films of this year tom hardy is excellent as eddie brock however riz ahmed seems like he doesnï 12tmt really know how to play the role of carlton drake
Nov 24 2018,positive,ohmahgawd a m a z i n g   i loved it  from the mild humour to amazingly wellmade plot venoms dark but playful voice really got me  i love it acting and characterisation was superb so was the directing writing and almost everything lots of action which is always my favourite part of a movie like this i enjoyed watching this action thriller a lot and literally cant wait for the next sequel to be released also taking into account the possibility of a spiderman crossover in a future sequel
Nov 24 2018,positive,loved it i dont see why film critics are so harsh on this movie i guess because its not a boring 3 hour long film about love during the war then they arent interested think they rushed the ending a bit but apart from that its great venom is awesome and is very funny with good banter between it and tom
Nov 23 2018,positive,honestly the critics are completely wrong with this movie the cast is great the symbiote is hilarious and the action scenes pack a punch overall great movie
Nov 23 2018,positive,loved this movie so much i went to see it twice i loved the characterization and how well tom hardy played the part as a writer myself i apreciated the entire movie as a whole but the story line was great i admit i havent read the comics but i have heard from those that have read them that they thought it was great 1010 would see again
Nov 23 2018,positive,its not the best superhero movie out there but it is perfectly adequate i enjoyed it and thought it was better than the trailers implied
Nov 23 2018,positive,entertaining and amusing
Nov 23 2018,positive,a bit slow in the first third but overall good fun and a laugh venom was my favourite character and eddie brocks relationship with the symbiote was a highlight of the film definitely wanted to see it multiple times the action was good and i thoroughly enjoyed myself watching it
Nov 23 2018,positive,this is the highest rating ive ever given a movie that i know is awfulbut this movie is so much fun i loved it please go see it its one of the best bad movies ive ever seen youll have a great time even if you know it sucks   ill give it             77
Nov 23 2018,positive,great move i dont really understand why the reviews so bad
Nov 23 2018,positive,exactly what i was hoping it to be entertaining with some good laughs critics shouldnt expect this to be cinematic gold its fun
Nov 23 2018,negative,this was a terrible venom movie it totally had nothing to do with the comic on the flip side if you want to turn your brain off and disregard the actual story of who venom was and you just want to see a black gewy alien wreck havoc then you may like this movie
Nov 23 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie like other superhero movies it was nice to see something different than sequels 
Nov 22 2018,positive,went to see it on a double date night with some pals and it was an absolute thrill i never liked the character venom that much before my only experiences had been with 9000s video games and the first spiderman trilogy which notably had very little focus on that character this was fantastic and fun and campy and everything i think of with a hero movie i loved it i cant wait to see it again and i cant believe im saying this but im going to be buying it when it comes out on disk
Nov 22 2018,positive,tbh iâtmm just laughing my ass off at how critics hate this movie and everyone who actually sees it loves it
Nov 22 2018,positive,venom although it needs to have spiderman at some point and it started off a little slow it was a good movie held together by tom hardys strong performance as eddie brockvenom and of course the action was awesome
Nov 22 2018,positive,entertaining but not the best made comic book movie
Nov 22 2018,negative,tom hardy is a bit wasted in this movie action is convoluted this whole movie was a stretch
Nov 21 2018,neutral,wasted opportunity effects were amazing but dialogue and 90 of the jokes were stupid and were surprisingly targeted at kids the wrong   demographic pacing was terrible sub plot was stupider than the star wars prequels worth a watch but if you come out disappointing dont say i didnt warn you
Nov 21 2018,positive,finally i was able to forget that 70s venom hardy nailed it and as a venom fan since his first picture in the comics he didnt need spidey to pull this off
Nov 21 2018,positive,typically sony formula better than expected 
Nov 21 2018,positive,had a few hiccups but honesty very entertaining and fun to watch saw it twice in theatre
Nov 21 2018,positive,really really good
Nov 21 2018,positive,what i expected from the movie happy they did it right tom hardy was perfect
Nov 21 2018,positive,went to see this with some mates and we all agreed that it was a blast tom hardy is fantastic and perfectly balances the dr jekyl and mr hyde of the character venoms portrayal also hardy was also great and true to the source material a joking wisecracking assbeating monster although riz ahmeds villain was weaker than he could have been he still gave a great performance with believable motivations the cgi in some places was a little over the top particularly in the final showdown but on the whole looked pretty neat its amazing how a character so tied into the spiderman universe can work so well without any reference to spiderman venom really can carry his own film and as someone whos not that into comic books i would say this is a great entrance point into the genre i will definitely be returning for the sequel to see carnage in action
Nov 21 2018,positive,totally awesome loved it
Nov 21 2018,positive,very good movie loved it the problem with it was that it had a little to much sgi but all though it was a good movie
Nov 21 2018,positive,tomy hardy shines as eddie brock thus is a very faithful version of the antihero venom the violence of the character is contained by mental imagary instead of concentrating on blood and guts
Nov 21 2018,positive,interesting to see how a villain becomes one 
Nov 21 2018,positive,pretty good movie but how do you make a pg13 venom i dont even remember seeing any blood acting was good but that fell short due to shoddy writing and bad directing     go see it but dont expect the dark venom that we all love just shut off and you might enjoy it
Nov 21 2018,positive,this movie was amazing and tom hardy was be far a terrific actor the only problem i had was the movie was too rushed
Nov 21 2018,positive,while im still nonplussed that the decision was made to write a spidermanless venom origin i do believe they pulled it off cons villain was too meh symbiotes relationship development and attachment to eddy was clunky and abrupt pros tom hardy was a great casting decision visually bold and interesting story moved along and i never felt bored great set up for future films 
Nov 21 2018,positive,hardys performance as brock left much to be desired venoms character was far less brutal than his original incarnations and their lore and origins have been thoroughly gutted and repurposed for goodness sake they cannot even pronounce sihmbeeoht correctly    however it was a fun actionpacked romp that was worth the sit down the lack of blood and gore notwithstanding and the dialogue between venom and brock made for an unexpectedly good buddymovie element that gave me a few good laughs recommended if you dont mind mediocre comic book films and are just looking for a bit of cheap fun
Nov 21 2018,positive,entertainment tick story of substance tick weighty characters we want to follow tick
Nov 20 2018,positive,the movie was alright the best part is easily tom hardy he was thoroughly entertaining to watch
Nov 20 2018,positive,i can see why critics hate this movie but i thought it was good not great but good i do have some problems with it but its funny action packed and the acting is really solid heres hoping venom 2 is better i guess
Nov 20 2018,positive,venom drags at the beginning takes too long to introduce the title character has wildly miscast villains and most of its action sequences are uninspired however it is tom hardys gleeful performance as both eddie brock and the voice of venom that make it worth viewing in theaters he commits fully to a portrayal of this wildly idiosyncratic character and despite the bland dressing makes the whole thing work
Nov 20 2018,positive,obssessed with the venom character 
Nov 20 2018,positive,my sons and i loved it i thought it was going to be scary but it turned out to be more comedy than anything else
Nov 20 2018,positive,i like the movie in venom movie into bears movie
Nov 20 2018,positive,venom is such a funny acation pack movie that brings more of the classc venom look then sam ramies venom look but sure he doseint have the spider symbol but the rest of the movie makes up for it and trust me its badass
Nov 20 2018,positive,not going to rock your world but does exactly what it says on tin will go to watch a sequal
Nov 20 2018,positive,it was better than i expected 
Nov 20 2018,positive,in my opinion the film was intense but weak about the relation to the spider man universe they focused at venom but missed the town the guy and showed us only the bad guy and the home of venom i missed a little participation of spider man
Nov 20 2018,positive,while there is a certain enmity missing because of the major role of spiderman missing the movie still does a good job of establishing the venom story without its arguably largest draw
Nov 20 2018,positive,fun funny well worth the watch cant wait to see what they follow it up with go carnage
Nov 20 2018,negative,nothing good plot script cgi acting all crap 
Nov 19 2018,positive,better than i expected actually tom hardy essentially saves the film with his nicholas cagesque performance
Nov 19 2018,positive,if you didnï 12tmt like this you are hcking frking flppingweak and natural selection is coming for you fucking bitch ass pussies
Nov 19 2018,positive,as a diehard fan of venom comics this movie gave me everything i ever wanted particularly since spiderman 3s portrayal a chance to see venom do amazing things on the big screen    as a movie itself the dialogue can be clunky the storys pacing is rushed the characters aside from brockvenom are about as bland as a saltine and the story has some major holes     with all that being said the movie was just so freaking fun that it didnt really matter at all whatsoever     the script was funny the fight scenes were fantastic it was gruesome enough to satisfy those who wanted an rrated movie and theres even some heartwarming emotion somewhere in there it was like witnessing your favorite character show off their skills and abilities for two hours was it pure fanservice to people who like seeing this type of superhero action of course     was it an amazing watch nonetheless     yes yes it was
Nov 19 2018,positive,this was a great movie this is what a venom film should be 
Nov 19 2018,positive,i like the action in the movie but its not as good as the venom in spiderman 3
Nov 19 2018,positive,im a venom fan myself and i believe this movie comes up to the standards that at least i wantedi cant wait for venom 2 to come out on the big screen
Nov 19 2018,negative,leave it to sony to ruin a marvel flick very lackluster
Nov 18 2018,positive,hungry great guy movie 5 out of 5 stars 
Nov 18 2018,positive,the movie was really awesome if your into action packed movies i really suggest this one i hope you will enjoy it as much as me and my dad did
Nov 18 2018,positive,really fun compared to typical formulaic marvel movies it didnt take itself too seriously and had me laughing most of the movie
Nov 18 2018,positive,enjoyed it for what it was
Nov 18 2018,negative,this movie was complete garbage
Nov 18 2018,negative,venom isnt nearly as bad as i was expecting it to be it isnt great but it was never boring that made this movie either decent or so bad that it was funny through all of it what really stands out about this movie and makes it better is tom hardys amazing performance because he was the one who looked like he was trying the most and sold all his awful dialogue so if you are forced to watch this movie you can totally sit through it its a fine movie really its just a guilty pleasure movie that anyone can laugh at
Nov 18 2018,negative,not great but not terrible the movie does a good job with venom and the eddie brock chemistry and that really saved the movie from the trash fight sequences and lousy script
Nov 18 2018,positive,one of the greatest villains moves ever i had very high  expectations  for this movie and it passed them by a mile  go see it if you havenâtmt
Nov 18 2018,neutral,it really was not good the paste was too fast at moments the villan was poor also the whole ponding with venom was too fast and poorly executed
Nov 18 2018,positive,it was amazing went with my father will see again
Nov 18 2018,positive,venom is the best movie in the world
Nov 18 2018,negative,two stars for the people that had to do the animation and stuff  this movie is awful in all the wrong ways
Nov 18 2018,neutral,yeah pretty much what i expected it to be mildly entertaining with a quick cameo from stan lee  not a lot else going for it but not worth walking out of if you have a free movie pass to use up
Nov 18 2018,positive,really enjoyed it the humor meets action was great and while it wasnt perfect it was certainly entertaining loved seeing all the georgia film locations
Nov 18 2018,positive,less than 30 really did you just not focus on what the film was about yes you have to follow the film and theres a big jump where nothing happens but its a great film funny in the right places and serious in others cant fault the cgi as its probably the best ive seen since the transformers films
Nov 17 2018,neutral,one hand good laughs other hand not that much to see
Nov 17 2018,positive,my boyfriend and i went with an open mind and ended up really enjoying venom good film b  
Nov 17 2018,positive,a great romantic comedy about a man and the space alien that lives in his stomach
Nov 17 2018,positive,too dark final battle was barely watchable
Nov 17 2018,positive,not the best movie iï 12tmve ever seen but would watch it again i felt at times it was kind of daft and i didnï 12tmt get the point however tom hardyï 12tms acting was perfect as usual and it has potential to progress and improve
Nov 17 2018,positive,funny entertaining and love the casting
Nov 17 2018,positive,love love tom hardy is funny marvel never disappoints
Nov 17 2018,positive,humorous fun and overall just a good time the mostly positive audience reviews vs bad critic reviews proves that the edginess of superhero films are becoming tired and that people want to see light hardheartedness in this genre frankly the critics just have sticks up their butts it was a great movie
Nov 17 2018,positive,this movie was wonderful i seriously dont understand how people didnt like this tom hardy was amazing there was a perfect balance of action and story the soundtrack was great i will certainly watch it again
Nov 17 2018,positive,venom is sadly not what fans of the character were looking for although hardys performance is a convincing one to say the most it does not save the film from the mess that it is  although it is still better than spiderman 3s topher grace venom it is a mess of tones and seems like more of a buddy comedy in some scenes with dashes of comic book references and beloved characters being thrown in your face its hard to find aything good about this movie but fear not there is a solid design for the symbiotes you meet in this film and even a few decapitations to push the character along riz ahmeds performance as carlton drake is actually one of the better highlights of the film as a menacing mastermind all in all it wasnt terrible and honestly critics need to get over the pg13 rating just because they wanted to have an r rating to be honest it feels more like your standard mcu flick than anything else recommended for those who want dumb merciless fun 63 10
Nov 17 2018,negative,enough superhero movies too many in one year
Nov 17 2018,positive,it was one of fun movies ive ever seen hardys performance was excellenti want to see it more
Nov 17 2018,positive,great movie very different from  cliché story of other super hero movies 
Nov 17 2018,positive,not nearly as bad as critics claim  cheesy and odd but works well for what it is  wouldnt mind a sequel
Nov 17 2018,positive,this movie is bonkers sad to see marvel characters outside the mcu continue to be treated this way makes zero sense outside of spiderman relationship i did like the insanity a bit so i didnt completely dislike it
Nov 16 2018,positive,woah is a very good movie maybe is funny some parts but is action you need see this movie
Nov 16 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this film    it was so funny and action packed   i dont know why it has bad rating because it was so awesome  venom i rate it 87 out of 10
Nov 16 2018,positive,comic book film that doesnt take itself too seriously enjoyed the ride
Nov 16 2018,positive,tom hardy was really good the storynot so much very rushed and venoms motivation made no sense
Nov 16 2018,positive,didnt deserve a 30 rating i liked it it was entertaining and funny
Nov 16 2018,positive,great movie refereshingly free of politics
Nov 16 2018,positive,tom hardy is amazing if only i can see more action to it that will be wonderful love the story plot of the story a must see marvel
Nov 16 2018,positive,a fun popcorn flick with some good action and laughs despite a slightly slower start than most hardy did an excellent job of playing two characters in one
Nov 16 2018,positive,even though the story is out of place and the venom character does more jokes than expected compared to sam raimis venom this is a huge improvement this movies can become much more better if the movie is rated r
Nov 16 2018,positive,a fairly good film nothing outstanding but a but considering the last big screen film of venom i will take it i was hoping for a screen adaptation of lethal protector i didnt macaulay culkin this time
Nov 16 2018,positive,this is the best movie ive seen since deadpool i think i might even like it more honestly i caught it its last day in theaters and i already want to see it again the action was incredible the writing was spectacular the actors portrayed the perfect chemistry for every scene and venom was beautifully done and really the best character even my mother who has hardly liked a movie since fifth element loved this film and agreed it was worth the trip to the cinema critics are obviously out of their minds
Nov 16 2018,positive,the story is nothing to write home about but venom still succeeds into bringing the title character onto the big screen with a few laughs and some engaging moments to spare
Nov 16 2018,neutral,venom aint no mcu movie but at least it  was a okay ride
Nov 16 2018,negative,not as bad as the critiques make it out to be but not good
Nov 16 2018,positive,best adaption of the venom character
Nov 15 2018,positive,loved it  i dont get why it rated so low i am now a fan of symbrok i loved how tom hardy portrayed himself as someone who you start getting the idea i had something wrong with him in the beginning meets up with i think is it really surprisingly good counterpart a partner someone that clicks with him it takes really good acting to accomplish that and for movie to get me to care about an alien parasite that i thought was going to be a villain ended up being more like a buddy cop but deeper i dont know i came out of that movie loving it and i really did appreciate how the two of them work together was taken totally by surprise and was happy about it
Nov 15 2018,positive,i liked it a lot but some parts felt a bit too scripted and rushed
Nov 15 2018,positive,best movie of the year possibly the best marvel movie ever second after deadpool maybe never in my life have i been invested in mcu but now hell catch me reading the comics in the near future im sold venom is ahead of its time and were all just fools incapable of comprehending its absolute superiority
Nov 15 2018,positive,venoms cringy one liners wierd acting at some parts too much humor and less venomwho cares i slightly do action not all too bad and yeah ok more venom this is a dark and scary villain humor is okay but this was more of a comedy oh yeah the two end credit scenes were kinda bad too the first meh the secod i am entirely speechless it was good but bad so
Nov 15 2018,positive,great movie tells alot about venom and the other symbiotes and doesnt feature spiderman really brings out the character in the comics
Nov 15 2018,positive,venom is a fun romp and you have to enjoy it for what it is if you are looking for the next infinity war then this wont be for you i cant wait for the sequel
Nov 15 2018,negative,as far as marvel superhero movies go âvenomâ ranks as one of the worst this watered down bore is dumb loud and brash with nothing to say the film suffers from an identity crisis with so many jarring shifts in tone that i struggled to stay engaged with the character and story    investigative journalist eddie brock tom hardy is seeking out his next big story when he accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alterego called venom eddie becomes the ultimate antihero as he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from an evil bioengineering corporation    a character like venom is crying out for the âdeadpoolâ treatment it quickly becomes clear that the studio was too afraid to go allout and make an rrated villain movie although making this film for adults wouldâtmve greatly helped there are feeble attempts at comedy that just arenâtmt funny i can think of just two scenes that barely made me chuckle    even worse are the lame action scenes and cheesy cgi director ruben fleischer takes the worst parts of michael bayâtms style with lots of shaky jump cuts and fiery explosions and slaps âtmem all together for lazy sequences like an animated motorcycle versus drone chase through downtown san francisco in a bigbudget marvel superhero movie i shouldnâtmt be bored senseless during the action scenes yet here i was disinterested and disengaged every single time    hardy is likeable enough as eddie but his nemesis carlton drake riz ahmed and lawyer girlfriend anne michelle williams add little to the plot or in terms of onscreen charisma i wouldnâtmt go so far as to say the film was miscast but nothing really clicks between any of the performers    hardcore fans of the comics may enjoy âvenomâ more than an average moviegoer but the film is ultimately too weird and confusing with an ending thatâtms just stupid    a screen zealots review
Nov 15 2018,positive,best villain superhero movie ive ever seen venom is supposed to be mostly bad though there is no way that the actor could ever have been a news reporter
Nov 15 2018,positive,im going to be honest i was proceeding with caution when i heard more about this didnt really have a strong desire to see it truth be told while a bit slow at the start the film really picks up at the second and third act providing a fun ride throughout the dynamic between eddie and venom is definitely one of the highest points of the film providing a little bit of humor and heart while the villain was basic and there were some bumps with the narrative this is still a solid film 
Nov 15 2018,positive,husband and i loved it had us laughing
Nov 15 2018,negative,being a comic book fan i was extremely dissatisfied with this movie because it had a lot of potential but it just didnt succeed in what it was trying to do it was trying to be multiple different things at once and the result is a mediocre comedy movie
Nov 15 2018,positive,why you did not like it it is awesome 
Nov 15 2018,positive,movie will not let villains be evil anymore but this movie gets close  ill admit i dont know much about venom overall but this movie did enough so that a 40yr old and a 10 yr old both enjoyed it  ive already recommended this to friends
Nov 15 2018,positive,critics just cant let anyone enjoy fun movies anymore i highly recommend this movie if you like superhero movies
Nov 15 2018,positive,shame this movie didnt get a better rating  felt it should have been received i believe that it was the perfect introduction of the character it was supposed to be chaotic and noisy thats what all scifi movies are what were they expecting its a comic character coming to life it will always take time to fine tune the character but i guess everyone expects genius on the first go get real
Nov 15 2018,negative,perfect so bad its good movie   perfect for drinking games   watch it  definitely  immediately
Nov 15 2018,positive,one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen
Nov 15 2018,positive,this movie was hilarious it made me and my brother laugh so hard when we saw it
Nov 15 2018,positive,great film dont listen to critics 
Nov 15 2018,positive,dope afnot for everyone though
Nov 15 2018,positive,i really enjoyed tom hardys relationship with venom it was really interesting to see them working together to kick ass or him argue with venom about kicking ass 
Nov 14 2018,positive,great movie very entertaining  my cousins loved it cant wait to for the sequel 
Nov 14 2018,positive,way better than it should have been on paper props to tom hardy and the director for making gold out of the concept the villain is forgettable
Nov 14 2018,neutral,yes i gave it a 25 but you should still go see it this movie is great and hopefully the start of a great franchise but i believe it suffered from not flipping the switch and making it rated r the venom symbiote is the best part of the movie its funny thereâtms a lot of funny moments that the whole family will love but i think it shouldâtmve been darker humor i fell the plot is rushed to make room for the 30 min car chase that we seen in all of the trailers loved the casting though eddie brock tom hardy michelle williams there dialogue can carry this franchise i canâtmt wait to see what this movie franchise has in store for us i know you will love it but i know sony can do better
Nov 14 2018,positive,tom hardy makes this movie succeed he is in every way spectacular
Nov 14 2018,positive,this movie is so bad but in a good way
Nov 14 2018,positive,what a great twist movie
Nov 14 2018,positive,while being presented as a horror film the trouth is that the movie is a comedy there are some flaws and plot holes not having a definitive theme is one of them it is still a good movie but it could have been much better if the studio stuck with the horror or comedy
Nov 14 2018,positive,some unnecessary scenes nice performance from tom hardy great action and humour moments
Nov 14 2018,positive,awesome movie  loved it  great to see stan at the end after his passing
Nov 14 2018,positive,i dont think that this movie is bad infant i actually think its pretty good its not the best movie of this year but its certainly good this movie had a decent story good action scenes excellent cgi and some halarious scenes the only thing i hated was the riot subplot because it didnt really feel important and was thrown into the movie at random times other than that this movie is good and i highly recommend it
Nov 14 2018,positive,i went to see this film with a few friends and i noticed a few minor things they didnt do well some of the plot felt a bit rushed and the turn around from venom wanting to take over humanity to wanting to live in humanity was almost instantaneous and i noticed barely any buildup to explain the decision eddie brock while being a good character portrayed wonderfully by tom hardy was extremely believable when he lost his life and went crazy unfortunately while i believe he is a wonderful actor i think he has the look to him of crazy and ruined so you could have told me at the beginning that his life was already ruined and i would have wholeheartedly believed you otherwise i thought most of it was good i loved the banter between venom and eddie and found myself laughing at many moments finally it was short most superhero movies these days are two and a half to three hours so it was a breath of relief that this movie didnt last very long if you are looking for a short lighthearted watch ill recommend it but it also has many flaws that can hinder your enjoyment so keep that in mind if you decide to watch
Nov 14 2018,positive,the critics are from another planet do yourself a favor and ignore them this movie is awesome
Nov 14 2018,positive,this movie is great
Nov 14 2018,negative,worst film i have seen this year 
Nov 13 2018,positive,movie is great it doesnt mean that it is terrible
Nov 13 2018,neutral,very funny with a great lead performance but still there are dodgy effects and some action scenes that just feel off supporting characters are weak but the cinematography is well done
Nov 13 2018,positive,this movie was awesome i do not understand why it has such awful reviews but from a fan that has always wanted a better venom moviethis was it they absolutely knocked it out  of the parkthe cgi was on point the comedy was hilarious and the ending was awesomein my opinion the fist second and third act  was done perfectly i honestly do not see how they could of done it any better especially since they couldnt use spiderman in the movie      well done i would absolutely give this two thumbs way up and a standing ovation
Nov 13 2018,positive,okay movie but if you wear glasses like myself you may want to wait till its available for home purchase some of the action was a bit too fast and blurry in my opinion
Nov 13 2018,positive,surprisingly funny i enjoyed it 
Nov 12 2018,positive,what a nice movie this movie reminds me of iron man everything in the movie works fine and i like the result
Nov 12 2018,positive,1010 would recommend this movie to anyone they did a really good job with this movie i thought it was gonna suck cause it wasnt rated r but it turned out great
Nov 12 2018,positive,venom is a film of two halfs if you can make it through the first 40 minutes of a clichã cd villain failed but still a spark there romance and some plot about saving humanity from overpopulation and global warming by turning us into monsters theres a remaining 40 minutes of absurd humour and exciting sequences the eddie brockvenom dynamic is so off beat and hilarious its worth the admission price alone
Nov 12 2018,positive,its a good movie but i felt it a little bit rushed i expected to see more from venom but every time he showed up it was amazing the postcredit scene is a must see
Nov 12 2018,neutral,it felt like something out of 2004 but id be lying if i said i wasnt entertained its a pretty awful movie but the scene with the lobster tank alone gives this an extra star
Nov 12 2018,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a while i definitely recommend it
Nov 12 2018,positive,should not have enjoyed this film  as much as i did but i did
Nov 12 2018,positive,i enjoyed it  a little cheesy at points
Nov 12 2018,positive,i really liked venom i dont get why people hate on it it was entertaining and i just loved it
Nov 12 2018,negative,boring slow yet rush origin of a violent antihero that is barely showed and developed
Nov 12 2018,positive,the previews do not do justice for this movie at all it was so good and went beyond my expectations me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed this movie i would definitely see it in theaters again you dont have to know much about venom to understand the film they do a good job at detailing that aspect of his origins 
Nov 12 2018,positive,dont believe the critics great movie funny and you dont need to follow any of the other movies that are supposed to explain venom to really enjoy this
Nov 12 2018,positive,movie was entertaining and tom hardy carries this it should have been darker and more vulgar but it was entertaining and i enjoyed myself
Nov 11 2018,neutral,netflix it took way too long for the character development an hour too long the last 30 minutes were great but not worth waiting 15 hours for it 
Nov 11 2018,negative,film history poison 
Nov 11 2018,positive,i was actually impressed with how good this movie is 
Nov 11 2018,negative,i went in with very low expectations i had to think about it for a while afterwards to decide my opinion but jeezi kinda hated it i didnt find the humor in it and it didnt play cheesy well
Nov 11 2018,neutral,despite its many flaws venom is worth the watch thanks to tom hardys performance    the film has several pitfalls typical of superhero films a one note baddie strange pacing and a bland relationship that serves no real narrative purpose the script suffers from pacing issues but has some hints of socioeconomic allegory that lends some depth to the generic shallow action flick script     the fact that venom is marvels first antihero movie coupled with the benefit of it having its own universe free of the dense lore of the other films adds a dash of originality venoms graphics are a strong suite and other than the unspeakably atrocious soundtrack is competently made tom hardys eddie brock is the saving grace of the film his wisecracking sardonicism is a flex of toms typically more stoic range the film manages to be comedic without ruining the tone of the movie  which ended up being less gritty and more fun than id expected partially due to the good chemistry between venom and eddie     overall for what it is venom is a thoroughly entertaining movie for any action movie fans who can stomach its flaws
Nov 11 2018,positive,cant wait to see sequel
Nov 11 2018,positive,first half of the movie is so slow i was almost nodding off also tom hardy isnt a great actor when it comes to the up close emotional scenes the second half was better with tons of action and a few laughs here tom hardy fits well with venoms character and it worked out ok only a soso movie overall 
Nov 11 2018,positive,i loved this movie and hope they will make a second and not just tease us like the amazing spiderman 2
Nov 11 2018,positive,venom was a great movie the numbers speak for themselves your critics have zero credibility they were only trying to promote a star is born remake lol
Nov 11 2018,positive,the plot was pretty poor it seemed like it was more of a comedy movie and not really an action movie the other issue was that it seemed very rushed
Nov 11 2018,positive,great film  not sure what the critics were watching but itâtms worth seeing just for tom hardyâtms interactions with the symbiote  29 fresh  in this era of distrust of the media these guys arenâtmt helping
Nov 11 2018,positive,this movie was soo funny
Nov 11 2018,positive,short film but it still was an awesome movie
Nov 11 2018,positive,absolutely excellent and tom hardy is amazing as always
Nov 11 2018,positive,really good movie fast paced tight storytelling and great characters make this movie make up for its messy final battle that somewhat ruined the greatness of the move highly underrated
Nov 11 2018,positive,brilliant  simply brilliant
Nov 11 2018,neutral,marvel studios is just trying to get more audience and box officedespite the disappointment of being a comic book lover the film doesnt even telling a good story 255
Nov 11 2018,positive,over all its a good movie i feel like there is too much fluff and the movie doesnt flow as well as it could
Nov 11 2018,positive,very fun movie will be a great addition to the sonymcu
Nov 11 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie is awesome
Nov 11 2018,positive,will definitely be purchasing this video 
Nov 11 2018,positive,very entertaining writing was okay but the action was a loved it
Nov 10 2018,positive,i went into this movie not expecting much but actually really enjoyed it i really liked the main character he was different from other leads i also like his relationship with venom i will definitely buy this movie once it has been released on blue ray
Nov 10 2018,neutral,venom is not a good movie but it has a sort of charm to it that keeps you watching its the the room of super hero films and both star actors named tom
Nov 10 2018,positive,once i realized this was not a serious horrorsci fi movie i decided to go it was great very interesting and funny the relationship between the host and parasite was nicely symbiotic and action was well choreographed more of this please 
Nov 10 2018,positive,it is not exceptional but it is fun gripping and it has a twist what not to like honestly i do not understand how critics rated it so low
Nov 10 2018,neutral,fun but needlessly gross a times
Nov 10 2018,negative,one for the tweens i guess really bad
Nov 10 2018,positive,fun plot has lots of holes but fun
Nov 10 2018,negative,most idiotic movie ive seen in a long time  dont even know where to begin listing the head shaking moments
Nov 10 2018,positive,it was amazing and so funny
Nov 10 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the film but there was a few problem like tom hardys accent was pretty weird at times  im just saying but other then some of the problems i really enjoyed it but it still was one of the worst superhero films this year
Nov 10 2018,positive,definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen im a marvel fanatic and i wasnt really that interested in venom until i watched the movie after i watched it i absolutely fell in love with the character venom i loved it so much and would definitely recommend it has comedy action fun characters horror awesome animation thats realistic a bit of romance and friendship i love and appreciate this movie a lot big thanks to the creators and stan lee job well done very good job lots of love ps already watched it 3 times âtm 1010
Nov 10 2018,positive,i sooo wanna own this
Nov 10 2018,positive,is about what you would expect from a sony spiderman movie not completely unbearable but i wouldnt spend more then a couple bucks to see it
Nov 10 2018,positive,no the best but entertain 
Nov 10 2018,positive,venom is the type of movie for me where there are some parts where it is so badass and the next it is so stupid and useless that it hurts to watch the beginning threw me off and the riot hosts are the worst parts of the movie the villain was weak and didnâtmt give you a feel of sympathy fear or interest at all the dialogue was a little rough too the female scientist that confronts eddie especially made me cringe however the visual effects were spot on with how the antihero works the final fight scene was badass and basically all fight scenes were just the giant highlight of the movie the hilarious banter between eddie and venom is what makes this movie watchable tom hardy nails it and i will see it again
Nov 10 2018,positive,much better than i anticipated
Nov 10 2018,positive,the gayest movie i have ever seen i loved it
Nov 10 2018,positive,movie is a lot of fun
Nov 10 2018,positive,loved it much better than expected 
Nov 10 2018,negative,story telling sucks
Nov 10 2018,positive,it was okay at best harmless to say the least at worst just different 
Nov 10 2018,positive,good story very entertaining  it looks like we live in parallel universes with the critics 
Nov 10 2018,positive,this was a very entertaining move it kept me my attention the entire time i waited to go to the restroom until the movie was over because i didnt want to miss anything
Nov 9 2018,positive,my main problem with this movie was the pacing and editing both were all over the place a few scenes seemed like they were missing a lot of stuff no really there was one scene that just stopped none of the scenes had proper transitions this could be the main reason that the pacing was awful as well the pacing in this film was off for this type of movie this is supposed to be an actionpacked thrill ride but its just slow now the main villain is just so bland he has no evil mastermind plan and doesnt even have a reason for doing what he does he doesnt act like a villain now the acting in this film wasnt that bad but it just didnt come across as people i want to root to win one thing i look for in movies is character development and if the characters had any this movie had very little to none the final bad thing i want to talk about is the tone of the film this film is pg in canada and pg13 in usa so they had to throw in some humour for the kids but when it doesnt fit the tone of the movie dont there were way too many forced jokes into this movie that was just out of place now the only good thing about this movie was the action shots once the action happened then thats when i was fully invested in the movie the action shots and the music that went with it was terrific they looked well rehearsed and well shot and the editing on those scenes were spectacular in the end venom was a slow movie that was only worth it for the action scenes and probably would have been better with an r rating
Nov 9 2018,positive,great actionloved it
Nov 9 2018,positive,it is a great movie  dont know what the critics are on about  after greatest showman i tend to look more at the audience score than the critics seems as if they are getting more and more out of touch with audiences
Nov 9 2018,positive,a very unbalanced film trying to be profound in its swipes at corporate greed and the abuses of power while trying to excite through fastpaced action sequences tom hardy one of my favourite modern actors turns in a very bizarre performance acting less like heâtms being controlled by an otherworldly force and more like heâtms having a combined caffeinesugar withdrawal twitching and shuddering like heâtms anticipating his next fix the action scenes manage to be mostly comprehensible and largely exciting aside from the last one where 2 dark beasts fight in close quarters in the dark of night making it almost impossible to understand whatâtms happening itâtms cruel to say so but it looks like it came straight from the âmichael bay school of filming action sequencesâtm the film always feels like itâtms in a hurry to get to the next plot point or chase scene or stab at how evil the villain is that thereâtms little chance for character development we know very little about eddie brock before heâtms venomised except that his life is a little rubbish so thereâtms not much to latch onto when heâtms infected despite hardyâtms best efforts the film isnâtmt terrible itâtms loud chaotic and poorly developed for sure but it does have its merits the cgi is incredible the action you can make out is fun and it does have reply value itâtms a shaky start to this impending cinematic universe but itâtms certainly more promising than the mummy
Nov 9 2018,positive,fuck what the critics say its a great movie
Nov 9 2018,positive,this is a really good movie part horror part comedypart hero movie ill watch it again ignore the bad reviews by critics they must be on dcs payroll this movie rocks
Nov 9 2018,positive,as a comic book fan i was afraid of this some movie because i have already heard so many negative things about it including not having spiderman which is a head scratcher but after watching the movie i was thoroughly entertained and rather enjoyed it how would they include spiderman i have no clue to this i and i doubt they will since they already have a story for the other symbiote ive learned over the years not to expect to see a complete comic book movie so just enjoy it for what it is 
Nov 9 2018,positive,awesome movie i ever watched
Nov 9 2018,positive,i was not really expecting that much given the 29 tomatometer but tom hardy is always worth a watch once again hardy shows his acting genius transformation into a humorous monster worthy of empathy definitely entertaining
Nov 9 2018,positive,i loved this movie so funny and i loved eddie and the symbiots relationship defiantly not the venom from my childhood but the venom we deserved
Nov 9 2018,positive,venom was a fantastic movie in my opinion i dont know what critics have against it one big point seems to be the detachment to spiderman which i personally quite like as i think spiderman is boring cliche and just useless
Nov 9 2018,positive,id let venom eat my ass please please tom hardy pleease tom hardy
Nov 9 2018,positive,takes a while to get going in my opinion but the last half hour or so are good
Nov 9 2018,positive,a very fun ride and excellent origin room to improve but nothing that takes away from a enjoyable comic book movie
Nov 9 2018,positive,that was a lot of fun to watch there are plotholes and some inconsistencies but a fun ride eddie and the symbiote have a very interesting relationship and tom hardy is brilliant in that role
Nov 9 2018,positive,i wish tom hardy couldve had his accent in this movie i didnt buy his american accent for a second 
Nov 9 2018,positive,could have been deadpool levels of good with an r rating still a fun ride 
Nov 9 2018,positive,awesome movie very exciting and like the the character venom plus tom hardy the real deal very talented individual well on his way to be one of the greats like pachino oldman deniro etc 
Nov 8 2018,positive,this is without a doubt the best antihero movie ive ever seen heck its even more fun to watch than both deadpool movies
Nov 8 2018,positive,good but could have been better
Nov 8 2018,positive,i truly enjoyed this movie i didnt know this about the venom character until now i would see this movie again anytime
Nov 8 2018,positive,movie was better than what critics said also funny ready peoples comments that didnt like this movie they sound like they want to be critics or something 
Nov 8 2018,positive,good movie tom hardy does great and san fran feels real bring on the sequel
Nov 8 2018,positive,venom is ok entertainment  some decent action and some comedy too with the inner dialogue with the symbiote inside of eddie brock    the plot was pretty predictable from the start other than where is spiderman  looking back i bet it was a licensing issue not including his main adversary and why venom was made more likeable and less evil than his backstory from what i know of it  i wasnt expecting something as good as infinity war so i wasnt that dissapointed  by the movie it was like i said before ok and worth a watch for the average viewer
Nov 8 2018,positive,im starting not to trust the critics lol i liked this movie and everyone i know that saw it liked it also
Nov 8 2018,positive,i thought venom held its own i liked the comedy and action tom hardy was awesome
Nov 8 2018,negative,they could of done better
Nov 8 2018,positive,very very nice movie i enjoyed every minute and i loved the jokes
Nov 8 2018,positive,i really wish this was a r rated movie that would have beed awesome instead we got this mess it has its moments but i felt i was missing something the whole time  ps spoiler i had to laugh when venom said listen eddie on my planet im kind of a looser like you really tom hardy cant play a looser ever
Nov 8 2018,positive,i mean its entertaining for me and thats really enough
Nov 8 2018,neutral,tom was great but the story was boring
Nov 7 2018,positive,i loved this movie im planning on going back to see it again highly recommend it
Nov 7 2018,positive,great  flick if it had a higher rating for more blood and gore  id have given it 5 stars
Nov 7 2018,positive,could it been better but overall entertaining and good to watch if you are a marvel fan 
Nov 7 2018,positive,this movie was exciting artistically gloomy at times and was surprisingly hilarious overall a great projects with great directions and effects there were some plot holes created by the actions of the bad guy but it is drowned out with tom hardys amazing performance and the fun atmosphere of this movie 
Nov 7 2018,positive,do not believe the critics at all  venom is a pretty solid movie with some great action scenes story telling and also had some funny scenes as well  was it a perfect movieno but its one definitely worth watching
Nov 7 2018,neutral,a fun ride with some pretty decent fightaction scenes with a few laughs thrown in as well a few cringeworthy scenes bring parts of the film undone really lacks the bite of a marvel studios production 
Nov 7 2018,positive,the movie had an odd balance of comedy and action with eddie going slightly insane about the symbiote inside his body and venoms random oneliners throughout the movie and their brotherlike relationship always insulting each other and fighting but also having each others back though the critics may talk about how bad it was i thought it had a great plot and execution
Nov 7 2018,negative,ugh where do i begin the character of eddie brock and venom is the only thing that makes this movie some what worth watching the action the comedy and the whole plot just felt honestly unnecessary not worth your time if youre wanting to watch a good superhero movie
Nov 7 2018,positive,it feels like everyone has something to say about venom amongst critics and fans its caused a lot of debate and controversy whenever this happens i tend to find myself becoming even more curious about the film because if everyone else has strong words to say maybe i will too    before i begin my review i just want to put in a quick disclaimer i am by no means a comic book expert and i dont claim to be marvels number one fan if anything im a casual fan so this review is coming from the mind of a film lover and nothing more now thats out of the way    venom was quick to grab my attention when it was first announced as im always interested when marvel move into darker grittier territories i have a soft spot for villains and venoms character is definitely one of the coolest ones in the franchise there are few things scarier than the thought of a parasite taking over your body so the horror elements definitely drew me towards the film visually venom does utilise things we would associate with horror such as long lingering shots and sudden jumpy moments whilst theyre nothing new or particularly outstanding i did enjoy this side to the film symbiotes as a concept are terrifying so it only seemed fair to portray them in this way    tom hardy gives a great performance as eddie brock especially during his interactions with venom the comedic side to this film was genuinely funny and gave the audience some light relief after the more horrifying scenes this dynamic between eddie and venom is what really stood out to me as they owned the vast majority of screen time and had to keep the audience entertained for me it worked and it had some serious laughoutloud moments    some of the scenes are a bit ridiculous but ive quickly learned to expect a bit of implausibility when it comes to comic book movies i wasnt bothered by some of the sillier scenes though i can see why someone would want to criticise them the one thing i was bothered by however was the plot holes and confusing lines within the film that so i felt this did weaken the script in places im certainly in agreement that the writing was lazy overall nonetheless i was still entertained by 90 of the film and i dont think thats a bad thing the action scenes were fun chaotic and made even better by venoms presence inside eddies head without that i might not have enjoyed them as much    i liked the visual effects throughout the film and was particularly creeped out by the way the symbiote looked before it finds a host the scenes set within the life foundations facility stood out to me reminiscent of other films where science goes wrong its clinical confusing and isolating making you feel just as uncomfortable and scared as those undergoing the trials i really enjoyed the twisted side to this narrative showing us a dark side to corporations as films often do    is venom the best film ive seen this year of course its not but it was a fun way to spend 2 hours on a sunday evening and thats good enough for me its a very average very three star film that kept me entertained its nothing more than that and to me thats okay
Nov 7 2018,positive,i loved every aspect of it but i give it 45 stars due to the fact we didnt see venom until 3 quarters of the way through the movie
Nov 7 2018,positive,it was so good more of a comedy than an action movie actually a thriller it is way better than the trailer the trailer was very bad the movie is great
Nov 6 2018,positive,awesome beginning a little gross but after that it was a great movie
Nov 6 2018,negative,it tried too hard at comedy and not hard enough at action
Nov 6 2018,positive,venom delivered a good combination of destruction and mayhem balanced with a decent plot and some humour at the same time the feeling was it didnt meet its full potential
Nov 6 2018,positive,this was a very cool film different but cool looks like they had a bunch of fun making it 
Nov 6 2018,negative,yes it is speckled with recycled tropes and plot holes yet it still manages to be fun and entertaining
Nov 6 2018,positive,even though the cgi wasnt up to par with other marvel movies it had a budget of about 116 million dollars the script at time felt like it was a natural reaction to understand you actually have to know venom before you see it that is where i feel most of the people that watched this movie fell short they walked in thinking it would bae a light hearted movie like all the mcu movies were but this is not a mcu movie it is just associated with marvel they broke the tone of those movies and made it their own which i felt was terrific
Nov 6 2018,positive,i loved it  i dont usually write reviews but the critics suck on their ratings
Nov 6 2018,negative,worst movie of the year in my opinion  no redeeming qualities  horrible pacing  worse than spawn 1997
Nov 6 2018,positive,venom was more entertaining than we expected  the previews do not hint at the dark humor in the show  the reason why the symbiote decides to stay with eddy is hilarious and the cameo in the end credits is also pretty funny  tom hardy did a good job at playing a weird quirky character that you cant really like or dislike but feels like a real person
Nov 6 2018,positive,cant wait til part 2
Nov 6 2018,positive,loved it big fan of this movie 
Nov 6 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy is as always  intoxicating the big screen really does this one justice its a must see
Nov 6 2018,positive,a fun interesting tongue in cheek and morally ambigious story  fun and horrifying in equal measure the bad guy is seriously psycopathic charm which is more terrifying then thanos imo the movie was enjoyable and doesnt take itself too seriously  another movie where the critics show they have no idea what we audience actually want to watch  highly recommend for fun exciting entertainment
Nov 5 2018,positive,wasnt a great movie but it wasnt a bad movie either it was a really good movie it was pretty funny and hardys performance was great
Nov 5 2018,positive,taking in consideration this is the first film of a possible sequel or trilogy you have to let somethings slide the movie was really enjoyable and entertaining two of the main things you want from a movie antihero wise venom does fit that bill perfectly thanks to brock and all of those who do know their comics will be generally satisfied with this representation of venom too many jokes maybe but then again in the comics venom does have a comedic side here and there so that it is not all wrong
Nov 5 2018,positive,enjoyed this movie very much
Nov 5 2018,positive,i definitely feel like venom is a superhero film that is fairly underrated by critics yes it obviously isnt the best superhero movie weve seen and it isnt incredible but does it deserve the bad reviews its getting from the majority of critics no i wanted to see venom but when i started hearing reviews for it i became a little more skeptical and didnt expect much after a while when i was able to see it for 10 because of a coupon and 5 tuesday i went in thinking it would be fun but not too good but when i walked out it was definitely better than i thought it would be it was definitely enjoyable but there were other good parts to it as well tom hardy gives a good performance playing eddie brock a person whos struggling with something thats partly taken over him which is an internal conflict which is what got tom hardy to play the part in the first place he liked the character venom and what i said is one of the reasons tom hardy is an amazing actor and thats one reason i wanted to see this michelle williams also gives a good performance playing his girlfriendexgirlfriend whos struggling to find out whats going on riz ahmed who plays the bad guy does a good job doesnt do as good as the first two but makes a good villain the visual effects arent as good as other superhero movies weve seen but they were good the action scenes were also really nice the direction by ruben fleischer isnt anything special but was okay one thing that caused critics to dislike it was the slightly messy script which i agree it kind of is but its not that bad overall its definitely a superhero film that fans and possibly others will enjoy
Nov 5 2018,neutral,it was good until it fell apart halfway through the last act felt rushed there were plot holes venom was a wishwashh character
Nov 5 2018,positive,i give this film a good rating because i love venom it was great to see him done right on the silver screen but also because i had a lot of fun watching this film
Nov 5 2018,negative,good action but not much else venom himself is surprisingly not in the movie as much as you think wouldnt pay to see it 
Nov 5 2018,positive,fivth best movie of the year for me third best superhero movie of the year i hope they dont add spiderman in this series though i dont think it would fit plus too many spider man movies
Nov 5 2018,positive,this movie is everything venom is funny but yet still serious venom has good screen time and tom hardy looks like hes having a blast
Nov 5 2018,positive,amazing 10 out of 10
Nov 5 2018,positive,true venom movie sticking with the comics perspective and ideals
Nov 5 2018,positive,rotten tomatoes voted rotten but we voted fresh tomatoes 
Nov 5 2018,positive,this was the best movie i have ever seen in theater the acting was phenomenal and the 1 liners were pristine i will name my first born child venom in honor of the significance of this movie the only downside to any marvel or action movie is the waste of time morning or making the crowd suffer through heartbreak where as in this movie it says six months later and gets right back into it the reason it is so good is because it doesnt have a strong attachment to spider man venom is more than a rival to spider man and is more than a villain the movie stets the platform for venom to become a super hero 1010 would recommend
Nov 5 2018,positive,if youre still trying to watch a marvel movie expecting something ground breaking like taxi driver or if youre a die hard comic fan boy you will not enjoy this movie however if you are a mcu fan and enjoy how movies are portraying the marvel universe then you will most likely at the very least enjoy this film for me this is one of my favorite marvel movies to date tom hardy was top notch and as you can tell im not that much into comics although i have read some and have some basic knowledge in spiderman lore but i gotta say this movie made me love venom even if its not portrayed as the comics
Nov 5 2018,positive,the only thing i wish that it had was to have been longer  i cant wait to see what they do with the second film
Nov 5 2018,positive,venom is an absolutely brilliant marvel film with an added bit of comedy which is sometimes missed
Nov 5 2018,positive,my husband and i took our grandsons we all loved this movie 
Nov 5 2018,positive,venom  an empty kind of fun
Nov 5 2018,negative,ripoff of upgrade but bad
Nov 5 2018,positive,forget the critics  watch this movie 
Nov 5 2018,negative,i wanted to like this movie absolutely the worse marvel film i have ever seen 
Nov 5 2018,negative,had high hopes but was let down by the stupid voice and horrible story line you arent invested in the main character at all so who really cares about whats about to happen to him i walked out after an hour 
Nov 5 2018,negative,that was so stupid a movie needs more than special effects to be worth seeing where is the storytelling with these blockbuster special effects shows
Nov 5 2018,positive,this movie is the exact reason i stopped listen to critic reviews absolutely outstanding
Nov 4 2018,positive,not sure why the critics gave this movie such bad reviews cause it really was fantastic action packed with a reasonable amount of comedy definitely worth watching
Nov 4 2018,positive,i personally enjoyed this movie and i only have a few critiques the cgi wasnt the best especially in the scenes stated the first fight scene where eddie grows a black forearmhand and punches some man a scene where eddie asks his neighbor to turn down the music and hisses at him the dialogue was pretty bad here are some examples where is he wheres venom eddie carlton drake and riot both know what he is looking for i feel like the wheres venom part is not needed and just doest fit i think there were some very funny scenes in the movie like the scene where venom and eddie have a conversation about jumping out the window and eddie chooses the elevator venom replies on this matter saying pus this part of the movie proves that they are two different people with different fears ideas and thoughts most of the time i really enjoyed this movie
Nov 4 2018,positive,venom 2018 is 91 certified fresh
Nov 4 2018,neutral,this movie was horible but loved it
Nov 4 2018,positive,went to it twice and both times had an amazing great experience
Nov 4 2018,positive,this was an amazing movie i dont understand how some people said the acting was bad or something you should definitely go see it
Nov 4 2018,positive,i love this movie its super funny and super oddly romantic and cute dark romantic comedy with tons of action and suspense and a villain whos clearly elon musk
Nov 4 2018,neutral,the first half is boring the second half would have been better if they hadnt wasted so much time in the beginningthat being said i liked it better than guardians of the galaxy
Nov 4 2018,positive,i will admit i was leery of this film after the last venom debacle sony gave us but i was pleasantly surprised tom hardy is an amazing actor and he did very well in this movie the lack of spider man does remove some depth but as a stand alone it was great way better than spider man 3
Nov 4 2018,positive,it was a fun movie i dont know why the critics are ragging on it other than they dont understand the appeal of superhero movies
Nov 4 2018,positive,really good would watch again
Nov 4 2018,positive,almost everything i wanted out of a marvel action flick tom hardy didnt play venom like the comic books even the the way he played ed brock in the movie felt detached
Nov 4 2018,positive,not an amazing plot but the lively relationship between venom and tom hardy is enough to make this a great movie would recomend this to be seen in theatres better than a movie you wait for to hit âon demandâ special effexts and action scenes were great
Nov 4 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to critic
Nov 4 2018,positive,great characters bad story to tell
Nov 4 2018,positive,awesome impersonation of venom
Nov 4 2018,positive,a lol of good humor and very entertaining venom himself was very cleverly constructed  too much blob backstory and a chase scene that dragged on way too long  not the cartoon venom you would have suspected
Nov 4 2018,positive,it was funthough the villain was a bit weak but otherwise it was a fairly entertaining movie  looking forward to seeing it again
Nov 4 2018,positive,not the smartest movie but a lot of fun to watch
Nov 4 2018,positive,easily one of the best marvel movies of this year lots of action good plot development and an appropriately amount of humor thats not over done or require constant breaking of the fourth wall to get a laugh like with deadpool a must see movie
Nov 4 2018,negative,a jumble of botched special effects cheap jokes and embarrassing characters thats a shame because this character of venom is really attractive and well designed  unsatisfactory
Nov 4 2018,positive,the movie is great and awesome
Nov 4 2018,positive,tom hardy and the relationship with the symbiote carries the movie other than that the villain is generic the effects are average and the writing is subpar
Nov 4 2018,positive,the foreshadowing whilst understandable cannot be avoided to the experienced film watcher
Nov 4 2018,positive,i understand why people think the movie itself isnt good but i had the time of my life watching eddie brocks and venom together even if other characters didnt have any depth it was really entertaining honestly if spiderman were in it it would have been a totally different movie and would have felt forced loved the performance of tom hardy though
Nov 4 2018,positive,we loved this movie
Nov 4 2018,positive,i enjoyed it im not sure why the critics dont
Nov 4 2018,positive,i like movie very much it just pity that movie dont last longer
Nov 4 2018,positive,i loved this movie with all my heart and i would die for venom and eddie
Nov 4 2018,positive,i may be biased because i love tom hardy but ive alwaya loved the venom character as well it has it slow moments but every movie does you really get a feel for the beginning adventures of venom and eddie brock cant wait for another movie
Nov 4 2018,positive,entertaining movie but not as good as the marvel ones
Nov 4 2018,positive,really good movie love it
Nov 4 2018,neutral,this movieis weird looking at the reviewers and audience scores theres an even bigger divide in reviews then justice league i think this movie is better then a 29 but its also worse then a 87 for me this movie is about a 55 what did i like about this movie the character of venom the car chase the tower fight scene and the special effects now what i didnt like the first half of the movie the setup of eddie brock is really not interestingthe love interest feels so forced into the movie of course you have the doctor brocks girls new boyfriend this movie is trying to be antman really badly the way eddie gets venom in the first place is such dumb luck when eddie gets venom he does things like eat trash or eat an entire bag of tater tots that are frozenor find his girlfriend and a seafood place and bite off a lobsters head so that whole part of the movie is a waste second the life company and riot who are the two main villains of the movie riot is characterless cgi blob that has no motivation whatsoever plus the indian guy is incredibly stereotypical company man archetype who cares only about business for me at least the whole movie feels like some of the writers were trying and others were using sonys cookiecutter style script its worth a watch but thats about it if youre looking for a better antihero movie i suggest deadpool why deadpool well deadpool doesnt have an obnoxious eminem song and the worst end credit scene ever anyway venom is fine but not a good piece of filmmaking its not as good as a regular marvel movie but not as bad as a dc movie this one gets a 510
Nov 4 2018,positive,critics got it wrong great film good laughs what is wrong with people today that they cant just enjoy a good entertaining film
Nov 4 2018,positive,not the best movie ever certainly but it is one of the most fun movies out there made me laugh at many points and made my adrenaline rush throughout
Nov 4 2018,positive,i really loved the movie
Nov 4 2018,positive,good story good action
Nov 3 2018,negative,very boring and plain poor acting performance from tom hardy very sad this film was a let down not looking forward in seeing part 2
Nov 3 2018,positive,an excellent movie a bit of a slow start with great payoff the only bad thing i can point out is when the big fight scene happens in the end itâtms hard to distinguish the two symbiotes
Nov 3 2018,positive,definitely not a professional critic but this movie was amazing the whole theme was dark and mysterious but it had that humor that movies often seem to miss characters were extremely well developed  and you could definitely feel what they felt loved every minute of it
Nov 3 2018,positive,very awesome movie cant wait until next one 
Nov 3 2018,positive,venom is misunderstood by the majority of critics the criticism that it shifts tones rapidly is key to why the movie is as good as it is     the character is literally two personalities in a single body one is a human reporter and the other is an alien who fears little from the dangers he puts eddie through the movie does an excellent job  with these dueling personalities     the humour is also a character trait that venom had during the lethal protector run and after the symbiote is often unintentionally hilarious its part of the characters charm in the way it tries to interact while not knowing what humans do    the movie would have been perfect if not for the cardboard cut out portrayal of ann weying i found her to be very rigid and what seemed to amount to just a set piece with very little heart its sad when a good actress is outperformed by a cgi head voiced by hardy    i enjoyed this movie and believe anyone who likes venom will as well
Nov 3 2018,positive,of course everyone is chiming in about how its not exactly like the comics well name a marvel movie that has ever come out that was great acting from tom hardy great cgi overall great movie watch the movie as it is not how you think it should be in your head
Nov 3 2018,positive,this movie was fun  not every movie has to have a poignant moment to please the artsy crowd just enjoy the ride  and this was a good one
Nov 3 2018,positive,this movie was fun it was truly action packed and even marvel movies that i love i find i check the time not this one  not every thing has to have a poignant moment to please the arty crowd just have some fun
Nov 3 2018,positive,very good not sure why its getting bad reviews great movie deserves better reviews
Nov 3 2018,positive,one of the single greatest films i have ever seen
Nov 3 2018,positive,though it was incredibly entertaining and i loved the comedy it was written terribly so many plot points and characters seemed thrown together poorly 
Nov 3 2018,negative,not really venom poor performance mediocre effects
Nov 3 2018,positive,it was an entertaining movie with humour lots of cool fight scenes honestly i have no idea which movie the criticts watched if you want an entertaining funny and overall enjoyable anti hero movie watch this
Nov 3 2018,positive,this will be better in the sequel
Nov 3 2018,neutral,i donâtmt think many of us saw this coming when sonyâtms amazing spiderman franchise went ass up which i still like fight me it was assumed that the planned sinister six spinoffs with flicks dedicated to spideyâtms rogueâtms gallery were also kaput and with the marvel cinematic universe having acquired every nondc property within the last few years in a manner akin to the british empire circa 1905 there was probably no reason for sony to use whatever remaining rights they had to make one of these but they did it has no reason to exist critics revile it so why donâtmt i or the majority of paying audiences seem to mind it much    the answer venom is a messy trashy movie that benefits incredibly from its lead performance and enough entertaining action to make up for its shortcomings in regards to said action venom was downgraded from ratedr to pg13 and it shows in many of the more violent moments with its thin plot and ample body count it feels a breath away from becoming an exploitation film that being said i would kill to see a hard r cut of this the direction is average and the score is so generic itâtms nonexistent the reason to see it is of course tom hardy his performance is balanced between earnest confusion and great comedic timing michelle williams would seem wasted in a picture of this nature but she manages to shine in a few moments the best of which are when he is arguing with his symbiotic alterego venom itâtms also a refreshing change of pace from the very safe and formulaic mcu installments that paying audiences are getting used to as for the future of this character itâtms hard to say sony practically had to change him from a spiderman archvillain to an antihero to make him more sympathetic yet the option is still available for sony and disney to cooperate so he could face off against tom hollandâtms spiderman tom h vs tom h or michael keatonâtms vulture bane vs batman iâtmm getting ahead of myself venom is by no means a cinematic achievement but it will perfectly serve as a rental or streaming option for a lonely cold night for losers like you isnâtmt that rightâeeeeddddiiiiieeee
Nov 3 2018,positive,venom is a movie that is filled with conceptual creativity situational comedy and excitingly unique action sequences     i admit that i tend to have a bias for films where characters react to a newfound superpower or ability in that regard this is easily one of the most thrilling movies that i have seen for a long time although many criticize this movie for pandering to audiences and telling a simplistic story those arent inherently bad things the movie is in fact formulaic but the formula works  its the concept of a parasitic alien creature that uses manipulation and brute force as a means of survival and the progression of adaptation that really thrives in that mold it was it hits the points of constructing an entertaining plot and isnt that a perfectly fine thing to seek out of a movie  one way to see this film is as sonys utilization of their remaining rights to the spiderman universe in hopes to create a franchise although i think that just saying the film is only motivated by the prophet is an easy jab to take at many modernday films a statement like this that plays off of circumstances tends to be more critical of the industry practices than the actual content in that case it would be nice to see more variation from the copypaste template that is seen across superhero films if i watched 10 if these kinds of films back to back im sure i would be dying for any sort of variation from the format at least there is some variation in venom when it goes for the buddycop theme      spoilers spoilers spoilers   cons the industry is on a prophet driven basis the character motivations are somewhat confused and for a great portion of the time that the main character had powers he was a confused victim people also say that the main characters are unlikable and they didnt experience much development   pros the movie uses the idea of alien species uniquely and supplies from what i can recollect a consistent series of events the visuals are very complex and well executed the themes are entertaining such as looking at the villains point of veiw and the portrait of them as confused victims there was a very creative use of concept in fight scenes    i may end up changing my mind about the film as it is dissected further and more direct flaws are recognized in the presentation but for now under my initial opinion i like it
Nov 3 2018,positive,awesome movie my kids loved it
Nov 3 2018,positive,its not better but its acceptable
Nov 3 2018,positive,this movie deserves a 90 rating  itâtms a great movie
Nov 3 2018,positive,ignore the critics enjoy the ride one of the best antihero of this year
Nov 3 2018,positive,this movie hands down is top three favorite comic  movie ever tom hardy was amazing    u critics r tripping   love love love this movie 
Nov 3 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie venom and eddie have great interactions and overall it was very entertaining and i would recommend it
Nov 3 2018,positive,this movie was and will be one of the greatest prequels to a franchise ever
Nov 3 2018,positive,great movie was pretty funny but i thought venom was a bad guy and there wasnt really a connection to spiderman
Nov 3 2018,positive,constant action and amazing kill scenes one of the best superhero movies of all time
Nov 3 2018,neutral,great hardy but the story is simply uninspired and incomprehensible
Nov 3 2018,neutral,a big budget b movie somewhat entertaining
Nov 3 2018,negative,being a venom fan since a child i was let down by this movie i tried my best not to be bias especially like many fans was left disappointed when they decided to make this a pg13 movie instead of the r rating it deserves lets begin with the story line its setting and suspense build up is weak they tried to so hard to leave it open for sequels and to be able to expand in the future of the venom universe that they drew away from the character development not only is the chain of events that gave eddie brock tom hardy his antihero form unrealistic and seem rushed but we in general as the audience had no emotional connection with the characters because we dont empathize them the cg was at times was poor and unclear especially when it was made easier as the action sequences were at night and dark so there is a less of a chance of picking up flaws personally i think they should of simplify the story and focus on building up the characters rather than being so focused on needing to have a big battle with much stronger super villain at the end
Nov 3 2018,negative,it was poorly paced it was obvious a huge chunk was removed so it can fit the pg13 rating shame on sony
Nov 3 2018,negative,ok movie nothing special 
Nov 3 2018,positive,surprising funny movie
Nov 3 2018,neutral,this had so much potential but was a let down in all departments particularly the miscasting of the main characters  dull
Nov 3 2018,positive,its more comedic than i thought it was but the movie is amazing nonetheless the pacing is fine and the villains and the heroes do have their motivation all and all its an 810 for me
Nov 3 2018,positive,dont know what they say  but film is great
Nov 2 2018,positive,its a good movie that feels weird to watch
Nov 2 2018,positive,pretty good overall slow start good humor
Nov 2 2018,positive,the most exciting and furious movie ive ever seen this movie built a very nervous environment that makes this movie become a real movie
Nov 2 2018,positive,i think that having read a lot of the critics reviews and a lot of the more respected audience reviews that slated this film people seem to have forgotten what a good old fashioned fun film looks like all the reviewers seem to believe that this film was intended as a very dark and serious film but i completely disagree i see this film as a deadpoolesque buddycomedy escapade this film was very funny which was completely intentional from the outset unlike some modern marvel films which seem to shoehorn some light relief humour into an otherwise very dark and serious film for example civil war i personally think that the humour and the action were a perfect counterbalance for each other and this film should be taken for what it was intended to be  a funny action film
Nov 2 2018,positive,in a nutshell id say venom was flawed but fun  if you go into it expecting to see a dark actioncomedy instead of a standard superhero film youre going to have a great time  there are some issues with pacing but the movie kept me entertained enough that i didnt notice them until i was thinking about it later
Nov 2 2018,positive,some parts of the beginning were a bit boring but besides it was a really good movie  i enjoyed it even if the critics didnt
Nov 2 2018,positive,fucking loved this movie yall butthurt cause u dont get modern day humor n this shit had me smiling ear to ear the whole time i adore this movie i love venom wish i had enough money to watch this over and over again love eddies humor thoughts and the way he carries himself  his acting is great yeah yeah this is just another uneducated review but whatever from a real person from the audience who just loves to enjoy movies for what they are those are my thoughts
Nov 2 2018,positive,this movie was a bit of a throw back for superhero movies but i really enjoyed it tom hardy was great the rest of the cast not so much  i would like to see marvel and sony work a new deal with this character
Nov 2 2018,positive,perhaps weve been spoiled by all the connectivity of the mcu stand alone flicks dont have the same appeal by the lack of possibility 
Nov 2 2018,positive,wasnt expecting much but was funny action packed even made me feel bad for brock for a second pretty good even though spidey isnt in this universeor is he
Nov 2 2018,negative,i hated every moment of it the worst thing is that it tries to make you laugh with jokes that look like they were created in a low budget circus
Nov 2 2018,positive,loads better than expected tom hardy was brilliant
Nov 2 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Nov 2 2018,positive,this movie was okay to see my 2 daughters also thought it was hohum the depiction of venom was well done but the storyline and supporting cast really hurt this movie would have been better to see venom in the mcu
Nov 2 2018,positive,great work great movie
Nov 2 2018,negative,people keep saying that this is a good movie  do you even know the concept of a movie to begin with
Nov 2 2018,positive,venom is enjoyable it is not great and not terrible it finds itself somewhere in the middle i really think this movie would have benefited greatly from an r rating there are sequences that just seem broken because they could not show or say certain things just because they couldnt break their pg13 rating overall a decent movie and worth checking out
Nov 2 2018,negative,editing is terrible  there is chemistry between michelle williams and tom hardy but tom hardy doesnt seem interested in it  lots of pointless scenes  they want us to feel sorry for their relationship and it was so rushed  soundtrack is very good so far  good cinematography  chemistry between venom and eddie brooke is the best thing  great action sequences  tom hardy is great as venom and better than topher grace  vfx and cgi arent that great  storys  pacing is messy as fuck  riz ahmeds acting isnt good   the villian is bad in every way  overall rating4510
Nov 2 2018,positive,do yourself a favor and do not listen to the critics i loved this movie it is definitely my 2nd favorite movie
Nov 2 2018,positive,it was not a superhero movie and had slow pacing but the story and action was great so maybe it im not a real critic but i would rent it
Nov 2 2018,negative,horrible movie with sprinkles of simpleton jokes
Nov 2 2018,positive,terrible movie i loved it
Nov 2 2018,positive,loved it i still cant figure out what people dont like about this movie it was well acted and action packed from beginning to end 
Nov 2 2018,positive,great but needs spidey cant wait for the bluray
Nov 2 2018,positive,look its not really venom however tom hardys take and it being a really entertaining movie  i saw it with my son and we had a blast go watch it you dont need anyones advice but you who are the critics but people themselves
Nov 1 2018,positive,the movie was rather good but the comedy was a little much since venom is a dark marvel character if the movie was a little darker i would enjoy it more
Nov 1 2018,positive,i love this movie funny witty amazing actions just cant understand why critics rated this low but its okay everyone is entitled to their own opinions
Nov 1 2018,positive,i went in thinking it wasnt going to be great due to its reviews but i loved it so much there were a couple plot holes but it was really enjoyable other than infinity war its stayed in my head the most i really want to see a second film and hopefully the reviews dont prevent that
Nov 1 2018,positive,the best way to describe this movie is stupid
Nov 1 2018,negative,venom isnt a good movie there are parts i enjoyed brock and venoms chemistry was pretty great plus there are comedic momentsbut that doesnt nor shouldnt carry or save the film this film doesnt do anything interesting and different and unique in the entertainment industry im a comic fan but this film isnt good its just a rushed sony productwhat else is new with sony i am not watching any of the other marvel sony solo films they have for the venomverse or whatever i dont recommend this movie because its just a waste of time despite the fact that its cheesy and just filler for a carnage sequel not only that but venom wasnt scary not one thing had me scared venom had me laughthats a bad thing the part i really liked however were the creditsbecause it was eminem anyway dont waste your money for this movie please its not good tom hardy i can tell was trying to carry to film and he did a good performancebut in the end its a weird rushed bad movie with a cheesy plot a very cheesy villain which is ashame because i love riz ahmed as an actor but anyway thats my review for venom
Nov 1 2018,negative,so i enjoyed parts of this film with its light harded humor plus brock and venom had great comedic chemistry this film had me laughbut that does save or carry the film in the end this was a rushed sony product venom isnt a good movie but it does have some enjoyable moments but do i recommend it no it doesnt effect anything in the entertainment industry and made me go oh thats so unique thats so different i think a movie starring a villain can work but venom fails at that not gonna lie i would actually love to see a mandarin film considering there is a real mandarin some where in disneys marvel cinematic universe anyways tom hardy i can tell tried really hard to carry this film and actually i think he did a good jobits just the film wasnt good but the one thing that was really a massive problem about this film is that venom wasnt scary
Nov 1 2018,positive,it was fun to watch
Nov 1 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the criticsthis movie is great on it own funny smart creative and a load of fun
Nov 1 2018,negative,movie was a total mess top to bottom  audience score is clearly astroturfed pretty aggressively
Nov 1 2018,positive,i thought it was one of the best movies ive seen so far the beginning was boring at first but it slowly became amazing and was just a great movie in general
Nov 1 2018,positive,generic but entertaining movie tom hardy shows off his performance and saves from shipwreck to a fleeting and clichéd story
Nov 1 2018,positive,i liked the movie but it took too much time to show this pseudoorigin and there could have been a two round fight against riot which also took too long to show up
Nov 1 2018,positive,critics are railing against this movie but i enjoyed it quite a bit venoms comedic attitude was highly entertaining and the visuals were really cool
Nov 1 2018,positive,amazing movie it was funny and the relationship between venom and eddie was perfect
Nov 1 2018,positive,tom hardy really stepped up his game in venom good acting good story plot good movie
Nov 1 2018,positive,really good movie enjoyable for fans of the character very much recommend
Nov 1 2018,positive,best gay romcom of 20twentygayth
Nov 1 2018,positive,i wasnt expecting much but what i did get was a fun and entertaining movie venom does have some problems 
Nov 1 2018,negative,while a hot mess what with its mediocre writing bland villain and plot holes galore venom still can prove to be a fun time out at the movies
Nov 1 2018,positive,critics are bad with this film
Nov 1 2018,positive,this is the first time i do not agree with the tomatometer mor like a 74 this movie is funny and descent story long as your not a technical dweep
Nov 1 2018,neutral,initially feels predictably formulaic for the increasingly tiresome comic book genre but eventually things get stranger and less convincing as it tries to turn a dark antihero picture into more of a buddy comedy featuring a human and an alien jumpsuit even diehards i imagine are going to be slightly thrown off by the tone
Nov 1 2018,positive,really funny and also a bit scary watch it guys its amazing
Nov 1 2018,positive,although the whole future foundation thing didnt work out well for the movie tom hardys performance once again saved a movie
Nov 1 2018,positive,its not the best movie ive ever seen but it by far doesnt deserv a 30
Nov 1 2018,positive,nothing extraordinary
Nov 1 2018,positive,if it was not for tom hardys acting venom would have been a waste
Nov 1 2018,negative,all i could see was tom doing a terrific  job in a terrible movie the action scene was quite bad even though the cg was great tom really is a great actor
Nov 1 2018,positive,i thought it was funny i liked how venom and eddie were a bickering couple i have no idea how theyll do that after credits scene in the next movie but ill pay to see it riot was interesting but come on we gotta see carnage
Nov 1 2018,positive,script could be better
Nov 1 2018,positive,enjoyable comic book movie that did a great job of bringing such a larger than life character to the big screen   my only gripe is that there is no clear link to the spiderman universe     one only assumes that the poor critical response for this is due to it not being part of the mcu
Nov 1 2018,positive,venom has some problems but overall a very fun and entertaining movie
Nov 1 2018,positive,really enjoyed it its funny and surprisingly relateable the most fun ive had in a superhero film since iron man
Nov 1 2018,positive,i watched it i loved it
Nov 1 2018,positive,entertaining movie but if you are a comic fan it does not follow the story
Nov 1 2018,positive,i enjoyed watching venom it may not be the best marvel movie out there certainly it is not the worst either watch it and have fun doing so
Nov 1 2018,positive,so ill preface gods by saying i get why critics didnt love this movie its formulaic and generic and hits on more than a few beats that are far too familiar in comic movies especially origin movies love interest loosely tied to villain corrupt corporate billionaire with a god complex and villain that is a bigger clone of the hero think iron man incredible hulk captain america 2012 superman ant man black panther etc why i still think it deserves 4 stars tom hardy he recognized what kind of movie he was in hit the tone perfectly and pulled off a great buddy comedy action movie as both buddies the effects were great i thought the pacing was spot on and it was overall very entertaining i think the pg13 rating hurt it as venom was made to be r rated but they walked the line well and the implied gore off screen still sold it its not award worthy but id fully recommend it to any fans of the genre
Oct 31 2018,positive,this was okay   iâtmm a comic book nerd from the 70s and love me some marvel and iâtmm pretty lenient because i love the mcu but i feel they couldâtmve done a much better job with the effects the visuals are a bit hotmiss other than that this is all good tom brady is makes a fine lead actor and the humour is in alignment with âthe spiderverseâtm sensibility
Oct 31 2018,positive,dude critics are dumb because this movie was friggin awesome
Oct 31 2018,positive,this was best super hero movie to date next to the first thor very entertaining funny youll love tom hardy they didnt overdue it for once
Oct 31 2018,positive,amazing hilarious love tom hardy love venom
Oct 31 2018,positive,iï 12tmve been waiting to see this movie for a while i had heard a lot of bad things about the movie though venom is my favorite marvel villain so of course i still wanted to watch it first things first i now see where all of the gay fan fiction comes from there are a few parts that are suggestive of eddie and venom liking each other more so venom liking eddie but besides that i thought the movie was pretty good definitely a step up from spiderman 3 venomi mean come on man tom hardy played the role pretty well throwing a few good laughs in here and there but still being serious enough to suit the role
Oct 31 2018,positive,amazing movie love the jump scares  i recommend this movie
Oct 31 2018,positive,tom hardy the perfect antihero
Oct 31 2018,positive,it was alright short and sweet but very predictable to be honest i see no future with this franchise of venom it was a nice movie yes but too immature and childishmore of a young adultteen movie than anything doesnt really explore the darkest aspects of venom
Oct 31 2018,positive,fantastic movie cant wait for the 2nd one
Oct 31 2018,negative,the 5 yearold narrative and character development is painful to watch its a shame that tom hardy had to pass through this embarrassment
Oct 31 2018,positive,tom hardy was awesome especially his reactions during the chase scenes but you dont have to use your brain to enjoy this movie 
Oct 31 2018,positive,very comiciak and very origanal
Oct 31 2018,positive,can relate to the characters first movie where the girl gets to experience the super powers as well 
Oct 31 2018,positive,it is enjoyable as there has  a slightly good storyline and some bits of the movie was funny and fun to watch
Oct 31 2018,positive,i thought the move was fun i saw a review that i think fits this movie if you want a good movie see something else if you want a fun movie watch this as a side note the target audience of this movie is teenagers and almost all of the humor is teenager humor that would explain the good audience score bad critic score i am a teenager so i thought it was fun
Oct 31 2018,positive,i really liked it im a big marvel fan so i know it has committed some venom mistakes  spiderman look  but the film is really funny full of action and you really get attached to venom
Oct 31 2018,positive,better than what the critics say  good start to be honest
Oct 31 2018,positive,great movie good acting kinda lacking in characters but excusable and a great example of venom if he was a good guy and idc if this is not like in the comic well sorry this is a movie not the comic and it is not suppose to be like it fully or even at all
Oct 31 2018,positive,its an entertaining movie with enough humour and grit to make it an enjoyable experience cant say wether it hits close to the comics but that doesnt really matter in my opinion
Oct 30 2018,positive,this is a great portrail of one of my favorite comic book charecters of marvel comics
Oct 30 2018,positive,entertaining but needs more connection to his spiderman lineage at least a mention  better writing
Oct 30 2018,neutral,entertaining but all of these films are trying to be deadpool this film would have benefitted by being shorter 
Oct 30 2018,positive,i loved it really good movie dont listen to the other stupid critics i feel like they went and watched the wrong movie  its definitely worth watching
Oct 30 2018,positive,really good movie i love it
Oct 30 2018,negative,truly terrible and not so bad that you can laugh at it it was a waste of time 
Oct 30 2018,positive,tom hardy was excellent as venom the action was great and the story was pretty straight forward look forward to seeing more venom in the marvel universe
Oct 30 2018,negative,venom cannot take itself seriously dialogue so bad it made me embarrassed to be in the theatre strung together by a solid collection of cgi fight scenes
Oct 30 2018,positive,great movie anyone who is a fan of the iconic villian or comics in general will love this movie and thats who it was made for the fans hardy was excellant and the relationship with venom was well executed cant wait for a sequel
Oct 30 2018,positive,the movie is so great i love the story between eddie and venom
Oct 30 2018,positive,this is one of those rare movies that you watch that isnt boring for a second  i dont know if its just because im a big fan of venom and that makes me enjoy it better but  i can say you will enjoy it
Oct 30 2018,positive,not great not bad just in the middle ill give 4 stars because of eminem
Oct 30 2018,positive,fun movie i went to see it last week i have to disagree with the crowd this movie was very entertaining for an almost 2 hours movie it was really unexpected and fun in many ways it made this looklike horror movie into a funny comedy and action im so waiting for the sequel have a nice day p
Oct 30 2018,positive,awesome thats all i have to say
Oct 30 2018,positive,this movie surprised me i wasnt expecting that i would like it but the audience score was so high that i had to check it out loved the story the acting the humor it was fastpaced and i really couldnt think of any way they could have improved it
Oct 30 2018,positive,screw the critics they couldnt fit this movie perfectly into a formula or category so they didnt like it ive been a fan of venom since i was a kid and was a little nervous about it but just saw it last night and it was awesome in fact my brother in law and father in law enjoyed it as well its never going to win any big awards its a comic book movie but we all thought it was very entertaining and i walked out of there happy and with a big smile on my face 
Oct 30 2018,positive,way more fun than it should have been it was more like the cartoon than most of marvels movies and i liked it that way
Oct 30 2018,positive,the actor played beautifully i didnt regret going to the movies
Oct 30 2018,neutral,its okay  my standards are pretty low for a lot of the comic movies because they stray so far but i feel like at least this was a massive step closer for the venom character to what it needs to be  im very pleased that they actually let venom be larger because venom is a big creature  i wouldnt say its worth buying or watching again  its very much a take it or leave it movie i wouldnt tell my friends they need to see it but i wouldnt discourage them if they were curious
Oct 30 2018,positive,venom is hilarious the perfect mix of funny and evil absolutely loved this movie
Oct 30 2018,positive,a fun popcorn flick that you shouldnt go into expecting anything at the marvel studios level
Oct 30 2018,positive,i liked it it was full of action it was funny and for the actor who played venom perfact not for young kids but i have seen worse lately
Oct 30 2018,positive,this movie was a rollercoaster of excitement it is very underrated but contains lots of action excitement thrills and laughs best sonyspiderman movie besides homecoming
Oct 30 2018,negative,this movie was not that good crap dialogue cringeworthy humour boring
Oct 30 2018,positive,is this a well made movie absolutely not the cgi is wack the editing is rough at best and michelle williams awful wig is ready to be snatched at any moment the villain is a little too generic and it isnt the grimdark story the trailers promised us but despite its many flaws i had the time of my life watching this movie its funny its surprising tom hardys performance is as brilliant as it is bizarre and the relationship between him and the symbiote possessing his body is the most entertaining thing ive seen this year so to surmise critically venom is not a good movie but i value movies based on how entertained i was and by god was i entertained this is never going to be oscarworthy but it is movie night with your friendsworthy and thats what matters to me
Oct 30 2018,positive,a film that failed with critics but succeded with us audience dosent happen very often and venom is an amazing example
Oct 30 2018,negative,first act is very rushed mediocre villain spotty cgi at times lack of chemistry between leads venom was much anticipated for me but sadly fell short tom hardy did great with what he had to work with and his relationship with the venom symbiote was great this is probably riz ahmeds worst performance i was very disappointed with how cliched and uninteresting carlton drake is the post credits scene is laughably bad but gets me excited for the sequel i wanted to love this movie but i feel that it is okay at best although the post credits scene really does get me excited for the future of sonys venomverse
Oct 29 2018,positive,this was a lot of fun look forward to a sequel
Oct 29 2018,positive,pretty good  not at all what i was expecting however
Oct 29 2018,positive,ive always wanted some justice after the disgrace known as spiderman 3 that movie poorly portrayed venom and failed to capture his stunning aspects im overjoyed that sony managed to recapture those traits as well as give us a new view on the antihero venom
Oct 29 2018,positive,entertaining although strange to have a film without the one responsible for venom although this storyline isnt bad just incomplete 
Oct 29 2018,positive,despite seeing the lowstar rating for this film i enjoyed this quite a bit    tom hardy somehow carried this movie into being quite good it has some goofy elements which seem to infect most of marvel at the moment sometimes good  ie thor deadpool antman     in this case i felt the goofy elements were unnecessary with a dark character like venom    also the villain somehow pops into existance within the last 15 minutes as per hollywood style but the escalation through the story and the action sequences werent bad at all    im looking forward to a darker venom sequel that fits the narrative and definitely more light on the extraterrestrial universe that these symbiotes are from    furthermore i really hope there is a spiderman vs venom story and somehow marvel doesnt mess it up    cheers to opening the marvel universe even more with this fun movie
Oct 29 2018,positive,this was a very good movie it didnt really have any modern themes or reasons for hollywood to jump on the bandwagon id recommend this to anyone if youre a fan of the comics monster movies action movies superhero movies or tom hardy this is a must its fun and the personality displayed by the actors was fantastic
Oct 29 2018,negative,venom is one of my favorite comic book characters i am fascinated by him and so i was incredibly excited for this movie less after seeing the first trailer it hurts me to say it is utter garbage to get the good out of the way the venom voice was great the fight with riot was ok the rest of the movie is just a tragic missed opportunity    i dont know who tom hardy was playing but it wasnt eddie brock he acts like a complete pussy throughout the movie and has the voice to match on top of that he winces and cries and groans like a 13 year old schoolgirl every time he gets thrown around when he sees the venom eyes in the mirror for the first time and yells like a bitch and hits his head and passes out in the tubmy god how embarrassing i love hardy and i love michelle williams but these have to be the worst roles each have ever played it was incredibly unfortunate to have the man who was bane play this pathetic character who had almost nothing in common with eddie brock as was having an actress with michelle williams magnetism be reduced to a dialed in performance in a wig    the soundtrack is truly baffling and it goes in sync with the forced humor as equally misguided a venom movie should be a scifi horror movie if it is going to be a light comedy then pull it off if it works it works this most certainly does not it goes from one cringeworthy moment to the next the climax of the terrible humor comes when williams character after being possessed by an alien entity transmits said entity onto her exfiancee sees him turn into a monster right in front of her and then saysoh thats bullshit after he runs away horrendous absolute garbage script and dialogue    i dont know how they managed this but the cgi is not even as good as in spiderman 3 if there is any good in that other garbage movie its how they make venom look sure hes too skinny because for whatever insane reason topher grace was eddie brock but he looked slick and menacing the only time the cgi looked ok was when the venom head talked to eddie even then the cgi was not very good on the rest of him in those scenes much less in the rest of them and while mentioning topher grace how was it that the symbiotes resemble the bodies of their host but the villain cannot remember this forgettable characters name gets bonded and becomes as huge as eddie does how do you have the actor who played bane play eddie brock who is shown literally lifting weights in the comics and make no allusion to his physicality to his drive towards power why do you make him talk with such a weak sissy voice eddie brock is a bully an asshole a confident jerk i saw none of those things here    talking about missing character traits and opportunities not once was his religiousness mentioned eddie brock is a catholic and understandably so believes the symbiote is a demon possessing him it was so easy to use his religious background and along with it the themes of good and evil of power and temptation nothing what a waste    tom hardy does not play eddie brock michelle williams the villain his right hand the female scientist all are forgettable it feels like a cheap film altogether right from the forgettable intro some infected lady walking off to some lab from the middle of the woods    to add insult to injury i stayed until after the very long credits just to watch that shitty animation which isnt even about venom or the real spiderman garbage movie shame on you sony for fucking this up
Oct 29 2018,positive,surprisingly enjoyed this movie
Oct 29 2018,neutral,venom wa sthe only good part of this movie everything else was boring and bland awful action sequances
Oct 29 2018,positive,an easy to watch good film went with a few friends and really enjoyed it its not meant to be a masterpiece its meant to be a fun film to stray away from all the super heros etc and it has done its job well yet another film where the critics show how detached they are from the  actual public who watch the films
Oct 29 2018,positive,great movie wish it was longer
Oct 29 2018,positive,venom is by all regards a bad movie but the cgi of venom chemistry between eddie and venom give it a few saving graces
Oct 29 2018,positive,we loved this movie we cant understand the low rating by the critics the movie is entertaining the acting was good and the story line kept us hooked this is from someone who doesnt know the venom story line my son and husband who do know the back story loved it too highly recommend
Oct 29 2018,positive,great movie from europe
Oct 29 2018,negative,this was so shit the end fight seen was a joke and the story was even worse
Oct 29 2018,negative,this movie was pretty butt but the eminem song was pretty sick
Oct 29 2018,positive,ignore the critics one of the best things marvel have done in a long time id love to see an 18 rated version or a higher age rated sequel but trust me you want to see this
Oct 29 2018,positive,fun movie different twist to eddie brock
Oct 29 2018,positive,good performances cgi and action scenes but a little messy tone and pacing
Oct 29 2018,positive,its was a good movie not the best but is pretty good
Oct 29 2018,negative,one of the worst superhero movies ive seen corny dialogue bad cgi pacing issues and plot holes abound it seems like the creators were confused whether to make this a comedy a kidfriendly superhero movie or a horror and succeeds in being none of them they may have benefitted from going more of the deadpool route with an rrating but that wouldnt have helped the other serious issues save your 10 and see something else
Oct 29 2018,positive,awesome its a very good mixture of horror comedy and antihero
Oct 29 2018,positive,this movie was great to me very entertaining  humorous 
Oct 29 2018,positive,excellent film action humor and acting is right venoms relationship with eddie is strangely charming has my approval
Oct 29 2018,negative,a lame and tiresome superhero movie that doesnt give a hoot about consistency the alien symbiotes for instance can successfully possess a bunch of people whenever that is convenient to the plot becoming also weirdly disgusting in the end with its fascist antihero morality
Oct 29 2018,negative,aside from tom hardy  the acting is so bad i felt awkward and cringed also it took more than 45 minutes to get a glimpse of venom in his full form kinda poorly done jokes werent even that funny but tom hardy makes it a bit better feels bad for tom because he has talent but the writers and directors flopped so dry
Oct 29 2018,positive,i dont know what all the critics were fussing about this was a good movie and tom hardys performance was excellent although i believe this movie would have worked better with an r rating the dynamic between hardy and venom was fun to watch and their relationship made it interesting to keep watching i thought the plot was good enough for a super hero movie with such a high budget and because of these things i recommend this movie to anyone with free time on the weekends 
Oct 29 2018,positive,slow at the start of the movie but after about 2030 minutes in the pace starts picking up and all the characters start to shine overall i loved the movie will be seeing it again in theaters 
Oct 29 2018,positive,it was fun to watch
Oct 29 2018,positive,the biggest complaint for critics is the tone of the movie shifted and because i actually have been yearning for genres to overplaythis was not only not a problem for mei loved it  life isnt a cafeteria tray you dont have neat divisions of people or movies  a day in this characters like would look like this so that made the movie true to me i urge sony and marvel to keep it up they will have an audience they will break ground in how stories are told dont let these film school rejects who have an insider way of framing things tell you what to do  i could watch this movie again i could own this movie and when it comes to both tv and moviesthere is not a lot i am watching because i have seen it before
Oct 29 2018,positive,amazing film it deserves to be in the mcu dont know why not
Oct 29 2018,neutral,2 12 stars  when it was revealed sonymarvel was going to try their hand at a standalone venom movie two things ran through my head was it going to be rated r and would it have any connection to the marvel universe mainly spider man  the answer to both was no so as long as you are able to stomach both of those going into the theater and think of venom on its own your experience should improve  however if you are a diehard fan this is going to rub you the wrong way in nearly every facet    get through the first 20 minutes and it will be easier to stomach is the most common comment i shared with many of my friends  not a good start  tom hardy plays our lead character eddie brock who was forced from new york due to an incident but thats about the only connection we are allowed to anything outside of san francisco and a potential marvel universe inclusion  we all know hardy is british but even this faux bostonnew yorknorth eastern mashup of accents he tries to pull off is off putting  the problem with the character of brock as far as hardys portrayal goes is he is so uninteresting  the basis for this entire film is flimsy at best and it struggles to make sense of its plot which felt totally contrived for the movies sake and not the other way around    the graphics shapeshifting action sequences and fight scenes are all well done but with the pg13 rating all the jokes violence and dialogue come across as simple or hand fisted  the absence of blood when peoples heads are getting bitten off and the one solitary fword inclusion at the dumbest possible time are laughable considering how violent the character of venom is known    i think there were legs here and the end of the film and the teaser afterward give us a bit of hope thinking if they allow a second film to follow the first we might actually get something worthwhile  but until they find a way to connect the character with the audience outside of brocks boring background story delivered via dialogue theres no real reason to root for this supposed antihero
Oct 29 2018,positive,in my opinion the movie was for fans over critics if you are a fan of venom definitely see this movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 29 2018,negative,really really stupid
Oct 29 2018,positive,i loved it it was exciting and funny i thought it was a tad cheesy but overall it was great 
Oct 29 2018,positive,with the last on screen version of venom being a flopcough cough topher grace i can honestly say i am happy with how this film turned out though it could have had some minutes added to the runtime the chemistry between eddie and venom is great the action we did get in the short runtime was fun and kept me watching some cgi could have used some buffing in scenes but overall i feel the pros outweigh the cons with an after credits scene leaving me excited for a hopeful rated r sequal to come next year i was not blown away by venom but with alot of certain marvel characters stories coming to a possible end soon it left me satisfied and intrigued with what they can do to try and keep the mcu fresh and on new paths
Oct 29 2018,positive,was really good except for the slow start 
Oct 29 2018,positive,we liked it a lot more then i thought we thought we would glad i ignored the criticism on this one 
Oct 29 2018,positive,okay i know what youre all wondering but aaron you said that the movie was absolutely amazing why change your opinion well i must dare say it wasnt that good i find the story mediocre the visuals are bland and the acting is so overwhelming tom hardy wasnt given something else to do except be funny for the whole movie its by far worser than amazing spiderman but at least it had a decent story the only thing was an upsetting moment that venom isnt an r rated movie literally has venom biting off someones head two times it showed eddie brock being stabbed through the chest eddie said fuck and youre telling me that its not r rated fuck you sony
Oct 29 2018,positive,family friendly antihero to watch  great film
Oct 28 2018,neutral,i was prepared for an average movie and it was just okay  the story was alright the action took a while to get going but i just want a huge fan of this eddie brock  i know he is suppose to be portrayed as a loser but he seemed too aloof and intense and more agitated with the voices than i think he needed to be which made the early scenes awkward i thought enough here to keep franchise going i just need a more stable brock i think topher was a better loser that was empowered by venom
Oct 28 2018,positive,a whole lot of fun  the relationship between eddie and venom carried the whole thing  not to mention a really cool chase scene that felt familiar from sonic adventure 2 
Oct 28 2018,positive,read the comics especially lethal protector which the film is based in then write a review    venom is surprisingly well done and faithful to the comic source material eddie brock is a really difficult character to play and hardy does well that said riz ahmedâtms villain is underdeveloped one dimensional and a cliche which lets the film down but itâtms enjoyable and worth watching
Oct 28 2018,positive,imostly like the film some giggles here and there but what annoyed me was how spontaniously the plot is ruined near the spaceship battle
Oct 28 2018,positive,really funny and entertaining
Oct 28 2018,positive,vemon is awesome for what isnt not  all of the actors are top notch  this movie would have been better if sony had the balls to make it rrated  dont sleep on this movie 
Oct 28 2018,positive,one of the best marvel films made cant wait for sequel 
Oct 28 2018,positive,cant wait for the sequel
Oct 28 2018,positive,entertaining movie tom hardy and venom banter is great and fun keeping the movie together critics are probably looking for something like the last jedi choke garbage
Oct 28 2018,positive,very fun and enjoyable to watch but the story wasnt very strong and venoms character ark was very underdeveloped this led to a mediocre movie that was fun to watch but maybe not enough to pay to see it in theaters
Oct 28 2018,positive,me and my brother like it because it was funny cooland i like the voice actor of venom who those that did not like it you should like it 
Oct 28 2018,positive,it needs more gore venom is a brutal being and frequently brutal action get implied which disapoints when not shown just to set the rating to childfriendly in an era when children have access to movies of despite restrictions anyway
Oct 28 2018,positive,i loved this movie so much just the right amount of humor mixed with the action
Oct 28 2018,positive,venom suffers from a generic plot but still triumphs in a characterdriven story with sprinkles of great humour and good action the cgi can be unforgivable at times but nonetheless venom looks and sounds great however i left the theatres knowing nothing about eddie brock or even venom for that matter i think the film could have been great if the great ideas were expanded and more violence to give it a kick tom hardy is great with what he is given and other performances are merely tolerable overall i had a blast with venom with its humour and visuals if youre looking for a generic and funny flick go see it if youre looking for a great movie with powerful storytelling then this wont be youre cup of tea
Oct 28 2018,positive,this movie is wonderful before the release you might expect something then this movie defines expectations in a great way the only thing that could have made it even better if       black panther was in it you cant argue with that
Oct 28 2018,positive,this was a super fun movie  i love tom hardy in this role  is it an oscar winning movie  no  is it a highly entertaining and fun movie  yes
Oct 28 2018,positive,this deserves to be in mcu if it was it would of got a better score
Oct 28 2018,positive,watched this at imax  loved it  not sure what the critics were watching
Oct 28 2018,positive,absolutely amazing movie the relationship between eddie and the symbiote was both exhilerating fun and emotional its basically an action romcom where the main pairing is a guy and his alien i ship it so glad i went and saw this at the cinema
Oct 28 2018,positive,awesome movie best was tom hardy amazing actor it was a great cutscene at the end please give this a good score movie 
Oct 28 2018,positive,venom was i movie i went into thinking it was going to be back i came out thinking hay that was okay even though the movie doesnt really have to much of a plot the characters are fantastic tom hardy you can tell is having a great time in this movie and his acting was amazing i would say the biggest problem of the movie was that the villain wasnt that interesting and character development seemed to happen off screen however venom is still a very good movie to watch one time with out questioning to much its a funny movie with great actors
Oct 28 2018,positive,personally this film was a very fun experience but nothing else above that terribly written story boring characters minus our main heroes and not so spectacular cgi is a bit distracting but with fun action intentionally and unintentionally hilarious comedy and a seriously amazing atmospheric soundtrack venom 2018 is not a good film by any means but it is a fun one and i recommend it because of that
Oct 28 2018,negative,movie wise its terrible enjoyment wise comedy gold this movie is so bad its hilarious the dialogue was so corny and fake that i was cracking up every scene
Oct 28 2018,positive,a lot of fun and doesnt feel rushed
Oct 28 2018,negative,venom was a total disappointment i still dont know if it is a comedy or an action movie the movie atleast delivers some fun dialoge between  eddie and venom but for most part it really bad
Oct 28 2018,positive,watch it ignore the critics
Oct 28 2018,positive,dont listen to the bullshit from socalled critics this movie awesome fun and dynamic between eddy and venom is fantastic and funny
Oct 28 2018,positive,good enough  tom hardy is super likable as is venom but its more scifi than comic bookey  not for the youngster maybe mature 12 and over because the morphing is a bit much
Oct 28 2018,negative,this movie is so terrible on every level and yet i loved every second of it for sure the room of the superhero genre
Oct 28 2018,positive,i am sorry folks but i was entertained i laughed and i was impressed with the actioni wasnt alone a very packed cinema in dublin watched laughed and enjoyed the lunacy hardy played for what it was madness and far from not having a plot i think that maybe critics are a little two prescious these days
Oct 28 2018,positive,legit might be my favorite movie
Oct 28 2018,positive,i will have to disagree with the critics on this one venom was awesome wish i could watch it again
Oct 28 2018,positive,without any previous knowledge of the comics venom was surprisingly satisfying there were several points of hilarity while at the same time keeping true to the seriousness of the plot line we were not confused fumbling for answers that could only be found in a previously written manuscript tom hardy delivers a spoton performance as eddie brock creating a confused and pain filled journalist he depicts the grunge character with a lightness for the viewer to love tom is venom well done michelle williams falls flat as eddies love interest anne and leaves you wondering can she project any other character beside sad teenage angst also is that a wig or does your hair just never movelike ever research following the viewing tells me that this is merely a setup for a conglomerate of venom series  while some are discouraged with this picture not reflecting the true story spiderman it appears this is just the beginning while marvel and dc both should consider better casting of the female companions this overall was a shocking relief
Oct 28 2018,positive,one of the best films of the year so far i highly recomend you to go see it in cinemas if your a marvel fan and even if you are not it is still amazing
Oct 28 2018,positive,the film was entertaining i found the characters were not easy to relate to at the beginning however i warmed up to all of them the action scenes were exciting the plot was clear and concise the weakness was in the slow start a coincidence of one of the chosen test subjects i found too unlikely some of the third act dialogue was bland and one fight scene with too much cgi however this was balanced by excellent dialogue in other parts and a meaningful earned ending and gradual character development that won me over if you are patient enough it is actually fresh with some scenes i have not seen in film before and even humorous at times i look forward to sony exploring more of these scary mcu characters
Oct 28 2018,positive,was this worth the ticket price for my 11 yo and i absolutely hardy and ahmed read the phonebook and be brilliant yes film critic  ba in film and media studies
Oct 28 2018,positive,the best word to describe it is meh
Oct 28 2018,positive,such a good movie i didnt think i would like it but it is so underrated i really recommend it
Oct 28 2018,neutral,not a film you should see in the theaters but its fine for a cheap rent or stream i didnt buy the eddievenom relationship at all it felt stilted and awkward hardy feels wasted in this movie the action overall was eh a car chase in sf should feel exciting but it wasnt engaging to me its a shame its a pg13 i feel like this movie would have benefited from an r the body count is high yet i saw no blood and it really made the action feel campy and flat if you put the wilhelm scream into your movie youre giving a giant middle finger to your audience its so painful 510
Oct 28 2018,neutral,the previous story tells me he must eat a living thing  tell me later he wants to eat potato chips and chocolate  return the bad guys in the trailer to me
Oct 28 2018,positive,better than the critics are saying not very deep but it is fun 
Oct 28 2018,positive,not scary but very entertaining love it
Oct 28 2018,negative,wow this movie is so bad at so many levels lol i dont even know where to start 
Oct 28 2018,positive,not the best superhero movie ive seen but it was a good effort by ruben fleischer and the writers i dont understand why so many critics panned this film performances by tom hardy and riz ahmed was solid michelle williams being the weak link just miscast the humour is well set and the action sequences entertaining i would have loved to see venom have more screen time  in all his glory but i was entertained 
Oct 28 2018,positive,tom hardy is a comedic genius 
Oct 28 2018,positive,was venom good no absolutely not but did i have the time of my life watching it oh my god yes i based my rating off of two things whether or not i enjoyed it and if i would recommend it to someone else the answer to both is a hearty yes i can absolutely see why critics have chewed this up and spit it out with a big fat 30 slapped on top though the main issue being pacing the plots pace is akin to being stuck in someones car as it desperately wheezes and lurches downhill in neutral toward a gas station but if that someone is your best friend and youre on a trip for pleasure and not business odds are youll be giggling about it the entire way there and back its also probably one of the first things youll mention if anyone asks about the trip theres even a chance itll be a fond memory when youre reminiscing years later over dinner but lets say its not a friend lets say its your boss lets say its on the way to an important lunch meeting with an important client lets say you were worming the conversation toward the subject of promotion when you hear that kachink you more than just wince when you hear that when you get back you never mention it again and if anyone asks all you can get out is a death rattle you slink back into your desk and open an incognito tab to job listings thats a memory you squeeze your eyes shut against when it rears its ugly head as youre trying to fall asleep and odds are much better youre seeing things from the first perspective than the second and from that perspective i can say that this movie is a treasure its funny its selfindulgent its unabashedly cliche in a way that hasnt been used in so long that its gone full circle and become fresh again and bizarrely enough i can honestly say it was sporadically heartfelt it was somehow written just well enough to make me care deeply for some of the most poorly fleshed out characters ive seen on screen in a hot minute at one point i involuntarily gasped a heartbroken no which is as embarrassing as it is impressive its not revolutionary or anything its just fun and fun is all it needs to be if thats what youre at the movies for 
Oct 28 2018,positive,910 dont know why it has so many negative reviews
Oct 28 2018,positive,do not believe the so called movie critics the audience will always give you a more accurate rating this movie is good if you havent seen itwhat you waiting for go 
Oct 27 2018,positive,this movie is amazing i dont see why everyone is giving it such a bad review big sigh i can see if your a huge comic buff which i am myself that the movie has nothing to do with anything comic related you need to look at it like its a stand alone movie not a marvel movie based off the comics to get it and you will understand where i am coming from i think they had a great thing going here and hope to see the next film come out with some carnage vs venom action
Oct 27 2018,positive,loved this movie dont understand what the critics are saying which makes sense since they dont seem to know what they are talking about watching this movie was like going through my childhood when i would read comics with venom in it hope to see them to bring more growth with marvel for many reasons great characters was not hard to follow cgi that was actually decent you want bad cgi go watch the star wars prequelssticks with source and material as best as possible if you think not go watch star wars tlj and try saying that was good story telling and stuck with source  as a comic person this was a kick back and just feeling happy to finally see the real venom
Oct 27 2018,positive,has some flaws but is overall a really fun time
Oct 27 2018,positive,while far from perfect this was simply a fun film and definitely worth at least one watch it has just the right balance between dark and funny that you would expect from a marvel film the best parts of the movie were definitely the fun banter moments between eddie and venom it was nice to see how their relationship developed over time and the humor shared between the two was quite endearing i actually like that this movie was devoid of any trace of spiderman it allowed us to focus solely on the eponymous antihero it does have its share of flaws but it succeeded in making me interested in any potential sequels
Oct 27 2018,positive,i would have given this film 5 stars if it was rated r
Oct 27 2018,positive,a lot of fun cool effects and a good new entry in the mcu 
Oct 27 2018,positive,cant wait for venom 2 
Oct 27 2018,positive,dont not listen to the critics my family and i loved the movie it had action drama and comedy i cant wait for the sequel 
Oct 27 2018,positive,i had a really great time watching this critics were way too hard on this movie was it the most wellpaced no they couldve spent less time on the set up and more time on the team up but i really connected to eddie and appreciated the way tom hardy took his character on i also enjoyed that some of the usual superhero movie tropes were turned on their heads as well they should since venom is an antihero there were some really comedic moments in this movie which i absolutely loved this is a movie i could see myself watching more than once which is a lot for me
Oct 27 2018,positive,its very epic and funny and has a ending that will leave you hanging after you watch the end credits dont miss out
Oct 27 2018,positive,i had no idea what genre it was supposed to be what the moral of the story was or what was happening at any point ever  1010 best thing ive ever witnessed please go watch this movie it will change your life
Oct 27 2018,positive,the movie was awesome and venom is really funny 
Oct 27 2018,positive,if your looking to stimulate your intellect read a book if you want a fun ride this is your flick i enjoyed it
Oct 27 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics it is such a fun movie but it is not a traditional super hero movie or a horror movie it is a really really messed up romantic comedy if you go in with that mind set it makes the movie even better 
Oct 27 2018,positive,not sure why critics scored this so badly
Oct 27 2018,positive,actually really enjoyed the movie  it leaned into comedy far more than i thought which was great venom and eddies dynamic is really interesting    definitely not a bad movie
Oct 27 2018,positive,amazing movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 27 2018,positive,really nice graphics a car chase a wilhelm scream a romance a comedy action and scifi its everything i could have asked for
Oct 27 2018,positive,really funny and lots of action but a little slow at the beginning 
Oct 27 2018,negative,what a clunkerslow and sillyi want my money back
Oct 27 2018,positive,it was an awesome film made a good origin story and i feel even if a person never read the comics would like it too
Oct 27 2018,positive,an absolute amazing movie very true to the comic
Oct 27 2018,positive,loved loved loved it
Oct 27 2018,positive,a fun movie with a relatable and interesting main character whos portrayed really well by tom hardy eddie brock goes through multiple life changes throughout the film and hardy manages to portray the character in each of them perfectly the relationship that developed between him and venom was interesting and felt very natural    the film plays with various tones which some people seem to have a problem with but i personally enjoyed the fact that it wasnt all serious or all comedy i didnt find the humour to be distracting all in all it felt like a marvel film but with its own take on it  i think the sound was too loud and the song in the beginning came out of nowhere and was ill fitting some of the cgi also felt off the action sequence towards the end between the symbiotes was badly executed it felt very messy and made my eyes hurt as i didnt know what to focus on     overall the movie was highly enjoyable with a very good main character the movie never settles on one tone but i personally dont think its bad in this particular film the movie also has some technical problems but they dont take away much from the overall experience im definitely looking forward to seeing more venom
Oct 27 2018,positive,i personally loved it
Oct 27 2018,positive,a fun movie worth a watch
Oct 27 2018,positive,venom is crazier than recent superhero films but also has great action horrorlike moments humor and a strong performance by tom hardy
Oct 27 2018,positive,excellent movie it is not supposed to have spiderman and does not need spiderman its called venom look at the audience rating not the critics
Oct 27 2018,negative,why it started off amazing the first half was absolutely incredible and then once again they had to ruin it by making everything so cheesyit works for the avengers it does not work for predator and venom they turned him in a jokester it was horrid but fine my disappointment grew more and more the further the movie went on stayed till the end of the creditsive been waiting for carnage on the big screen for 25 years at leastso call me surprised when they have woody harrison as carnagewhat did these guys hire the same crew who casted the first spider man series aka the worst casting ive ever seen in a movie i love woody harrison but as carnage he cant be carnage plus his old lady box dye bozo the clown perm is ridiculous theres going to be some carnage i was dry heaving i was laughing so hard its so stupid i really hope that they will get enough bad reviews to fix this these movies are making me not want to go to the theatre anymore

Oct 27 2018,positive,great movie was much better than expected do t know how people are saying this movie is boring
Oct 27 2018,neutral,this movie isokay the pacing is god awful until venom shows up some of the performances are questionable at best for the exception of hardy who is giving 110 in this film but the movies second half is pretty fun in short its not as bad as the critics say but its definitely not as good as the audience score suggests 510
Oct 27 2018,positive,this actually wasnt a bad film i was never bored it was fun and entertaining
Oct 27 2018,negative,funny inner monologue of tom hardy kinda like dumber version of birdman is what make this movie watchable other than that  its as schlocky and toothless as you can think pg13 rating also hurts  similar to suiside squad
Oct 27 2018,positive,i loved it tom hardys work is amazing and it was funny  after reading reviews i decided not to watch it but today i accidentally ended up watching it and i regretted that i listened someone elses opinions go and watch it its fumny and come on its tom hardy 
Oct 27 2018,positive,best marvel film yet ok it was a bit slow starting but it had everything romance that didnt make you want to throw up some  action shots that did  a clean script unlittered by swearing and a hero who cared before he wasvsuper i absolutly loved it
Oct 27 2018,neutral,you cant have your protagonist killing scores of innocent cops and bystanders i dont care what he does in the comics
Oct 26 2018,positive,loved this movie refreshing take on the character quirky story and great acting by hardy very entertaining

Oct 26 2018,positive,the humor was totally unexpected
Oct 26 2018,positive,it was better than i thought still needs spiderman
Oct 26 2018,positive,a breath of fresh air to a very different antihero definitely not a perfect film but a thriller that is worthy of praise  hope they keep this character going
Oct 26 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film tom hardy did a fantastic job and the visuals are stunning i really recommend and im quite confused as to why this movie got such a low rating i personally loved it and it is definately not as bad as the critics are saying
Oct 26 2018,negative,thiswas laughably horrible dialog plot and character interaction
Oct 26 2018,positive,it is a simple fun movie  tried to be dead pool but fails  still  worth the viewing
Oct 26 2018,positive,tom hardy is my favorite
Oct 26 2018,positive,great movie comedy was great i feel tom hardy played the character really well but itâtms one of those movies where itâtms better the first time to me venoms threats and comments were pretty funny and scary i guess but itâtms all my opinion
Oct 26 2018,positive,why is everyone hating it venom was awesome i laughed a lot and i just enjoyed how eddie and venom slashed people and started to work together you guys are just confusing me every movie that is so good sucks in your opinion please let the people watch the movie before you guys give your reviews which are so bad please that would be very kind
Oct 26 2018,positive,my wife and i really enjoyed venom and my daughter loved it
Oct 26 2018,positive,great movie super funny tom hardy is amazing as venom i would definitely go with the audience score on this one and go see it in theaters
Oct 26 2018,positive,its everything youve ever wanted to see in a venom flick if youve ever read any of the comics youll love it
Oct 26 2018,positive,thought the movie was pretty good  tom hardy did a fantastic job as usual it was a little slow in the begining  but once it got going it was action packed with a side of humor terrifically done between eddie brocks character and the character of venom itself  however venom is a villian first and foremost  he eventually becomes an anti hero but hes not saving the world right out the gate this is one of those films that needed an r rating to really get the correct kind of character development and lets not even talk about how bad this will be if the try to shove carnage into a pg13 rating
Oct 26 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie
Oct 26 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Oct 26 2018,positive,good for entertainment  but nothing to write home about 
Oct 26 2018,positive,despite the critics reviews low rating i liked it seems like the audience ratiings were very much higher
Oct 26 2018,positive,wasnt the worst movie ive seen but not great started real slow which kind of takes you out of it a bit there are some decent parts though with that said if theres another one ill see it
Oct 26 2018,positive,movie is great and entertaining the entire time critics dont have a clue on what theyre talking about always go with the audiences opinion never the critics
Oct 26 2018,negative,this film simply lacks a good plot
Oct 26 2018,negative,disappointed not familiar with comic so readers of this review take that into account in my opinion this was a waste of time very pedestrian plot story line very predictable wasnt expecting a comedy which this was a waste of good actors time as well michelle wiliams walked through this one tom hardy made the best of his poor material but poor it was why did he agree to make this special effects lackluster if a sequel gets made ill be very surprised
Oct 26 2018,positive,i cant give it a 5 it was fun to watch with family i recommended it to friends and family
Oct 26 2018,positive,started out a little slow with the storyline but then quickly picked up the pace to make it  an excellent movie
Oct 26 2018,negative,not a great moovie but neither a really shitty one it was watchable but not that enjoyable  canst say much more cause there isnt really a lot to say     problem with pacing stupid dialogue and incopetent vilain lot of cgi playstation 23 style
Oct 26 2018,positive,i thought it was good
Oct 26 2018,positive,the movie is worthy however i wont tell that i would recommend it to viewing developers should pay more attention to the 2nd part
Oct 26 2018,positive,its not bad its not great
Oct 26 2018,positive,venom was not the movie i expected to see but i did enjoy parts of it most of the movie is wasted on the ridiculous plot that at times was painstakingly annoying although i will definitely watch it again for the hilarious hardy symbiote vigilante buddy feels
Oct 26 2018,positive,only 30 on rt venom is an absolute joy and the most underrated movie of the year tom hardy lots of laughs and the greatest antihero ever whats not to like
Oct 26 2018,neutral,there have been better superhero movies but this certainly isnt the worse its two biggest problems are an unentertaining villain who is about as unspectacular as they come and a disappointing performance from tom hardy who comes across as eddie haskell from leave it to beaver oh i have this parasitegoodnight mrs chan i expected something darker and more violent instead of silly and too comic bookish
Oct 26 2018,positive,venom looks fantastic he looks nearly exactly the same like in the comics tom plays brock like a god story is good could have been a bit longer and most importantly venom was portrayed as this childish kind of ridiculous character which is exactly how he is in the comics this brings in a lot of humor into the movie i absolutely loved the movie critics should listen to the audience in my opinion it showed everything i wanted in a venom movie peter parker was not needed here if it works for the audience then the studio obviously did something right thats why i dont listen to critics anymore to sum this up venom was fun to watch and i absolutely loved the movie
Oct 26 2018,positive,it had the perfect balance of humor and gore it left me on the edge of my seat the whole time the experience i had going to see venom was both enjoyable and thrilling i only hope that the second movie is rated r so that viewers could get the best experience of carnage i only say this because he is a dark and twisted character that to best be portrait in a r rated film i wouldnt change the relationships between venom and broke or eddies girlfriend at all only more gore and a little bit darker story line
Oct 26 2018,positive,not the movie i was expecting from the trailers but this was a pleasant surprise good popcorn munching movie
Oct 26 2018,negative,a poor story with a very poor script had me rolling my eyes and checking my watch throughout the movie
Oct 26 2018,positive,i loved this movie it was very entertaining and i loved watching the interaction between eddie brock and venom however it is a little slow to get to the meat and bones of the plot i will agree that as a superhero anithero movie its only good not great timing and plot wise i do look forward to seeing the hintedat sequel though
Oct 26 2018,positive,we are venom its so intense so good watchable over and over again
Oct 26 2018,positive,graphics are awesome but could have been better a better story
Oct 26 2018,negative,i vehemently despise spoilers but just so you know how much more i despised this movie jenny slates character dies
Oct 26 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie two end scenes last one will definitely get you 
Oct 26 2018,positive,kind of a twisted version of spiderman good action and some funny stuff too 
Oct 26 2018,positive,best romcom of the year
Oct 26 2018,positive,clearly the critics got it wrong with this one tom does a remarkable job as the quirky eddie brock and the look of the cg venom character is absolutely on point venom does not disappoint 
Oct 26 2018,positive,it was a solid film but not very true to what i understand the nature of venom to be based on the comics solid 3 stars 
Oct 26 2018,positive,really enjoyed the movie it isnt a marvel fans only movie it has the comedy marvel is know for and in my opinion it is a great movie all the bad reviews are wrong for me go watch it maybe you wont like it bu i really recommend you to do so
Oct 26 2018,positive,are there plot holes sure do ya have to suspend your disbelief a decent amount was it entertaining 100 awesome action some solid laughs and really cool to see venom come to life 
Oct 26 2018,positive,tom is kinda played a good role for eddie and his interact with venom is the best things that happen in this movie
Oct 26 2018,positive,wow sony finally found a comic book genre that they can do anti heros
Oct 26 2018,positive,being a venom fan and fairly familiar with the comics i went into the movie a little worried from what i heard from the reviews that it was poorly scripted and a down right failure well im gonna tell you something it was great the humor action and relationship between eddie brock and  venom  was  awesome and highly spot on with his comics could have used a different villian host as he was way to dry and just a poor actor in general and yes  the script could have used some work but to be honest i loved the movie being familiar with how they are in the comics and would watch it again for sure also the action scenes and the way they talked to  the not so good people was hilarious awesome and spot on as well
Oct 26 2018,positive,not as good as some of the other superhero movies but story was ok entertaining 
Oct 25 2018,positive,they really stuck with the comics characterization i really enjoyed it and hope for a sequel my roommate doesnt like comic books but she loved this movie
Oct 25 2018,positive,loved it interesting movie i recommend that everyone sees it
Oct 25 2018,negative,great movie but a huge miscast i was hoping for thomas jane or someone of that nature tom hardy isnt entertaining hes super hot but he doesnt have very many facial expressions like what i expected of someone who is suddenly a super strong gross it superhero comics have a tongue in cheek humor i didnt see in this movie so yeah great movie just didnt feel like an mc movie and where was spiderman at least have a cameo wasted opp
Oct 25 2018,positive,some useless and unnecessary scenes and plot points but delivers in action horror and comedy
Oct 25 2018,positive,good but not too many action scenes
Oct 25 2018,negative,eh this movie was boring for me didnt feel connected to the plot or the characters the action scenes were bland tom hardy was great tho 
Oct 25 2018,positive,this movie is good it was fun it reminded me of how marvel can turn really dark villain in to comedic antihero and i dont know why critics are hating on it so much
Oct 25 2018,positive,i honestly dont know what everyones talking about venom is fine i mean its not great there were a few moments i found myself thinking this bits pretty bad why did they do this and a lot of moments i found myself thinking this bits pretty good but they still probably should have just made a real venom movie with marvel    but its fine the absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within venom himself between brock and the symbiote and the movie would have been a lot worse if tom hardy wasnt capable of pulling that off look a venom movie probably should have been rated r and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago but i still had a good time with venom maybe its not the best possible version of the story but im still glad we have this one
Oct 25 2018,positive,great romcom would see again
Oct 25 2018,positive,had goofycringey moments but still had a lot of fun  has a sony spiderman feel to it kinda dated
Oct 25 2018,positive,a pleasant surprise not true to the comic but still a good movie takes about 45 mins before it gets interesting those are the only 2 draw backs that maid it a 4 star and not 5
Oct 25 2018,positive,i like it enough to watch a sequel it gets an extra star for nostalgia
Oct 25 2018,negative,yawn inducing smashysmashyaction scenes overlayed with terrible cgi and strapped to the bones of a potentially good comic book franchise bonded like a parasite to good acting thats trapped behind terrible plotting so not a win  all that said 10 year old comic book reading me gives it six stars
Oct 25 2018,positive,the romcom people were waiting for
Oct 25 2018,neutral,venom is enjoyable if you have absolutely no expectations tom hardy is a good actor just like costar michelle williams the problem is they are miscast for the roles as they try and elevate amateur hour action filmmaking also this is not the venom we know and love from comics its nonsensical trash from a barely fan director that doesnt understand the character nor the appeal but there are some funny moments during the film at best you can say venom is fun and entertaining but in reality the director does not know or care enough for the source material to pay reverence to it is this venom better than one we saw in spiderman 3 in some ways yes we get to see eddie wrestle with the symbiote in literal ways and in others ways no the origin and ties to spiderman are completely sidestepped which leads a fan to ask why does the symbiote take on a spiderman appearance with the eyes it doesnt make much sense and never explained just like several plot points or narrative choices what we are left with is a film that is a mess but fun and entertaining if you have absolutely no expectations a sequel is teased but do we really need more bad cgi with a nonsensical take on venom no we need venom back at marvel so he can be done right 
Oct 25 2018,positive,its definitely no theatrical masterpiece but entertaining to watch throughout
Oct 25 2018,positive,i dont know what this critics talking shit about this movie its really good they cant even make their own movie
Oct 25 2018,positive,venom is directed by ruben fleischer written by jeff pinkner scott rosenberg and kelly marcel and starring tom hardy riz ahmed and michelle williams    screen story by jeff pinkner and scott rosenberg and its about an investigative journalist eddie brock attempts a comeback following a scandal but accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alterego venom soon he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from a shadowy organisation looking for a symbiote of their own    as one of the most anticipated movie of 2018 this review will contain lots of spoilers youve been warned    the plot of this movie is showing us that the symbiotes has arrived to our little blue planet apparently by carlton drake and then one of them escaped and thats all i wanted more i wanted at least to know how did drake know that these creatures are even existing not only seeing the plane coming to earth just like that it was more than fastpaced than it should actually be and this is my biggest issue with this movie it might be not that big but when it comes in the plot it must be the biggest    now to the first act it was good as an introduction of everysingleone in this movie but it went so slowpaced it was fine for me after that huge fastpaced plot    the second act begins and the fun starts by eddie gets venom by maria and from that very specific moment when eddie got infected the movie got so fun and fastpaced with some amazing chasing mixed with action and a very exciting soundtrack but its not sinless because the second act has some very bad cgi especially when the camera was focused on eddie while driving but eddie talking to venom was so amazing i cant describe how amazing these scenes were then we get the very first whole venom appearance scene which was very good but very short though and here is another issue we dont get that much of venom scenes we get his voice and some of his gadgets i wanted more of that amazing creature    the third act was very good i got satisfied especially when i saw the shevenom i didnt even think that they would actually put her in everything was great until the finale it was breathtaking but very very short but still very entertaining but i hoped that it lasted more than what we got the cgi was pretty good and the soundtrack too    the movie was really good i liked it it disappointed me because i didnt get that much of the things i wanted to see in it i mean the movie is just 1h 52min they could have make it longer but anyways its some very talented performances except for michelle williams as anne weying she was very annoying and i didnt enjoy watching her and it has also a good story mixed with amazing action sequences and a great ost im gonna give venom a b    alright guys thank you as always for reading my review let me know if you like my reviews or not and i welcome all the comments
Oct 25 2018,positive,this was basically being too high the movie  you want to eat everything and you feel like youre going to fuckin die  this movie was a mess but an enjoyable mess  it was bad but yet entertaining  i would suggest it if youre looking to enjoy something like the room
Oct 25 2018,positive,very entertaining action and comedy wise story wise not great
Oct 25 2018,positive,fantastic i dont recall the last time i had so much fun loved eddie and venom and the fact that their bond didnt get squashed down
Oct 25 2018,positive,the movie i liked a lot i do not usually see rotten tomatoes because the critics of the experts never agree with my opinion and i see that that has not changed  this page should look for people more related to the tastes of the people i think it was a good script finally an antiheroe  and very well done eloquent action scenes and without exaggerated extravagances of special effects plus excellent actors i hope marvel comics continues on that path
Oct 25 2018,positive,just watched venom  was brilliant doesnt capture the essence of venom in the comics how ever still loved how they did him    it was to me a horrorcomedyaction movie to me it captured it all it didnt have gore but it may as well have done and love it    i hope a venom 2 comes out of this that i want to see
Oct 25 2018,neutral,yeah venoms personality and his gonzo relationship with eddie is a bright spot along with some of the action effects  to some extent tom hardys fun performance its not enough to lift up a boring aggressively silly movie that too generic and shallow for its own good as a movie it mildly entertains but as a film its a misfire  510
Oct 25 2018,positive,it was really good especially if youre looking for a more mature marvel movie i havent really seen a decent marvel movie since logan while other marvel movies are good they come off as childish at times the story was good tom hardy was awesome in the words of joe bob four stars check it out 
Oct 25 2018,positive,ive seen it twice already and im going again next week
Oct 25 2018,positive,i saw this movie 4 times already and i love it it has in my believe the best motorcycle scene ever made
Oct 25 2018,positive,best live action venom ever
Oct 25 2018,positive,so much better than what the critics say
Oct 25 2018,positive, film critics are trash go see this def onpar with any of the phase 1 mcu films 
Oct 25 2018,positive,very enjoyable if you like the venom character
Oct 25 2018,positive,better than i thought it would be some decent laughs and a great job by ton hardy the major actions scenes were lacking but overall worth my matinee theatre ticket
Oct 25 2018,positive,not sure who paid the critics for false negative reviews this movie was hilarious
Oct 25 2018,positive,critics are idiots this movie is entertaining granted theres some plot holes but tom hardy is great 
Oct 25 2018,positive,i thought this movie was going to suck because of the reviews that it got so on my off day i decided to go see it and see for myself and i gotta say it was a decent movie i definitely think they could have made it longer and made it more dark i feel a lot of these marvel movies should be dark but for some reason they keep it pg13 also they keep trying to throw in comedy into the movies and some movies dont need it all and all i thought this was a decent movie
Oct 25 2018,negative,whew they had me at tom hardy and marvel yes please  and although im not the hugest fan michelle williams is very well respected i was so looking forward to venom despite the bad reviews  listen to the reviews the script was cringeworthy and some of the action was very entertaining but not enough to get me on the good side of the fence tom tried like a hot trooper to elevate the show with his hilarious reactions body language and expressions in an effort to rise above the ridiculous dialogues but alas no
Oct 25 2018,positive,tom hardy is an amazing actor
Oct 25 2018,positive,we havent had a nice simple comic movie in a while 
Oct 25 2018,positive,this movie had flaws the antagonist was awful it took to long getting into the storyline imo and i didnt enjoy the romantic threesome other then that i really enjoyed the movie i enjoyed it more than most disneymarvel movies i was left wanting more and the post credit scene at the end literally gave me goose bumps     i do not understand how critics work i checked on some of the critics who gave t his movie a bad review and why and then i checked how they reviewed the last jedi this proves that we have a serious problem with critics in the industry today and user reviews is the only real review we can count on as the consumer as the professionals are not honest
Oct 25 2018,positive,mixing aliens and spiderman works to a point i found the first half of the movie engrossing and suspenseful second half very noisy and green screen in abundance
Oct 25 2018,positive,usual comic book movie had some good action and great chase scenes in san francisco 
Oct 24 2018,negative,campy and was a complete waste of my time
Oct 24 2018,neutral,tom hardy and venom were good the rest of the movie was pretty lame 
Oct 24 2018,positive,im in the minority but why do all these critcs say that it wasnt good the audience liked it and those who havent watched are probably going to avoid it because of all the hate its getting criticizing the movie with the perspective as a respected movie critic is not what this site should be about instead see it as an everyday person going to enjoy a movie criticizing it this way gives those who havent watched a perspective they can likely relate to no normal person is gonna go and watch venom and say that it was terrible it had a good amount of laughs and the action looked good the jokes were funny and the acting was great just because it doesnt meet the expert bar doesnt  mean its bad try to look at it from the perspective of an average joe looking for a good movie those bad critical reviews are what stop people from going to see it but those reviews are from people who are payed to criticize movies rotten tomatoes doesnt  give the audience score a significant look when really thats what it should come down to how the people liked it
Oct 24 2018,positive,it was much better than the critics would have me believe
Oct 24 2018,positive,the critics cant criticise apparently this movie is the dogs bollocks i really enjoyed it the cgi for venom look really cool plus it has some great humour in it
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie was the best one ive seen its seriously just a romcom  
Oct 24 2018,negative,option a watch this   option b root canal   option c brain surgery  option d revaluation of every life choice that got you to this place
Oct 24 2018,positive,very fun could be gayer but overall if youre thirsty for a hot monster want to see a hot and good actor doing his job awesomely or just like a good time this movie is for you once again needs more gay but gets points for trying effects are really good and story is nice shoutout to my homeboy stan lee btw
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie is freaken  funny
Oct 24 2018,positive,venom being the target of such widespread critical derision is a case in which i cant objectionally understand now that ive actually watched it directed by zombielands rueben fleicher sonys latest marvel venture is a refreshingly old school comic romp that references the days before the mcu set into motion a code of conduct that all else would follow its fun its wild and takes a bunch of tonal risks the result is not perfect in composition but way more cohesive then it deserved to be or you have been lead to believe like tom hardys loopy central performance the film itself is entertainingly offkilter uneven and also pretty satisfying is a myriad ways i dug it
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie was awesome i loved eddie and the symboiyote venoms dialouge
Oct 24 2018,positive,campy dumb and tbh hilarious had a great time at ten on a monday and have been recommending it to everyone i know
Oct 24 2018,positive,very entertaining movie plenty of laughs would have strongly benefited from an r rating that or a developed villain 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i watch this twice and the special effect on the movie was amazing
Oct 24 2018,negative,this is a movie that while better is comparable to suicide squad in that is isnt an objectively good film however you can still have a fun time watching it i will probably pick up the 4k when its realeasd
Oct 24 2018,positive,venoms voice acting got to be cartoonish and the antagonists ego was larger than the intimidation that was meant to be construed but i have to be honest by saying that i was thoroughly entertained the entire film the feelgood story clear lessons and themes and fantastic quick wit
Oct 24 2018,positive,after the first 35 minutes i loved it
Oct 24 2018,positive,excellent antihero movie tom hardy kicking  and eating pancrease wearevenom
Oct 24 2018,positive,a bit slow in the beginning they spent way too much time showing eddies hard fall from grace the fun starts with our boy venom and goes from there great car chase good fight scenes black humor the critics are overpaid failed hollywood types that think a movie has to have a certain formula and cant be just fun worth admission go and enjoy 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie but they should have made it r and put in the blood and such from him killing people
Oct 24 2018,positive,this was a great movie although there could be a bit more character growth i would recommend this to any venom fan to repeat this was an amazing film
Oct 24 2018,negative,if you need to know one thing about this movie know that its rated pg13 this movie went the way deadpool would have gone with a pg based rating venom is a killer an antihero who is far more gruesome and cruel than deadpool could dream to be so my advice is to skip the theaters and wait for the uncut dvd release hands down the worst comic movie to date yes its worse than green lantern
Oct 24 2018,positive,it was entertaining and had some good laughs  maybe not worth seeing in the theaters but worth seeing
Oct 24 2018,positive,pretty cheesy at parts but overall a pretty good movie
Oct 24 2018,positive,i actually liked it alot although it seemed abit rushed and hopefully can improve soon to make it better
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie is dope as sugar honey ice tea im looking forward to the new smcu universe venom and eddie are portrayed beautifully so perfect stuck to the comics accrurate job well done as expected from tom hardy love the mention of the klyntar race sony killing the game this year first spiderman ps4 now this 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i am absolutely obsessed with this movie its so good and im so disappointed and so sad about the ratings this movie deserved much more better ratings
Oct 24 2018,positive,it was action packed funny and entertaining
Oct 24 2018,positive,actually a very entertaining and fun watch
Oct 24 2018,positive,wow with the critics hating on venom like they did justice league i was prepared for a disaster of a movie i am going back for a second viewing this weekend maybe without hardy the numbers might have a leg to stand on yes it was a mistake to go for the pg13 rating but its still entertaining and even jawdropping sometimes better than other superhero flicks with higher ratings imho
Oct 24 2018,positive,loved it not sure why the critics were so harsh though yes the script is a bit formulaic and yes pacing was slow in certain parts the cast did a great job and unlike most action movies coming out right now it kept my butt in the seat in comparison to the other marvel movies that have been coming out of marvel studios this one had more of a darker tone which i personally prefer but while i liked it i feel like an even better movie was left on the cutting room floor which is a bit of a shame but it didnt hurt the movie too much overall
Oct 24 2018,positive,action comedy that kept me entertained and laughing for a movie about one out of a couple major villains of sm id say they did a pretty good job
Oct 24 2018,positive,good but needed to be rated r
Oct 24 2018,positive,venom was a cool movie they used a lot of different elements it started scary went over to a little bit comedy and ended with a real superhero movie ending very good
Oct 24 2018,positive,its not the greatest action movie but its definitely the greatest romantic comedy of all time even if they try to hide it under some action sequences
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie was awesome i love it
Oct 24 2018,positive,venom is like a buddy action comedy meets alien invasion flick the effects are fantastic the acting is stellar  tom hardy is amazing  and the plot works all around somewhere between deadpool and blade
Oct 24 2018,positive,awesome movie lots of action great humor kept us all intrigued not tons of gore which was great because he didnt not require it
Oct 24 2018,positive,this movie memed hard being funny engaging and epic all while keeping a reasonable pace definitely not mcu caliber but it was a fresh fun time would see again 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i was reluctant to go see this movie because of  the bad ratings it received from critics but im  happy that i decided to go even though the script sometimes lacked momentum the villain came across as a bit lame and the romantic arc of the story  took a while to establish itself tom hardys portrayal of venom and the high quality action scenes made up for these mistakes the soundtrack is also awesome  and fits very well with the overall vibe of the venom character
Oct 24 2018,neutral,a nonmemorable yet fun telling of a beloved comic book character suffers greatly from its incoherent script forgettable villain and questionable direction but in all honesty its still pretty damn entertaining and tom hardys portrayal of venom rescued this film from being an abomination
Oct 24 2018,positive,liked it a lot fun and not dumb
Oct 24 2018,positive,surprisingly funny and a genuinely enjoyable movie cant wait to buy it when it comes out
Oct 24 2018,positive,terrible writing with good acting to try and save it weird tonal shifts entertaining with a lot of flaws
Oct 24 2018,positive,great movie dont trust the critics idk what they are talking about 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i always have low expectations for any marvel movies but this was great the humor wasnt forced like almost every other marvel movie and tom hardy is amazing dont listen to the critics 
Oct 24 2018,positive,awesome entertaining from start to finish funny and full of energy not sure why the low scores from critics many fans have already seen it multiple times 
Oct 24 2018,positive,decent movie kind of slow plot  needed a spiderman connection 
Oct 24 2018,positive,i went in not knowing what to expect but venom exceeded my expectations special effects were great i love the added humor and venom does fine existing separately from spiderman
Oct 24 2018,positive,best marvel movie since black panther excellent acting and very funny at times tom hardy is amazing in his role as eddie brock 10 year old loved it as well
Oct 23 2018,positive,seriously shocked seeing the tomatometer rating the movie only 30 that movie literally blew me off my feet definitely recommending it to anyone who asks me about it
Oct 23 2018,positive,tom hardy manages to bring enough talent to the table to compensate for venoms flaws
Oct 23 2018,negative,cliche and overhyped
Oct 23 2018,positive,refreshing for a superhero movie great special effects chemistry between the love interest and main character was weird in the beginning overall i was surprised i liked it and didnt feel let down some character development seemed a little too sudden and forced though
Oct 23 2018,positive,just seen the new venom movie and thought it was great hardy was a great eddy brock the story line was good it could have been alittle longer but very enjoyable and worth seeing in the theaters  they have to do a sequel
Oct 23 2018,positive,this is the greatest buddy adventure movie ever and its unfortunate that the studio didnt try to portray that in its advertising the critics were expecting something else and thats probably why it got such bad reviews i think if it had been offered as a romcombuddy action movie it would have garnered much better reviews as a whole i love this movie and id see it again purely out of the relationship between eddie and venom excellent dynamic i took off a half star because i thought there could have been more screen time between the two if you havent already please go see this
Oct 23 2018,positive,really entertaining movie thats carried forward brilliantly by tom hardy
Oct 23 2018,positive,venom was a good movie but it lacks a good time in the first 30 minutes
Oct 23 2018,positive,i grew up as a 90s kid reading my dads venom comic books and watching the animated versions i really enjoyed marvels spin on venoms new character the old character was all about venom and  hardly about eddie but they threw in a twist they included eddie as the a part of venom numerous times saying we and us and showing the bonding experience especially with anne i really enjoyed this movie and hope that they come out with a second i understand that spiderman is a vital part of venom in the marvel world but honestly whether you grew up with marvel or not venom did amazing as a movie without spiderman holding him up they did a great job i look foward to seeing more of these interpretations
Oct 23 2018,positive,i really dont understand the largely negative review from critics and some fans did venom reinvent the wheel when it comes to storytelling or superhero movies no it didnt however as a fan of venom and anything comic related i had fun the lack of spiderman can be confusing to some more casual comic fans as well as general audiences but its not the first time venom has been solo adapting the lethal protector series was a nice way to keep the movie fun and true even without spiderman plus the movie leaves more content to be touched upon down the line i think the movie is refreshing and fun it shows that not everything marvel has to necessarily be connected to still have an enjoyable movie its honestly a little bit like ant man and the wasp i unlike some people thought the cgi was very tastefully done and visually pleasing point is if your a fan of venom then you will probably enjoy the movie if your a fan of marvel then you will probably enjoy the movie last but not least if your a member of the general audience you will probably find venom enjoyable even if it doesnt attempt to redesign movie making as a whole
Oct 23 2018,positive,venom is far from perfect but dont sleep on it tom hardy is fantastic as venomeddie brock and the design and characterization of our symbiote protagonist is superior to that of its spiderman 3 predecessor fun and funny its not going to win any oscars and it pales in comparisons to the heavy comic book hitters of the year black panther and avengers infinity war but its worth a viewing especially if youre a spidey fanatic like me
Oct 23 2018,positive,a film for the kids silly popcorn saturday afternoon fluff cleansed of gratuitous skin vulgarity and stupidity with enough cleverness and duplicity to amuse adults without really scaring the daylights out of the kids  fast fun and some furious chase scenes but tom hardy is so easy to watch and so likeable this could start a whole new franchise for him michelle williams doesnt hurt either
Oct 23 2018,positive,a little rushed but overall a fun movie
Oct 23 2018,positive,was fast in the beginning but really awesome and fun to watch after venom
Oct 23 2018,negative,this is a weird one this film is not particularly well made written or paced but there is still enjoyment to be found in just how strange of a film it is strange in the sense that it doesnt feel like the kind of super hero movie that still gets made it tells closer to the mask than it does to spiderman homecoming tom hardys performance is sincere if not a little bit off the wall at times he cranks the physical comedy up to 11 something that i did not expect judging by the trailers speaking of the trailers if youve watched them youve basically seen this whole movie if this review seems to be sounding a little uneven and all over the place thats because the film is as well tom hardy said that his favourite 40 minutes of the movie were cut out of the final product and honestly you can really feel it by the time the final act starts eddy and venom seem to become close friends off screen and the battle with riot the films villian doesnt seem to have any real build up yet despite all of the films failings there were still moments that left a smile on face and with it a sense of administration that such a messy weird uneven movie even got made in the first place
Oct 23 2018,positive,this movie is so much fun  for sure the fifth best superhero movie of the year right up there with avengers infinity war deadpool 2 spider man into the spiderverse and aquaman
Oct 23 2018,positive,the first 30 mins seemed kinda slow and drawn out but everything after eddie got his symbiote was awesome the interactions between them are comedic and beautifully done
Oct 23 2018,positive,love it would see it again its me momo
Oct 23 2018,positive,awesome movie after the dc nightmares fun with a goodm movie
Oct 23 2018,positive,entertaining and a fun ride not as bad as the critics seem to think
Oct 23 2018,negative,a concept that had such potential falls flat on its face as sony screws up again    the plot concerns venom trying to stop another symbiote from destroying the world however this simple plot is only carried along because everyone in the movie is an absolute idiot with no common sense    the script is laughably bad and tom hardy mumbles his lines throughout the whole movie so its really hard to understand him    the special effects arent to bad i guess and least venom actually looks like a hulking threatening monster    the editing is atrocious very rarely do i get confused by bad editing and i can generally keep track of stuff in huge action set pieces but i have no idea what happens during the action scenes all i can make out is incomprehensible noise and two rubbery cgi monsters smacking into each other    overall i think your money is best spent elsewhere
Oct 23 2018,positive,the critic reviews definitely got it all wrong with venom tom hardys magnetic performance as eddie brockvenom easily carries this adaptation of a comic book legend and spidermans greatest rival action was perfect good drama and a solid supporting cast very fun movie
Oct 23 2018,positive,this was actually pretty good the middle was slow enough to be madding though the rest awesome
Oct 23 2018,positive,not every antagonist needs to have a protagonist
Oct 23 2018,positive,loved this movie so good action packed and had a lot of genuinely funny scenes
Oct 23 2018,positive,was shot more like a scifi action movie than the typical marvel movies that have been coming out lately i really liked it best marvel movie in ages glad sony took this one on
Oct 23 2018,positive,very good as most marvel films loves the action and great use of comedy
Oct 23 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie its not a part of the mcu but was still a terrific marvel film 
Oct 23 2018,positive,the critics are just being pricks about it the movies great and lots of fun
Oct 23 2018,positive,finally a venom movie  i enjoyed it but wish there was an r rating to make him more like comic character of venom  overall was good with occasional  laughs good action scenes
Oct 23 2018,positive,comical brilliant and gripping  this film hit my expectations out the park i would even see it again in cinema
Oct 23 2018,positive,nice action movie with entertaining action scenes and well built cinematography however the story felt a bit lackluster still enjoyed it a ton and cant wait for the carnage film
Oct 23 2018,negative,venom greatly benefits from hardys acting which is basically the only thing that stands out he carries the movie by himself for the most part because the script is frankly disappointing
Oct 23 2018,positive,some of the critics said that the movie needed more action or needed a stronger tie to spiderman but thats what made the movie so good by making the movie independent from spiderman they could all there attention on eddy brock and venom and we all have seen marvel action movies like avengers and xmen it a breath of fresh air to see a movie that focuses primarily on the psychological aspect of venom it was the right choice
Oct 23 2018,positive,great original story
Oct 23 2018,positive,1010 great movie would watch for the third time
Oct 23 2018,positive,despite some pretty glaringly obvious poor camera work and a lacking script the film still manages to deliver both edgeofseat riding action and marvel type comedy apparently some critics arent able to stomach a little bit of head biting but thats okay overall its a decent watch if nothing and i didnt regret seeing it in theaters this film probably couldve benefited largely by being left to marvel studios themselves rather than letting sony take point here
Oct 23 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Oct 23 2018,positive,ignore the critics they dont know what theyre talking about at all this movie was the best actionsuperhero movie ive seen in a while 
Oct 23 2018,neutral,just okaytoo scifi at times 
Oct 23 2018,positive,omggg i dont care what the critics say it was so entertaining haha
Oct 23 2018,positive,dope movie tom hardy is hilarious as eddie brockvenom 
Oct 23 2018,positive,well venom was better then expected but had its problems some lines fell flat well others were hilarious the biggest problem was being held back by rating not just in the action and swearing but by having a much heavier tone for the over all plot the fight scenes were good but not great and seeing riot use some of his moves almost just made me feel let down because all i could think was imagine what that would have looked like with an r rating some of tom hardy and venoms dialogue was great and so was tom hardy as eddie id check it out for sure but could have been so much more 
Oct 23 2018,positive,it may be generic to some but i honestly love it its a lot of fun
Oct 23 2018,neutral,noticeably an r rated movie that was censored to pg13 to sell more tickets very disappointing
Oct 23 2018,positive,there are good parts and bad parts in this movie   overall its a fun movie however both the beginning and ending of the movie are quite horrible you can really see how sony interfered witch brings me to the conclusion good actors and vfx just arent enough to compensate for bed script and production
Oct 23 2018,positive,best movie i ever saw this movie made me want a symbiote
Oct 23 2018,positive,its actually a bmoviecomedy they didnt market this correctly the fanboys and critics didnt get it
Oct 23 2018,positive,loved this movie great job look forward to the next 
Oct 22 2018,positive,venom may be no infinity war but it is still an epic popcorn flick that i feel is unnecessarily hated
Oct 22 2018,positive,funny and adventurous plus tom hardy loved it 
Oct 22 2018,positive,must watch movie 
Oct 22 2018,positive,critics can go fck themselves this movie was beautiful
Oct 22 2018,positive,amazing movie some stuff needed better explaining but all around great movie
Oct 22 2018,positive,i fell in love with eddie and venom they are so good together 3
Oct 22 2018,negative,the character played by hardy has no redeemable traits that make him interesting  the space slime changes its mind in the middle of the movie about its motive which i found to be unbelievably bad writing  not a good comic book movie not a good marvel move not a good movie
Oct 22 2018,positive,it was actually good
Oct 22 2018,positive,810 how  this movie got only 30
Oct 22 2018,positive,very entertaining great performance by tom hardy
Oct 22 2018,positive,was a super fun movie and cant wait until the next one only wish they spent more time with eddie thinking he was going crazy dont listen to the critics they likes tlj and that movie sucked
Oct 22 2018,positive,loved it eddie was such a relatable character and anne wasnt a cringy ex and dan wasnt a controlling new boyfriend
Oct 22 2018,positive,movie was great love how they integrated everything together like always the stupid critics are wrong and the audience is who people should listen to
Oct 22 2018,positive,we loved this movie tom hardy was amazing humor action  amazing visuals
Oct 22 2018,positive,watch this movie if you want to have fun and see eddie brock act like a loveable goofball dont be scared by the tomato score  its not an art film ladies and gents
Oct 22 2018,positive,not sure whether i was so excited that that they made a venom movie or tom hardy was venom or that marvel actually allowed a person to get their head bitten off but critics got this one wrong
Oct 22 2018,positive,great movie it was funny as well as badass and there was a bit of romance who the hell is rating this movie only 30 on rotten tomatoes when the audience is rating it at 88  this was a fun title i wish they make it into a series or at least a second movie
Oct 22 2018,positive,i  saw venom not too long a go it was a great movie it was action packed i enjoyed it and it was funny i feel like rotten tamatoes is rating venom wrongly
Oct 22 2018,positive,venom was a hit all thanks to its director ruben fleischer the movie takes place in san francisco when an alien organism venom becomes linked to a host eddie brock one of fleischers goals that he reached very well was that he wanted to create a movie that was different from most marvel movies he did this by showing the audience the view of the villain although most people see venom as a villain which he is fleischer happened to make him the hero of this story second fleischers use of visual effects brings venom to life for the audience the visual effects of venom is not something that is easy to make however fleischer successfully does this and shows the audience a visually realistic monster venom some scenes where this can become incredibly difficult is when venom takes over eddies body however fleischer does this very well and allows the viewers to experience every detail of venom third venom is given a humorous personality which keeps the audience laughing throughout the film most of this happens in conversation between eddie and venom but venom continues to surprise the viewers throughout the film in conclusion this film is a success due to the visual effects the comedy and the view of the villain
Oct 22 2018,positive,venom man  venom man  friendly neighborhood venom man  made of goop  any size  catches thieves  eats those guys  hey wait  dont do that venom man    a best horrorthemed romcom of the year i want the sequel to have a scene where venom and eddie fight over the remote do it do it cowards
Oct 22 2018,positive,just watched the movie with my son did not want to see this movie well i am glad i did movie was awesome and very interesting was not like i expected it to be it was way better
Oct 22 2018,positive,this film was actually really entertaining and somehow made comedy work unlike some marvel films actors and venom were very good for their roles cant believe critics gave this a 30 definitely deserves at least an 80
Oct 22 2018,positive,it was not a 30 rotten tomato worth watching
Oct 22 2018,positive,it was great i just loved it and i loved the fun bond between venom and eddie and he actually doesnt need spiderman although it would be pretty good to see them team up
Oct 22 2018,positive,i really thought it waa a great film very funny and also some nice action i could see the film again and again and still enjoy it i hope there will be another
Oct 22 2018,negative,dumb movie with bad words bad used i guess idea was to sound funny but not even close not recommended
Oct 22 2018,positive,entertaining and funny at times id recommend seeing it
Oct 22 2018,positive,what the hell do critics have against this it was fantastic as a particular article saidvenom is a romcom disguised as a bad superhero movie it really was they even had the tragic breakup characteristic of one one of my main gripes was that the cgi during the fight between riot and venom it could be a little easier to understand the whole thing was just two masses of black goop mashing and slashing but honestly in desperate need of a stronger attachment to spiderman are you kidding this islike a part one a sequel will probably run parallel to the mcu
Oct 22 2018,negative,what a disappointment what frustrates me the most is that sony promised a horror movie and we got a full comedy with a character that never said a joke in the comic books venom has horrible scenes and horrible dialogues the best thing in the movie is tom hardy which is also not great
Oct 22 2018,positive,i like so very much the work of tom hardy have the intention to do all to it can to be venom
Oct 22 2018,positive,absolutely love this film captured venoms weird humour also loved the interaction with venom and eddie brock also the fight scene between venom and riot  ripping each other apart was awesome
Oct 22 2018,negative,barely 25 stars feels like the whole movie was rushed with the script and the cgi superhero shows that are on today have better cgi than this whole movie and they have a smaller budget
Oct 22 2018,positive,loyal to the source material and fun all the way through
Oct 22 2018,positive,i loved venom it is by far the best marvel movie in years
Oct 22 2018,positive,the critics are wrong this was the perfect venom movie that we could have asked for the amount of character development between eddie and venom is very close to the comics the critics are incorrect about this this is a must watch no matter how low you guys put this down it rises higher we are venom 1010 would watch again spiderman didnt need to be in this this was never about spiderman this is about the symbiotic relationship of eddie and venom and the whole i am like you a loser is something deeper then the critics can wrap there heads around so fuck off i will defend venom
Oct 22 2018,positive,im not sure why critics rated it low i enjoyed it and it was fun
Oct 22 2018,positive,the movie was super fun and enjoyable the villain was meh but the friendship between venom and eddie was amazing
Oct 22 2018,positive,lit movie dont listen to critics 
Oct 22 2018,positive,pretty good it was worth visiting the real movie theater
Oct 22 2018,positive,i may be the minority but as in legend tom hardy does it once again  carrys the film by himself if not for a dull plot and possibly a duller villain this film would have floppeda sequel im sure will be alot better
Oct 22 2018,positive,incredible film rotten tomatoes are so wrong i dunno what they have against dc film but it has to stop
Oct 22 2018,positive,very fun movie i was really looking forward to it and became worried when critics came out with their reviews they were wrong tom hardy was great and i really enjoyed his humorous relationship with venom hope they have even more of that in the sequel
Oct 22 2018,positive,i dont care what anyone says the movie was great just look at the audience score if you need validation personally i wasnt completely on board to see the film but my partner wanted to see it so we went being someone who doesnt really like hero movies the story and chase scenes kept me on the edge of my seat i laughed during most of the dialog between venom and eddie and at one point the entire room erupted in laughter go see it i promise you at least wont hate it if you dont have the same opinion but you will enjoy it
Oct 22 2018,negative,cheesy and poor acting
Oct 22 2018,positive,one of the best superhero movies iâtmve seen in a while thatâtms not made by marvel sure the cgi looked not good but still really enjoyable and a funny movie
Oct 22 2018,negative,liked the movie hated the storyline
Oct 22 2018,neutral,venom starts out on the right foot with an intimate view of eddie brocks life and a great setup that promises an amazing payoff but stumbles through the finish as it appears to have no idea what to do with that buildup when it has it
Oct 22 2018,positive,not a great movie but you get entertain 
Oct 22 2018,positive,no doubt the best romcom ive ever seen the action was really fun the characters were fantastic tom hardys acting was outstanding as always what a beautiful movie im going to see it for the second time tomorrow and wish i could watch it on repeat
Oct 22 2018,positive,dont listen to the idiot critics this movie is pretty good
Oct 22 2018,positive,i loved this movie it had humor and action and a tiny little bit of love mostly action and humor tho i loved the storytelling and the direction they took this movie loved it
Oct 22 2018,positive,go see it  good story  good action  the relationship between the host and symbiote is cool  the symbiote venom is the best character in the film
Oct 22 2018,positive,i dont care about story structure or tone or theme i want to be entertained and venom was entertaining it was funny and i thought it did the comics justice i think spiderman would have felt out of place in this movie everyone whined about it not being rated r but i thought it didnt need it he still ate people and bit someones head off i think thats about as much as it needed it didnt really need to be gratuitous like deadpool it just isnt necessary for venom i enjoyed it to the point that i didnt want to leave to go to the bathroom i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 22 2018,positive,i walked into it expecting the worst yet i enjoyed every bit of it
Oct 22 2018,negative,the movie started off slow as a matter of fact the movie didnt start getting interesting until 10mins of it ending  i wouldnt recommend this movie at all
Oct 22 2018,positive,for me venom is one of the best movies 2018 and i had a great time watching it it just has the perfect amount of humor at the perfect time and i enjoyed to watch the relationship between human and the symbiote the characters are well developed and tom hardy did a really great job would definately watch again and i look forward to further venom movies love it
Oct 22 2018,positive,great popcorn movie venom charactervoice was very likable id definitely see the sequel 
Oct 22 2018,positive,the thing is this movie has something that is missing from the newer marvel movies it has integrity and some gravity and its darker i think this is why it is doing so well at the box office in spite of bad reviews but all this aside and some problems with the plot overlooked venom is underneath it all actually a really decent movie tom hardy delivers a knockout of a performance although what he is working with here is kind of sketchy material i mean a venom movie with no ties to spiderman at all hardy delivers a unique performance that lingers with you after the movie is over
Oct 22 2018,positive,it was a great movie very accurate to the comics and what i wanted in the movie it had a few issues but overall it was great
Oct 22 2018,negative,if you are specifically into venom maybe this was great but as an outsider who is generally quite into marvel and tom hardys films i thought this was really underwhelming 
Oct 22 2018,negative,its just sad how a stupid movie is attracting all that audience  sad
Oct 22 2018,positive,really good superhero film it misses some plot points but its a great easy watching film
Oct 22 2018,positive,super entertaining i was laughing for most of the movie the action scene are also really cool
Oct 22 2018,positive,great movie i love that the writers did not pick up the original gettogether story where venom is clearly the villain with eddie brock full of hate in the newer comics venom tries really hard to become a hero because he does not want to be the villain the characterisation in the venom movie is brilliant and i absolutely love tom hardy in the role of eddie brock he is a gorgeous fit and his acting is gorgeous especially the scenes where he reacts to the voice in his head show what an extremely talented actor he is thank you for this movie i can not wait for a sequel this time hopefully with more of the bromance between eddie and venom they need more bond and screen time together
Oct 22 2018,positive,if not for bad writing id give it 5 hardy and venom have a wonderful dynamic and the villain is interneting enough but the plot was a pile of predictable basics and lame twists i would love to see the characters in something less sub par but that is what transformative works are for hopefully there is a sequel written by someone who has taken more than a basic super hero course still worth a watch likeable characters can save a boring story
Oct 22 2018,positive,its a amzing movie one of my favorits movie of all time
Oct 22 2018,positive,beat version of venom in a movie still would like to have seen a more true to the comics version but i wasnt disappointed 
Oct 22 2018,negative,the main character constantly seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown and this is before he meets venom poor cgi and the odd moments of humor mixed in with horror lead to a strange unsuccessful dialogue and plot
Oct 22 2018,positive,good but not very good
Oct 22 2018,positive,finally venom has been brought to life in live action great fun movie id love a sequel
Oct 22 2018,neutral,an utter waste of tom hardys talent more of the usual hollywood lazy writing and reliance on cgi at the expense of script and character development i really hope this isnt a trend for hardy
Oct 22 2018,positive,the eddie brock and venom dynamic alone is worth 5 stars
Oct 22 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie id gone into the cinema bracing for the hot mess described by the critics yet left with a big smile on my face  fun banter between eddie and venom and exciting wel paced action scenes
Oct 22 2018,positive,absolutely loved this havent been to the theaters in so long and it was so worth going just to see this
Oct 21 2018,positive,this movie was amazing the only bad thing about this movie was ummm nothing it was so good and tom hardy was the absolute perfect actor to play venom  i also loved venoms personality and voice the movie was so amazing im going to see it again for the 6th time and i love it
Oct 21 2018,positive,it was a fun ride watching this movie i think that the rating from critics is unfair yea 30 minutes that were cut from this movie are a problem but still this isnt bad movie by any means this venom is standalone thing for itself and you all must know that when you are watching movie accept the fact that there is no spider man no real comic book origin and etc accept that and you will enjoy the movie 
Oct 21 2018,positive,formulaic but enjoyed it
Oct 21 2018,positive,one of my favorite action movies including my mothers and she hates watching super hero movies but this one has a good plot and just great overall 
Oct 21 2018,positive,great movie dont understand the critic score probably a bunch of losers who are unhappy and trying to nit pick at everything watch this with an open mind and if you have a decent sense of humor and enjoyment for some action this is a great watch also if you like the mcu marvel movies its hard not to love this one although different universe
Oct 21 2018,positive,a very funny action spectacle everyone must see this movie   its better than the original spiderman triology  its a great fun and funny
Oct 21 2018,positive,i found it entertaining enough to enjoy
Oct 21 2018,positive,i actually liked this film of course i understand many of the critics points but generally i found it very entertaining
Oct 21 2018,positive,good movie but why so bad ratings
Oct 21 2018,positive,ignore the critics and go have a blast with this film ive never had any interest in venom but a friends invite beat a boring evening at home soooo glad i chose to attend because this was one of the funnest action films i have seen in a while although the beginning may feel a bit familiar or slow it quickly gives way to a great time
Oct 21 2018,positive,tom hardy made the movie for sure his character was hilarious and written well the exchange between venom and eddy cracked me and the theater up everyone was laughing i loved it sure i felt certain things might need to be different but really itâtms been awhile since i enjoyed a movie like this one iâtmm excited to see what happens next and will be owning this movie 
Oct 21 2018,positive,amazing witty funny and full of action must see
Oct 21 2018,positive,people dont know how to review this movie was amazing
Oct 21 2018,positive,although when compared to other new marvel movies this plot line may seem simple i think people need to stop comparing look at the film as a whole  and understand its place in the marvel universe i laughed and fully understood the plot i thought the special effects were creative and the music was entertaining overall the movie was enjoyable and i think people are underrating it
Oct 21 2018,negative,this movie is a steaming pile of cat turd
Oct 21 2018,neutral,a few fun scenes scattered in between less than top shelf cgi and cookie cutter script 
Oct 21 2018,negative,i normally dont like to mention the tomatometer or the audience score in a review but this is one of the few times where im at a loss the amount of socalled reviewers attacking critics in their reviews is baffling as if their opinions are worth more than the critics but i went out to see this film as i was all too curious to see why there was such a wide gap between the tomatoemeter score and the audience score and after seeing this movie i really wish i had listened to the critics im not quite sure what version everyone else saw that seemed to warrant the endless amount of 5 star reviews but clearly i wasnt so fortunate this film is a mess from start to finish perhaps the most disappointing thing about the film is seeing such talented actors like tom hardy and michelle williams give such bland performances apparently tom hardy only decided to do this film for his son and it clearly shows  this is easily one of the worst performances of his career to make matters worse him and michelle williams evidence almost no chemistry together but the performances arent the only problem  the asinine dialogue awful cgi which looks like its about 15 years outdated and lack of a compelling villain is what really made this film almost painful to sit through on top of that the movie tries to incorporate comedy but most of it comes off as forced and awkward i chuckled only twice throughout the whole movie the nicest thing i can say about this film is that at least the action sequences are competently filmed and are somewhat entertaining to watch and while i wouldnt go so far as to say this was almost as painful to watch as catwoman this is easily one of the worst superhero films in quite sometime
Oct 21 2018,positive,not the best however i will give that it was greatly underrated and compared too deeply with stoic acting that often comes with the bravado of comic book heroes venom is the kind of film you go see because you crave some good quality trashnot intellectual prose or social commentary a good bubblegum film that still satisfies the finicky feminist in me
Oct 21 2018,positive,this movie needed to have an r rating and needed to pick its genre its villain didnt stick and a lot in this movie felt sterile  that being said did i enjoy this movie  yes thoroughly  it was at times an absolute blast to watch and that enjoyment is the reason im going to the theater to begin with  i want a sequel and i want it to be better than this but i want a sequel because of the fact that this was ultimately a lot of fun
Oct 21 2018,positive,i like it is funny i definitely wanna see next movie
Oct 21 2018,positive,as a long time venom fan since i was a kid i was pleasantly surprised how good the movie was  very enjoyable action scenes and character development i really loved the characterization of venom
Oct 21 2018,positive,best accidental romcom ive seen all year boy falls in love with alien and saves the world 1010
Oct 21 2018,positive,really good fast pace movie
Oct 21 2018,positive,such a great acting crew the graphics were good and action was awesome i am a huge fan on venom and loved it
Oct 21 2018,positive,the movie was phenomenal i loved every bit of it and seriously recommend it
Oct 21 2018,positive,i loved this movie dont know what the critics saw but it was a ride full of laughs and good action
Oct 21 2018,positive,i thought it was a good movie funny at parts like a super hero buddy cop
Oct 21 2018,positive,i dont really why the critics hate this so much but its doing so well in theaters also this clearly was the best romcom of this year
Oct 21 2018,negative,this was a major disappointment it had great visuals and action a good performance by tom hardy and the occasional good joke but still its inconsistent tone and painfully bland plot make this a major letdown
Oct 21 2018,positive,now i am a huge fan of venom i have been waiting for a venom stand alone for a looong time and i loved this movie i view it as sort of a refresh names stay the same but the story has been changed its fun action pact i felt pulled in from the beginning    plus at this point marvel can do pretty much whatever they want cant wait to see what comes next
Oct 21 2018,positive,i actualy enjoyed the movie but i wished it would have ben a r rated move since venom is supposed to be more of a  darker story
Oct 21 2018,positive,the movie was funny and cgi was great the movie felt  fast but i still enjoyed it
Oct 21 2018,positive,it was amazing and awesome and tom hardy is the man
Oct 21 2018,positive,i really liked this movie i wish i wouldve saw the spider logo though the cgi was pretty awesome i think sony stepped up their game big time with venom since spiderman 3
Oct 21 2018,positive,really good movie if you dont over think it great action great story movie critics missed yet another one i just hope they didnt ruin our chances at a 2
Oct 21 2018,negative,allow me to explain the mess with this movie everything sonys impression with venom at first in spiderman 3 was just a hilarious impression of carnage just black a now sony thinks theyve learned their lesson by just making him bigger and bulkier than the venom we saw in spiderman 3 venom also shows that tom hardy is not only capable of screaming like a 8 year old but can also downgrade the rating for the movie this movie was rushed and unenjoyable none of the characters expect venom himself were plain out boring and uninteresting as bad as this movie is you should watch it anyways its fun and youll being laughing when venom says pussy    sony lets make a venom movie  tom hardy im interested  sony yeah and we can make it r like deadpool   tom hardy ooohfu im just doing this to please my 10 year old son   sony and   tom hardy maybe we could make it i dunno pg13   venom pussy
Oct 21 2018,positive,i was expecting so much more action out of this movie there was too much of him being sick and not enough cool action scenes the best action scene being the one where the crew comes into his apartment and the neighbor across the hall witnesses the madness otherwise the action was just not there it was sloppy and boring
Oct 21 2018,positive,critics need to relax  this movie was a nonstop thrill ride  lots of fun  sure there were some holes in the plot sure there could be some improvements but really  just sit back and youll enjoy the ride
Oct 21 2018,positive,i dont understand the hate  this was a fun antisuperhero movie  it has some good action some funny dialogue  the obligatory stan lee cameo  whats not to love  is it oscar worthy well was it supposed to be  does it have some hidden moral message  was it supposed to have  i doubt it  it was fun  just like a movie is supposed to be
Oct 21 2018,positive,great movie really enjoyed it
Oct 21 2018,positive,way better than i expected
Oct 21 2018,positive,this movie was incredible i went into it expecting garbage i tried to validate my expectations  i tried to watch it and say it as terrible because i hated the idea that it was a venom movie without spiderman but i couldnt it was brilliantly written expertly directed and phenomenally acted the only negative thing about the movie is the face that there is no spiderman which honestly isnt all that much a bad thing considering the hit and miss history of spider man movies please go into this movie with a clear mind to judge it as a movie instead of just hating it as a movie without spiderman please give it the credit it is truly due
Oct 21 2018,positive,venom is not the best movie but meets its purpose is fun and keeps you hooked to the screen anytime
Oct 21 2018,positive,dont worry about what the movie geeks the comic book purists and the sony vs mcu guys venom is a fun movie     the chemistry and banter between  eddie and venom both played by tom hardy  is better than any other relationship in the film the way he and his supposed fiancee talked to each other was very cardboard if i talked that way with my fiancee i would assume we wouldnt be engaged for much longer  riz ahmed  who is awesome sleepwalks through the film his motivation is very onedimensional  and unbelievable how does a pharmaceutical ceo do space exploration on the side    but dont let that distract you the story  requires the audience to suspend belief in order to enjoy it and yes upgrade did it better but i had fun with this movie and my audience cheered at the end maybe because it was a free screening
Oct 21 2018,positive,a great movie filled with laughter and action
Oct 21 2018,positive,my new favorite of the marvel movies deadpool and guardians of the galaxy are my favorites stay to very end to see all marvels additions 30 by the critics i kept looking for something to hateit wasnt there
Oct 21 2018,negative,slow plot development bad acting bad writing only a few entertaining minutes out of two agonizing hours
Oct 21 2018,negative,extremely poor film although it does have very few  redeeming qualities best to save your money for something else than sit through this abysmal tripe
Oct 21 2018,neutral,so much of this movie is poorly executed and the acting is kind of dull dont get me wrong tom hardy is great but i honestly dont even think the chemistry between venom and eddie was all that good the movie felt intensely rushed in the third act and a couple plot points are left unanswered the reveal ending is so poorly written that i think a fourth grader came up with the idea i wanted to like this movie i really did i will give it this though it was a lot of fun 
Oct 21 2018,positive,the best parts of this movie are the symbiote and eddie brock conversations funny the human villains are lacking the movie drags when the symbiote is not involved arsenal works but his host is useless that being said the promise for part two is huge an enjoyable popcorn movie overall i enjoyed it
Oct 21 2018,negative,what a lousy movie  i thought the story and acting were terrible  too similar to upgrade
Oct 21 2018,positive,not as good as ragnarok better than thor 1 and 2 and quite a few others this movie was funny well developed full of heart well animated and just a generally spectacular movie could venoms character arc slowed down a little and probably made more sense yes but it was so minor i barely noticed i wanna see it again and again and again
Oct 21 2018,positive,a fun film which despite being a jumbled mess of horror and comedy still manages to retain entertainment value as its themes somewhat mirror the transformation the protagonist is undergoing as two juxtaposing mindsets battle for harmony inside one body its not an mcu film but when it comes to venom much like with deadpool thats not a bad thing
Oct 21 2018,positive,another movie the critics got wrong  venom had a plot a hero a villain an evil company  and set the stage for sequels with or without spiderman  tom hardy and michele williams had great chemistry and the played well off each other just wished their ending was different  venoms motivations and their chenging made sense he loved earth and didnt want it to be overrun by his kind  great special effetcs  especially the fight between venom and riot  venoms appearance could have been a little more accurate though  definitely  a good start to the sony  expanded universe
Oct 21 2018,positive,fun to watch and the reviewers cannot control what people truly like
Oct 21 2018,positive,this is not a good film but its a fun ride more and more movies fitting that description nowadays 
Oct 21 2018,positive,awesome movie i hope they keep the sequal going i didnt give it 5 stars because the battle at the end could have been bigger
Oct 21 2018,positive,so the critics crapped on this movie is the plot all over the place yes is not having spiderman around weird yes but let me tell you one thing is venom entertaining yes first let me say something i dont know how this movie is pg13 because the body count is brutal i guess decapitation and slashing of human beings is okay as long as there isnt an inch of blood i think its lame but ill let it go this time venom is an anti super hero flick that is really a dark comedy bromance that will make you love it or hate it tom hardys interaction with his symbiote is what makes or breaks this movie     i honestly dont know how sony plans to if they do include spiderman here in the future because this version of venom would murder peter parker in battle thats another thing some of the venom face visuals might scare younger children so be careful with your kids in this one not to mention the amount of death this has some younger kids might not like it     this movie is kind of a fun mess i cant wait for the more gory and brutal directors cut final review 8 out of 10 stay for after credits and final credits
Oct 21 2018,positive,i saw this movie twice and might go back to see it a third time ngl it was so fucking good the chase scenes the build up the character dynamics all so filling   ive never seen a movie twice in a theater on my own accord soooo  thats saying something
Oct 21 2018,positive,just saw venom today overall feeling is i loved it the retelling of the story in a new way adds depth to the character and a future of unanswered questions and a sense of wonder to whats next the movie has really intense action moments however the movie was slow in many parts and left alot of emotion to be absent i feel it was straight forward and didnt allow the other characters growth and give enough time to connect with them but as far as origin movies go this one takes the cake and leaves you wanting more i feel the future of this movie has alot of potential and i for one wouldnt mind seeing it makes it way to the mcu also that end credit scene makes me feel if they go for venom 2 we will see alot more action and hopefully rated r
Oct 21 2018,positive,rotten tomatoes quit censoring me venom was good
Oct 21 2018,positive,venoms a very unconventional superhero loved the movie also loved the chemistry between michelle williams and tom hardy  you never see venom as a hero but yet you still root for him and the bromance between tom hardy and venom is awesome its a super good movie to watch with your friends or just to have a good time yourself
Oct 21 2018,positive,tom hardy was excellent did feel rushed in spots but overall i really liked the movie 
Oct 21 2018,positive,amazing movie with great actors i enjoyed the plotline and reccommend it to anyone that enjoys action acting was really good and i enjoyed the humor in it overall loved it and wish to see it again
Oct 21 2018,positive,the start of a true love story
Oct 21 2018,positive,its actionpacked plot and witty dialogue makes this one of the best superhero movies there is never a dull moment in this funny movie the acting is fantastic youll want to see it repeatedly
Oct 21 2018,positive,amazing movie i would give it a 5 but its lacking spiderman otherwise a great film its also really funny i cant wait to see the next venom movie
Oct 21 2018,positive,entertaining and fun movie
Oct 21 2018,positive,very good movie i enjoyed it the story was good the action was real good and it had some laughs hope to see more of venum in the future
Oct 21 2018,positive,dont believe the critics go see it
Oct 21 2018,positive,absolutely loved it the critics are wrong again
Oct 21 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie i like the story especially when venom help eddie and become a good
Oct 21 2018,positive,venom   2018   dir ruben fleischer  runtime 1 hr 52 mins     synopsis when eddie brock acquires the powers of a symbiote he will have to release his alterego venom to save his life    so considering this was produced by sony i didnt have high hopes for it especially considering that this film is not connected to the mcu unfortunately which in turns means no spiderman how it should be anyways i was dramatically surprised with this film because i actually really enjoyed it the story itself was surprising because venom has many origin stories a very different route was used which worked out amazingly now knowing that this is an origin film just keep in mind that this starts out pretty slow once venom bonds to eddie they everything starts moving the rating of pg13 i was kind of expecting a spiderman 3 realm but they used it to their full capabilities and added a horror element with venoms cannibalism im not sure if it was on purpose but at some point if they decided to add him to the mcu it would work with venoms strange humor that works really well for the film its dark but not so dark that it becomes grotesque the end of the film worked really well setting up for a sequel my one complaint about the story is that they should have used the dry opening a little better by having eddie get venom sooner so they can build the character of venom a little better considering he is his own being and they acknowledge that in the film   the cgi was awesome and worked 1000x better than the way venom was portrayed in spiderman 3 apparently the white spider logo wasnt put on venoms chest so that way it doesnt have anything to do with the mcu riot looked amazing as well instead of making him look just like venom they stayed true to making him look like riot the final battle gets a little disorienting with some much cgi and symbiote action at once the characters are great even with venoms short character build he was a great asset to the cast tom hardy of course comes with amazing acting very unsuspecting character portrayal for hardy same goes for riz ahmed playing a villain the way he does would def recommend a theatre watch the action as well as venoms voice is worth hearing and feeling in theatre of course i would buy this being a marvel and superhero film but im a little biased on that note     45  most critics bashed the film not really sure why tbh even being biased i didnt see a lot of flaws mechanically wise the acting was great the cinematic elements were on point and the story ended well     oh dont forget there is a mid credit scene after the first set of credits you get a sneak peek into what is to come probably the most exciting part in my opinion was geekin all the way through it although as much as i want to spoil it i wont say anything it sets of for one of the best villains in the marvel universe
Oct 21 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie the interaction of eddie and venom was great and tom hardy was great  i personally liked the blend of comedy and dark undertones and i sincerely hope to see more venom in the future
Oct 21 2018,positive,this movie was so awesome cant wait for another one
Oct 21 2018,positive,super entertaining and funny plenty of action and excitement throughout the movie felt like i was watching a mcu movie
Oct 21 2018,positive,screw the critics this was a funny action packed movie that should have pleased any venom fan
Oct 21 2018,negative,are we still in the 2000s era
Oct 21 2018,positive,i liked the movie  its by no means perfect and leaves plenty to be desired but i liked tom hardys performance the humour was good and the action was pretty fucking awesome its obvious that the movie was changed to pg13 from rrated at the last minute because with the amount of heads that are bitten off theres a surprising lack of gore
Oct 21 2018,positive,i just watched venom it was fun i like the humor not a perfect movie but cool and entertaining i recommend it congrats venom with its success you deserve it
Oct 21 2018,positive,loved it simple action movie for venom fans no its not perfect but i enjoyed it because it was fun unexpected humor
Oct 21 2018,positive,i immensely enjoyed this film and love it regardless of whatever nitpicks i have most of which i chuck up to the change from r rated to pg13
Oct 21 2018,positive,this ticked all the boxes for this kind of movie and then some wellacted good effects nice attempt to make it a slightly different genre have to think thats marvels influence on sony but i could be wrong i appreciate that they didnt waste too much time on the setup they understand that if showed up for this were already allin spiderman purists might not like seeing the character apart from that world but other than that if you like this type of flick i highly recommend im not sure what the critics who complained about it thought it was going to be
Oct 21 2018,neutral,25 stars because the interaction between venom and eddie is occasionally funny  visually a complete disaster the alienssymbiotes are supposed to be gelatinous and amorphous ok but that means you dont fill entire action scenes with nothing on the screen but them  plot was virtually nonexistent venom decides to fight on the side of humanswhat why when tf did that happen   also did anyone else notice that the alien symbiote controlling its human host and being constantly hungry is basically a ripoff of dreamcatcher by stephen king
Oct 21 2018,positive,nothing cinematic rememberable but one of the most fun none marvel studios comic book movies in this years which are filled with too much output of this genre tom hardy shines in the protagonist role and raises the entertaiment of a film which would be a bland one without him just like ryan reynold did for deadpool  minus points for the non charismatic bad guy
Oct 21 2018,positive,top 5 marvel in my opinion
Oct 21 2018,positive,the interactions between venom and eddie were hilarious
Oct 21 2018,positive,awesome movie loved every second
Oct 21 2018,positive,shockingly subpar cgi extremely fast pacing and a pointless romantic subplot plus the plans to change it from r to pg13 dont make venom a bad movie we have decentish action tom hardys amazing performance and dynamic and a couple of funny moments with a midcredits sneak peek at into the spiderverse thats sadly better than the rest of the movie shouldve kept the original r rating plan but still a better venom movie than spiderman 3
Oct 21 2018,positive,better than i thought it would be story seems to be missing some seens
Oct 21 2018,positive,fun movielove the humorous way the character interacts with eddie
Oct 21 2018,positive,very entertaining  another great marvel movie adaptation
Oct 21 2018,negative,too much comedy very disappointed
Oct 21 2018,positive,really cool moviethe humor was cool and the action too
Oct 21 2018,positive,it was an awsome movie we loved it the best venom ever since the comics obviously
Oct 21 2018,positive,as the box office and audience score is telling you this is a movie you have to have to check out and that was not a spelling mistake
Oct 21 2018,positive,storyline needed a fair amount of setting up tom hardy fitted well as the main protagonist film concluded with quite a fire show
Oct 21 2018,positive,great movie for light entertainment 
Oct 21 2018,positive,my 12 year old is now a venom fan well done entertaining movie 
Oct 21 2018,positive,standard marvel movie not the best not the worst it was a still an enjoyable movie to watch and venom is much better here thanspiderman 3
Oct 21 2018,positive,any critic who has a negative review of this movie has obviously never experienced venom in the comics great representation and extremely enjoyable
Oct 21 2018,positive,venom does a great job at portraying spidermans number one arch nemesis giving him the screen time he deserves and the look of the traditional comic feel unfortunately the film falls flat everywhere else the best part of venom goes to tom hardys performance hands down not only by portraying him as a man with a split personality like in the comics but also having tom voice venom and play eddie brings a performance like no other the film falls flat in just about any other aspect unfortunately the first being that the film is rated pg13 although this brings in more people and doesnt segregate your audience it doesnt really encapsulate how brutal venom is i often found it awkward when venom would eat a person on screen then just right before you see him eat a head or limb the camera pans away to the next scene or to some action that was originally off screen to the audience this could be seen as jarring or take us out of the whole worldcharacter they were building the second problem with this movie is the villain now marvel has a bad track record with making great villains excluding loki thanos and killmonger but by the time riot makes it on screen the main villain its very lackluster with his symbiote is paired with generic rich villain number one whos motives are taking over the world just like many other rich villains take deadpool for example ajax being the exact opposite of deadpool by being the guy who cant feel pain but can die he has clear motivations and we want to see him suffer because he tortures wade the problem with riot is we dont really care what happens to him because he hasnt done anything to our protagonist lastly the cgi on venom was great when the trailers first appeared venom looked a mess with his words not synced up to his mouth or how he looked like a giant video character by the time the film came out he looks great sounds great and overall feels great although venom is stale is most parts of the film it is redeemed by tom hardys performance alone i would totally recommend to just see a true venom portrayal but if youre going to see it because of other reasons then youre wasting your time
Oct 21 2018,positive,its not a complex and too well edited movie but damn its just enjoyable to watch
Oct 21 2018,positive,the critics really got this one wrong check it out for yourself
Oct 21 2018,positive,i wasnt expecting much but i still had my hopes set high with a certain character never making his appearance my mcu fanboy self was never fully satisfied the leave of enjoyment that came from the chemistry between eddie and venom unexpected and fresh id see two more of these movies with or without the web slinger
Oct 21 2018,positive,not bad they played it pretty safe and its a decent action movie but not really a step forward for the mcu 
Oct 21 2018,positive,best cgi works and interesting story
Oct 21 2018,negative,except relationship between eddie and venom and tom hardythe carry of the movie everything in this movie is so bad
Oct 21 2018,positive,one of the best marvel movies hands down
Oct 21 2018,positive,it was amazing and spooky at the same time
Oct 21 2018,positive,the movie was just so much fun to watch its was funny and also the action of the movie was great overall i loved it
Oct 20 2018,positive,movie is ok rotten tomatoes are just hypocrites lmfao
Oct 20 2018,positive,the movie was not that bad i actually liked it
Oct 20 2018,positive,dont know why the critics dont like this movie i was thoroughly entertained lots of action good humor and a tinge of romance  what more can i ask venom was awesome and tom hardy played the role well
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom whips up an entertaining and thrilling adventure with the added support from a talented cast a must see film
Oct 20 2018,positive,minus the comic book parts missing and especially spiderman i bought the lethal protecter day of and i loved this movie so much i wish this gem came out earlier
Oct 20 2018,negative,bored but made me cringe with the cg practical effects
Oct 20 2018,positive,the best marvel movie  totally loved it
Oct 20 2018,positive,not what i expected not great but good entertaining and tom hardy was great did not like michelle williams character though 
Oct 20 2018,positive,even though venom has received numerous negative reviews from critics and it does have its flaws the movie still presents itself as a comedic thriller with amazing chemistry that tom hardy is able to showcase through eddie brock and venom no movie is perfect but venom is nonetheless a good and quality movie that does not deserve the level of slander that it is receiving
Oct 20 2018,positive,it was much better than the critics ratings  best marvel movie in quite sometime
Oct 20 2018,positive,i loved this movie so much
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom really does kind of explode literally at one time and its action is fun its a good introduction to venom if you dont know much about venom
Oct 20 2018,positive,not the best marvel movie but man is it up there  it starts slow but builds and builds  and when venom get in itoh man  go see it for yourself
Oct 20 2018,positive,glad i didnt listen to the critics rating p   super fun movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,a more than adequate comic book romp through the dark world of venom  the film might have been epic if an r rating wouldve been allowed  but as is this flick was good fun not an award winner but still a good time for the right audience
Oct 20 2018,positive,a bit slow at the beggining and then all sudden but overall good movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom was a good movie its disappointing how people are rating it such a low score because spiderman isnt in it the movie is supoosed to focus on venom not spiderman otherwise i really enjoyed this movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,great movie my only problem was not seeing tom hollands spiderman interacting with venom a lot more character build up on both venom and eddie brock in comparison with spiderman 3s venom
Oct 20 2018,positive,amazing and hilarious everyone who hated this movie doesnt know how to have fun was is the best marvel movie ever made no of course not but id rather watch venom over infinity war any day a feel good monster movie id go so far as to say a romcom if i could definitely worth seeing
Oct 20 2018,neutral,510 given sonys lack of quality spiderman product since the spiderman 2 of my youth i wasnt getting my hopes up for a return to form and while it did me well to quell my expectations venom was a fairly funny chatoicbutstillfun flick its empty headed and relies on the mcus formula without the direction to make it stick but tom hardy carries the film with a physical and understatedly hilarious performance the plot is as generic as it gets  an evil tech mogulpsuedo genius tries wielding ultrapowerful space goo for his own twisted purposes and faces resistance from an antihero who also has a space goo it didnt feel fresh and many of the action scenes gave me whiplash but the action scenes that didnt were a good time the cgi and special effects varied in quality from good to noticeably out of place i was entertained enough that i would see a sequel but might also forget when it finally comes to theaters
Oct 20 2018,positive,good for the first standalone venom movie cant wait for the next venomcarnage movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,do not listen to the haters this movie is very good
Oct 20 2018,positive,it was different and i liked that about it decent storyline also and funny at times
Oct 20 2018,negative,a few minor comical moments and not much else what happened to the bada villain that we were all waiting for
Oct 20 2018,positive,loved it a good balance between humour and action
Oct 20 2018,negative,a terribly made film that has no place in cinema
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom wasnt such a bad movie the story is decent and the fun aspect of it is the relation between venom and brock if the action was good it was way too fast i think the speed of it will annoy many viewers the main villain is kind of an musk style of rich guy but he lacks charisma and has poor dialogues the relation of brock and his girlfriend doesnt ring true and change too fast in a way or another i give it a 65 because venom and brock were interesting characters and some actions are pretty good i wish the villain and girlfriend would felt less like an after though in the story
Oct 20 2018,positive,so much fun loved venom and eddies relationship too i usually dont dig action movies but this was way more than action i was never bored did you know this follows the 7 plot points of romcoms 
Oct 20 2018,positive,really enjoyable popcorn flick excited for more even my fiance like it probs because of tom hardy though p
Oct 20 2018,positive,honestly dont know what type of drugs the critics are on this movie was bomb what else did they want more comedy its a symbiote for we got plenty of comedy from something that eats off heads or did they want more venom then complain about the movie being to long or just cut off the entire backstory and complaining it has no backstory like what more do you want i personally thought it was great
Oct 20 2018,positive,the critics dont know what the heck they are talking about  this is a good film  not great but good
Oct 20 2018,positive,better than i expected 
Oct 20 2018,positive,i saw this movie a few weeks ago and i have no idea why the reviews were so bad its not perfect and they made a few mistakes that i wont go into detail for spoilers but overall it was a really good movie and really shed some light on the villain that we wanted to see more of from spiderman 3
Oct 20 2018,positive,great action funny script interesting story that leaves an open end for sequels
Oct 20 2018,positive,okay film but its missing spiderman or just a mention of him 
Oct 20 2018,positive,not understanding the critical ratings obviously as a heroic movie venom is far removed from the comics version but i really enjoyed this
Oct 20 2018,positive,fans wanted so much from this perhaps too much something darker and more credible like batman begins maybe or perhaps the grit of what spawn should have been but what we got was a popcorn flick tom hardy did a good job it was enjoyable we got a few heads bitten off and it followed the comic book villains character arc reasonably well obviously excluding the spidey parts all in all i think critics have been a bit harsh perhaps the emergence of woody harleston as carnage might bring some more balls to the franchise if a sequel ever gets made
Oct 20 2018,positive,i was wary from the reviews but it wasnt bad go in with low expectations expect a sony movie with a lot of blind violence and swearing its not a marvel quality movie but its one of the best song movies ive ever seen
Oct 20 2018,positive,amazing portrayal of the antihero  brilliant to see brock and symbiote to become one and hardy is epic
Oct 20 2018,positive,i loved the relationship between vemon and eddy brooks in the film
Oct 20 2018,positive,nice movie animation of venom could be more realistic but overall this is very good marvel movie i dunno what critics is smooking
Oct 20 2018,positive,perfect encarnation of venom awesome action story and humour
Oct 20 2018,positive,awesome movie will watch again soon
Oct 20 2018,positive,went to venom with my 11 and 13 year old we all loved it humerous action packed a
Oct 20 2018,positive,good first start took 45 minutes for venom to show up which is fine flushed out eddie problem was once he showed up he and eddie bonded it 13 minutes of screen times so pacing a little off also should have been rated r but this was good sequel can fix problems 
Oct 20 2018,positive,it was good it wasnt perfect and it was flawed but its entertaining af and yall need to see it
Oct 20 2018,positive,extremely entertaining maybe not technically accurate however it is easily over shadowed by the concept and performance
Oct 20 2018,positive,we enjoyed this and we can watch whatever we want
Oct 20 2018,positive,the critics are way off the mark with this one its not a perfect movie the first half is much better made than the second half if you watched the trailer you pretty much have the whole film but that doesnt mean its a lousy picture or that you wont have fun going to see it    obviously not for kids but its a pg13 film so they pull a lot of punches lowering the gore factor down below what some fans wanted to see
Oct 20 2018,positive,if it hadnt been for tom hardy this movie wouldve been a crushing disappointment this incredible man is virtually sonys golden ticket   though venom has some other strong points  1 venom himself symbiotes look extremely cool and i find graphics quite nice love the way venom changed his facial expressions and the last bitingheadoff scene in the shop the moment both eddie and venom are sneering after we are venom  thats damned hot and thanks mr hardy for venoms voice too  2 dcstyle colors its dark itss depressive and its the way it should be  3 jokes are funny i laughed a lot really  4 eddies interaction with the parasite for instance   his violent reaction to an unexpected bodymate or their weird cooperation though still seems like we should be grateful to tom hardy for that  but as soon as eddie brock gets out of your sight you realize theres an immense amount of drawbacks  1 pg13 thriller and horror omg the only thing thats horrible about venom is that sony decided to widen their audience through getting rid of violent scenes and sex scenes too i guess i just hope theyll have at least r back for the following movies  2 cast i wonder whether they had no money left after inviting hardy or ruben fleischer just thought that tom was great enough to get the whole thing out of a jam on his own yeah hardy is definitely capable of doing that but the rest of the characters couldve been played by anyone and even if there would be no one  nothing would have changed  3 as the result of drawback2 theres no actual villain its absolutely not riz achmeds part bearing in mind the highly pretentious speech about the binding of isaac thered be no better candidate than samuel l jackson though i really doubt marvel would ever approve it  4 motivations the characters have are odd to say the least probably they were cut severely to fit the lower rating who knows but what we have is that theres no reasonable explanation for why venom stopped being so passionate about ending the world or why drake found that idea amusing or what the hell eddies boss sent him to life foundation knowing hes such a stubborn mule  ps sorry if my english is bad but i felt like i should write it
Oct 20 2018,positive,vary good but couldve been more like the backstory in the comics but loved it
Oct 20 2018,positive,action packed and funny great movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,really good would watch again and cant wait for venom 2
Oct 20 2018,positive,funny and fun this is the movie that venom deserved i will be going back and seeing it again
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom shows how venom should of have been in spiderman 3 a big tall and creppy venom is a fantastic film and honestly i dont get why people hate this film
Oct 20 2018,positive,decent the movie could have given venom and the dude more time to bond didnt make sense that venom wanted to betray his home because he spent a few days with the dude
Oct 20 2018,positive,very good movie wish it was rated r but all in all really fun
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom is a good movie and unexpectedly funny worth seeing the critics cant see past a movie that isnt trying to be the best they have forgotten the allure of campy corny fun and thats what this is a 90s action comedy for 2018 this is the mask for a new generation and thats a under appreciated movie i love too so the critics gave it a 30 and fans gave it 88 and thats ok this isnt an mcu movie its not trying to be and thats ok too this is why thor ragnarok is one of the best and more memorable than say civil war imho sometimes better results are achieved from not trying so hard
Oct 20 2018,positive,dont believe the critics venom was a great movie good action and some comedy my favorite villain for sure
Oct 20 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it it seemed to be exactly what it was trying to be a comicbooklike antihero film tom hardy rocked the role
Oct 20 2018,positive,this movie was literally the best movie ive ever seen i cant wait for it to go out on amazon video bc im dying to see it 100 more times
Oct 20 2018,positive,this was a great movie dont listen to the critics on this one
Oct 20 2018,positive,this movie was fun the whole time  i cant wait to see it again
Oct 20 2018,positive,the pacing in this movie is all over the place and annies a terrible character but everything else in this movie was fantastic and nearly everything i wanted in a venom movie its not perfect and hopefully the directors cut irons out a few of the kinks but as a diehard venom fan i really liked what i saw and i cant wait for what comes out of this in the future
Oct 20 2018,positive,although its not in the same mcu as spiderman i still loved it funny and serious acting was great and the story line wasnt bad brocks interactions with venom were funny and they tried to humanize venom in a positive way wish they would still try to tie in spiderman in the future this venom is waaaaaay better than the spiderman 3 venom sony took some lessons from foxs deadpool and logan if this was rated r it might have gotten 5 stars i wanted to see him bite their heads off in more graphic detail lol
Oct 20 2018,positive,good popcorn flick whichs often funny and exciting somehow though it misses the mark
Oct 20 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics the plot does seem to go really fast towards the middleend of the movie but the movie was most certainly entertaining and i wouldnt wait to til it comes out on bluray also haters yeah nonmcu marvel movies can be good this one was better than at least 6 mcu movies
Oct 20 2018,negative,was just a bore to sit through
Oct 20 2018,negative,sony clearly forced the team to churn this out regardless of quality i hope we dont get a sequel
Oct 20 2018,positive,nice movie despite the mediocre likeability of the characters and the inexplicable result of the final battle the symbiotes certainly held my interest i loved trying to predict how exactly theyd behave next as well as the new take on venom for me at least
Oct 20 2018,positive,this movie was amazing blowing away all of my expectations it was funny and eddie was more relatable and real than most superheros i thoroughly enjoyed watching it and cant wait to see it again
Oct 20 2018,positive,a serious piece of art driving us through eddies tribulation of not being able to accept andor fix the errors and mismatches of the world leading him to find his inner monster which finally enables him to alter reality to his liking
Oct 20 2018,positive,some parts werent what i was counting for but the movie itself was really fun
Oct 20 2018,positive,i liked the movie very much i enjoyed the friendship between venom and eddy brock it was pretty funny but there were some cringe worthy parts i agree with the critics some what but i agree with the audience waaaaaay more than the critics the movie was funny venom killed it loved him in this movie same as ediebut i didnt like that it didnt really know its identity at the start
Oct 20 2018,positive,great movie critics have it very wrong 
Oct 20 2018,positive,love it tom hardys acting is amazing
Oct 20 2018,positive,another movie that goes to show you should not listen to the critics it was fast paced had a bunch of action and some light banter between eddie and venom i loved it
Oct 20 2018,positive,funny and awesome at the same time way better than expected
Oct 20 2018,neutral,venom is a 510 at best there are no character arcs apart from eddie and venom it feels rushed and the plot makes no sense at all bad movie
Oct 20 2018,positive,spoiler waening anyways im just out of the movie and so far i liked it well i really liked it venom is just so funny and the script is funny i would say tom hardy is a perfect actor for venom who knows maybe theres going to be venom 2 according to the post credits it might be we will get venom 2 but i dont think so beacuse the rating is crap even though its my 3rd favorite movie soooo i really recommend this movie 
Oct 20 2018,positive,venom was an absolutely great movie i loved it a lot but i need to explain some things i didnt like about venom so spoilers ahead now what i didnt like about venom was that we didnt see that much symbiotes i expected to see at least 3 or 4 symbiotes in venom formation but the final battle really shut those expectations up and was even better the other thing is i wonder how venom survived the explosion at the end because i thought he died along with dr drake and his symbiote and venom even said goodbye to eddie before the explosion but i cant complain because as soon i thought venom actually died he surprisingly said something to eddie when he was talking to annie im so happy that the movie ended this way and proved that eddie and venom actually make a pretty good team the last two things i wanna review are the 2 post credit scenes the first one was at a prison where eddie interviewed the person who is gonna play carnage which is an amazing scene by the way the last one is a preview of spiderman into the spiderverse after seeing this movie i now realize how bad they misused venom is spiderman 3 and is definitely an upgrade from spiderman 3s venom overall this movie was pretty good and i cant deny that i would love to see the sequel the day it comes out in theaters
Oct 20 2018,positive,great fast moving action with twist of humour and edgy scifi horror 
Oct 20 2018,positive,fun story plus a great performance by tom hardy with solid chemistry between brock and venom gets sort of bogged down by spotty cgi and a lack of interesting side characters still worth the price of admission though
Oct 20 2018,positive,worth a watch tom hardy doesnt really suit the role imo and the fight scenes could have shown more little bit messy at times but not a bad movie better than most marvel movies
Oct 20 2018,positive,the critics got this one wrong these reviews were selfindulgent clichéd and and just plain lazy that this film did well at the box office is a testament to the relevance of these reviews film critics often forget why we go to the movies instead making it more about them than the films 30really  this was a comic book film about a guy who turns into a creepy kind of funny creature that bites peoples heads off no need to look for the next tour de force here friends while this may not have been the best comic book film the film did a few things very well for example the dialogue between venom and brock was well done as were the action sequences  friends it was a comic book film honestlywhy so serious
Oct 20 2018,positive,tom hardy fits to venom personality in the film
Oct 20 2018,neutral,many useless storylines and action could be done better but at least it feels like venom unlike spider man 3
Oct 20 2018,positive,so much enjoyment watching this feels more like a humorous romcom with some pretty badass action than something to take seriously if they make a second one i hope they use eddie brocks connection with the symbiote for more laughs
Oct 20 2018,positive,good and fun i dont know why critics hate it so much
Oct 20 2018,positive,if it was made for more mature audience it could have been better not bad though but not so great either i felt like eddie brocks character was quite bland and wasnt built deeply enough tom hardy was amazing though
Oct 20 2018,positive,before i get into this review ill be talking about spoilers and my thoughts right before this film in the theater right before the movie i really was hyped and before when i watched the trailers i wasnt hyped at all but for some reason right before this movie i was hyped great fantastic fun sony marvel movie starring tom hardy and michelle williams so first five minutes of the movie were really really dumb and almost ruined the movie for me i dont know whos idea it was too but that in the beginning but if your curious just watch the movie for yourself tom hardy is amazing in this and pretty much steals the show every scene that hes in im really invested in eddie brock and tom hardy s portrayal is perfect i cant picture anybody else in that role venom is cool as well and i thought that all that cgi would ruin him but nope its good and spoiler warning when he takes over michelle williams s character annie its amazing its hilarious this movie had a ton of jokes and i dont know if they were intentional but it didnt feel forced or flat at any time it felt very smooth but in every movie their is always a bad part or bad characters the villian sucked and his motivation is cringe and whats the big deal about second fake rip off venom  i wanted carnage to be the villian but well have to wait for the sequel
Oct 20 2018,positive,its good i dont understand the bad raiting
Oct 20 2018,positive,its no marvel universe movie but the movie was fun to watch and different all at the same time
Oct 20 2018,positive,pretty awesome movie thrilling action and on point humor
Oct 20 2018,positive,entertaining action packed funny and horrific
Oct 20 2018,positive,i dont get what the critics were thinking the dynamic between eddie brock and venom not only in conversations but in fight scenes too is incredible the mix of action comedy is done well  though the small horror aspect does feel unnecessary the venom cgi is well done and feels like a black knight on the screen  every suit up moment brings a joyous feeling to you not all jokes are a hit but im chuckling more then questioning the writers  overall venom is a surprisingly well worked out film  even with the lack of a spiderman
Oct 20 2018,negative,please sony please give spiderman back to marvel
Oct 20 2018,positive,entertaining movie but not too great of a plot i dont know much about the history of venom but the movie was very fun to watch and makes me hope there are multiple venom movies in the future 
Oct 20 2018,positive,the movie is actually really entertaining tom did a great job fitting into his role 
Oct 20 2018,positive,im giving it it 3 12 because as much as i want to give it 4 there are some issues with the film aspect the beginning was a slow build and the set up wasnt the greatest but tom hardy did a great job fun action good humor and decent play with cgi effects forget what the critics say do yourself a favor and have a good time watching our favorite antihero 
Oct 20 2018,positive,the first half an hour was booring but the rest was entertaining and amazing
Oct 20 2018,positive,i was pleasantly surprised how good this was i thought the previews were horrible and had no interest in seeing this however my wife wanted to go and im glad we did very entertaining and a good story 
Oct 19 2018,positive,well then i guess we have a future cult classic on our hands despite receiving negative reviews from critics venom proved to be a hit with audiences especially with such polar opposite opinions between the factions i was curious about venom venom is no work of art but it is a fun that fits snugly into popcorn fun the plot is routine involving  a sleazy reporter who loses his job because of his attempt to expose a tech company and his fiance breaks up with him because he used her confidential files in the interview after losing his job he lives in a crappy apartment doing not much of anything until an employee from the tech company asks him to break into it to expose a new experiment using strange alien life forms called symbiotes on humans he breaks into the lab and becomes exposed to one of the test subjects you can guess what happens the plot is by far venoms weakest element because it follows a very routine comic book film plot you know whats going to happen however venom excels in a number of other areas in particular tom hardys performance as eddie brock and the symbiote inside of him venom are what really carry the film far above what it should have been in fact the acting as a whole is quite good it also boasts very funny humor becoming an interesting take on the buddy comedy genre as we get to hear the banter between eddie and venom it also has thrilling action sequences making for a wild ride while i wish there was more to the plot and i also wish this film didnt have to be trimmed down to a pg13 fingers crossed for the rumored rrated extended cut venom manages to be a witty wellacted thrilling comic book film that will develop a very loyal following in future years if you want to have pure fun during a film venom makes for a very good time
Oct 19 2018,positive,better than i expected 
Oct 19 2018,positive,venom rocked and i say this as a person who is awfully critical of movies  my girlfriend also liked it and she hates these types of movies having wanted instead to watch a star is born or some crap like that  go  watch it  ignore the critics  they are losers on this planet anyhow
Oct 19 2018,negative,boring pays no respect to the source comic book material takes heavy liberties with all aspects of the original plot this movie is hurried along with no plot or story the character development is terrible  this was almost like an informercial of how a venom movie could be i cannot say ive never seen a bad tom hardy film now this must be the worst film hes ever done he plays the role of a very passive everyman he fairs way better playing the dominant alpha male in his action and drama roles the performance is very awkward and unbalanced the action is decent in spots there are a few interesting moments that could turn into something but inevitably fail the movie in general is very derivative ive seen it done much better google movie upgrade this gets a big thumbs down in the theater for me if youre a big venom fan it might be worth a watch at home
Oct 19 2018,positive,very entertaining great movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,it  was a fun super hero movie if you like  the comics and the character venom you will like it if you are expecting it to be the spiritual successor to the english patient like it seems many of these critics review bombing it were the you will be disappointed
Oct 19 2018,positive,best superhero movie in a while
Oct 19 2018,positive,i thought it was great
Oct 19 2018,neutral,ouch this one hurt tom you did the best with a trainwreck of a script character chemistry was way off im not gonna drag this one outwhich is how i felt while watching the movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,a rocky start is more than made up for in an intense and relevant story thats a perfect balance of horror action and comedy professional critics that poorly rate this movie rate it due to it not fitting their standard of how a movie should be presented but the way it is presented is almost what makes it a good movie will watch again and again and again and again and again
Oct 19 2018,positive,while this hasnt been my favorite marvel production i think that venom is completely underrated knowing there was significant time cut off of the original film to make it pg13 made it easy to notice some choppy transitions nevertheless the movie was fun to watch and had a good storyline i recommend
Oct 19 2018,negative,starts slowly with a thin story disappointing 
Oct 19 2018,positive,was hella awesome and tom hardy was phenomenal as eddie
Oct 19 2018,positive,venom is a good movie you guys are just mean
Oct 19 2018,positive,definitely not as bad as critics are saying it is it is definitely bad but  tom hardys and venoms interactions make it a very entertaining film granted the tone is all over the place the directing is horrible and the action is set at night with symbiotes being black however this deserves around 55 not so low at 30
Oct 19 2018,positive,a very entertaining movie may have a bad story but and a simple bad guy but atleast they dont feel hollow i do like the funny relation that eddie and venom have in the movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,we loved this movie we cant understand the low rating by the critics the movie is entertaining the acting was good and the story line kept us hooked this is from someone who doesnt know the venom story line my son and husband who do know the back story loved it too highly recommend
Oct 19 2018,positive,the critics are idiots
Oct 19 2018,positive,not a perfect movie as in it didnt blew me up completely but overall just good ol fun i guess the critics were too busy trying to see where the movie failed to have fun with this surprising gem from sony
Oct 19 2018,positive,entertaining in general some jokes dont land but tom hardys portrayal is hilarious some parts are sped through and villain is subpar but everything else is finegreat
Oct 19 2018,positive,lack of a spiderman made a change to the characters backstory was a bit sad to see that he wasnt going to be sporting a massive white spider on his chest but overall it was good funny although some of the conversations were a bit different from what you would expect from venom but it was overall pretty good
Oct 19 2018,positive,just as the critics say its a bad movie but venom is a awesome movie full with action humor visual effects the acting the directing and everything that is described in this movie tom hardy did a phenomenal performance as eddie brockvenom and this whole movie is not a flop but its a good movie 
Oct 19 2018,positive,amazing pretty hard work
Oct 19 2018,positive,i feel like the movie was underrated good story maybe but i look for the movies that entertain me not for how good the movie was executed everybody isnt like that but the movie really entertained me and i loved it five stars
Oct 19 2018,positive,it definetly couldve been better but i actually enjoyed it there were a good amount of jokes that didnt distract from the plot i thought venom was a super interesting character one that we havent seen in the marvel universe yet i didnt love the romance subplot i get why they put it in but i found it way too forced and shoved down my throat heres to hoping theres less of that in the probable sequel or just cast a different likable actress overall it was a good movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,funny new look to a comic character such as venom done with other heroes of the same universe recommended
Oct 19 2018,positive,better than topher gracenuff said
Oct 19 2018,positive,i loved it i wasnt a fan of venom in the 3rd spider man with toby  so was very skeptical on this film going with friends  i ended up loving it  one of the best movies ive seen in a long time it was enjoyable  and i laughed often with the inside voice but not over the top too much
Oct 19 2018,positive,this is a flat out fun movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,this movie demonstrates truly how venom is and is a great adaptation to how venom would be without spiderman
Oct 19 2018,positive,i can understand how some may think the plot to be a little erratic but it properly portrays the characters and in a somewhat comedic way i quite enjoyed the film and thought its craziness fit well with venoms comic book trope
Oct 19 2018,positive,i was really excited to see this at first when i heard this movie began production i thought oh no sony will screw this up like amazing spiderman etc i walked out of this movie thinking my god they have broken the sony superhero curse   overall i loved the movie i found it very satisfying every hit that venom dealt against the life foundation agents to the swat team to riot i loved it tom hardy you played eddie brock like you were quite literally living that life the music was so crucial in delivering this stunning piece when the motorbike chase scene first started the music was subtle it did quickly jump to loud impactful crucial music the music and i cannot say it enough was superb also great end credits scene tease sony  i think that the 1 instant problem i have without deeply thinking about it is that venom says riot is unstoppable yet he kinda defeats him in a 330 minutes battle if i were change the movie slightly i wouldve made some form of encounter between venom and riot to let the audience know that riot is unstoppable   if i thought about the movie storyline hard enough then i could see gaps i am not fully aware of how the human and symbiote bonding works but the chances of carlton drake and anne being sustainable hosts for the symbiote wouldnt in my eyes add up perfectly  i love this movie i found it great and enjoyable but it obviously has some problems i dont blame the writers for maybe not fully understanding on how to set symbiote biological rules so yes there are problems but there are so many parts that are completely on point
Oct 19 2018,positive,a couple of great venom moments but sometimes lacking intelligence and continuity in the story great action and acting from hardy it could have been greater with a better script its a missed opportunity but entertaining enough b
Oct 19 2018,positive,very entertaining movie with a comedic flair to it
Oct 19 2018,positive,venom is honestly a really funny movie that is enjoyable when you known how to take a chill pill and enjoy an alienhuman romcom tom hardy does absolutely amazing i do wish they included michelle willams more hoping for a venom 2
Oct 19 2018,positive,its like the venom  lethal protector comic book series  fun goofy and a bit of mess in places  i loved it  and i didnt miss spiderman at all
Oct 19 2018,positive,this was one of the most entertaining and funny movies ive seen in a looong while looking forward to part 2
Oct 19 2018,positive,loved it ive seen it twice and wouldnt say no to seeing it again hardy was a great eddie brock and the original story worked so well would recommend
Oct 19 2018,positive,choppy story is saved by wellplaced venom nostalgia and terribly good jokes hardy nails eddie brock
Oct 19 2018,positive,i think it was amazing it had good cgi
Oct 19 2018,positive,surprisingly fun a bit too fast tempo but overall a nice movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,man  i just loved this movie  it was fun and engaging  i know the top critics would be like blah this isnt la la land but this turned to be fun the story was a good one  leave it to tom hardy to mail the role my advice go watch it people and enjoy the movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,absolutely loved it was disturbingly creepy as well as being meticulously reasonable just phenomenal
Oct 19 2018,positive,it takes a long long time to warm up but once the action gets going the going gets tough cool chase and action scenes involving the creature and with the minutes rolling it becomes clear that this flick is to be understood more as an action comedy ending in fact quite hilarious its not a thor character kind of humor but rather a morbid sarcastic kind which makes the whole story more acceptable as a silly new character which might bring a new line of adventures in future mixups with other marvel heroes wait for the extra minute during the titles tom hardy is once again at his best enjoyable but rather for the die hard marvel fan 6 of 10 points
Oct 19 2018,positive,venom has many flaws that critics just cant ignore bad cgi editing and direction it is a mess but one really fun and entertaining mess it is fun it has really exciting scenes and in the middle of it venom and eddie venom here is presented in a way that not many remember but it is perfectly done making him a character that the audience can easily fall in love with plus great acting from tom hardy in fact all of the main actors are really good and in general the characters too   it is a movie that will for sure make you smile and have a good time showing great actors and characters and while the script isnt really deep or complex it is well made and not as lazy as many critics think for how much i and clearly everyone else in the theater i was enjoyed the movie it deserves 5 stars
Oct 19 2018,positive,over all i think this is a hilarious movie to watch i enjoyed it a lot
Oct 19 2018,positive,i loved it most marvel films are endless action but this was a change of pace the relationship between eddie and venom was great go see this movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,saw it twice loved it
Oct 19 2018,neutral,venom i dont really know to say with this roller coaster of monstrosity lets discuss the cons first riot and venom look exactly the same during fights together in the same scene especially the part when he fought him i had no idea who was who until their symbiotes had been removed and that was mainly because the contrast or background light was so dark    well heres some pros the good thing about venom was the quality of the cgi and the special effects except the darkness of it they were very good but they were not colorful for riot so as i said last paragraph i want to say the story development was good but it was all over the place especially with riot as the symbiote not the host it was pointless to show it    one big thing about it is that the humour they intentionally put in is not funny and serious moments were very funny michelle williams acting was atrocious in important moments she made scenes that were supposed to be serious something else my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job tom hardy done a good job as usual im sad to watch it a month late because it was a 15 here in the uk but watching it now it shouldve been a 12a    grade c
Oct 19 2018,positive,the critics are being veru harsh to a very decent movie i loved every minute of this film it was not supposed to be this serious film it was not supposed to be a typical superhero movie i thought the punch lines were in all the right places and if you knew what you were getting into it was an amazing film
Oct 19 2018,positive,the people who didnt like it are funny stop whining its not saving private ryan or the titanic its venom you people went to see this knowing what it was and yet youre still complaining about it if youre a comic book movie fan go see it its good if youre not go watch citizen kane or something and quit your bellyaching
Oct 19 2018,positive,we all expected more but it is what it is i always keep my expectations low when it comes to character introduction movies in the superhero genre everyone wants to see the character in full action but dont have the patience to find out how it happened it could have been better hoping next installment is better i dont think the film should be trashed like it was it wasnt that bad
Oct 19 2018,positive,the performances are great the tone rides the line between serious and funny comedy is important to the venom character i think they marketed poorly making people expect a horrordark film    i enjoyed the story loved the cast    didnt love the cgi but its still enjoyable to watch
Oct 19 2018,positive,the movie is good if you are not familiar with the comic otherwise you will be disappointed
Oct 19 2018,negative,i wasnt expecting much i didnt get much the story was rushed about 70 of it didnt make sense from plot holes tom hardy was a good eddie brock but the rest of the movie was a flop its difficult to do a venom movie that really does the character justice without  spiderman i wouldnt watch it again the cgi was pretty bad too the venom voice wasnt creepy and slithery or anything creepy pretty much a poor attempt lazy
Oct 19 2018,positive,i was apprehensive but didnt want to see a star is born so i went to see venom  i would see this again because it appeals to my sense of humor  the comedic lines come when you are not expecting and the action and energy made the film tops in my humble opinion
Oct 19 2018,positive,haters gonna hate but hardy rules as he always does fx were awesome only improvement would have been the r rating
Oct 19 2018,positive,bruh i havent even seen the movie yet i just like tom hardyand venom
Oct 19 2018,positive,had every aspect of venom i hoped for
Oct 19 2018,negative,a plausible superhero tale that never turns all that super while the social commentary is timely and decent the story never quite takes off which keeps the hybrid action comedy far from ever achieving a successful mutation 
Oct 19 2018,positive,great  but i found the end anticlimactic
Oct 19 2018,positive,great storygreat charactergreat movie
Oct 19 2018,positive,very good action packed
Oct 19 2018,positive,i wonder why the critic reviews are bad great movie im already hyped for the sequel
Oct 19 2018,negative,hmmmmmmm ive seen worse movies i like tom hardy but i wasnt convinced with his performance the life lab ceo was just annoying and that guys acting skills are mediocre at best and since when did venom become like this entity that speaks to him and tells him hes hungry  i could be wrong i didnt read the comics execution was bad though it takes forever for eddie to become the venom action wasnt overly impressive overall i just didnt care for the movie and didnt really care for the characters my advice is to wait till this one comes out on dvd 
Oct 19 2018,positive,super movie but venom is so goos did not matched as hero but only a villian
Oct 19 2018,neutral,this film works better than it should at the end this film also changes the dynamic between the host and the symbiot where each has their own moral guidelines i was not a big fan of the films music i think that once venom enters into eddie brock the film tone gets funnier i liked seeing the girl friend being venom and showing the dynamic i liked the stan lee camero in the film with his dog towards the end of the film what works in this film is how venom would say one thing and eddie brock would say something different this film also showed a different kind of fight than seen in other super hero films this showed that you can have a successful villain lead film rather than a mixed one seen in suicide squad or megamind i felt like the first half of the film has a lot of tension and scary where as the second half works because there is more comedy in how one thinks one way and then the other acts on the opposite way which provides comedy which i enjoyed in the film i was glad that this film did not show the gross parts or showed blood and would cut in a way to have those scenes inferred 
Oct 19 2018,positive,i thought the special effects were amazing the movie was good up until the last part seemed kind of cheesy but i enjoyed it 
Oct 19 2018,negative,the action scenes with venom were pretty well done disappointed that the advertisement promised me a villain movie but instead gave me a hero movie while butchering the venom character he decides to be a hero because empathy  i did enjoy venoms commentary 
Oct 19 2018,positive,very fun sure it couldve been done better in ways but i enjoyed it plenty
Oct 19 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant movie great solo film must watch the cgi and voice for venom was bang on     and the way they brought venom onto the big screen in general was amazing
Oct 19 2018,positive,honestly i dont get why the rotten tomato review is so bad if you take away the spiderman eliment and maybe even forget about how he is in the comics venom is a great movie all in all its unfair to rate it low when the movie had all the action and developed the new venom character well as an anti hero i loved it so at me
Oct 19 2018,positive,not a perfect film but certainly enjoyable
Oct 19 2018,neutral,an enjoyable time if your expectations are low
Oct 19 2018,positive,if this movie came out in the early 2000s it would of done better big respect to tom hardy i had fun
Oct 19 2018,neutral,i thought tom hardy was a good fit for eddie brock i liked the set up but i had a lot of issues with the way the suit interacted with eddie  there were just a lot of things wrong with it i feel like it was a missed opportunity im enough of a fan of the comic book that i was willing to let some stuff go 
Oct 19 2018,positive,riches popcorn review on venom i was asked by my granddaughter to see this movie so i did and i must say it had some great special effects storyline was kind of weak cinematography was excellent i would have to give it three stars which would be the same as a 7 i did enjoy the movie but its just like the others nothing but special effects i would have appreciated a better story line as far as suggesting it to for others to watch ill leave it up to you not the best movie ive ever seen but for a marvel movie it was okay 
Oct 19 2018,positive,forget the critics its about the audience this movie was sick af and didnt need spider man at all it was too dark for that anyway
Oct 19 2018,neutral,i wish it had been either a comedy or a scary movie i didnt like the mixture of both 
Oct 18 2018,positive,this was a fun movie which is what a comic book movie should be tom hardy did an excellent job the only thing i wanted was more storymore build up to the climax it was moving along with the struggle for control between man and symbiot and then the final battle came out of nowhere worth seeing though of you are a fan of this genre 
Oct 18 2018,positive,this movie would be a five star if it was r instead of pg 13 
Oct 18 2018,positive,i honestly dont think the critics saw the same movie
Oct 18 2018,positive,yall dont know what your talking about this movie was awesome would you rather watch the room i dont think so
Oct 18 2018,positive,im pretty sure anyone who doesnt like this move has never read a comic book of any sort in their entire life seriously it was great i really hope they make a sequel because there is so much more they can do with the character
Oct 18 2018,positive,this is my favorite marvel movie 
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom has the most realistic reaction a human being can have when faced with an unknown and invasive entity in your body the lack of hypermasculine macho in this movie just makes it even better the villain is megalomaniac with single minded obsession and in comes this pair of losers to take him down also  the origin story of interspecies soulmates dont  me thats comic canon if nothing else it stays true to the tagline
Oct 18 2018,positive,tom hardys performance makes this crazy cannibal and completely out of control antihero come to life totally worth it story and editing could have been better though
Oct 18 2018,negative,redundant and contradictory of the actual nature of this character
Oct 18 2018,positive,such a great movie i actually didnt think id enjoy it cause of the very low critic rating by rotten tomatos but wow they are totally wrong on this one
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was an overall good movie but it wasnt very serious it was more of a comedy wasnt terrible though
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was great a ultra fun movie that had lots of relatable humor
Oct 18 2018,positive,tom hardy carries the movie and makes some of the scenes memorable
Oct 18 2018,positive,honestly i wanna see it again
Oct 18 2018,positive,hell yea  visuals were incredible
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom is the best and weirdest rom com ive ever watched thanks for existing i gues
Oct 18 2018,positive,critics are wrong  simply wrong  similar type of movie to deadpool  not as funny but it comes together well and is entertaining  moves along fast  could have easily added 2030 to movie without it dragging  opposite to most action movies these days which could easily drop 20 min without losing anything
Oct 18 2018,positive,good movie better than i thought it would be previews made it seem dark it was well balanced with humor acting was good although  the movie ended really abruptly and had me saying thats it what just happened its  over
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom  may not be the most wellthought in the conclusion but certain key elements and enjoyable scenes makes it an entertaining film
Oct 18 2018,positive,action good jokes good acting great did it have the deepest story nah no twist endings here and the characters are shallow but not as shallow as thor so if you like action with twist its worth a watch ps its a comedy
Oct 18 2018,positive,i did see the movie with some of my best friends just when it released and it was realy great to watch everybody of my friends also said the movie was great and we are realy happy to see thats there a second movie coming with carnage the only little downside to the movie was that it was fsk 12 and not fsk 16 thats the rating here in germany but it was still awesome and kinda brutal for an fsk 12 movie but because the next movie is gonna be with carnage i think and i hope the next movie is gonna be rated fsk16    please excuse any wrong writng and so on my english is not always the best
Oct 18 2018,positive,not bad overall worth a sequel tom is excellent of course
Oct 18 2018,positive,i saw it in italian and i can say it is a very good film tom hardy is always so talented
Oct 18 2018,positive,starts slowly but once venom comes to life so does the movie  great action and really funny  i liked it  al lot
Oct 18 2018,positive,all the top critics who reviewed this movie are the same people who said the last jedi was one of the best star wars movies
Oct 18 2018,positive,dunno if its because all the superhero movies set the bar so low but venom exceeded my expectations and i think it was a really nice movie it was selfcontained came back to pick up elements where theyd been left so that everything made sense enough for the entertainment type of movie that it is and gave everything a nice feeling of closure with room for more adventures and plot development the density and pace felt just right for me but again this probably depends on personal preference visually too i i think they did a good job overall i really enjoyed watching it and i think its a great movie in its own league
Oct 18 2018,positive,great movie and very great story the movie may not be rated r but it got destruction and cool fighting parts in it
Oct 18 2018,positive,i know why some people dont think this movie is good cause of no spider man and all but if they think about it that this is a origin story of venom 
Oct 18 2018,positive,a litlle bored at the first but surprise me at the end
Oct 18 2018,positive,the critics are way off the mark on this one although the film wasnt as gritty as one would hope for a venom movie they still did a great job for a pg13 version some of the fight scenes were a bit too chaotic to tell what was going on
Oct 18 2018,positive,great movie the critics are wrong everyone i have talked to about the movie has loved it
Oct 18 2018,positive,what a great movie cant wait to see part 2 if they come out with one
Oct 18 2018,neutral,could have been better but i liked brock and venoms relationship 
Oct 18 2018,positive,this movie was the most fun thing i had ever been to for me this movie was way better than any spiderman movie including homecoming dont listen to what people say this movie is hands down amazing go watch it now
Oct 18 2018,positive,great movie dont understand what all the bad reviews are about full of action and well placed humor
Oct 18 2018,positive,by movie critic metrics not a good movie but to any marvel comic bookmovie fan it is very enjoyable and worth seeing
Oct 18 2018,positive,was so good i couldnt get out of my seat to use the restroom
Oct 18 2018,positive,dont know what the critics are smoking this film isnt bad
Oct 18 2018,positive,the critic reviews are straight bullsht     movies great comedy works in well venom has so much depth but is still pretty intense pacing seemed fast but this is a rounded and complete story
Oct 18 2018,positive,bad ass venom fight 
Oct 18 2018,positive,i have never reviewed a movie in my life but this movie has been so supremely screwed over by critics that i had to im giving this movie a 55 simply because i havent enjoyed a superhero movie like this since sky high this idea that it needs to be connected to spiderman is ridiculous theres a reason they moved the story to san francisco this isnt an action movie though like do not go into this thinking its an action this movie is 100 a comedy with a blossoming romance story that i hope is further developed in venom 2 the cgi was great honestly and those claiming its like a movie from 2004 need to look themselves in the mirror and question their sanity i thought this movie was going to be so bad its good its not its just straight up good and i enjoyed every minute of tom hardys fantastically realistic depiction of a san francisco man with depression dealing with an unfathomable situation can 100 relate overall this movie was fanatastic and i cannot recommend it enough go watch it and enjoy it
Oct 18 2018,positive,i love it tom hardys performance is brilliant and venom hes just fun
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom was a good version of the character for a venom with no spiderman it did good
Oct 18 2018,positive,do not listen to critics or anyone see it for yourself and make your own opinion i loved it
Oct 18 2018,negative,was a decent action flick but it sort of dissolved in the last act t
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was great movie it deserves more rating
Oct 18 2018,positive,as per drama goesit is therecgi therecringe therelittle content to support the drama thereacting wise and the role of venom the parasite you might not call that or simply symbiotic  has a good chemistry between edie brock and the following sequencesoverall for a scifie fan it is a entertainer
Oct 18 2018,positive,this movie was so good dont listen to these bitter wackos go see it for yourself
Oct 18 2018,neutral,the movie was ok is entretaining but nothing more it doesnt make justice to the name of venom in that sense the adaptation is not good enough for fans even so the movie manages to give you a good time not a film to watch more than once though it could have been way better violent and darker which was expected
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom is way better than many other marvel movies such as spider man thor iron man etc the real critics should be the audience  the money it makes not some old dudeswomen sitting in a chair and critisising like they are some  geniuses in movie making industry
Oct 18 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie
Oct 18 2018,positive,venom is surprisingly an amazing film by all means its nothing special but it is a great movie for the character and in my opinion as good of a solo venom movie as we will ever get tom hardy makes an excellent venom and a pretty decent eddie brock even though sometimes it just feels like tom hardy being himself venom is very fun and entertaining to watch the cgi is very good surprisingly and believable the music feels like stock music nothing special there the cinematography is quite nice if the camera would stay in one place for a long time the actions are generic and uninteresting and have extremely quick cuts to keep a pg13 rating even when venom bites someones head off tom hardys banter with venom is the heart of this movie and makes it very entertaining venom works without spiderman however i do not see how venom can have a conflict with spiderman if he is every featured in a sequel the endcredits scene is kinda goofy but very satisfying heres to hoping for a sequel
Oct 18 2018,positive,obviously the movie has its flaws it starts of at a rather decent pace the as soon as eddie gets venom it is a nonstop train only slowing a little however it is not bad because spiderrman isnt in it if anything it makes it more interesting letting eddie and venom have their own story without being obsessed with spiderman
Oct 18 2018,positive,a solid performance from tom hardy plenty of laughs and good action scenes maybe not ss polished as other marvel movies but well worth the watch
Oct 18 2018,positive,an action packed romcom a truly enjoyable experience from start to finish
Oct 18 2018,positive,i thought it was a solid movie but that was only because of tom hardy
Oct 18 2018,positive,i can see what critics would want from this in terms of a more stabilize story with depth and technicality but i absolutely loved the way venom is portrayed his cgi scenes are incredible and so is his peronslaity
Oct 18 2018,positive,tom hardy is the best
Oct 18 2018,positive,i understand why people like it they just go to see it as a way of distraction to have fun and watch a blockbuster butr it definitely isnt a well made movie personally i think its because of the studio cutting scenes that were ex cesively noticeable and you definitely realise when it happens tom hardy was really good in this perhaps not perfect but i liked the eddie brock he portrayed the premise is not 100 coherent and is one of its many weaknesses all in all i would only recommend this movie to casual movie goers or venom fans not people that will notice the mistakes becasue they are a lot and you will get pissed   my rating  35
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was average i dont get the negative reviews of this movie it was fun but had its flaws
Oct 18 2018,positive,the plot while simple is easy to understand the humor isnt forced humor and the cgi is decent i liked the movie its fun to see a character like venom be comedic
Oct 18 2018,positive,a fun take on the beloved character and a much needed relief from the over saturation of the marvel cinematic universe
Oct 18 2018,negative,people are being way too generous this movie is stupid and makes no sense its honestly an insult to the character and comic books in general
Oct 18 2018,negative,this was bad on all accounts plot acting writing you name it so predictable cheesy and unoriginal from the get go
Oct 18 2018,positive,not bad its fun movie
Oct 18 2018,positive,movie was an enjoyable action comedy critics are far too harsh seeing as how this wasnt made to be an oscar winning movie also why are critics so confused about the idea of an action comedy most of their qualms seem to revolve around the idea that the movie didnt have a proper identity is it that weird to blend two genres heres a hint no its not weird
Oct 18 2018,positive,screw the critics thats all im saying
Oct 18 2018,positive,a very entertaining movie could have done better with slower pacing and better motivation for certain characters but a very good movie overall cgi could have been better 
Oct 18 2018,positive,the first act is a painful slog but if you can manage to make it through the action set pieces were ludicrous fun absolutely worth the watch if you want to sit down turn off your brain and mutter holy s to yourself as you watch the madness unfold
Oct 18 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film i thought it was great i prefer this over some of the other marvel movies
Oct 18 2018,positive,ignore critics this movies cg and actions were portrayed pretty well and was very enjoyable
Oct 18 2018,positive,oscar worthy i cried 
Oct 18 2018,positive,the film was brilliant do not listen to the critics may not be gory with blood and guts spilling left right and centre but its got everything else you want in a venom movie the origin works perfectly without spiderman imo also i had a good laugh watching it but not to the point where the plot want taken seriously a must watch
Oct 18 2018,positive,as a venom fan i loved the movie  took a little too long for venom to show up but the interaction between him and brock was great just like reading the comic fun movie not supposed to be cinematic excellence it is a fun comic book movie  had it not been sony at the helm look what they did with the dark tower would have been not as hated supporting characters could have been better dialogue could have been tighter but great comic book flick if you like the book i think you will like the movie
Oct 18 2018,negative,weak and very predictable plot from the venom trailer you can immediately guess major plot points and that venom would be the hero furthermore the characterization of  the main characters are not adequate one will not feel disgust towards the life foundation ceo or even care about the main character and his relationship with her girlfreind the fight scenes are very cliche and were not as fantastic as expected even with the use of cgi
Oct 18 2018,positive,i like this movietom hardy is fantastic i love venom
Oct 18 2018,positive,even better than i thought not the best choice in the cinemas right now but if you want to see action movie go on
Oct 18 2018,positive,a nice break from the disney marvel cringe 
Oct 18 2018,positive,this movie has a lot of action  it is a recommendation to see
Oct 18 2018,positive,plot was kind of all over the place but the movie overall was awesome
Oct 18 2018,positive,awesome defo want to see it again
Oct 18 2018,positive,saw this yesterday a fair film i enjoyed the two hours not my favourite superhero film but would happily watch again and any sequel mr hardy is very watchable and the relationship with venom is fun the motorbike chase is really good final fight is a little rushed the humour is great
Oct 18 2018,positive,solid way better than most marvel films  ant man anyone
Oct 18 2018,positive,i dont think ive laughed so much in a theater in a long time
Oct 18 2018,positive,hardy is a wonderful sight to behold his characters dynamic with the symbiote is pure gold every other actor gives a wonderful performance the action scenes are intense enough and the only real damper is that the film could probably hit its stride slightly earlier  i love it
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was amazing hilarious till the end 
Oct 18 2018,positive,a fun loud and ludicrous flick highly recommended
Oct 18 2018,positive,it was pure joy critics seem not to understand the job of an actor and wanted bane from the batman universe to infect the spiderman verse this is a teen world even if spiderman is not in itdumb ass critics this film was everything it should be i loved it
Oct 18 2018,positive,dialogue couldve been better but overall good movie
Oct 18 2018,neutral,once again sony has ruined a potentially great film featuring venom thanks to far too much studio interference while tom hardy is trying his best venom is just a mess that never really establishes a tone and wont commit to an actual consistent story it has its moments of good humor but the movie does little more than simply exist
Oct 18 2018,negative,horrible movie  left half way through
Oct 17 2018,positive,very good movie it is very criticized but its actually such a good movie i would recommend everyone to go see it its so good
Oct 17 2018,positive,solid movie and some pretty good humor tho the pacing was weird and rushing at times dont see why the critics rated it so poorly as it kept me entertained the whole time would love to see more movies like this
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie was outstanding  it was fun a hint of darkness and grit and just enough humor  action scenes were massive without being overdone and tom hardy nailed it  do not listen to these critics  sony did a fantastic job separating venom from spiderman and they could have a great franchise if they dont push too much too soon
Oct 17 2018,positive,to me this movie is up there with infinity war and thor ragnarok 
Oct 17 2018,positive,dont let the reviews make an impact on your decision to see this film it is absolutely amazing
Oct 17 2018,positive,dont read the critics crap this movie was a solid 355 and im a huge venom fan couple of cornball moments but still decent 
Oct 17 2018,positive,seem to start a little slow with some plot holes with technology that we have currently but overall was worth the watch for a comic book fan not a disney movie thankfully no offence to the avengers brand but very predictable and very very tired
Oct 17 2018,positive,this is an example of critics being out of  touch with the audience if you grew up reading venom comics then youll love this film
Oct 17 2018,positive,great movie the venom scenes are some the best in the movie the only problem is that some of the plot seems rushed also riot and drake died pretty fast and easy
Oct 17 2018,positive,enjoyable solid acting the plot has problems the movie is  divided into separate acts and the the catalysts to shift into a new act feel forced but they execute it so well  oh bromance for the win
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie is way better then it has any right to be i expected something okay from the trailers but i was very pleasantly surprised great action excellent editing and pacing and even got a laugh from me several times ignore the critics a great action movie
Oct 17 2018,positive,the movie was very entertaining with laughs and action it is similar to deadpool in enjoyment factor 
Oct 17 2018,positive,really good funny jokes and for the people who want to have a good time you should watch it
Oct 17 2018,positive,although this wasnt the best film ive seen recently it was very entertaining and i got a lot of laughs i would definitely watch this again especially if we got to see the 3040 minutes that tom hardy said got cut
Oct 17 2018,positive,loved it seeing again this weekend
Oct 17 2018,positive,it doesnt get much better than this  stay for 2 trailers
Oct 17 2018,neutral,although i went into this movie not expecting anything i actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit no this movie is nowhere near perfect nor terrible it is a decent movie despite the mistakes
Oct 17 2018,positive,you wanted venom without spiderman you got it and yet you still bitcb about it every movie has its flaws if you went in expecting citizen kane or even avengers then got to hell you dont know the source material so who are you to judge grew up a spiderman fan and this was as better than the original origin story venom has more motives other than just revenge which got stale even in the comics which you never read
Oct 17 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics  terrific film  give it a chance and youll love it
Oct 17 2018,positive,ignore the critics on this one they were way off the mark this was an awesome movie kept you interested the whole way great humor  great story i thought tom hardy as eddie did a great job and there was something very special about this film you felt for the characters and it seemed fresh as opposed to the somewhat worn out yet still fun other marvel fare of late
Oct 17 2018,positive,it was weird but movies are missing weird it was refreshing to see a movie just go for it
Oct 17 2018,positive,full of humor not a perfect movie but enjoyable
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie was a great mixture of action and comedy its not perfect but well worth watching 
Oct 17 2018,positive,its much better then what critics say its as good as thor 1 and captain america 1 
Oct 17 2018,positive,i had loads of fun with this movie  even if it doesnt have spiderman it still awesome to see my favorite spiderman villain get his own movie
Oct 17 2018,negative,just as uninspired and goofy as sonys the amazing spiderman universe might as well just give back the full rights to marvel
Oct 17 2018,positive,a very entertaining antihero movie can be slightly slow at times but also succeeds with its humor and interesting story
Oct 17 2018,positive,was very entertaining due to an intriguing plot good action and acting and humorous lines throughout people with distaste for dark humor or dark protagonists will most likely not enjoy the film as much tom hardy killed it venom has always been one of my favorite marvel characters and this was a good adaptation 
Oct 17 2018,positive,this was everything i wanted it to be i have no idea why people are taking their kids to it its not a kids movie its about a murder machine eating peoples heads hilarious antics my only complaint is that the chase scene was too long
Oct 17 2018,positive,i loved this movie i cant see why it is so hated by critics as it is funny entertaining even tense edging onto scary at some points when the horror side comes out eddie brock is a funny character and the combination of venom makes him even better and i will definitely be getting this on dvd well worth a watch
Oct 17 2018,positive,i like it but it is to slow and we saw the best action in the trailer
Oct 17 2018,positive,a venom movie without spiderman that has had terrible trailers cant be any good right  that what i thought going in but i came out surprised  it is not a great movie but it is a pretty fun 2 hour ride  the main reason the movie does work is the core story thread of tom hardys eddie brock and venom story arch  the other parts of the movie are a mess  i came kind of comparing it to suicide squad where you have some characters that are really good but the overall movie is kind of hit and miss
Oct 17 2018,positive,original concept well acted and did a nice adaptation of the original comics if you dont  like this movies your ego is getting in the way of your own joy
Oct 17 2018,negative,labeled as a box office success thus far venom is a disappointing superhero or supervillain film     investigative journalist eddie brock attempts a comeback following a scandal but accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alterego venom soon he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from a shadowy organisation looking for a symbiote of their own    look bad movies get made and good movies get made there are always people behind these projects that care deeply about the work theyre doing and regardless i think that work deserves to be recognized what kinda bums me out more is the fact that this film is beating out films like first man in the box office and its not even close venom was something i got to see opening night with a crowded theater and it was more than a dissapointment     the real saving grace of this film was tom hardy ive been waiting to see hardy in a superhero film besides the dark knight rises and i wasnt disappointed he adds so much dimension to his character honestly it might even be the most lines of dialogue ive seen him speak in a while but he really carried this film and if it werent for him i dont know if i wouldve finished this film     overall the story of venom was really messy its nearly a 2 hour film and yet it flies past like a bullet one minute were here and one minute were there and we never get a chance to breathe and soak in all the information they throw a lot of information and characters at you and never really take their time to sort it all out tom hardy said a lot was cut from this film and it felt like that this is easily a great example of a rushed film     i really think this films biggest problem was the fact that it was rushed we were never able to get attached to the story the cgi was really cool at some parts but it was lackluster at others and i think thats because they just werent given enough time to work on venoms cg i felt like this film couldve had a lot of its problems solved if it just took its time     in the end venom was not the best it was entertaining but with a lack of attachment to our protagonist and a lot of cheap cop outs it just wasnt something that i could recommend investing your time into
Oct 17 2018,positive,pure dumb fun not the best executed movie ever and there are some glaring flaws but the movie is a lot of fun tom hardy is great the cast is great the action is pretty fun when you look at the hurdles the movie needed to get past small budget being venom without spider man it certainly gets past them and succeeds with flying color
Oct 17 2018,positive,this was a messy movie some of the cutting was ugly and i was not a fan of the action that all being said i really enjoyed the character arc that they gave venom and how he changed over the course of the film i had a lot of fun watching this film
Oct 17 2018,negative,garbage dont let the fanboys fool you youll regret wasting your hard earned money on this terrible film
Oct 17 2018,positive,i liked it  it wasnt horribly gruesome and the story was pretty good considering the challenges of making a spiderman villain without spiderman  i thought  eddie was a bit too new york  and san francisco was a little too clean and not filled with weirdos to be realistic but if i think of it like a cartoon it was perfect
Oct 17 2018,positive,i loved this movie i want it to do well to warrant a sequel half of it should be eddie venom banter  tom hardy was fantastic both as eddie and venom
Oct 17 2018,positive,i dont care what the critics say me and my mates loved every bit of it and i hope they carry on producing more movies only criticism is not having spiderman
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie was so nice i watched it 3 times
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie fucking sucked in plot points but it was fucking funny ok i laughed through the whole thing and would watch it again blease give this movie some credit for humor
Oct 17 2018,neutral,there mightve been a decent movie in there somewhere  too bad sony had no faith in the director and hacked the movie to bits just like fox and the predator  the two stars are for tom hardy who carries this whole movie across the finish line on his shoulders  the halfstar is for the inventive use of the venom symbiote cinematically  they definitely found uses for it that ive never seen in any comic book  the rest of the movie unfortunately is a mess
Oct 17 2018,positive,love it its so funny i had a great time watching it
Oct 17 2018,positive,a very entertaining movie  despite the characters origin could not involve spiderman this moviemade it not necessary it truly is its own thing great acting funny where it needed to be and very entertaining as any mcu movie i wish this movie was a part of the mcu  go see it
Oct 17 2018,positive,pretty good not the best but better then what i expected too bad the last shot of the movie what featured in the trailer but hey its not a big problem the after credit scene left what to be desired of the people who dont know much about marvel and the characters but a nice nod if you know what it is about
Oct 17 2018,positive,i dont understand what the critics are on about the movie was funny and brilliant
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie might not have been entirely biased on the comics but i did love the banter betweenvvenom and eddie it made for some funny moments the action in the car chase could have been a little better planed as for the fight scene at the end what did we expect people between 2 cgi characters the fight was automatically going to be a least a little bad every time theres a cgi fight every one complains all in all i thought it was great good for the comic book nerds who are ok with movies adapting the characters
Oct 17 2018,positive,very enjoyable movie tom hardy was very likable as brock
Oct 17 2018,positive,i had heard mixed reviews about this movie but it was fun and i never found myself bored really enjoyed it
Oct 17 2018,positive,i like this film very much  i dont care other review i love venom very much
Oct 17 2018,neutral,it has its moments but youll still leave wishing you had the antidote
Oct 17 2018,positive,forget what the critics say  this movie is absolutely amazing
Oct 17 2018,positive,venom a character who is supposed to be tied into the spiderman universe is not tied in at all this film is very entertaining and has its action moment in it trying to make venom funny isnt a great take on the comic book character from watching this movie we can clearly see that this venom would be a part of the amazing spider man universe not the marvel universe
Oct 17 2018,positive,i love the venom character and this movie made me very happy i like how the really captured the essence of eddies and venoms weird relationship it was funny it was spooky it was satisfying the story had plenty of plot holes but those really didnt detract im excited to watch it again
Oct 17 2018,negative,its just a bad movie poorly cast written acted directed and produced
Oct 17 2018,positive,its not perfect but it is everything i wanted from a venom movie
Oct 17 2018,positive,screw the critics this movie was fun interesting and had great action scenes i cant wait for the next one
Oct 17 2018,positive,interesting story but not one of the better marvel movies
Oct 17 2018,neutral,it was just ok nothing spectacular i came to the realization with this movie that im not a fan of michelle williams
Oct 17 2018,positive,what a movie  more action more fun
Oct 17 2018,positive,goofy but still great
Oct 17 2018,positive,venom is an enjoyable film if youre a fan of the character or a fan of tom hardy who gives a good performance as eddie brock and venom the cgi used for the character looks great the film suffers from script isssues but still i enjoyed the movie venom gets a b
Oct 17 2018,positive,saw this last night and enjoyed it very much  not sure why the critics loathe it so bad  its an antihero movie the interaction between venom and brock is hilarious  tom hardy plays the broken man very well there were several moments where the jokes had the entire theater laugh at the same time  the action and pacing of the movie are good  professional critics are too full of themselves  they expect an action flick to be oscar level when literally nobody else does
Oct 17 2018,positive,i mean what else do we expect from super hero movies now think i sjust have a soft spot for topher grace whatever he is in not a huge tom hardy in movies so didnt really sell it too well for me
Oct 17 2018,positive,very very goooood  tom hardy its great
Oct 17 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie even if it was far from the best movies in its genre the humor came across pretty well to me especially the internal struggle between venom and tom hardys character unlike a lot of other people i did not walk out of the cinema dissapointed however for full disclosure my expectations were not that high to begin with that probably helped
Oct 17 2018,positive,the critics were too hard on the film very much worth going to see my dad and i loved it
Oct 17 2018,positive,despite all bad reviews i went a watched venom myself and had a great time venom is funny and true to comics film not perfect but by far not as bad as 90 of critics depicted it so dont listen to anyone go and have fun in cinema
Oct 17 2018,positive,want to see it again 
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie has become one of my faves  the dark jokes were just amazing cant wait till venom 2  hoping it will be great 
Oct 17 2018,positive,probably not a movie for critics but for the fans that enjoyed the character in comicscartoon this might be the only superhero movie that entertains the people who have some background on the story and are willing to connect a few dots themselves     definitely going to buy it on bluray whenever it releases
Oct 17 2018,positive,yes this wasnt the greatest and it flopped in the third act but tom hardy nailed this part he saved the movie it has a weird mix of horror and comedy but i think it works somewhat the movie felt rushed even though it was 2 hours it packed a ton of story in the first hour and i think they nailed venom the first 2 acts were great but it flopped in the third with poor writing i wanted to give this three stars but i just couldnt with how many times i laughed uncontrollably and the decenct action it provided im excited to see what they are gonna do next and hopefully they can get a good to story with this amazing character they created
Oct 17 2018,positive,the movie was great it displayed eddie and venom different from the comics but not in a negative way as a matter of fact this portrayal was made stronger by the movie the diolauge between venom and eddie captivates the audience as well simply for humor as the movie was pretty funny overall id say to anyone who wants to watch this movie go watch it and dont pay attention to scores see it for yourself
Oct 17 2018,positive,i think that critics are being unfair about this film its a great film with a fun banter feel to it and the friendship between venom and eddie is great however i do understand that the ending is weak there is a huge plot whole and that ruins the feel of the film i think all the characters are great and will definatley be hoping for a sequel would recomend you see
Oct 17 2018,positive,movie is good could have make it more violent there was no need to show it as a hero 
Oct 17 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie the critics got it wrong with this one
Oct 17 2018,positive,great movie  enjoyed it in full  cannot wait for another venom movie  good experience and i wasnt a venom character fan tom hardy hes genuine actor hat down he even came to one of the cinemas in london to surprise the fansbrilliant
Oct 17 2018,positive,another big miss for the critics i am starting to look at audience scores more than the rantings of supposed experts  experts at what exactly    this film was funny entertaining and just old fashion fun   audiences love it  and it is well worth a view
Oct 17 2018,negative,the critics were right about this one the movie is missing half of the story just like in the fantastic four reboot also like fantastic four venom skips a large period of time even if the time skip isnt as bad as fantastic fours it seems like sony hasnt learned from their past mistakes both movies feel rushed little time on important plot points and too much time on unnecessary storyline that lead to nowhere i even tried to view the movie as if i knew nothing about superheroes or comic books but i still cannot see venom as a movie that i would watch for a good story tom hardy is the best thing about this movie by far but to me not even his acting could make venom more than twostars in conclusion venom is a decent movie at most with minimal story development 
Oct 17 2018,positive,a extremely awesome movie
Oct 17 2018,positive,not as good as i hoped tom hardy was awesome though
Oct 17 2018,positive,the classic cop partner theme was presented in this film and actually worked well the cgi was amazing and it was a fun entertaining film
Oct 17 2018,positive,not the best marvel movie but definitely enjoyable for average movie audiences and comic book fans respectively tom hardy is excellent as eddie brock
Oct 17 2018,positive,the kids wife and i liked it  the critics are a joke    good acting funny not boring  this is an entertaining movie worth the money
Oct 17 2018,positive,pretty good movie go see it for sure 
Oct 17 2018,positive,didnt expect anything from the reviews and enjoyed this more than i have any film in quite some time very entertaining to watch and great spots of humour throughout
Oct 17 2018,positive,what are you guys smoking this movie was amazing it was full of action entertainment and phenomenal acting 30 you gave this movie a 30 seriously wow a lot of you critics faild miserably on this one and i read some of the audience ratings talk about a knee slapper cheesy you call this movie cheesy lmao what a joke
Oct 17 2018,positive,this movie was so funny and had such a good storyline 
Oct 17 2018,positive,love it a must see movie too much action 
Oct 17 2018,negative,ok movie usual scifi with not too bight scientists and protagonist usual movie tropes with most jokes falling flat  not worth the movie ticket cost best to wait until it streams
Oct 17 2018,positive,a very entertaining movie the writing sucked but it was surprisingly funny the interactions between venom and eddie are priceless watch it its worth your time
Oct 17 2018,neutral,the movie finished too quick and the storyline was a bit odd thought it was ok though
Oct 17 2018,positive,it is a funny story that keep you interested in the movie there is no scene that you would like to skip the scenery is very detailed and with a good quality venom is very good animated and nice to look at very nice   the relationship between venom and eddie is so lovely portreted you just can not fall in love with it the direcor and script writers did a good job  but annie character kind of bothers me shes not bad there is a lot more bad female characters in movie industry  but she is not part of them for sure but still not good though     i think most critics expected a very deep manly movie but got a very funny love comedy with superheros background they are dissapointed so now they judgy it harshly
Oct 17 2018,positive,a great antihero movie the story couldve been done a little bit better but overall great acting great setting and great way to introduce venom
Oct 17 2018,positive,only thing bad about this movie is the critic reviews i enjoyed this movie i couldnt have expected more
Oct 17 2018,positive,this is the best take on a comic book villain i have seen yet yes i can see why audiences love it
Oct 17 2018,negative,venom tom hardy plays charlie kelly from its always sunny in a weird unsuited role which could havez possibly worked if well written collette williams is thern also forced into this uncomfortable love interest role that just is never well defined and is forced into a weird wig  its a pity  there is so much you could do with venom as a character
Oct 17 2018,positive,we are venom cant wait to see how carnage is introduced
Oct 16 2018,positive,id like to start by saying im a little biased since venom has always been one of my favorite villains ever if not my favorite  cons lousy script lousy screenplay making changes to the original storyline tom hardys weird mumbling a weak and minimal plot  pros good cgi once the character venom shows up things get great the character is a badass and they nailed it with the voice i wasnt bothered with either with his dialogue maybe one weird line  it had all the cringeworthy moments that the marvel movies have but once you get past the first halfhour things start cookin and its not too long so youre out of there before you really start analyzing again
Oct 16 2018,positive,this was a great movie if you like marvel films like thor ragnarok you should watch it right amount of action and comedy dont expect super serious dialog this film captures venoms comic canon personality well
Oct 16 2018,negative,very underwhelming film too much of trying to be funny when it comes across cringe and not enough actionstoryline
Oct 16 2018,positive,i always love tom hardy and i really enjoyed this  movie funny thrilling and the venom character was likeable which made his disgusting appearance easier to stomach lol
Oct 16 2018,positive,i have heard a lot of mixed reviews when it came to this movie i was very skeptical about going to see it  i enjoyed the movie and thought it was actually a pretty good movie i kind expected more but what they provided was good enough for the audience to want to see what will happen next within the series  everyone complains about the ending but where is the problem just like any normal superhero movie they have one of those endings that leave you hanging with questions tom hardy never fails to please with his acting skills but overall the movie is a go for me if you are iffy about seeing the movie go on a tuesday like me when it is 5 so you will not be so upset about the price you paid if you hate it
Oct 16 2018,positive,was a fun movie didnt follow the comics to closely but it was a very enjoyable experience hope they make a second
Oct 16 2018,positive,tom hardys venom was greatdont listen to the critics listen to the fansas usual the critics are wrong
Oct 16 2018,positive,phenomenal the acting in it is incredible tom hardy played an amazing wellrounded character who isnt casually misogynistic for the laughs and shows his emotions tom hardy played that character like it was a real person eddie brock was such a relatable character and showed an amazing relationship with the venom i think the cgi was great showed competent and relatable characters this movie feels like it cares more about character development and relationship building and then it does about save the world plot which is what a lot of dc and marvel movies are missing
Oct 16 2018,positive,an awesome action movie with comedy and a great storylinethe post end credit scene sets it up perfectly for a sequel in fact im a big fan of comics but i have to say i like this origin story better than the original because it didnt have a huge reliance on spiderman
Oct 16 2018,positive,enjoyable kids really liked it not the best by far but fun shows people dying so little but on the dark side 
Oct 16 2018,positive,i think this movie was stand out really good animation and all the character was so click
Oct 16 2018,positive,from the new spidey until the last avengers all the way through thor this is the only marvel film that did keep me entertained 5 out of 5 for me
Oct 16 2018,positive,was awesome not sure why critics dont like this movie but tom hardy was fantastic as was michelle williams     i highly recommend 
Oct 16 2018,negative,acting and script sucked tom hardy didnt pull me in to the story i am glad i watched it just so i can join the conversation of how much it sucked
Oct 16 2018,positive,glad i didnt listen to the critics  this movie was awesome
Oct 16 2018,positive,overall great film want to see more like it just a couple nitpicks here and there otherwise venom was really good
Oct 16 2018,neutral,venom was a fucking blast well at least for the first twothirds of the movie tom hardy delivers a lovely wellthought character to its audience my main issues with this film was lack of drive and want from our villain carlton drake played by riz ahmed and the absence of a build up to battle riot the symbiote paired with drake  i could of done with less car chase and more utter nonsense from our favorite violent alien casting lost with michelle williams and jenny slate both characters were reduced to a simple meaningless female role no underneath layers that proved to the viewer the characters had anything to risk you will get your dose of actionhero violence and lame it cannot be romance but what saves this film was tom hardys performance what could have made this film was an rrating and a better plot we deserve a kickass venom film and i hope one day we get it
Oct 16 2018,positive,i loved both tom hardy and the venom character in this i would watch it again sometimes pacing could have maybe been a little different but i personally dont care to change anything
Oct 16 2018,positive,seen it  awesome movie cant wait for the sequeal
Oct 16 2018,positive,just what i was expecting  a fun movie with some good laughs kind of dark kind of quirky not forgettable or too cringeworthy looking forward to hopefully seeing more also make sure to stay for the during credits scene and after credits scene longest credits ever but it was worth it imho
Oct 16 2018,positive,this was the best marvel movie to date they developed the symbiote characters in a way never seen anywhere not even in the comics and it made this movie so much more dont know why the critics didnt like it they can bite it
Oct 16 2018,positive,was not the best marvel movie but not the abomination people depicted either  i will probably see it again
Oct 16 2018,neutral,venom is a comic book favorite among many and given the opportunity to see him once again on the big screen is a huge gift to us but with a script that does not stay on a single theme horror comedy romance if they were serious to make this a great film it would have been rated r from the start to keep the horrific of venom everyone loves
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie was fun typical case of the critics not liking a movie but missing an important point of view  sometimes you just want to watch an action flick for the action  without a detailed plot analysis it was better than i expected  and venoms inner dialogue was hilarious if you are on the bubble about going and just want to enjoy a popcorn action flick  its definitely worth checking out
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie is absolutely one of the best 2018 films no idea why those people gave a such bad review probably those dc fans want to belittle the rates
Oct 16 2018,positive,heart pounding nonstop action movie probably  one of the best ive seen of marvel yet next to infinity war truly  worth seeing cant wait for a  second venom
Oct 16 2018,positive,not as bad as critics are saying 
Oct 16 2018,positive,entertaining funny well cast critics proven wrong again
Oct 16 2018,negative,although they used marvel characters this was not a marvel movie they went in such a different direction from what we know of the venom characters that they should have just come up with a different name for the film 
Oct 16 2018,positive,i always look to rotten tomatoes before i watch a movie of any kind they are normally right in this case they are not in my opinion venom is fantastic tom hardys character as eddy brock was a great move   listen dont take it from me or rotten tomatoes go see venom for yourself and sit back with a cold drink and hot popcorn and enjoy the moviesi know i did
Oct 16 2018,negative,bad movie overall not to mention does not follow the comics even a little bit so many plot holes it barely makes any sense basically another nonsense action flick that missed out on what should have been the coolest marvel movie yet
Oct 16 2018,positive,if you love deadpool you gotta see this movie its fantastic
Oct 16 2018,positive,this was an amazing movie
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie yall  trash for trying to make this seen like a bad movie wish it was rated r but cant wait for the sequel
Oct 16 2018,positive,1010 it was enjoyable to watch and had quite a few humorous scenes  there were of course a couple things that either didnt make sense or was dragged a little too long car chase  but was a great movie and highly entertaining  will watch again
Oct 16 2018,positive,i like venom he is my first super villain in all time
Oct 16 2018,positive,honestly loved it great representation of venom as a character only gripe is i didnt like the female lead and the action was a little hard to follow but very enjoyable and funny in ways that make sense for venom to be
Oct 16 2018,positive,way better than i expected    the special effects were some of the best ive ever seen acting was very good
Oct 16 2018,positive,love the movie the kids loved it its easy to follow the story hardy is excellent great movie to go watch a sunday with the family i really dont understand what the critics look for but as fr as enjoyable this is a 10
Oct 16 2018,positive,they cheat you when they say its not worth it is its actually really good
Oct 16 2018,positive,critics need to get a damn life this movie was good hardy does a great job the story was decent and the graphics looked cool its a super hero movie we need to stop rating these things like its an art house film fun flick cool idea good acting great cgi
Oct 16 2018,negative,misconceived on a much larger scale    venom     fleishers marvel entry is neither marevellous nor plausible in any whatsoever form of cinema even a commercial cinema attempts with all the dedication to keep the viewers tangled in its selfcreated world but this is a poorly constructed tale that brags about pulling off a faster and gripping screenplay in each frame whilst the truth is it skips out the essential bits and makes less and less sense as it ages on screen and this is the only graph that grows as it moves forward it never fails to surprise us on disappointing with a newer tactic     the emotions are shallow the action is a big mess and the visual effects are questionable now these were the thing to be expected upon since the storytelling that is worth listening to gets shucked away within first few minutes of the feature fleishers comfort genre ie humor too is forcely imputed and barely draws out a chuckle in its almost and overstretched two hours the characters are undercooked and hence are immensely difficult to be read upon despite of having such loud one dimensional characteristics hence it naturally makes the actors to fill in those shoes difficult     williams is disappointing but she is not the one to blame similar is the case with ahmed and slate hardy had a wider range and when i say wide i meant he had two roles to shift in every now and then which he does convincingly in here and addition to that hardy is a hard working actor living among us his commitment on justifying the beloved comic character is crystal clear in here but a sinking script like such has no savior not even someone with a caliber like hardy the chase sequence that is unnecessarily long is purely banal where if taken a step back and thought twice about it its existence itself can tell a lot about the feature     the so called thrills that it aspires to achieve is misconceived on a much larger scale than usual the awe moments are barely the oh moments fleishers execution is the frizziest composition of all and mind you it had to compete with its equally challenging script there are few things that it gets right which is the repercussions that it causes when something enters into your body and this is probably one of the best bit of it as hardy keeps resisting his inner voice but these are the things extracted from the comic books on terms of originality there is a void to be filled in here     the narration seems in awful rush throughout the course of the feature which is something that itches especially if your beloved character is getting ripped off on screen this mishap of few stunts a big cgi action sequence few twists and turns and one big seenthisseenthat motto that would end up wiping out the entire world is why it is more sad than bad venom is hardys tale no matter what echos through that empty hall the work is always to be looked upon
Oct 16 2018,positive,it was better than i expected and not as bad as the critics made it out to be
Oct 16 2018,positive,personally i enjoyed the movie quite a lot
Oct 16 2018,positive,i followed the movie from the announcement of its conception i was excited to see the combination of talent accumulated on this project it seemed the right mix for the subject matter venom isnt shakespeare never will be and should never aspire to be what it is is a great buddy movie with the twist the buddies are the same guykinda theres not much to dislike here hardy gives a whitty and comical performance and his supporting cast also are all solid theres just something warm and funny about brock and venom and how they come together in a beautiful bromance this is a movie we really needed at this time and the haters can hate but it doesnt stop us loving venom
Oct 16 2018,neutral,they didnt treat venoms character the way they should have
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie  as it seams a lot critics hate the movies that the public like  will watch again
Oct 16 2018,positive,it was dumb but i went into the theatre expecting that so it didnt disappoint
Oct 16 2018,positive,the jokes were funny the action was cool and it was just like reading the comics sure there are some scenes that can be seen as so bad they are good however this movie has less pitfalls than the critics would have you believe i highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves marvel
Oct 16 2018,positive,great film which pays tribute to the comics well
Oct 16 2018,negative,so disappointed with this movie it started off slow and never got better smh
Oct 16 2018,positive,i absolutely was entertained and enjoyed this film 
Oct 16 2018,negative,not a great movie characters were very weak story was very weak relationship between eddie brock and venom were the strong part not even sure if they seek will be worth it 
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie kept alive only by tom bradys performance
Oct 16 2018,negative,weak almost nonexistent plot horrible dialog terrible execution pointless exposition when its not needed and none when it is needed it plays as a made for netflix movie wait for it not worth paying money i might even say it was slightly worse than black panther
Oct 16 2018,positive,i really dont understand the bad reviews venom is awesome  tom hardy is amazing as eddie brock  venom was so funny and the back and forth with him and eddie was really entertaining the action is great riz ahmed as the villain wasnt anything special but i didnt mind him venom is easily one of the most entertaining movies of the year
Oct 16 2018,positive,its an entertaining movie as little
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie is awesome dont know why the critics hate this movie makes it one of my favorite movies
Oct 16 2018,positive,fun and entertaining from start to finish looking forward to seeing it again
Oct 16 2018,negative,this movie needed spiderman i think it couldve been better
Oct 16 2018,positive,venom definitely has the cool factor b it was not afraid of getting a bad review and only hoped that it was longer as the end drew near the relationship between venom and eddie and eddie and anne were both interesting and genuine nice post credit set up at the end  liked it
Oct 16 2018,positive,loved it critics are dumb
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie and tom hardy was awesome
Oct 16 2018,positive,solid pg13 wished it could be rated r my step son and his friends liked it
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie dont let the critics change your mind about going to see it
Oct 16 2018,positive,the audience scores are more trustworthy than the professional critics really enjoyed this movie
Oct 16 2018,negative,if teenagers wrote directed and acted in a film this pile of garbage would be worse than what theyd make the genius move was getting hardy to agree to be in this crapfest as his star power is the only reason this stinker hasnt bombed like it deserves to nothing makes any sense after 30 mins and the plot contradicts itself repeatedly and dont get me started on the dialogue utter garbage if you love comic book movies avoid this turd for once the critics got this absolutely right 
Oct 16 2018,positive,the plotline flowed well the commentary between venom and tom hardy was really funny the chi was great it stayed pretty close to the venom comics i liked the addition of him staying on earth because he liked it and wanted to prevent his species from invading i loved the commentary on global resource crisis and overpopulation the female characters were fun i liked how many diverse representations there were and that carnage is woody harrison  the banter between tom hiddleston and venom was the highlight for me all in all the critics didnt get the movie and gave it a wrong rateing
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie is amazing   the characters humour and horror all mixed together make for a great movie their is absolutely nothing wrongand i repeat nothing wrong with this movie everyone should go and see this movie i dont care if the other people on here are critics or not they are still all wrong   i repeat go and see this movie it is hreat and amazing            ignore all of the other ratings they are all false and bullst
Oct 16 2018,positive,fun entertaining but a little bit short
Oct 16 2018,positive,final fight could have been better and characters other than venom and eddie could have been fleshed out more
Oct 16 2018,positive,this is a much more comic book accurate version by appearance in a few ways though venom doesnt have the large white spider on his chest but this is because the symbiote hasnt bonded to peter parker i thoroughly enjoyed the movie the villain was kind of rushed and put in within the last about 30 minutes as riot but it was built up throughout the way the symbiote bonds with eddie is not comic accurate but spiderman being in the mcu causes problems so they had to mix it up a bit butt all in all i think the movie was pretty good and it was fun to watch in theaters
Oct 16 2018,positive,a darker superhero film that still knows how to have a bit of fun  the humourous interactions between eddie and venom are the real highlight as are the great creature special effects  the story is ok as although it covers the origins of the character sufficiently it does go on a bit long and the ending feels a bit rushed  the action scenes are difficult to follow and look a bit staged at times and although the villains are good the other characters dont really stand out
Oct 16 2018,positive,as an origins movie as well as an antihero movie venom could not be a better adaptation of the comics tom hardy is a great fit for the role
Oct 16 2018,positive,it was good for the most part it was well written and put together and surprisingly good considering spiderman wasnt in it
Oct 16 2018,positive,venom has always been one of my favorite characters of all time and tom hardy was the perfect guy to play him     the story was not what i was expecting but still very enjoyable and the cgi was top notch the actuals character venom was awesome to look at and to listen to have to love a little comedy with it as welli look forward to carnage in the next installment 
Oct 16 2018,positive,best gay interspecies romcom of all time
Oct 16 2018,positive,left the cinema excited and with a huge smile on my face while exiting the cinema i heard people talking about their favourite the scenes and one guy even said no way i am watching this movie only once it starts out slowly but from the moment eddie meets venom you know it is gonna be good the one liners are funny the action scenes are intense and the chemistry between eddie and venom is strong dont listen to the critics you will have a great time also there is absolutely no political correctness bs in this one
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie is so awesome i would see it again and agian moslty because im a huge venom fan
Oct 16 2018,negative,how did this get made
Oct 16 2018,positive,not sure i understand the critics this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie
Oct 16 2018,positive,i really liked the movie  it has  a good actor and a good main story
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie was action packed  filled with little and subtle jokes sarcasm  and lots of wit i was filled with excitement when this was annouced i seen the trailer i was completely sure that it was gonna smack and now that i have seen it i know for a fact that it is an amazing unbelievable 1010 will buy and watch over and over again
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie a lot of action and humor
Oct 16 2018,positive,loved the relationship between brock and venom the visual of venom was really good and very important the movie was too quick and fast paced and i hate the idea of woody playing a major role in the next film going to have a hard time overlooking that
Oct 16 2018,positive,is a excellent  movie with action and fiction
Oct 16 2018,positive,dont listen to critics it is amazing  i love that venom and eddie have this really cool bond type deal going on later in the movie  i hope its a franchise that goes further
Oct 16 2018,positive,not a good film but still one of the best of 2018  i was grinning the entire time
Oct 16 2018,positive,everything i expected from marvel and more loved it amazing 4dx experience balanced humor dark but not really horror which i appreciate it works well in marvels style and universe easilly deserves 5 stars
Oct 16 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics they are comparing it to fan4stic and catwoman it is much better than those i already seen the movie twice theres a reason why it has such a high audience score
Oct 16 2018,positive,only thing i have to complain is that the movie was kind of short there were a few plot holes that might have been fixed or refined with longer screen time but overall i really enjoy this movie it was the action movie i expected from sonyy
Oct 16 2018,positive,i think the critics are way off on this one this flick was an allaround treat perfect amount of campiness
Oct 16 2018,positive,loved every minute of it yeah it could of been better but hey theyll get it right soon
Oct 16 2018,negative,the start of the movie was about as accurate to the cartoon series of the 90s as possible j jonah jamesons son is venturing in space and has something of interest to bring back to earth its no surprise to the audience that this is the first time we see the symbiotes that eventually become venom and his fellow symbiotic race through much of the movie the story takes a weird turn and doesnt give us a whole lot of back story in brocks past his social issues etc the story felt and was  way too rushed for this film even the teaser in the ending credits scene with woody harrelson felt out of place and awkward i was also hoping for a tom hiddleston cameo  but that never happened what a shame i had too high of hopes for this film going into it women watching this movie though had a field day with their swooning ooh and ahh moments watching tom hardy
Oct 16 2018,positive,expected to hate it due to to the pg13 rating but i was still very entertained
Oct 16 2018,positive,i dont know why u had given more ratings to spiderman  homecomming and less to venom 2018  this is awesome movie guys everybody must watch this
Oct 16 2018,positive,i am a marvel movie buff and honestly this is one of the best the plot was somewhere along the comics and the computer animation was great good job marvel
Oct 16 2018,neutral,venom wastes its interesting body horror themes and talented cast on a confused tome that swings wildly between horror and comedy and a hapless script that never gives its characters anything interesting to do although the sight of seeing tom hardy interacting with tom hardy did make some scenes very entertaining
Oct 16 2018,positive,i was never bored good story good action funny tom a hardy was great to watch and root for as is always the case
Oct 16 2018,positive,who cares about the critics
Oct 16 2018,positive,my girlfriend and i have already watched the movie and we liked a lot if you like the comics you wont get dissapointed because this venom is a very good adaptation of the venom from comics if you want to see the comics that was used to give basis to this movie read venom  lethal protector it has only 6 issues
Oct 16 2018,positive,i think venom was a fun movie with an exelent cast
Oct 16 2018,positive,well done great job i like the feel of the movie and the pacing was great  fun movie for sure  the movie new what it was and acted acourdingly
Oct 16 2018,positive,it was actually pretty good i liked it a lot it was funny action packed and interesting the cgi wasnt that bad either i think the ratings are so low is because its from sony and not a disney title regardless of that this will for sure give sony a much needed boost and hopefully they dont completely sell out and get bought by disney  100x better than the last jedi thats for sure
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie the super villain is potrayed as a superhero even though he bites peoples head offoverall a great action thriller superhero moviei would recommend all marvel fans to watch it
Oct 16 2018,positive,pretty good but nothing is perfect except avatar and j park so im giving 90 45 stars as its one of the best movies ive seen and definitely the best of the year  i never really liked venom all that much and didnt think they could make a good movie out of venom but i guess they did  the women really brought the movie together j slate and m williams were awesome but i wish j slate didnt die  tom hardy was pretty good and i dont particularly like him in many movies so that should say a lot  overall a pretty great movie  i hope they make a sequel and then probably will just because it made so much money  this movie couldve easily been done wrong i think also  eminem song at the end was icing on the cake  the symbiotealien couldve looked more lifelike also instead of cool but fake looking  just hope they dont mess up the sequel   ps  were the critics on crack when rating this or just not paid enough  critics are losing their reputations by rating gold such as this like coal  this is definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen
Oct 16 2018,negative,not much was done right here entertaining if you expect the movie to only share the name and likeness of the source material
Oct 16 2018,positive,i saw it last night and loved it left the theatres thinking nothing annoyed me  venom was endearing and actually charming  turns out i can use a little venom in my life  i highly recommend it
Oct 16 2018,positive,think the critics are completely out of touch with the rest of society i went in understanding a couple things since thor ragnarok caught me 100 off guard as i was looking for a major action film and went into a comedy i promised myself to be more ready for films and to accept them walking into this movie i understood that this was not meant to over shadow infinity war and would be damn near impossible to do that marvel movie or not i went in with that and also knowing that past venom movies or collabs have not been to popular at all going into this movie and watching it i actually enjoyed every single moment and felt a real connection to venom tom did an awesome job on this and this movie will definitely  be on my owned list
Oct 16 2018,positive,venom was awesome not sure what the critics watched my only complaint is that it was too short i hope they release the cut footage on bluray and hope they make another one
Oct 16 2018,neutral,can be better but interesting enough feels in between all scary funny serious comic etc waiting for a second part that fix the problems
Oct 16 2018,positive,i dont know what movie the critics watched but venom was awesome one of the best movies ive seen in awhile my only complaint is that it was too short i hope they release the cut footage with the bluray i also hope they make another
Oct 16 2018,positive,i loved the movie rotten tomatoes is incorrect with their rating
Oct 16 2018,positive,it was very good what i really enjoyed was it was a different story about venom than from the spiderman 3 so they werent retelling the same story it was quite different also like every marvel movie they show 2 clips in the credits stay for the first one because it is relevant to it the second one is about a cartoon spirderman so its a waste of time staying for that one
Oct 16 2018,negative,this would get 0 stars if it wasnt for tom hardy he makes it watchable
Oct 16 2018,positive,great movie very well done had some great funny aspect to it to make it another great marvel movie 
Oct 16 2018,negative,what a waste of tom hardy its a train wreck tom cant even save the humor is lame 
Oct 16 2018,positive,interesting funny not very loaded with meaning perfect
Oct 16 2018,positive,pure crap thank god i went to a discounted matinee and only paid 650 for it not even worth a 1 redbox rental
Oct 16 2018,negative,movie was garbage tom hardy what were you doing man like did you think doing the whole movie while drunk was somehow a good thing christ and venom the character was good for like the 1st part of the movie then venom goes from evil super villein to pet dog like man if they could have just focused of the character growth of venom instead of the coight dang love subplot screaming internally  maybe the change of heart would have felt like a well deserved pay off but no it is abrupt and jarring
Oct 16 2018,neutral,the movie is ok of you like tom hardy 
Oct 16 2018,positive,very enjoyable film had a lot to live up to with all the hype surrounding it  i thought that it managed to stand up to that level of expectation tom hardy as eddie brock was an excellent choice  he played the part well least not forgetting his bond that he was creating with venom was entertaining to watch especially when he first started hearing him speak
Oct 16 2018,positive,this is the romcom of the century venom said pussy and tom hardy made out with him no single event in my life will ever top the 2 hrs and 20 minutes i spent watching it
Oct 16 2018,positive,the movie takes a different turn to what you would normally expect of a superhero movie the tone is set in the first 510 minutes which is always very nice im not a media expert but i thought it was very well made nothing too in your face the movie hints at gore but never really goes over the top with it which i prefer absolutely loved it and cant wait for another
Oct 16 2018,positive,a solid movie with great future expectations
Oct 16 2018,positive,very likable comic book movie entertaining and with the price of going to the movies now a days thats very important i enjoyed and cant wait for sequels
Oct 16 2018,positive,this movie is amazing the critics dont know what theyre talking about
Oct 16 2018,negative,it was just ok for me  this is nothing more than the movie upgrade made into a comic book with slight differences  dont believe me go watch the movie upgrade for yourself youll see  something was missing 
Oct 15 2018,positive,the movie was amazing i highly recommend any fan of the commics to go and see it
Oct 15 2018,positive,honestly went in with low expectations as everyone i that already saw the movie said it was meh but after a watch it im a big fan cant wait to see how sony universe does
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom2018pg13oct 5 byclem the movie guy based on the marvel comics character who first appeared on the big screen in spiderman 3 2007 venom is the first film in sonys marvel universe adjunct to the marvel cinematic universe mcu tom hardy stars as eddie brock an investigative journalist who is assigned by his boss to interview carlton drake riz ahmed the ceo of the life foundation about the potential beneficial discoveries of his scientific explorations into space against orders brock veers off neutral territory to focus on classified intel he gleaned from the laptop of his fiancée anne weying michelle williams an attorney involved in preparing a lawsuit defense for life foundation brock confronts drake about the illegal testing his company is performing on humans that has resulted in deaths as a consequence of his aggressive questioning brock is fired he is dumped by anne who also lost her job as a result of brocks actions six months later way down on his luck with bills piling up  no work in sight brock he is sought out by dr dora skirth jenny slate one drakes scientists who can no longer tolerate his research methods using the toxic symbiote lifeforms discovered in space to infect unexpected homeless people when brock learns that maria melora walters a homeless friend of his has become one of drakes test subjects he breaks into the research facility in his attempt to rescue an already infected maria the symbiote transfers from her to brock after escaping the facility eddie begins showing strange signs of the symbiote inhabiting him who reveals itself as venom venom explains to brock that the comet is an invasion force searching for new worlds where the symbiotes can possess  devour the inhabitants with the new superhuman attributes that the symbiote gives him brock must find a way to prevent earth from being overtaken directed by ruben fleischer from a screenplay by scott rosenberg jeff pinkner  kelly marcel venom is a decent attempt at a comic book adaptation it was entertaining with plenty of wry humor throughout despite a very simple comic book story i do wish that they decided to make the film rrated instead of the pg13 rating so that the full antihero intensity of the character could be revealed it would been very interesting to see the film with the 40 minutes that they cut which included tom hardys favorite scene now ill have to wait to see if they release a extended version on dvdbluray the performances from the cast were good  i could tell that everyone was having fun with the material that they were given it was cool to see michelle williams doing something more lighthearted than the more emotional roles that we are accustomed to seeing her in like all marvel films venom has a scene during the end credits featuring an oscarnominated star there is also a trailer at the very end of the credits of the new spiderman film that comes out this christmas if you want a little cinematic escapism for 2 hours then see venom in 2d 3d or imax 3d but you could always wait for dvdbluray for this film as well
Oct 15 2018,neutral,the story is totally different than the real venom and has spoilt the classic
Oct 15 2018,positive,good stuff really enjoyed this
Oct 15 2018,positive,way better than i thought was gonna be tom hardy does an excellent job once again movie is a taste of something new in the superhero film era
Oct 15 2018,positive,cant wait yo see carnage
Oct 15 2018,positive,one of my new favorite movies crtitics are completely detached from what viewers like and why they like it which results in poor scores for movies that are just cool or fun not everything needs to be scored like a stupid high class artsy french film it was chaotic and noisy and fun as hell no connection to spider man i dont care i do not care about spiderman at all 0 when was the last time a spiderman movie was good be honest that upcoming one might be but the absence of spiderman related whatever didnt affect the film in any way shape or form not only that but if critics were familiar with the source material they would know that venom isnt even inherently connected to spiderman so i dont know what they expected please go see it its fantastic
Oct 15 2018,positive,not even going to lie this movie was awesome 
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie was amazing venom is everything fans wanted it to be and more
Oct 15 2018,neutral,it was average wasnt impressed with the villain not worth paying to see it at the movies
Oct 15 2018,positive,f you for everyone who gave bad review for this
Oct 15 2018,positive,seriously where the hll do you people find your critics if this movie review business wants to survive you better find real people to review the movies your top critics are obviously too smart laughing for this monumental task of being able to tell if the average person people whom still possess common sense will like a particular movie this was a great movie and very entertaining tom hardy was awesome
Oct 15 2018,positive,massive hole in plot when venom decides to save mankind
Oct 15 2018,negative,predictive the management of the actors is pessimistic
Oct 15 2018,positive,dont go into this movie expecting to see one of the best movies of all time or anything close to such because realistically it isnt not even close but does that mean the movie isnt enjoyable  no in all reality its a fairly good movie one which id recommend to anyone who likes superheroantihero type movies simply because thats what this is you shouldnt go into this expecting an amazing script writing or story you should go into this movie taking it as a marveldc movie meaning youll go in looking for some kind of super human spectacle and itll deliver while also trying somewhat failing to make a cohesive world for a possible squeal    so would i recommend this movie for the following categories    acting  yesno no offense to anyone other then tom but they didnt seem to be fully into it tom on the other hand he did very well with what he had for lines    story no unfortunately its not very cohesive and has a few holes that stand out a bit to much     super human showing definitely this movie delivers on that quite well and for a stand alone film of this nature it definitely set a good tone for possible squeal spectacles
Oct 15 2018,positive,worth seeing but dont expect anything better than an average movie experience exchanges between venom and brock are sometimes humorous but more often cringeworthy a major turning point for the character of venom toward the end feels completely unearned what should have been an amazing reveal in the post credits sequence ended up seeming way too forced
Oct 15 2018,positive,honestly i feel like  this movie could fit in with the mcu this has soul unlike infinity war infinity wae just feels like a rehash of previous stories movies like iron man antman gaurdians and thor didnt feel like they were trying to be the comics and venom doesnt have that feel
Oct 15 2018,positive,wasnt so bad in occations was even funny most of the critics had been panning it to death just because it isnt a marveldisney movie the cgi can improve
Oct 15 2018,positive,not good at criticizing nor am i a real comic fan i just can tell when i like or dislike it a movieand i like venom despite an obviously flat background story i found it very entertaining that i will def buy a ticket for the next venom movie also venom is now my 2nd favorite anti hero character
Oct 15 2018,positive,come on  ideal for the kids and teenagers you can laugh but i like it
Oct 15 2018,positive,honestly not that bad had a few funny scenes the last fight scene was pretty chaotic but all around good movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing and a lot funnier than i expected highly recommend it
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing  i loved this movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie dont know what the critics were thinking on this one 
Oct 15 2018,positive,i thought it was well paced funny the intro of venom was well done and appreciated by the audience  the ending felt a little rushed and anticlimactic but overall i thought it was a good movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,another great movie that idiot critics dont like because it doesnt stroke their overinflated egos  if you dont know anything about comics then you shouldnt talk about comic book characters or their movies  though not perfect venom has a lot of what comic fans want  the plot is solid the action is good the villain is compelling and the hero is likeable  its funny when it should be and its dark where it should be  all around good flick
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom is fun this movie will not win any oscars is a simple fun movie with a entertaining main character and a simple villain this movie is not for the critics is for the fans is for people that want to be entertain with out having to think to much  spoiler alert  sony keeps doing the same thing giving us the last scene of the film
Oct 15 2018,neutral,they tried so hard to nail the eddie venom relationship and ignore the fact that their villain is so boring despite the perfect acting from tom hardy and riz ahmed i still struggle to understand the role of eddies girlfriend and his doctor boyfriend these 2 character serves no role except being venoms transporter i also feel that the action carchase sequence in the san fransisco streets is not that compelling they can put a thing or two there but they didnt now we go to the villain side of things carlton drake is the one of the mosst boring villain that i ever seen his motive in making human trial is unclear its ibvious that he isnt thinking straight and of course in the course of the story this character only get worse by combining him and riot it feels that from him being a pussy to him being a riot who is brave to go against eddie is a really bad character development thats why this movie is not that good but actually there is a good thing in here one of it is being the relationship between eddie and venom they nailed it still a really fun sequence how eddie is dealing with these voices inside his head and have to deal with the real world thats complicated for him i give this movie a 25 star and i hope with the sequel we can see more of a unboring story villain and side characters
Oct 15 2018,negative,the only good thing about the movie was the symbiote dialogue and the carnage cameo
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved this movie dont listen to the haters
Oct 15 2018,positive,despite its bad rating its not a bad movie  it was very enjoyable  it did not have the depth a typical tom hardy movie has but seeing someone struggling between good and evil something we can all relate with
Oct 15 2018,negative,as i sat in the theater watching venom i was constantly reminded of what it could have been venom is not a good venom movie or very much of a good movie in general the writing and dialogue is lazy while the cgi is passable yet used far too much the movie seems misguided and desperate the casting is not good but far worse is the writing this movie is a mess of cgi action and lazy dialogue with no real intrigue i have seen a vast amount of people react positively to this movie maybe peoples standards are lowering maybe movie audiences of today are just easy to entertain or maybe its just a matter of preference whatever the case if you are looking to see a venom movie that does the character justice this is not it i am not a hater of this movie it had its moments but i could not bring myself to excuse its numerous flaws this movie is good to an extent it has some funny moments and an intriguing mixed personality dynamic between eddie brock and venom overall this movie wasnt bad but it wasnt good i came into it with high hopes and left ultimately dissapointed
Oct 15 2018,positive,was an enjoyable and entertaining movie for our whole crowd
Oct 15 2018,positive,its a good movie just dont go in with high expectations i think people were too hard on this one its an entertaining film not meant to be taken too seriously or held to really high standards just a quick 90 minutes of fun but it would be wrong of me to say this movie doesnt have its flaws
Oct 15 2018,positive,tom hardy turns in a performance that made me want to see more of the character in the future  its also a movie that has rewatchability along the lines of a good 90s action flick  the action sequences are different and i laughed quite a bit at the comedy  most negative critic reviews of this movie should be read in a nasally pta voice
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom is a strong independent symbiote that dont need no spiderman
Oct 15 2018,positive,in my personal opinion venom was a great movie and the movie wasnt based of a spider man comics but come from a venom stand alone comic called lethal protector which has riot and and scream who had a cameo as the yellow and red symbiote
Oct 15 2018,positive,fantastic a buddy cop movie between eddie and his livein boyfriend disguised as an edgy antihero movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics go watch the movie yourself and i bet youll love it it truly was awesome funny and actionpacked at the same time
Oct 15 2018,positive,as a long time venom fan tom hardys performance and portrayal of eddie brock and his relationship with the dark yet goofy symbiote was flawless i said goofy because for the most part venom is extremely goofy and sort of odd character in the most of his comics something to maybe consider getting an idea of before going in the theater and only expecting dark monsterlike action yeah there were some plot holes rough cuts and dialogue trips but this was a very unique take for a superhero movie maybe even the first of its kind since the word superhero is loosely tied in with venom and thankfully it doesnt follow the typical formula that youd expect from the other 25 superhero movies youve seen this past decade learn the character appreciate the flawless acting and somewhat compelling story and youll have a good time seeing this movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,brilliant humourous must see loved it
Oct 15 2018,positive,i tried to post a review earlier but it didnt work so i apologize if this ends up appearing twice anyway i saw venom today and i had a really great time the plot was solid and the villains motive easy to understand it didnt drag out and in fact left me wanting more when i left the theatre    the relationship between eddie and venom is definitely the strongest part of the movie i greatly enjoyed watching their dynamic evolve into what i can only describe as a loving relationship it doesnt feel forced or shoehorned in they have amazing chemistry     if youre on the fence about seeing this movie id ignore the critics and give it a chance superhero movies arent even my thing but i really loved this movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,the critics are wrong on this one the audience is right venom is dark and funny and not cheesy like in spiderman 3 you wont be disappointed this one definitely has cult classic written all over it
Oct 15 2018,positive,its hard to go wrong when you add the talents of tom hardy and riz ahmed to a film this first entry to the venom series is a fun ride through and through although it lacks some of the pop other marvel films thrive on the action keeps you engaged and the characters have purpose and keep you emotionally invested throughout however for a movie called venom i could have used a bit morevenom its a movie that sets you up for more to come at a slower pace than i would have liked its dark and gritty ambiance felt flat for a pg13 rating and could have worked better as an r rated blood bath like deadpool i loved how venom himself felt like a completely separate character and became somewhat of an antihero all in all it was a fun thrill ride to start of the series and i look forward to more 
Oct 15 2018,negative,the movie is the trailer if you are wating for something new this isnt the movie for you it is generic and full oficina expotions
Oct 15 2018,positive,captures the vibe of the comic and the character  funny fastpaced and enjoyable i dont know what these critics expected considering the subject matter shakespeare only criticism is that it seems like they left a fair bit on the cutting room floor  it wasnt overlylong and could have done with an extra few scenes of character interactions and eddievenom getting to know one another 
Oct 15 2018,positive,i was very scared this film was going to be bad because of all the bad reviews by critics but it wasnt bad at all i enjoyed the film and recommend it to old school venom fans like myself obviously not a cinematic masterpiece but as a venom fan i was satisfied 
Oct 15 2018,positive,i tried to post a review earlier but it didnt work so i apologize if this ends up appearing twice anyway i saw venom today and i had a really great time the plot was solid and the villains motive easy to understand it didnt drag out and in fact left me wanting more when i left the theatre    the relationship between eddie and venom is definitely the strongest part of the movie i greatly enjoyed watching their dynamic evolve into what i can only describe as a loving relationship it doesnt feel forced or shoehorned in they have amazing chemistry     if youre on the fence about seeing this movie id ignore the critics and give it a chance superhero movies arent even my thing but i really loved this movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,awesome action pack movie tom hardy nailed it
Oct 15 2018,positive,just good fun and hardy is brilliant
Oct 15 2018,positive,was so good i enjoy an old fashion sony action movie no good for critics excellent for me
Oct 15 2018,neutral,venom is an ok movie to see if youre bored and have nothing else to do it was mildly entertaining at times but has way to many cheesy lines not exactly where i would plan to see tom hardy 
Oct 15 2018,positive,enjoyed the film very much  sooo much better than what the critics reviewed  surprised with the humor and set up of the story  ill see it again with different friends for sure
Oct 15 2018,positive,much better than i expected hardy has a good performance and the writing wasnt terrible i enjoyed it
Oct 15 2018,neutral,not that good but fun would have been better if it was r venom himself was perfect
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie is fun and cool but its flawed as well a film is never perfect and for this the story is weak the third act seemed rush and thats about it
Oct 15 2018,positive,fun comic book film but i think they waited to long to make tom hardy venom
Oct 15 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie the effects were so cool and the interaction between eddievenom eddieanne and eddiedan were great did not expect to enjoy it this much and some parts did gross me out but im definitely going back to see it again
Oct 15 2018,positive,i loved it i was expecting a boring ooo i captured your familyhot girl from workhot girlfriend and if you dont do what i say ill kill you yada yada but this is not the case i was so pleasantly surprised at the ending and i would definitely recommend this to anyone
Oct 15 2018,positive,freaking movie is awesome its a must see 
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie a little slow at first but had to build up to becoming venom i get that cant wait for the next one
Oct 15 2018,positive,last saturday i went to see it  and i really have a blast with this spin off movie the vfx are amazing the soundtrack is fantastic  for be a movie outside of the mcu works out independently at his own they based on the issue of lethal protector i think sony this time nailed replacing the origin of the character  tom hardy is extraordinary with the performance of venom the only problem of the movie i found is the missing of carnage  so i cant wait for the second one
Oct 15 2018,positive,critic reviews dont do the movie justice go make your own opinion i thought it was fantastic and hit all the notes i wanted from a comic book movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,if youre a fan of the comic youll love the movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,best movie i have ever seen funny great animation great action scenes and more this is by far my favorite move i wanted to see it again right after i finished it furthermore i created a rotten tomato account just to write this review
Oct 15 2018,positive,alright listen up i never review movies i do not do this i do not see a point to this and i do not think the effort is worth it that being said this movie has been done so dirty by movie critics that it is my patriotic duty as a gay person from the san fran area to defend it   the primary problem with this movie is that it leads you to believe its an action movie its not thats a lie accept it venom is not the big dumb action movie we deserved it is the big dumb gay romcom that we needed it is yet another blessing of 20gayteen tom hardys acting is stellar as usual some of the other actors are a bit too concerned about the events of the movie to fully channel san fran but thats alright venom was always going to be a difficult character to translate to the big screen but overall they did a pretty bangup job   also any movie critics who say that venom is in desperate need of a stronger attachment to spiderman need to read the actual comics because eddie and the symbiote are married they have a kid fake nerd boys are always getting everything wrong   i would also like to add that the cgi in this movie was incredible serious kudos how long did that take  tldr venom was gay i mean great and fabulous movie critics need to shut up and actually judge movies on the proper criteria and the most unrealistic part of this was that people in san fransisco would allow big pharma to move in and sign up for clinical trials   source to prove im right im gay and from san fransisco
Oct 15 2018,positive,i went in with all of the bad reviews in the back of my head and was a bit scared expected disappointment but ended up loving it the action scenes are nothing new and floating head thing should have been done another way but the humor and the inner goofy dialogue so made up for it it did show venoms humor and goofyness and like always tom hardy did a great job
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie turned out to be a thrilling yet entertainingly funny picture its enjoyable for all comic book fans and has just the right amount of darkness to capture the minds of the more expecting audiences it could of been a bit longer with more venom planet origin footage and also more of the other symbiotes in action a bit sooner but all in all quite enjoyable a sluggish first half in addition to no word or mention of tom holland at all but im kind of glad spider man did not make a cameo in this stand alone venom picture it defyd they audiences pressures to have tom in it making the viewer focus and enjoy more of that awesome venom carnage we were hoping for
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing the quality of it was amazing and it was so funny as a new marvel fan this made me love venom himself even more dont listen to the critics i have no idea what they are talking about
Oct 15 2018,positive,god damn that was much better than i expected slower start but second half and especially the ending were perfect hell it was even funny i genuinely laughed  not a loud nose exhale really laughed no forced humor like for example in sw tlj loved tom hardy loved venoms voice for casual comic books film fan 55
Oct 15 2018,positive,love tom hardy the movie was surprisingly funny cant wait until the next one definitely need to see at the theater 
Oct 15 2018,positive,very entertaining movie with a couple plot holes great acting by tom hardy absolutely ignore the critics and watch this one
Oct 15 2018,positive,the best movie ever dont see why people rated it 1
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie i enjoyed it nothing wrong with it to me
Oct 15 2018,negative,wow that movie was terrible  wasnt that pretty much the same as every alien horror film ever made  ugh  ive lived every marvel movie except this one
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing movie tom hardy did so great
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie had great action the special effects were great and a movie about a everyday joe turning into a monster was interesting 
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved the movie definitely going to see it again good job hardy cant wait to see a sequel
Oct 15 2018,positive,several plot holes related to the symbiotes didnt really buy into the romantic relationship seemed like it was forced motorcycle chase sequence was pretty cool 
Oct 15 2018,positive,was expecting a terrible film based on critics reviews but me and brother saw it opening night on thursday night and to our surprise it was a load of fun it was not a perfect film but for the relationship between eddie and venom was the best part of the film
Oct 15 2018,positive,not sure what movie the critics was watching we enjoyed it
Oct 15 2018,positive,so suprising goodactioni did enjoy itexcellent
Oct 15 2018,positive,i dont understand the critics here go see the movie for yourself and you will enjoy it especially if you are someone who likes movies based on comic book characters the dialogue between eddie and venom is one of the best parts of the movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,i liked it could have explored the symbiote back story more
Oct 15 2018,positive,awesome film tom hardy is again able to demonstrate the multiple sides to a persons psychi in a way that makes him endearing and likeable the parasite is comical and the partnership between venom and hardys character is entertaining laughter could be heard in the cinema great balance of comedy and action all in all its a cross between the comedy of deadpool one not two as that was poor and spider mans dedication a must see watch im off to watch it again
Oct 15 2018,positive,this is the type of fresh superhero movie with a great structure every other movie of this genre should have it as an example tom hardy is incredible in this role
Oct 15 2018,positive,a lot of fun to watch
Oct 15 2018,positive,not a bad movie as many makes you belive but defiantly not a bad movie it could have done somethings better specially the beginning as it feels that it drags too much in the first act however after that the movie starts to get good and good soemthing to have in mind if you want to watch this this is not your daddys venom he read in old comics nor this is the same venom you saw in the cartoons  this is a unique take on venom that could have done better but it certainly pay off for trying to come up with something new while respecting the old
Oct 15 2018,positive,while unfortunately its a missed opportunity with the comic origin that we all know and love its a great original story and left me wanting more
Oct 15 2018,positive,it was good im a huge venom fan and maximum carnage one of my fav comics so im very excited about bonus scene as for movie i did not believe the chemistry between broc and anneother than that its fun funny and action leaves you wanting more
Oct 15 2018,positive,as i had to wait a week extra to watch it as i was working all week when it came out and was watching all the bad reviews flood in am thinking god what have i just pre booked my ticket for yes the script is all over the place due to the fact sony see  signs and rush everything and wonder why they get backlash or not on the same level as mcu this was a fun movie even without spiderman the thing that saved it from being compared to f4 or the amazing spiderman 2 was the actors tom hardy  riz ahmed who i loved in ill manors who looked and worked like they wanted this movie to be the next best thing and had passion within it going forward if mcu keep spiderman on another contract i hope disney and sony can come to a agreement where they can help each others universes and do it for the fans and not the  signs that comes when the films right    chris james
Oct 15 2018,negative,just another fake marvel movie showing why only the marvel studios should be trusted with bringing comics to real life    this movie was not horrible but just fell short in just about every way of how good it could have been with a more creative driver leading it there were multiple cringeworthy moments in the movie and so much potental wasted i found myself wonder how it could have been if marvel mdae it and not song before it was even over
Oct 15 2018,positive,best movie of sony pictures
Oct 15 2018,positive,its not good but there are parts that are really good fight scenes are often well done with great special effects though the final fight in particular is surprisingly bad venom is funny with a dark sense of humor which meshes well with this version of the character as well as with tom hardys eddy brock its a different take on both characters and the bad editing really muddles what could have been great they seem to have expanded venoms power set somewhat which is fun to watch but contradicts itself in a few minor places venom bites off a few heads but always off screen so as to maintain the pg13 rating and the violence is mostly punching and throwing if you dont mind waiting 25 minutes to see him get the symbiote its a fun action movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,i absolutely loved vemon its nearly a 2hour film and i could of watched more hope theres vemon 2
Oct 15 2018,positive,this was a great movie the action was there the characters were well defined and i found it easy to follow i recommend seeing it in real3d for that extra pop some of the trailers left ma a little confused because they showed many of the scenes out of order but when have trailers not done that luckily the trailers dont give away all the excitement of the movie i actually hope they make additional movies for venom id definitely go see them
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved this movie the action was great venom and eddie were so likable
Oct 15 2018,negative,tom hardy is the only positive in this bland dull movie with a bad villain terrible dialogue and sub par cgi
Oct 15 2018,negative,the critics are right about this movie that is all
Oct 15 2018,positive,very good 1010 would watch again
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing movie dont let the critics fool you into thinking it is not
Oct 15 2018,positive,saw this movie with my 11yearold son we both loved it  i dont understand why the critics gave it such a harsh rap 
Oct 15 2018,neutral,this is a fun movie i was entertained throughout most of the movie if that was my bar this would be pretty good  but it isnt i ask myself a few questions  will i care about this movie six months from now  no ill never see this movie intentionally again  will anything in this movie be relevant in any nonvenom related movie no i dont think so  if i like venom from the comics which i do will i get anything from this no this isnt venom from the comics its just shares some imagery but not really much in terms of behavior motivations or anything else that i recognize from the comics  if i could only see one movie this or infinity war which would i see infinity war  ok this or ragnarok ragnarok  ok this or doctor strange doctor strange  ok this or iron fist season 2 iron fist season 2  ok this or iron fist season 1  oooh harder i would have chosen iron fist season 1 but id have been wrong     so there we go if youre going to see all of the comic book movies watch this one its fun  if you have a limit to how many movies you or your family members are willing to see skip this one spend your time on something better
Oct 15 2018,positive,definitely not perfect takes a while to build up to venom and thats the only part youll care about as a viewer the relationship with the girlfriend is inconsistent and that wouldnt be a problem if that wasnt a big part of eddies drive in the film however what makes it great is the title character himself when venom is on screen he really steals the show and i dont even mean tom hardys performance which also steals the show and some of the best scenes are him and venom interacting venom was very entertaining to watch and was very charismatic the animation on him was very impressive was well considering you have to see it so much it really had weight to it and you could feel the pounding of his steps showing his sheer strength action scenes are great but in the dark too much which sucks because venom is black the villain is very weak and has conflicting motives but it gives an excuse for a fight scene so it didnt bother me as much as it should have
Oct 15 2018,positive,as a venom fan i really enjoyed the movie as a movie snob i could pick a few wonky choices but ultimately id see it again venoms portrayal was awesome
Oct 15 2018,negative,a thrown together mess it has some fun action moments but its pretty forgettable
Oct 15 2018,positive,mostly enjoyed it tom hardyvenom is the only thing good left standing from it though
Oct 15 2018,positive,2 things  at the end of this film venom is basically a good guy which is bull shit  also the heel turn venom pulls is very quick to come about  felt like there was 20 min of dialog missing from this movie  shit script writing
Oct 15 2018,positive,i enjoyed the hell out of it the banter between the two was extremely different from what you normally think of with those two but to me it worked amazingly
Oct 15 2018,positive,i think its a fun movie to watch but it has many flaws which make it hard to keep track what type of movie it wants to be  it feels like a comedy tries to be a action and feels like bad drama
Oct 15 2018,negative,it started off well and then went in the wrong direction it was like watching the original teenage mutant ninja turtles trilogy in succession i would not recommend and am not interested in a sequal unless big changes are made
Oct 15 2018,positive,really entertaining and exciting action great start for a non hero movie i hope it blends with the rest of the marvel universe at some point
Oct 15 2018,positive,an entertaining movie didnt go in expecting very much but tom hardy really knocked this one out a lot of the scenes were just pure fun will absolutely watch again
Oct 15 2018,positive,overall a good movie  venom not so much
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing movie and im not a massive fan of tom hardy
Oct 15 2018,neutral,there is no disagreeing that this is a bad movie with a terrible third act but what has it going for it is tom hardy his performance in both venom  eddie brock cement this movie as an okay watch with some funny interactions between the two characters
Oct 15 2018,positive,absolutely brilliantsome of the scenes so so silky
Oct 15 2018,positive,listen i entered the theater with no expectations and i had a blast watching it its not the best movie by any means but if youre a fan its worth your money    only regret it shouldve been an r rated movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,100 gay super gay love it with whole my heart pls make it even more gay thanks 
Oct 15 2018,positive,really good moviewho cares that is missing with spider man btw there is one it i i have enough with the purist of comics tom hardy is great and the jokes are not so forced as in last jedi or some other marvel movies
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom has its flaws but i think a likable protagonist and a surprisingly likable psychopath symbiote the im kind of a loser too speech before the final battle really made me want to root for him even despite the murderousness lol make this movie into an overall fun movie experience  im looking forward to the sequel
Oct 15 2018,positive,brilliant film tom hardy played his role very well
Oct 15 2018,positive,story could have been more drawn output together doesnt take away from the fun and fast action mixed in with some humor that hardy delivers quite modestly as venom scares the heck out of him cgi isnt as bad as everybody says though probably could have been better a fun ride that doesnt over complicate itself or take its self too seriously if you dont mind that which i usually do in movies watch it without expectations of it being something great and enjoy what it has to offer and not how much better it most likely could have been
Oct 15 2018,positive,absolutely loved it cant wait for carnage
Oct 15 2018,positive,dont go into it expecting another marvel superhero movie its its own thing the move really picked up once eddie and venom bond that is expected because it is an origin movie no its not an oscar contended but you will enjoy this movie if your into comic book adaptations
Oct 15 2018,positive,not what i expected but in a good way  i dont want to give any spoilers but i went in expecting a spiderman movie with no spiderman but got a fun action buddy cop movie  i would watch it again and if the sequel does manage to become a thing i will for sure watch it  dont let the bad critic score keep you away  it is worth seeing in theaters
Oct 15 2018,positive,its nice to see venom on screen again what it lacks in your average comic book writing and depth of emotion it makes up for the use of special effects in action sequences  venom is made for kids and my hopes for spidermanvenom movies is to be made for adults where kids want to watch it and know it doesnt have to be rrated  dark knight trilogy anyone  i like the idea of tom hardy as venom but dont find woody harrelson as carnage appealing but maybe he played the character too kiddish  a better choice in my mind would be jackie earle haley watchmen
Oct 15 2018,positive,stop saying venom is a bad movie because all i hear is bullshit and im sick of your bullshit all the reasons you have to hate venom are silly intended because im suing you for calling it silly no spiderman good turd in the wind great the action amazing best movie i have ever seen and im a huge marvel mostly movies fan and please make a venom 2 or my life is ending  and as a marvel comics fan who read lethal protector and other venom series this movie made me really really happy but hearing people talking shit about it makes me really really mad i know everyone has their own opinion and bleh but your opinion is wrong ok venom hasnt wronged you in anyway please appreciate it for the amazing movie it is im dying i need a venom 2 soon
Oct 15 2018,positive,outstanding performance of hardy and venom is the first different superhero movie i ever watch in my life  this flim is outstandinggo nd watch venom with the avoidance of the critic reviews
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom is tough to mess up  ok movie with a great protagonist  left me wanting more venom  make a sequel and i will certainly see it
Oct 15 2018,positive,while the start of the movie was slow it turned into a funny and enjoyable almost romcom and i hope to see more
Oct 15 2018,negative,this movie wouldve been fire if it came out in 2005
Oct 15 2018,positive,seriously who trusts critics anymore
Oct 15 2018,positive,a solid movie with great performances and entertaining scenes the talking scenes between eddie and venom are by far the best the action sequences are some good some bad the fight in the house or the chase scene are good the swat scene and final battle agnst riot are bad riot is in this so little even carlson drake himself is more interesting than riot the romance is terrible the final battle is really anticlimatic but tom hardy as both eddie and venom carries this movie fun entertainment
Oct 15 2018,positive,its nice to see venom on screen again what it lacks in your average comic book writing and depth of emotion it makes up for the use of special effects in action sequences  venom is made for kids and my hopes for spidermanvenom is to be made for adults where kids want to watch it and know it doesnt have to be rrated  dark knight triology anyone  i like the idea of tom hardy as venom but dont find woody harrelson as carnage to be attractive cast but maybe he played it to kiddish  a better choice in my mind would be jackie earle haley watchmen
Oct 15 2018,positive,a subpar movie that tries a little too hard to follow the formula set by superhero movies and anyone who has ready the comics would know that venom is most certainly not a superhero
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie i cant wait to see spiderman and venom in the future stay to the end of the movie 
Oct 15 2018,positive,the critics have it all wrong venom was an amazing movie they obviously didnt understand the complexity that is venom go see it
Oct 15 2018,positive,its not massively original or groundbreaking but it was very entertaining and funny  the audience we watched with enjoyed every minute  we nearly didnt go because of the bad reviews but then various people recommended it so we went and glad we did  four stars
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie differs greatly from the comics but that isnt necessarily a bad thing in comics multiple universes is a common thing and each universe is either slightly different or very different from the main universe in which we see in the comics so venom is just an alternate universe where riot isnt just a minor character but rather a powerful enemy so once my friends understood it as an alternate universe they enjoyed a lot more than if i didnt explain it i had to use a rick and morty reference to help them understand
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved it funny suspenseful will buy it when it is available  more please
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing movie worth the money and time watching it
Oct 15 2018,positive,this movie was amazing it seems to be based of off two comics that ive read venom the lethal protecter and planet of the symbiotes venom is so badass and so cool again this movie was amazing dont listen to any critics who rate it badly
Oct 15 2018,positive,exhilarating and top notch acting by tom hardy
Oct 15 2018,negative,silly boring and nonsense better wait to stream it on netflix once its available or rent it dont even bother in buying the dvdbluray edition
Oct 15 2018,positive,the film sets out to be a good fun action film and it succeeds in being just that thats okay tom hardy is fantastic as eddy brock and his interactions with venom are the highlights of the film the villain is clique but it kinda works for this film however it would have been more interesting if he was a bit more complex but i will admit that the film feels like scenes were cut and i am positive the film was going to be r rated this is because there are times when characters go through an entire arc and we dont see it just the before and after also the film is shot a way to show the gore but cut away last second most pg13 films shoot those scenes at different angles to hint at the action venom just cuts away at the last second to the next shot but in the end i enjoyed this film it wasnt the film i was thinking i was going to see but it was a fun film nonetheless
Oct 15 2018,positive,tomato meter must be broken because this movie was pretty damn good   
Oct 15 2018,positive,really good movie tom hardy plays a really good venom
Oct 15 2018,positive,the actions scenes were well done and venomeddie came off as endearing
Oct 15 2018,positive,love it forget the critics watch it 
Oct 15 2018,positive,we seem to be living in an era where professional critics are widely out of touch with general audiences  this was a fun movie with good action memorable characters and an interesting plot  its got its problems but it a good time and i enjoyed it
Oct 15 2018,positive,i dont really understand why this film is getting such negative reviews from the critics its a fun action movie with a good storyline and humor venom kept me gripped from beginning to end and tom hardy is excellent in it and really brings the character to life just because a marvel movie isnt in the current mcu doesnt make it a bad movie
Oct 15 2018,positive,i dont know what these people are thinking the movie was great to me was it a perfect movie no but it was a good movie the cgi was great the interactions between eddie and venom were awesome the action and fight scenes were epic and there was a fair amount of comedy and head eating in it so i enjoyed it
Oct 15 2018,positive,action packed and some gold humour 
Oct 15 2018,positive,it must be a very sad life for critics they lack the common intelligence to any kind of imagination of creativity so its easy for them to be haters and it sucks to be one because they cant and dont know how to enjoy an entertaining movie we all loved this movie 
Oct 15 2018,positive,was a solid movie the critics have had too much bad opinion juice
Oct 15 2018,positive,the movie is genius
Oct 15 2018,negative,character assassination
Oct 15 2018,positive,do not listen to critics this movie is superb the special effects are incredible it has a very very big budget the authors are perfect this is one of the best movies i do not understand why so many negative reviews frankly you have not seen to put such low notes
Oct 15 2018,positive,was doubtful about seeing the movie after poor critics reviews but boy they got it wrong watched it in 4dx a great experience even my wife enjoyed it despite not being a big fan of actioncomics movies herself a bit moody silly and dark humorous but in the right ways provides good contrast to usual superhero movies but still doesnt feel out of place in marvel universe look forward to seeing part 2 in the future
Oct 15 2018,positive,dont get why this movie had alot of bad critic reviews everyone iv spoke to loves it as do i
Oct 15 2018,positive,it was great this is one of my favorite movies of the year 
Oct 15 2018,negative,once again another cartoon piece of crap with all the money gone into cgi effects and no script 
Oct 15 2018,positive,so sad to see the critics score of 31 for venom as it was nowhere near that bad ive given it a generous 4 stars i would say if it was possible to give 375 stars i would as this film deserves 75 suicide squad 2016 got 28 are critics actually saying this was only 3 better than the dreadful suicide squad venom was funny and completely captivating throughout and tom hardy was again brilliant i hope it happens and if it does i look forward to the sequel
Oct 15 2018,positive,i have never cared about critics ever and im not going to start now  it was fun
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom was a well done film to those who have nothing good to say please just stop posting ok you was probably not brought with the spider universe this adaptation of venom was well done the special effects was awesome i enjoyed the quarrels between venom and eddie especially with his love life im hoping for a sequel
Oct 15 2018,positive,i enjoyed how they brought these characters to life and cant wait for things ti come 
Oct 15 2018,positive,ok animation not so great dialogue and short fight scenes but still very funny and when they do fight its very cool
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie probably could of been better dont understand critics destroying it its just a fun nobrainer comic book movie 
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing movie had the perfect mix of dark humor and action tom hardy played a pretty good venom in my opinion
Oct 15 2018,positive,really fun movie to watch
Oct 15 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this film is a blast
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing100 percent recount great movie and the post credit scene made it even better
Oct 15 2018,positive,venom itself and most of tom hardy saves this movie from being boring and wasteful at least something was done right in this wildly paced film
Oct 15 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie it didnt take it self too serious im glad they didnt go dceu dark 
Oct 15 2018,negative,no reflection on tom hardy but this sucked
Oct 15 2018,positive,really good visual effects were amazing and more funny than i thought it would be but just the right amount so it doesnt destroy the feeling
Oct 15 2018,positive,critics graded this movie harshly largely because they dont understand the comic or the characters and because of the mcu ownership of spiderman they decided to distance themselves from the spiderman origin of the character causing a lot of comic fans to rate it harshly but this film is a blast to watch and though given the immense amount of information to convey in the short frame of the movie not a ton of true character building was done but enough to give you everything you needed to see what drives the main character and the plot so i and many other enjoy this hilarious and at times dark but exciting action flick
Oct 15 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish it was also funny im  excited for the second one
Oct 15 2018,positive,tons of fun great take on character and content 
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved this movietom hardys performance is very impressivethe villain in the end is a little undesirable but it is still a good watch
Oct 15 2018,positive,really loved the movie the humor and the progress of the movie is quite interesrting take on my point of view really recommend to watch this
Oct 15 2018,positive,yeah it has the typical marvel plot line but it also seems fresh and raw with a spin on the time honored super hero theme plus its nice to see demons can be friends too
Oct 15 2018,positive,amazing im in love with tom hardy
Oct 15 2018,positive,as much as i love the character this movie fleshes him out pretty well i loved every moment with venom and eddy brock a wonderful popcorn flick
Oct 15 2018,positive,the critics most be on something to really hate this movie this movie was awesome time flew watching this movie 
Oct 15 2018,positive,love the movie great action and portrayal from tom hardy as venom
Oct 15 2018,positive,unpopular opinion i liked venom tom hardy has a great talent though not always well complimented by michelle williams the movie has action comedy and a few startles here and there maybe not the movie of the year but i genuinely enjoyed it
Oct 15 2018,positive,pretty good it seemed a bit rushed on the story line though
Oct 15 2018,positive,fucking amazing these critic scores are completely shit it was perfect
Oct 15 2018,positive,great movie funny and entertaining 
Oct 15 2018,positive,it was a really fun movie to watch
Oct 14 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie cant wait for a sequel 
Oct 14 2018,positive,i like that marvel takes the time to explore their characters in origin movies i understand the critics score but this was really entertaining i think critics should weight the entertainment factor of movies a little higher or they risk losing credibility i consider their score when deciding on a movie but if the critics pan it and the fans love it with some limited exceptions i go with the fan score in this case i am definitely looking forward to more of venom 
Oct 14 2018,positive,awsome movieaction packed
Oct 14 2018,positive,awesome movie tom hardy is badass n venom actions n movements is on point 
Oct 14 2018,positive,not as bad as critics says it is
Oct 14 2018,negative,visuals were great but story was very sporadic cant tell if it was bad writing or bad editing
Oct 14 2018,positive,i thought this movie was great but if u are looking from a comic book view i can see why some people are disappointed in the movie 
Oct 14 2018,positive,the movie is very good
Oct 14 2018,negative,wtf i dont know what i was expecting but it wasnt a lost 90s van damme flick seriously though the first 3040 mins of this movie was just bad then all of a sudden it gets bad and funny with a bunch of action that while it wants to be more robocop than lets be cops but ends up being the reverse still what can be expected of a pg13 venom movie aside from its a sort of dumb  dumber meets the punisher corps also this flick was clearly brought you by the product most placed within it tatertot mmmm thats oreida to me    final verdict its a good time and to say ts as fun to watch as it is competently forgettable is to call it what it is a modern superhero movie so do yourself a favor and be sure not to think too well at all about whats actually going on cause well its painfully stupid so why dont we call it what it is dumb  venomer
Oct 14 2018,positive,im all for venom and tom hardy but would have liked a better made movie  good starting point for future movies as you have the right cast they just needed something better to work with
Oct 14 2018,positive,if you are true spiderman fan you will enjoy watching this movie i know when it was over i was wanting to see it all over again it has tons of comedy and action i had not laughed out loud i a movie theather in a while
Oct 14 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one its way better than they are giving it credit for loved it
Oct 14 2018,positive,critics can go screw themselves this was an enjoyable fast paced and funny movie they managed to make a great venom while remaining devorced from spiderman i adored venoms personality and how it changed and adapted the longer he and eddie were bonded and vice versa i look forward to a venom 2
Oct 14 2018,positive,dont believe the critics on this one its one of the best movies ive seen all year 45 stars
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was awesome very good story  funny
Oct 14 2018,positive,i had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised
Oct 14 2018,positive,cgi not up to avengers but it was funny and interesting hope to see another
Oct 14 2018,positive,i honestly dont know why this movie is getting such a harsh treamtment from critics i can honestly say i had a great time with this movie the effects look great and the overall look of venom himself is fantastic and while yeah this movie is not perfect my main critisim being that the bad guy is a bit boring and generic as well as his motivations  that being said this movie is incredibly fun and had me smiling the whole time solid 4 out of 5 for me
Oct 14 2018,positive,decent overall reason for the 5 star rating is to counter act horrible critic  reviews was weird  seeing a venom movie without spider man but the spider man has so many parallel universes that  seeing one  were  eddie get the venom symbiote without the web crawler wasnt   to far fetch all in all good movie cheesy humor symbiote battle
Oct 14 2018,positive,very good heart pounding action movie tom hardy is the perfect guy for this marvel character 
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie was amazing  i cant wait to see more of venom 
Oct 14 2018,positive,i dont know why anyone would insist on this being a pg13 movie venom without gory violence isnt venom otherwise pretty good
Oct 14 2018,positive,hilarious cheesy and at times genredefying
Oct 14 2018,positive,worth paying to see 
Oct 14 2018,positive,i thought it was hilarious and im glad it was because we all know venom is much more gruesome in the comics but i like funny better but the only thing wrong with it is its a too fast paced movie rather from that i loved it
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie go see for yourself dont let other people tell you how you should feel about something especially any form of art
Oct 14 2018,positive,this is a wonderful movie it kept my attention from start to ending and im the type to fall asleep during a movie love it
Oct 14 2018,positive,ok so its not shakespeare or even deadpool but tom hardy nails the antihero and its fun to watch
Oct 14 2018,positive,hardy makes eddie brock into a delightfully pathetic protagonist
Oct 14 2018,positive,did a good job with braking him from spider series loved the movie grew reading spider from the 80s up movie was epic cant wait the next one with cletus
Oct 14 2018,positive,i love the style of humour and the visuals are amazing given the amount of time they game themselves cant wait to see spiderman into the spiderverse
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie is getting slaughtered by critics who are disconnected from audiences it reminded me of the era of great action films in the vein of spawn or the blade films the ones that arent garbage and it was a breath of fresh air in a time when all super heroes are prim proper and tailored to sell toys to children there werent any annoying token characters the plot set up an interesting story that i hope they expand on and the action was violent and weighty     do yourself a favor and go see it
Oct 14 2018,positive,not one of the great super hero movies but it is very entertaining and something different  looking forward to more
Oct 14 2018,positive,couldnt stop smiling and loving this film lots of good one liners and the action i craved good casting mooorree
Oct 14 2018,positive,awesome movie dont understand the bad critics reviews
Oct 14 2018,positive,one of the best comic book movies of the year this movie kept my interest throughout the movie good acting and good story
Oct 14 2018,positive,it started off slow but once it picked up it flowed nicely lots of funny moments and action
Oct 14 2018,positive,the critics are a bunch of self entitled yuppies who think their opinion matters more than yours at the end of the day i dont really care what they think it was a wildly entertaining movie and im really looking forward to the next 2 and i will cough up the money to see them when they theater release
Oct 14 2018,positive,first off i want to say shame on you to the critics for the role and based on the settings and situation that eddie brock was in through out the movie tom hardy captured it effortlessly the movies action was fun to watch also i thought the humor between venom and eddie was on point a lot of these critics have trashed these theee aspects of the movie some critics are familiar with a certain genre and critique it very well others are more familiar with artsy movies like american beauty and will use that knowledge to critique movies outside of their realm this was different for tom hardy so do t expect it to be like bronson go see venom for what it is and it will impress you
Oct 14 2018,positive,good blend of humor and action this movie was able to take venom out of the spider man universe and make it its own dont listen to paid podcasts or critics go watch it yourself 
Oct 14 2018,positive,could have done better but wasnt bad 
Oct 14 2018,positive,not bad boring at some points and has pacing issues at times
Oct 14 2018,positive,very fun film to watch not super good but pretty good to watch
Oct 14 2018,positive,best movie in a long time amazing
Oct 14 2018,positive,what saves venom from being a total failure is tom hardy and a few short moments of cleverness the comedic moments brought some air to the constant biting we never really get the chance to dive in the movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,the critics were really incompetent when rating venom fun good plot spot on acting from hardy what more can we ask for we are venom
Oct 14 2018,positive,eddie and venom are funny but everything else are sucks
Oct 14 2018,positive,pretty good i liked this movie my wife wanted to see it and i wasnt that excited about it but in glad i saw it in theatres i also learned a bit more about venom as the character i was expecting a movie like the one they did for spiderman 3 but this movie was awesome good acting and action i like the venom character
Oct 14 2018,positive,in my top 5 of favourite movies i really enjoyed the movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,story is thin but definitely entertaining
Oct 14 2018,positive,wow are the critics totally wrong  my family loved it and the theater audience loved it  when people leave the theater saying i cant wait for the sequel apparently it was well received
Oct 14 2018,positive,i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie i loved it the critics giving it a bad review should just be used as snacks for venom
Oct 14 2018,positive,the movie is entertaining tom hardy and venoms relationship is the strongest part of the movie but the way that hardy delivers some of the dialogue sounds kind of cringe carlton drake is a very cliched one dimensional villain that isnt threatening at all michelle williams had nothing interesting to do in the movie  i felt that the movie took too long to get to the venom parts but after that the ending felt very rushed  venoms weird sense of humor might be the best part of the movie  overall the movie was an entertaining popcorn flick but very forgettable
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom is a fantastic film nothing like the critics said
Oct 14 2018,positive,it not that bad  full of action and comedy
Oct 14 2018,positive,i thought this movie was going to be garbage but its really not i like it a lot wished it was longer though in my opinion venom is way better than black panther
Oct 14 2018,positive,you see this is what i wanted from sony theyve always did a good job at marvel movies but critics these days dont seem to be smart enough to see it cringe worthy cgi it wasnt even that bad
Oct 14 2018,negative,the only thing that could have made this movie worse is if quavo from the migos made the soundtrack
Oct 14 2018,positive,the chemistry between venom and eddie epic action scenes and the duel with riot more than make up for the first 30 minutes bland ceo villain and boring lab scenes my personal movie of the year that didnt turn out to be straight bad
Oct 14 2018,negative,i ended up going to see venom with my best friend since we both love marvel films and after the film i never truly understood the take on the film there is a lot of different aspects towards the film and the plot was horrible i thought that venom would have given me a great storyline and drive but in the end the movie was just all over the place and didnt keep me intrigued or on my toes like most action films
Oct 14 2018,positive,this was an action packed fun movie its exactly what youd expect from the character venom and tom hardy did his thang if youre looking for a deep thought provoking story line you will not want to go to this thrill ride 
Oct 14 2018,neutral,wacky bullshit on par with transformers in taking something from source and ripping out only what executives think sells to the masses vs the fans  it succeeded money wise in a lack of competition but will its followup be like the amazing spiderman two and done  it could have been either a good body horror movie or just a slap stick comedy but not both nor a faithful attempt  good on sony for tricking and treating their own version for now
Oct 14 2018,neutral,good movie for the weekend but not marvels at its best
Oct 14 2018,positive,super entertaining loved it
Oct 14 2018,positive,funny in its own way only quite disappointing too see tom hardys performance in this movie which is a bit sluggish and lowering expectations for its fans however a fun easy and enjoyable movie to watch with the gimmicks of supervillain changing to do good for the marvel world
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom breaks largely from the source material but manages to hang on to the antihero aspect of venom comics the cgi is mostly second rate and the film relies heavily on it the story itself isnt entirely forced and the interaction between venom and tom hardy seems somewhat natural
Oct 14 2018,positive,hilarious and fun depiction of the infamous duo of symbiote and brock fantastic cast following a story thats as colorful and vivacious as the comics
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie goes to show that critics have no real sense about what makes a movie good i went into this extremely skeptical and while the first half hour seems to slightly drag it really picks up and you realize that the slow burn was well worth the wait cant wait to see what is in store for the rest of the series
Oct 14 2018,positive,enjoyed it a lot not sure why critics hated it
Oct 14 2018,positive,good action and really funny
Oct 14 2018,positive,after years of visiting rotten tomatoes for reviews i finally had to make an account and say what the hell are the critics talking about i mean look dont get me wrong venom is not anywhere near the cinematic masterpiece that dark knight and logan were but it is in no way a bad movie venom is the movie that you watch because you want to have a good time and it absolutely delivers in that sense the beginning of the movie made a decent yet somewhat slow attempt at character building however after that it was just a roller coaster ride of explosions monstrous heroism and nostalgic 90s cliches overall this movie is at worse a 7 out of 10 but nothing lower this movie was fun makes you laugh and i will probably go see it a second time critics were wrong on this one
Oct 14 2018,positive,first to start off on a side note you mean to tell me there are superior reviewers my ass nohody is a superior critic their opinion does not matter    anyhow venom its a guilty pleasure for everyone nonetheless tom hardys he best part of the entire film the humor and comedy aspects work and are funny the action is okay but when you see venom and he moments you have with him are fun and enjoyable now the editing cinematography pacing a overall plot is garbage and the cg is a bit and miss in a few places what people complain about i dont have issues with content wise and etc what people dont talk about i have issues with i personally loved this film and i will without a doubt buy this on dvd i look forward to the sequel but please for the love of god sony get a new director and especially new writers for the sequel
Oct 14 2018,positive,we enjoyed watching this movie not a dull moment i would recommend it
Oct 14 2018,positive,a masterpiece what spawn should have been the only thing rotten about this movie are the tomatoes being thrown at it  a terrific and exciting film with intense cinematic substance venom looks and sounds astonishing backed by the performance and acting brilliance of his actor hardy is an ingenious choice for this bravo
Oct 14 2018,positive,after reading rottens rating and having lowered expectations i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was actually quite enjoyable for me it had the right amount of filler  and also wasnt painful to sit through it captured  maintained my attention even while low on sleep also had alot of action  some good comical relief i dont understand why rotten tomatoes gave such a negative rating
Oct 14 2018,positive,ok it aint citizen kane but this is a totally enjoyable movie  tom hardy was the perfect fit for eddie brock and the internal battle for control with the symbiote is excellently portrayed  plot holes  a few but they seem like nitpicking next to the realization of the character  will see again and purchase the blu ray
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie was simply amazing and i would see it many times again
Oct 14 2018,positive,the movie was absolutely phenomenal one of my favourite movies to date im not sure why it was given such awful reviews by critics 95 of the people ive talked to have agreed that the movie was fantastic
Oct 14 2018,positive,introduction movie of a marvel character so as it goes these type of movies are not great because they all have a certain flow to them a sort of checklist of things that have to occur not bad not great
Oct 14 2018,positive,while venom doesnt quite go down the horror path that was teased in the promos it does work quite well as an actioncomedy the cast are all good and i got a few laughs out of the eddie brockvenom buddy movie dynamic overall i enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,positive,scenes involving venomeddie brock were very entertaining and the best part of the film  everything else not so much  villain was horrific cgi was questionable and the story and characters that werent our title characters were complete nonentities  wasnt expecting much but at the least it wasnt outright terrible had bright spots among the forgettable overall film
Oct 14 2018,positive,admittedly the intial setup for this movie is a little bland and boring eddie coming across as the usual egodriven jackass journalist but almost immediately after the timeskip hes shown to be a genuinely sweet caring guy who makes me wanna root for him even when he does stupid shit enter venom and the entire movie goes from zero to sixty becoming hysterically funny and oddly sweet by turns dan is a genuinely nice dude who wants to help anne is a kickass voice of reason venoms entire character is delightfully rideordie with eddie pretty much an hour after meeting him and eddie never falls into the awful jealous exboyfriend trope he genuinely cares about anne and her happiness apologizes for betraying her trust and honestly talks venom who is hilariously invested in their relationship down from trying to win anne back because dan makes her happy and he genuinely likes the guy as well 1210 would definitely recommend
Oct 14 2018,positive,way better than i thought it would be dark humor and it totally worked without spiderman
Oct 14 2018,positive,ok so first offits not the caliber of avengersinfinity war but then again what other super hero movies really are the style of the movie reminds me of superhero movies that came out 15 or so years ago which isnt bad i enjoyed the moviefrom tom hardys bumbling characterto the ridiculous nature of some of the plot to the banter and joking back and forth between venom and eddie brock it looks like sony has a good 1st movie in their marvel spiderverse
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was pretty good although it wasnt action packed enough some parts were pretty chessy but it was still good
Oct 14 2018,positive,i thought its was funny and a great start for us to see more of what he has to offer more like before movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,great action scenes and story line
Oct 14 2018,positive,lets be honest we went in to see a sonymarvel movie i watched it expecting to see absolute garbage and what i got was a legitimately funny kind of buddy cop movie the main character was odd and unrelatable at times but that endorsed how he was a loser once i realised that everything came together and became very enjoyable i just wish the villain died sooner he monologued way too much i wanted him to die so hed stop talking
Oct 14 2018,negative,pure garbage  the worst of the marvel super hero films to date
Oct 14 2018,neutral,effects were ok story was par chemistry was bland
Oct 14 2018,positive,amazing movie just shows how out of touch critics are 
Oct 14 2018,positive,i wasnt expecting this movie to be different from all comic and hero movies  since this is an antihero well i could say this is soft deadpool and im not into comedies and i found this really funny to watch thank sonymarvel for making something good out of this cant wait to see an sequel
Oct 14 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,positive,a great change of tone from the other marvel movies cant wait to see more from venom
Oct 14 2018,positive,it really is a great movie not including spiderman didnt hurt this movie at all it honestly helped it it process that this movie can stand by itself without the help of other super heros this is definitely a movie to go see
Oct 14 2018,negative,terrible movie bad acting cheap explosions poor writing  it took half the movie till venom even became a thing tom hardy does a bad american accent his character was stupid and got the consequences that he deserved the relationship with his girlfriend was not believable she leaves him at the first hint of trouble and then comes back after hes infected by an alien do not waste your time or money on this steaming turd
Oct 14 2018,positive,i absolutely love this movie the big reviewers are just cowards
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved the humor i also really enjoyed the action
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie is better than most superhero movies ive seen forget about the critics just go see it
Oct 14 2018,positive,very fun venom will only get better
Oct 14 2018,positive,fans of venom know what the critics here dont eddie brock is the soul that understands venom best according to venom himself in the comics the idea that this somehow needed spiderman couldnt be more off base the fact that they chose that wording in the critic summary shows exactly how little they understand venomnin general honestly peter parker is the least suitable host for a thing like venom which is why they canonically arent a good fit     in reality this movie places the focus exactly where is should beon the development of the relationship between eddie and venom amidst the chaos of the marvel universe its fun and its funny the chemistry between the symbionts and eddie is adapted beautifully the voice of venom is rendered exactly in the way you might hear it in your head as you read it from a comic book panel     i will be going to see this film again which is not something i normally do with any movie these days because the dynamic between all the lead characters was just that much fun and enjoyable to watch this film proves yet again that movie critics are wildly out of touch with general audiences     go and see this movie you will not regret it
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was pretty good i wish this was apart of the mcu universe if it was then critics would have given it higher ratings the unwritten rule is that if its not mcu or christopher nolan it doesnt cut it and thats not fair critics are the worst how can a blockbuster movie have a 89 rating with audiences but 31 with critics i rest my case
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom was a really fun movie the relationship between eddie and venom is alot of fun action is very good great start look forward to many more movies with venom
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it everyone has their own opinions but ive always been a marvel fan 
Oct 14 2018,positive,best superhero movie yet  loved it from beginning to end
Oct 14 2018,positive,an absolute blast nearly every scene had something to make me laugh the dynamic between eddie and venom was endearing and hilarious it might not be the highest quality of movie but damn is it fun
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it great action and very funny
Oct 14 2018,negative,first half very slow then it was like they were just grasping at a new series 
Oct 14 2018,positive,we loved this movie yes maybe they could have made it better but it made my lough and enjoy the moment that night when i had had a difficult day before the show
Oct 14 2018,negative,this movie was a fart how many failures does sony need to endure before they just get humble and let marvel take the reigns is losing money on a flop better than taking a cut from an inevitably successful marvel film i dont get it
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved this movie great casting cant wait for a sequel
Oct 14 2018,positive,not what i expected i type this while waiting for the credits to end and i am so shocked this movie was better than i thought i laughed and loved it im not a movie critic but the credits are almost over so definitely 45 stars
Oct 14 2018,positive,damn good time and good fun as well hardys giving his agame and venom is outright hilarious its pros and cons are the very same thing venom is awesome we want more venom we dont have enough venom least sets up something cool to be excited for in its sequel hopefully itll get one doing damn well at the box office
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie was great  the scenes with them talking in his head were fun and interesting  some of the cg is a bit shiny but didnt bother me much
Oct 14 2018,positive,saw it today awesome entertaining and funny too
Oct 14 2018,positive,excellent better than expected critics are very wrong or did not get paid 
Oct 14 2018,positive,hardy brings the character to life in a perfect way
Oct 14 2018,positive,one of the best movie in marvel universe
Oct 14 2018,positive,i will admit that i have a biased in favor of this movie due to being a huge fan of the spiderverse in general but i seriously cannot get over how much fun i had watching this movie    people are far too hung up on the idea that venom is and always was an evil being that wanted nothing more than the destruction of everything which could not be further from the truth venom hated spiderman because spiderman ditched him but beyond that he was always kind of a goofy notquitebadbutnotquitegood character and venom is always better as a character when he is separated from spidey because it allows him to develop as a character    all in all it was a fun movie all the way through and it did a fantastic job of adding to an already existing story in a compelling way     i do knock it for some cg scenes being a bit meh though and knowing there is approx 40 minutes of cut footage makes me want more of it 810 i would absolutely watch this movie again and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the spiderverse
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie widget good visuals effect
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was a great movie and i would see again
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was great they balanced out venoms evil with comedy and good guy vibes   well done
Oct 14 2018,positive,one of the most epic movies i have ever watched
Oct 14 2018,neutral,sony does not have a sterling track record of late when it comes to their superheroes after the dismal response to 2014s amazing spiderman 2 sony reached out to the creative team at the marvel cinematic universe mcu to better guide their flagship property a solution was worked out wherein the mcu would essentially make a spiderman movie and borrow the character for their own films and sony would reap the profits and it worked wonderfully with 2017s spiderman homecoming now sony seems to be falling into a similar trap getting ahead of themselves with an itch to build a larger superhero universe of properties venom is a fan favorite spiderman villain so to give the guy his own movie even without spiderman is already a risk the ensuing venom solo film is a big gooey mess of a movie that needed to decide whether it was going to be scary funny goofy serious pg13 or rrated or good or bad    eddie brock tom hardy is an investigative reporter who has relocated from new york to san francisco hes got a cushy job a loving fiancé michelle williams and he loses it all thanks to his ego and drive to uncover the secret experiments of a wealthy elon muskesque business magnate carlton drake riz ahmed then eddie discovers the secret of drakes lab an alien symbiotic substance that crashed on earth it bonds with eddie and appears in his head as a guttural voice egging him into bad behavior and the hopeful munching of heads and bodily organs eddie must learn to work with his new partner to thwart drake and another alien symbiote with plans for world domination    venom struggles to separate itself from the plethora of superhero films out there and forge an identity of its own unfortunately without spiderman and the larger marvel world its even in the tagline the world has enough superheroes if this is the antisuperhero movie it cant pull that far apart the setup was there for something potentially different venom could have been the villain instead of merely an antihero with eddie brock wrestling with his inner demons in a way that evoked the classic tortured duality of jekyll and hyde i think that approach certainly would have brought out more from director ruben fleischer zombieland gangster squad instead the filmmakers assert that their gooladen superhero is a bit edgier a bit looser with the ethics of justifiable homicide when it comes to snacks and to make it certain they employ a clearcut villain who has even less compunctions so as to make venom look better in comparison this is a pretty lazy antihero archetype that follows the superhero formula to the core if the venom symbiosis was presenting problems in eddies life or presented a lethal force that tempted him to the dark side that needed to be tamed or at least withheld that would be one thing but its the sameold tool for empowerment thanks to the venom alien eddie is able to stand up to bad guys he shrunk from before thanks to the venom alien eddie is able to be a better reporter and reactive citizen hooray for a movie that advertised there were too many superheroes they just flatly rolled out another    the major problem with venom is that nobody seems to be on the same page as to what kind of movie they are making firstly tom hardy seems to think hes making his own version of jim carreys the mask hamming it up to great comic effect stuttering and sloshing his way from scene to scene this movie would be vastly less interesting if it was not for hardy and his committed performance of borderline nicolas cagestyle nuttiness the film became that much more entertaining once venom and eddie were bonded and hardy had to reconcile the backandforth in his head and in public there are moments that im almost convinced the movie is asking its audience to laugh at it and hardy rather than with it like when he takes a dip into a lobster tank to cool off it made me think of all of me but with an alien parasite the buddy comedy aspect and interaction was a highlight the movie is better when it either embraces its goofy elements or at least pretends not to be as serious the serious version of this movie seems to infect most of the supporting players notably williams and ahmed poor michelle williams manchester by the sea is another underrated love interest and in the one scene where she does have agency and power she immediately gives it back over to eddie ahmed rogue one just looks lost going from overblown monologue to confusing monologue making it hard to grasp what his motivations are from scene to scene is it space exploration conquering or saving the earth theres a part at the end confrontation where ahmed and hardy are literally fighting oneonone and its hilariously mismatched theres no way a tiny guy like ahmed would be able to contend with hardy in a fistfight thats the more unbelievable moment yet    the story has many shortcomings and logical constraints that exist for sloppy stalling purposes take for instance the opening scene where a us space shuttle crashes back to earth and lands in malaysia have the people of malaysia suffered enough downed aircraft one of the four alien symbiotes escapes and latches onto an emt worker taking control of her body we then flash forward six months and drakes company is testing the symbiotes and having poor results losing all but one that bonds with eddie brock why even have four of these things why have two to eventually die offscreen when one would do but really why have any of this setup the bad guy symbiote is effectively stranded in malaysia for six months until it figures out that little white girls are the ticket to slipping past airport security guards and i guess stupid secret lab guards as well why not have the breakaway symbiote be the venom one why even have the means of their arrival crash in malaysia if theyre all just winding up in san francisco anyway the only logical answer is the filmmakers wanted the big bad sidelined long enough to set up more plot but its so sloppy the same can be said about how eddie eventually ends up facetoface with his special symbiote jenny slates gifted scientist character is to sneak eddie into the lab without her supervision of where to specifically go and for him to take pictures of the suffering test patients why does she need an intermediary to take pictures why cant she do this and then submit them to eddie if she fears that the tests are as dangerous why does she let eddie stumble around when the bad guys initially give chase they use flying drones as their killer weapons i figured they would use these aerial machines to fire at eddie as he speeds away on his motorcycle but no instead they use them as kamikaze bombs how is that effective why do the good people of san francisco seem to shrug at a series of bombs going off around their city this is pretty much the definition of modern terrorism how about when the venom symbiote goo is separated from eddie and hes taken away and the symbiote has to escape from a hospital and it has a choice of small dog or human being as its escape vehicle and it chooses the small yappy dog the movie is littered with these kinds of headscratchers and leaves the overwhelming impression that much of this story and ensuing production was thrown together in the most haphazard fashion    the action and special effects are also pretty messy and lackluster the venom alien goop just looks like hardy is constantly dripping black paint the effects do not look drastically improved from when we first caught glimpse of a big screen venom in 2007s spiderman 3 though no candy corn fangs theres a lengthy attack sequence between venom and an entire squad of swat officers that takes place in the haze of a teargas cloud its meant to evoke a sense of horror as venom pops up randomly except it just makes everything too chaotic to maintain interest too many sequences take place at night to obfuscate the special effects work the final act is the worst part as venom faces down another symbiotic goomonster and it ends up being a clash between a blackskinned goo monster and a greyskinned goo monster outdoors at night with quick camera edits good luck trying to comprehend what is happening on the screen its such a bleh villain as well just a bigger slightly more evil version of venom and its worlddominating plan involve bringing the other symbiotes to earth which will take by my calculations at least a few decades at best of space travel time its one last noisy dumb moment in a movie filled with loud and dumb moments to pass the time    i still cant find a straight answer whether venom was initially filmed as a pg13 film or as an rrated movie and reedited into a safer more commercial pg13 form in its current incarnation i dont think an rrating would have added much more to it but thats because the film doesnt feel like it was conceived as an rrated property thats a shame considering it features an alien creature that eats peoples heads there is one scene where venom eats a muggers head and the next scene he reverts back to eddie brock and we see eddie leave the shop in clear sight the dead body of his headless victim is curiously missing even though it should be in full view what happened also what happens to the shop owner who is now witness to this traumatic event are the police or insurance agents going to believe her tale about an alien monster biting the head off a man whose body was left in her business is anyone going to want to shop there again once word spreads that a guy had his head removed the venom movie we get doesnt earn this scene and it doesnt get to wave away the scrutiny it invites    venom is a mediocre superhero movie that doesnt know what it wants to be it says it doesnt want to be a superhero film but it falls under the same plot trappings it seems like its a silly comedy but then it asks you to take it seriously it seems like a serious action thriller but then it has a goocovered antihero say without a hint of irony that its time to save the world then theres the painfully onthenose postcredits scene meant to bait the audience into interest in future sequels stop doing this hollywood this is a sloppy movie on all levels the saving grace is hardys dedicated ridiculous ticheavy performance which at least smoothed over the rough patches at various points for my enjoyment otherwise the best part of the venom movie is a threeminute clip for the animated spiderman movie sony is scheduled to release in december those delightful three minutes are better than anything else venom has to offer in its slapdash goofilled tonal mishmash check out the underrated genre gem upgrade instead the superior venom    nates grade c
Oct 14 2018,positive,i loved this movie and i want to see it again critics once again prove they are untrustworthy
Oct 14 2018,positive,greatest moviee everr
Oct 14 2018,positive,if you want to sit through a fun movie then venom is perfect good action great jokes and all in all you have a great movie not perfect for sure but if you go into any movie thinking its going to be perfect then youre doing it wrong and definitely ignore the critic reviews especially considering if you look through just a few of them you can see they cant spell or use spell check seriously one of them said a few laffs its laughs there arent any fs in laughs so their credibility isnt something that can be trusted
Oct 14 2018,positive,amazing movie more words are not needed
Oct 14 2018,positive,interesting take on the character good overall performance by hardy not his best some awkward moments in dialogue socially but brief and overall good proves that the chaos and extremes of venom can be on its own without spiderman as well as having good references to comic roots
Oct 14 2018,positive,entertaining joy ride with tom hardy rocking his role another film where the punters disagree with the proper critics  well worth checking out
Oct 14 2018,positive,i actually really liked it yeah maybe i got kind of bored by that marvel dorky humor but hey it was good
Oct 14 2018,positive,i really like the movie the story is pretty straight foward like we want to show the monster and we want to show he talking and is just great the action scenes are amazing i love it all and i dont miss spider man on it and i dont feel like it need a conection with spider man at all because they dont have the felling of hate spider man they have the felling of we have nothing we are loses i love it
Oct 14 2018,positive,i dont normally watch super hero movies but this movie is a must see its awesome go see it
Oct 14 2018,positive,according to me this is a good movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,the romantic comedy with a monster we all deserved after that fish man thingy
Oct 14 2018,positive,this is a very well made movie i really enjoyed it congrats to sony and tom hardy already a huge hit
Oct 14 2018,positive,enjoyed it even more so after seeing the bad critics reviews and realising they were all wrong
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was a very entertaining movie but it was a stand alone venom movie so no spiderman dont let the fanboys ruin it for you
Oct 14 2018,negative,i went into this film expecting a dumb fun movie something to see with friends   what i got was a boring movie with awful acting writing and only good special effects when it comes to goo while full venom looks like he came out of a 2000s movie they waste half the movie establishing rules broken the next scene i dont mind not really explaining things just dont halfexplain things only to then go back on what you just said its boring venom is neither funny nor scary nor exciting the villain is a waste of screentime the supporting cast has exactly one good character that gets no screen time and people just do things or are places for no reason the action sequences feel boring and useless venom never feels to be in any danger and just beats up guys who cant hurt it in any way in a smoky and dark room so much of the movie isnt even action but is just exposition that is either useless or immediately discarded    it would make a great symbiotehardy romcom but it was cowardly and didnt actually do that and i wont give it points for what it wasnt or what it could be
Oct 14 2018,negative,they dont ever really establish a relationship between venom and tom hardy but then all of a sudden venom is abandoning his own kind and planet because of him whyyyyy not as funny as it tried to be even michelle williams could not save her characters lines riz ahmed was strong but not enough to save this film
Oct 14 2018,positive,critics suck this movie was really well done the  relationship between brock and venom was class and the fight scene at the end was amazing this was a really cool movie im really looking forward to see where this franchise is going
Oct 14 2018,neutral,every scene was on the verge of greatness but was ruined by this idiotic humor
Oct 14 2018,positive,great popcorn flick my daughter and i had a lot fun watching it
Oct 14 2018,positive,an intentionally hilarious time
Oct 14 2018,neutral,it definitely had a few cool moments and the sitcom comedy jokes made me giggle a couple of times but overall forgettable and slaps the venom character we all know and love right in the face
Oct 14 2018,negative,this was sloppy pure and simple
Oct 14 2018,positive,go see venom the critics were either paid to give venom a bad review or they didnt watch the same movie i did jerks
Oct 14 2018,positive,i liked this movie i dont know why professional critics have such a problem with it
Oct 14 2018,positive,very goog just didnt hit the mark
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom was great please disregard the misleading reviews from critics and watch this awesome film
Oct 14 2018,positive,theres a lot in this movie that is really stupid but i loved it me and my friend laughed our butts off at the cinema it was a bit messy and chaotic at times but honestly i dont really care it was really entertaining and just great would watch it again
Oct 14 2018,negative,fun movie with a horrible story and a love story that is as confusing as the relationship between eddie and venom venom has some quotes that are so bad they are almost good
Oct 14 2018,negative,after watching a second time ive realized how cringe this movie really was an inept attempt to paint a picture
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it critics be morons
Oct 14 2018,positive,ignore critics this is one of the best films this year and one of the best films of the marvel universe well only technically   eddie and venom made one of the best duos i have ever seen in a film  and cannot recommend this enough
Oct 14 2018,positive,i was pretty good i recomend it
Oct 14 2018,positive,really good film its needs to view
Oct 14 2018,negative,i am surprised that even having a lot of superhero movies to learn from having an interesting and attractive character as a villain the director somehow managed to overlook that and made the most generic movie in this genre sarcastic jokes of the protagonist irreverent phrases of the villain sequences of action without logic etc the only big difference between this film from others superheroe movies is that in this flick nobody laugues at the jokes
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom its a good blend between an action film and a comedy film it has a lot of action that does not disappoint you but it still has enough comedy to keep it from getting redundant like most of dcs movies
Oct 14 2018,positive,great marvel film cant what for the sequel and what this could bring to mcu its definitely a twist to normal marvel films  so many possibilities for future  marvel films bring on the spidey villains 
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie deserves more than 30 on this site
Oct 14 2018,positive,perfectly watchable surprisingly funny and a good scene setter for further action yes it has pitfalls but its thoroughly enjoyable
Oct 14 2018,positive,i was surprised how enjoyable it was good balance between dark tones and humor
Oct 14 2018,positive,in part it is a good movie but he lacked to show the darker side of the character  in my opinion a 7 out of 10
Oct 14 2018,positive,plot was well done and tom hardy really embraced the character there was a good balance of action vs some tastefulncomedy throughout i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,positive,i walked into the movie theatre thinking there were shit reviews i didnt hear anything about the movie honestly forgot i was gonna see it that day  and for some context some rt rotten tomatoes reviews said it should be rrated or is this a comedy  back to those in a second  from the opening few minutes i was like well here we go the cliche dark music to start rushed through the opening sequence nonimpressive special effects i even pulled my phone out 5 minutes in to check the running time which was 2 hours 20 minutes at which point i mouthed damn it  so clearly i couldnt be more biased from the rt reviews i read a few minutes ago  as i start to watch the comment about the movie that it shouldve been rrated started to sound more and more true damn imagine if venom destroying those ppl in the beginning were rrated wow this movie has such a lack of focus what kind of audience are they trying to reel in 13yo wouldve done wayyyyy better with rrated elements  im shitting on this movie so hard   now lets skip to when venom comes in were at the part where eddy main character has become a host for the venom aka hes infectedish the part when he gets infected is kinda cliche which just made me even more angry but i was somewhat excited to see how venom plays out in eddys body  a few minutes later he goes home and eddy looking at a mirror suddenly shouts the word food and scares himself into passing out eddy himself did not say this but it was venom which lies in his body i was like what the f cuz his voice was in perfect adult english complete with personality and still monsterlike  anyways eddy and venom end up having a relationship with each other it starts off just animalistic from venoms side as it tries to survive and stuff but as the movie progresses their conversations start to reflect that of a of friendship laced with banter but tied by the need for both of them to survive if eddy dies venom dies  their interactions especially with an english speaking venom inside eddy start to become funnier and sometimes stupid i laughed in the movie sometimes because scenes and dialogue were downright stupid and sometimes because venom is a real charm  anyways by the end i was genuinely sad that our time with eddy and venom was coming to a close and i was shocked that 2 hours and 20 minutes flew by so quickly  comment on those rt reviews i do agree there should be an rrated version and it would be amazing but this is just such a treat that i appreciated not passing up on also is this a comedy i would say yes because ive learned one thing from watching movies you enjoy a movie not because its perfect though it definitely could be you enjoy it if you love at least one aspect of it for venom everything was arguably shit except for venom and eddy
Oct 14 2018,positive,was a fun movie to watch i really dont get what all the bad reviews are about cant wait for the next one
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was really enjoyable 
Oct 14 2018,positive,very enjoyable with some good comedic moments i cant understand why the critics dislike it so much as this is after all a comic book film and as such shouldnt expect any clever plot lines but rather a true popcorn flick and it delivers as such
Oct 14 2018,positive,i wasnt sure how i felt about a venom movie without spiderman i also wondered how eddie would get enough hatred  without spiderman but i was very impressed at how the director  made this into a stand alone movie i also going hardy played his part very well   i cant wait for the installments
Oct 14 2018,negative,the only redeeming quality of this movie is tom hardy acting has ass off the cgi is weak in a world with such better offerings and the plotwriting is reminiscent of the older fantastic four films in quality wait for rental and dont waste your money
Oct 14 2018,positive,good movie not the greatest but definitely not 30 rotten
Oct 14 2018,positive,unorthodox antihero movie decent soundtrack overall tom hardy portrayed venom perfectly strays from comics but the originality of it makes it just that much better
Oct 14 2018,positive,being a big spiderman fan and seeing the trailers i was worried to see this but i was surprised going in it wasnt your traditional superhero movie it had a alienhorror feel to it it also reminded me of the campy days of like adam west and michael keaton batman i think they did a great job with it enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,negative,the acting was really bad
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie if youre a lover of  action comedies tom hardy excels in his performance as  venom and the plot is actually very interesting would definitely recommend and am surprised at the negative reviews
Oct 14 2018,positive,while the setup of the movie is gorantakingly bad and character development is pretty much turdtastic with people basically turning on a dime in their motivations and behavior the film was entertaining due to tom hardy probably the best actor out there the great cgi and the humor     venom was portrayed in a great way also voiced by tom hardy  as an origin story it does the trick though obviously there are many more venom storylines making the sequel potential limitless if sony and disneymarvel can work it out    worth a view in the theater stay till the end of the credits for an extended look at spiderverse     even more worth a view in the theater if you go on a cheap day as i did
Oct 14 2018,positive,honestly its not a bad film i do think the ending was a bit rushed and the fight with riot really could have been better but hell this is way better than spiderman3
Oct 14 2018,positive,good movie is not the best marvel or comics movie but i like itthe way they recreate venom and how it doesnt share anything with spidey is fresh for mei dont want spiderman to be the new ironman appearing in every movie they maketom hardy fits well and is fun to see and thats the point to have fun watching ithoping for some carnage vs venom in the future
Oct 14 2018,positive,ignore the ratings if you want an exciting captivating and surprisingly funny movie then look no further as a lifelong fan of spiderman who was ready to dislike this movie since first hearing of it i have to admit that i completely enjoyed it it might not be perfect but it deserves a lot more appreciation than its been getting definitely worth seeing   1010 would watch again
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie was slow and yet a bit too faced paced the character development within venom is uncertain and that goes mainly to the symbiote his motive confused me a left a hole but either way the movie was arguably nice and decent to watch even though there was no spiderman
Oct 14 2018,neutral,the first 45 minutes are torture when he finally becomes venom it becomes a fun movie its good for a one time watch but nothing more
Oct 14 2018,positive,really good movie f the critics
Oct 14 2018,positive,fun but incredibly flawed 
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it wasnt like the comics i know but i honestly spent the entire time exchanging hilarious laughter with my husband id see it again and ill definitely be buying it
Oct 14 2018,positive,1st half of movie was really good but scond half could have been better
Oct 14 2018,positive,slow to start and then ends too soon but much more humor than i expected
Oct 14 2018,negative,i never thought i would say this about marvel movie boring
Oct 14 2018,positive,venoms plot was interesting enough to keep interest building throughout and the movies sarcastic fun humor was a pleasant surprise at many spots along the way venoms alien character was likable and fun to watch transform the cgi was cool throughout in most parts of the movie perhaps until the end when it seemed to go a bit overboard in the final alien fighting scene when it seemed to be overdone at times but overall venom is a fun movie to watch especially in 3d venom is a fun movie if you are a superhero movie fan or a fan of fun cgi infused movies in general thumbs up for me
Oct 14 2018,positive,the symbiote venom took it waaaay to the outfield i mean home run great job funny twisted but still funny aww man im definitely watching this again
Oct 14 2018,positive,absolutely adored this movie only thing is that i wanted to see more of venom and riot together tom hardy is great and found his relationship with venom really entertaining
Oct 14 2018,negative,i feel bad for tom hardy his talent was wasted in this movie im the script was a little bit trash and there was like a 4 second fight scene at the end
Oct 14 2018,positive,i loved this movie i would have to highly disagree with the rotten tomatoes rating
Oct 14 2018,positive,its a very good moviei liked it 
Oct 14 2018,positive,this was such a funny film dont understand the low critic review excellent
Oct 14 2018,positive,amazing film tom hardy is such a legend d
Oct 14 2018,positive,honestly the best movie of this year so far even surpassing deadpool if whom i think relies too much on comedy whereas this film has action death and some well placed comedy  the intentions and plot points work perfectly and if i collide a would have given this a 1010  
Oct 14 2018,positive,its an interesting dynamic demonstrated in the comics and in cartoons the symbiote learns peoples secrets and chooses to share with people now whether this is all internal or a conversation is up to speculation but i enjoyed the idea of the titular characters talking to each other it was also neat to watch the symbiote come to life
Oct 14 2018,positive,i loved the movie of course it has mistakes but the movie critics need to understand the differences between going to see a movie to entertain themselves and going to see a work of art
Oct 14 2018,positive,that movie was awesome   so many critisism from rottentomato so many idiots
Oct 14 2018,positive,a fun movie to watch
Oct 14 2018,negative,dumb movie poor casting weak start dumb plot dumb decisions really dumb dialogue teeny bit of charm in spite of itself my friend dragged me to this she thought it was going to be great she was disappointed she agreed with me that it a dumb movie 
Oct 14 2018,positive,it was a well made action story with a great car chase scene loved loved loved the san francisco backdrop in the movie the actors did a great job supporting the comic heroes here hope theres a second movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,freaking loved this movie 
Oct 14 2018,positive,i went to see this last night and ive got to say the critics and completely and utterly wrong   its an was an awsome film itll make you laugh the story is engaging and venom actually quite endearing  even when hes biting peoples heads off in fact especially when hes buting peoples heads off   ignore the critics reviews and go see it youll not regret it
Oct 14 2018,negative,clunky clichéd and left me confused as to how fans think this is anywhere close to a good film what could have been a fantastic introduction in the mcu left me with a bad taste in the mouth thinking what we could have had and what we got instead 
Oct 14 2018,positive,best movie ever venom was great tom hardy was amazing no need of spider man would have been great if there was spider man but i am very happy and pleased with what we got
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie realy wasnt as bad as the reviews say i do agree that some scenes feel a bit cluncky and the lines are odd but i think atleadt this was a fine movie with alot to enjoy
Oct 14 2018,positive,was actually amazing funny and well made
Oct 14 2018,positive,best movie ever you can go to 
Oct 14 2018,positive,awesome movie screw the critics i think we should seriously do something about the ctritics they dont give accurate ratings at all 96 out of 100
Oct 14 2018,negative,its really bad they made venom a superhero while he is the most evil villain from the marvel universe and spiderman isnt even in the movie go watch a star is born instead
Oct 14 2018,positive,i enjoyed it even if the critics didnt
Oct 14 2018,positive,i dont know what the critics are talking about venom is a fun and entertaining movie doesnt get boring at any time couldnt tell what was happening at times during the fight against riot but apart from that it was a very good superhero movie cant wait to see carnage
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom was really fun it has good comedy that lands have the time ok action scenes but my favourite thing about this movie was the relationship between eddy and venom that relationship lead to some very funny moments and i really thought that was the thing that shined in this movie now this movie isnt perfect it definitely has problems its really cheesy at time the villain is really over the top and there are plot holes and it could have been stretched out longer but in the end venom is fun and if you want to just turn your brain of and go see a movie that you dont really have to pay attention to and you just want to have fun than go see venom you will have a good time with it im ganna give venom a b 
Oct 14 2018,positive,although i found venom a bit annoying at times tom hardy relieved me from forgetting this film 
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie going to see it again definitely not disappointed
Oct 14 2018,positive,its ok but needs work still recommend
Oct 14 2018,positive,its good go see it 
Oct 14 2018,negative,there is no understanding of the characters that the whole story is based on just a need to give us a series of unfortunate events and continue on to the next stage
Oct 14 2018,positive,movie was excellent loved all the digital work humor was a big part of this movie just adding to what already was a great movie cant wait to see the sequel
Oct 14 2018,neutral,could have been so much better but michelle williams way overacts in this one its like we know youre a talented actress you dont need to prove it every time thankfully the mega star tom hardy saves this film for what it is his jekyllhyde impersonation with venom is fantastic 
Oct 14 2018,negative,the final act is just a mess
Oct 14 2018,positive,a  great marvel romp it doesnt take itself too seriously and teeters on the edge of deadpoolesque humour without swan diving in tom hardy is brilliantly cast and plays the conflicted host very well  i left utterly convinced of the symbiotic relationship many marvel films try too hard to be dark  there is darkness but also so much fun i loved it
Oct 14 2018,positive,critiques were totally wrong according to me the movie lacked the traditional mcu plot but kept the audience boringless we debate for years but the movie is not boring at any part of the movie i hardly saw any one walking out at the middle of the movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,really love the movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,fuck the reviewers this was an awesome movie with good comedy i dont know what goes on in their head they must be too busy sucking of marvel than to actually look at this movie with an open eye
Oct 14 2018,negative,sucks worst superhero movie ive seen in a while dont know how people like it theres so many plots holes the action is overall bland and generic and only a few funny moments
Oct 14 2018,positive,for decades the true origin of venom has been rewritten to accommodate the symbiotic organism coming to earth on a space shuttle which had to happen because it would take too much time and effort to include spiderman and the secret wars  with that in mind it is not necessary to include spiderman at all if one wishes to just take a short cut and have the symbiote attach to eddie brock  venom even includes a factual point that eddie was shamed out of new york and ended up in san francisco so it is easy to tie eddie and peter parker together  the relationship between eddie brock and venom is perfectly represented from the comics to the big screen and fans of the comic books will notice quotes lifted directly from the pages brought to the movie  this movie is slow on action in the beginning in order to develop the central characters however once the action starts it is nonstop until the end and the midcredit scene gives us a nice tease at cletus kasaday  critics are idiots  fandom is the truest form of rating a movie
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie it was a little rushed in the beginning and some cheesy moments but i really enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,positive,i loved itthe characters where likableit had a lot of funny scenesthe story was ok and the design for venom was amazing
Oct 14 2018,positive,i was expecting this movie to be bad the previews looked terrible like bad cgi dumb plot and bad acting then the reviews only cemented this idea as the terrible reviews rolled in took my daughter anyway because there wasnt much else to take her to but holy cannoli it was actually very entertaining enough so that i didnt care about the plot so much or the cgi which neither was too bad my daughter thought it was awesome and i enjoyed it so dont listen to these movie reviewers they are idiots 
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it patiently waiting for more 
Oct 14 2018,positive,the movie was awesome  fuck those who are saying its bad
Oct 14 2018,positive,its an awesome movie this venom is a new take of what the character is and tom hardy really stood out in this film you should really see this for yourself cant wait for venom 2
Oct 14 2018,positive,such a good movie so glad i didnt listen to the critics and went and watched it myself 1010 recommend watching
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie and the sequel will be even better 
Oct 14 2018,positive,very funny i strongly recommend
Oct 14 2018,positive,its a great comic book movie i think the critics were looking for king lear they should have gone to another movie rather than expect this one to be something other than a great adventure story booooo critics
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom has the most reasonable plot out of all marvel movies with some plotholes but after all the film is only two hrs long and therere lots and lots of action with no noticeable falls into stupidity for the sake of more action which happens very often fukken always actually in marverl movies the only flaw is that half of the jokes are stupid    and dont you let those shitcritics fool you
Oct 14 2018,positive,i have learned long ago to never trust critic reviews they never seem to get it right most of the time i must have just watched a different venom because while i cant say this movie was perfect i can definitely say this was a very entertaining viewing fyi stay till the very end youre welcome 
Oct 14 2018,positive,really great movie seriously pleased but why is stan lee lowkey like sean diddy combs with his music videos  artists making cameo appearances in his own movie lol cant wait to see the followup im a for sure woody harrison fan since cheers days lol the special effects action and humor were all great
Oct 14 2018,positive,very entertaining movie what are critics even saying 
Oct 14 2018,neutral,it was pretty good action kinda sucked tho
Oct 14 2018,negative,fun movie with a horrible script the main love story was as dull and confusing as the relationship between eddie and venom some of venoms quotes were so bad they were good
Oct 14 2018,positive,so dope f the haters funny action packed well paced 
Oct 14 2018,negative,worse marvel movie what a way to destroy one of the best villains and hos story 
Oct 14 2018,positive,not perfect but funny and entertaining  worth the watch  give me eddie and venom speaking all day long
Oct 14 2018,neutral,an utterly mediocre film
Oct 14 2018,negative,a fun movie with a horrible script the main love story didnt make any sense  and was as dull as the relationship between eddie and venom venom had some quotes that were almost so bad  they were good
Oct 14 2018,positive,funny movie but it goes a bit long it also feels discombobulated but turns out fun in the end to barely entertain
Oct 14 2018,positive,i dont care what you say i enjoyed tom hardy is very good actor my favorite scenes are venom and eddie diaolgs and actually cgi is not that bad and action is great thats all for me
Oct 14 2018,positive,good movie and cant wait for the next one have waited a long time for whats coming in the next film 
Oct 14 2018,positive,it may not be dark depiction of venom as supervillain but it definitely creates a room to grow its good host creates a conflict with the destructive nature of venom would love to see it get cross interaction with spiderman
Oct 14 2018,negative,a badly written story for entertaining movie only
Oct 14 2018,positive,all the negative critic reviews actually helped my experience for this movie going in with low expectations is always the best way to enter a movie this is a great special effects fun popcorn movie not really true to the comic books minus spiderman a side of tom hardy i havent seen before in a movie with all that said its worth your time it has humor and a anti hero who eats heads stick around for the post credit scene its cool 
Oct 14 2018,positive,solid comic book film some cheesy dialogue and random scenes but overall very fun and different also a bonus for being pretty faithful to the comics 
Oct 14 2018,positive,this movie was tons of fun while there will eventually be a need for this likely franchise to connect to spiderman to truly reach its full potential this incarnation of venom was fresh and fun it had plenty of sarcastic laughs and good action sequences im looking forward to a sequel a few plot holes here and there but the movie as a whole was fun and entertaining
Oct 14 2018,positive,its not the best film but its enjoyable and pretty good
Oct 14 2018,positive,i was skeptical going in knowing that spiderman wasnt going to be involved in this film how can you have a venom without spiderman well turns out you can i was pleasantly surprised by the film especially with the venom character its by no means perfect but i went in there to get entertained and that is exactly what happened looking forward to more symbiote madness
Oct 14 2018,positive,really fun movie i was a little skeptical because of rotten tomatoes reviews but they made venom just the way i wanted cant wait for venom 2
Oct 14 2018,positive,i thought it was an amazing movie
Oct 14 2018,negative,sony is just phoning it in at this point 
Oct 14 2018,positive,too good to be not funny
Oct 14 2018,positive,great idk why it got bad reviews everybody is just a cry face and wants thing there way and complains to much 
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it so much i think its better than spiderman
Oct 14 2018,positive,professional movie critics dont know what they are talking about i put professional in quotations because i dont consider movie criticism to be a field worthy of the title this is a fantastic movie and i hope to see more superhero movies like it
Oct 14 2018,positive,good movie nice plotjust needed a little bit more action and more of what venom could do 
Oct 14 2018,positive,my favorite marvel movie to date other than perhaps deadpool  i really loved this movie besides venom has always been one of my favorite characters in the spiderman universe i may even like hime more than spidey
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom has always been my absolute favorite villain when the trailer for this movie came out i was very worried also i did not like the fact that spiderman was not going to be in the movie so when going into watching this movie i had low expectations but instead of hating this movie i in fact came out of the theater loving it while there is a lot wrong with this movie they did a few things so well that for me it made up for all the other mistakes i love venoms sense of humor thats very unique and just makes me chuckle tom hardy played a completely different character for eddie brock then what i thought i wanted and im so glad he did i can relate more to the character of eddie brock that i see on screen to sum it all up in the end i got what i wanted from a venom movie crazy venom sense of humor an amazing representation of venom in cgi and action
Oct 14 2018,negative,critics were right disappointing maybe it was the cast or poor choice of director 
Oct 14 2018,positive,is the acting oscar worthy no will the script hold up to scrutiny against the likes of the avengers series and others probably not the story could have been better with a bit more refinement and polish but at least the story didnt make a big political statement it didnt derail itself with needless subplots and most importantly i had a good time i will take a movie like venom 100 times over a movie that is crafted with stuck up entitlement a bigger budget and approved by critics that want guaranteed traffic with a paycheck ive seen reviews scoff about childish puns in venom yet didnt deadpool do insanely well the jokes in that were far more cheap and raunchy at times its easy to dismiss and put down something that wont probably garner you favor but id rather throw in with the losers that were willing to do something worthwhile and venom did exactly that it gave me a worthwhile good time where i got to enjoy some popcorn and a slushie and forget how shitty reality is for a couple hours will definitely go see again will definitely buy because you know what it was still better than ghost rider lol
Oct 14 2018,positive,great movie really enjoyed it
Oct 14 2018,positive,great plot and clear character development exactly the movie i expected and wanted to see far better than any of sonys attempts to create a standalone marvel universe unfortunately carnages appearance was just lazy scriptwriting and although memorable very cringe despite that venom truely is a masterpiece of dark humour action and film
Oct 14 2018,negative,a borring rushed super hero movie that has a crap villain a confused hero movie doesnt know what it wants to be 3rd act starts 20 minutes before the ending and seems rushed and the final fight cgi scene was a mess worst dialoge i seen in ages the only reason it gets 2 stars is because i did have a few giggles there where i wasnt suppose to
Oct 14 2018,positive,venom was a great movie  tom hardy is excellent  cgi wasnt too much
Oct 14 2018,positive,loved it its awesome
Oct 14 2018,positive,v good v good v good cant wait for next one
Oct 14 2018,positive,this was a great movie tom hardy actually played a great part as eddie brockvenom i absolutely loved him in this movie michelle williams played a great part too its definitely a must see movie 
Oct 14 2018,positive,awesome movie but it would be more awesome if they put more skills and fighting scenes
Oct 14 2018,negative,not good this is on level with green lantern ben afflecks darevdevil and the recent tmnt movies theres may be a full 8 minutes and im fricking serious of venom the actual creaturehero on screen i will admit tho when hes on screen it is cool to see some fun action but horrible attenpts at humor one joke got me one and the acting all around is almost as bad as halle berrys catwoman even tom hardy couldnt save this one so bummed 
Oct 14 2018,positive,solid but could have been great 
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was amazing i did expect this to be more for adults more gore and scare but it was still awesome i loved it and i already want to watch it a 100 times over
Oct 13 2018,positive,the critics know nothingthis move is the best  and a must see
Oct 13 2018,positive,i wouldnt call it a good movie but it was very entertaining and cool 
Oct 13 2018,positive,very good movie dont understand the critics negative reviews 
Oct 13 2018,positive,really suprised ready the reviews and loved it anyway tom hardy was fantastic
Oct 13 2018,positive,i dont like marvel movies i dont like the avengers spiderman none of it i loved venom and i cant wait to see it again i thought it was hysterical and creepy af the only bad part was michelle williams wig everything else was incredible
Oct 13 2018,positive,its a good movie to enjoy and while i agree with the critics regarding originality and so on im glad i watched it in the big screen and venom is kinda quirky cool 
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a great movie and who ever review is all wrong and he doesnt need spider man in his  movie and if you have readed the comics you would know that most of the venom comics dont have spider man
Oct 13 2018,positive,a very funny mess with good cgi and eastereggs
Oct 13 2018,positive,genial tom hardy un maestro
Oct 13 2018,positive,my inner child was more than satisfied as i saw the one character that i longed to see be brought to the big screen was its exceeded all of my venom fanboy expectations and with carnage coming into the mix i cant wait to see the next one
Oct 13 2018,neutral,fun at times but if youve seen the previews then youve seen the movie 
Oct 13 2018,positive,screw what the critics say it was fun dark and amazing peep it for yourself
Oct 13 2018,positive,was really excited for the movie and it delivered
Oct 13 2018,positive,one of the best marvel movies it have great story telling the backstory was perfect the movie was funny and intense in a good way you should watch it
Oct 13 2018,positive,really great movie funny fun action packed a bad guy i hope venom beats the crap out of spider man cant wait to see what other venom movie they make next
Oct 13 2018,positive,the trailer made the film seem more dark than it truly was i went in expecting something completely different but a somewhat comedic take on the origin of venom worked really well tom hardy was amazing and looked like he had a good time making  it still the trailer though should have had more comedy in it if they portrayed it as a comedic comic book movie in the trailer they probably would have made more money instead of tiptoeing around that aspect of the film this overall though was a very well made film with a good story and i recommend going to see it
Oct 13 2018,positive,a humorous movie that although has a lacking story makes up for it with its amazing portrayal of venom and his comedic interactions with eddie the premise of the show may seem lacking to many critics but there is no doubt that the many people who went to see the movie loved it overall the cgi was not bad and the fight scenes were exaggerated but very satisfying to watch
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved the movie  even though there were not many action scenes  its not just about violence and stuff half of the time its showing how eddie and the sybmiotes relationship is  but people hating on the movie can screw off and the cgi is not bad youre just blind
Oct 13 2018,negative,venom is a combination of bad writing and a supporting cast all comming together to create one big confusing mess this film rivals fantastic 4 2015 as one of the worst super hero films
Oct 13 2018,positive,the best movie i have seen this year dc catch up
Oct 13 2018,positive,i have no idea what the critics were drinking when they surveyed the movie first of all its a comic book movie and people want to compare it to other marvel movies but thats just not the case this is the first venom movie ever made and think the team did a good job of showing relationship that was built between and alien dont be fooled by the critics my wife and i truly enjoyed the movie my wife is not even a comic book fan and thought the movie came together well go see for yourself before you let others sway your judgment 
Oct 13 2018,positive,great special effects this venom makes the spiderman 3 version look like such a little bitch great setup for future venoms stories enjoyable movie critics have lost touch with what normal people enjoy in a film
Oct 13 2018,positive,i love the movie and the way the studio was able to make venom come to life a most watch of this year did i mention i love really love this movie
Oct 13 2018,negative,i didnt hold up to be apart of disney marvel movies its an okay movie 
Oct 13 2018,positive,so good   they made venom so powerful and cool  venoms person has a great look for this story
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom was humorous and action packed in my observation yes it did steer way from the original story line of how venom came to be but this new story line made me wanting more each passing sceen the cast and crew did a great job in their performance and couldnt be more glad to have seen this movie i would just say be a bit more open minded and have no expectations going into this movie you will enjoy the movie a lot more
Oct 13 2018,positive,something different not a hero not a villain is like a 3rd and 1st person view  with a  human view of venom
Oct 13 2018,positive,criticsscrew the pro ratings really enjoyed the movie only thing i left wishing for was they didnt wait so long to get back to too venom hardy of course was amazing cant wait for a sequel
Oct 13 2018,positive,i wanted to make my own opinion on this movie i grew up seeing venom on the spiderman cartoon anyway my memory of the character was fuzzy but i didnt know what to expect after only seeing venom and eddie in spiderman 3 i appreciated tom hardys dedication to his betrayal of both characters i ended up liking venom in the movie version it is different from the comics because venom is not torturing eddie and instead developed a buddy relationship with him this was a wierd yet fun relationship to see id see a sequel its an interesting take on the antihero genra that seems familiar in formula and simple in script but also contains a newness to it because tom hardys character was not a cookie cutter male lead and just seemed liked the average joe   they have a good foundation to do a lot with this super hero movie eddie is an average guy with a realisticly crumbling relationship which i enjoyed seeing how this added to the story wasnt perfect but i would watch again and am now a bigger fan of venom and consequently tom hardy
Oct 13 2018,positive,how else do you judge a film besides how much you enjoyed it at least thats how i judge them and i am forced to say that i liked this film i did not get caught up in the prerelease hype so that might have helped but i found the movie action packed funny and strangely heartwarming maybe you shouldnt get those things from a venom movie and maybe that is why i have heard complaints from so many about the movie but all in all it was not a perfect movie at all romance was kinda pointless plot left some to be desired and  it couldve afforded to be a much darker film but heck i liked it
Oct 13 2018,positive,wasnt sure about this movie in the beginning wasnt sure about tom hardy but the movie was excellent full of action tom hardy did a great job very witty and  funny
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie would have been a whole lot better if it were r rated blood and gore was definitely needed in the killingdecapitation scenes but besides all that the movie was great
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it wana see more
Oct 13 2018,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Oct 13 2018,positive,super entertaining funny and action packed 
Oct 13 2018,positive,sony has done venom justice a great different entry in the superantihero genre the non stop but not overwhelming action makes up for the lack of spiderman 
Oct 13 2018,positive,this was fun and demented
Oct 13 2018,neutral,tim hardy amazing script
Oct 13 2018,positive,honestly a lot of fun if youre not over critical  really cool relationship between eddie and venom
Oct 13 2018,positive,based on the reviews i went to see venom reluctantly  i even hated the posters  another bug movie i thought   well i was surprised how good it was  tom hardy was both sexy and goofy and made his character believable  the actions scenes were in your face the way i like them and the cgi was brilliant  its also funny scary and romantic  hard to pull off but the cast and director ruben fleischer managed to pull it all off seamlessly   i also enjoyed the growing relationship between the protagonist eddie brock and the symbiote alien  i want to see more of these characters  not sure why the critics would give this film such low scores  i can only imagine that most were not marvel fans or action film fans and took their resentment out on this very good film  favorite quote no you cannot eat his head
Oct 13 2018,positive,a really nice movie about a antihero that has to deal with disapointment
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom is an absolute success if youre a true marvel fan do not listen to the naysayers on this one just get to the theatre hardy is amazing as per usual and brings his crazy skills to the genre go in with comic book expectations and it will not disappoint venom is the superantihero we need critics be damned
Oct 13 2018,positive,from all the reviews i heard about this movie i wasnt expecting it to be that good with that being said it turned out to be an excellent movie not by any means perfect and definitely not the best superhero movie but it wasnt fact a really good film
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a very good movie sure there was a part here and there but i think its a good movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,per the usual critics have it wrong this film was dark but funny a great take on venom and tom hardy was a solid choice great film looking forward to more
Oct 13 2018,neutral,plenty of flaws but it has its moments itll make you laugh itll make you jump in your seat and it will make you wonder why they chose to do certain things is it worth the ticket price depends if youre just looking for a movie that will entertain you and leave you with a smile then yes
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was very funny and moved a little two fast but still good
Oct 13 2018,positive,this is the room of the comic book movies and thats why its perfect
Oct 13 2018,positive,laughably bad i found it terrible and terribly entertaining 
Oct 13 2018,positive,i dont know what people were expecting but this movie delivered what i was expecting though the chemistry between hardy and williams not really there
Oct 13 2018,positive,one of the best romcoms out there five stars
Oct 13 2018,positive,i give it a c it was entertaining but cant compare to the marvel movies weve all grown custom too the storyline could have been better and his lover could have been different thought the love they displayed was forced overall decent and looking forward to venom carnages rage
Oct 13 2018,positive,i believe that this is an incredible movie the critics judged it off of how it lines up to other series it is its own type of movie remember hes an antihero
Oct 13 2018,positive,top 5 favorite super hero movie critics dont know what theyre talking about this movie was spectacular tom hardy is an excellent fit for this character
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie much watch 2nd best of 2018
Oct 13 2018,positive,despite the critic reviews despite a slow first act with questionable writing and odd pacing issues i thoroughly enjoyed this movie very much it was a hell of a lot of fun especially the banter between eddie and the symbiote together creating venom the hulking terrifying venom by the way was amazing to watch on screen as he is visually portrayed 10 times better than in sm3 the action scenes with venom are great and his dialogue significantly improves upon the aforementioned writing issues in the first 2030 mins venom is badass and i left the theatre smiling pleasantly surprised if youre at all interested in this movie or character dont hesitate and give it a shot
Oct 13 2018,positive,honestly the movie was jumping around and around to scenes and it was sometimes confusing like how did drake get riot was riot one of the 4 symbiotes i had a lot of questions
Oct 13 2018,positive,wasnt bad wasnt bad at all
Oct 13 2018,positive,one of the best movies marvels ever made

Oct 13 2018,positive,amazing connection between eddie and venom
Oct 13 2018,positive,fantastic movie worth every penny
Oct 13 2018,positive,this is one of my favorite movies i liked it more than most of the movies in the mcu i dont know why it has a 30 as of right now but that score does not represent this movie at all if you have not seen it yet i highly recommend it
Oct 13 2018,positive,a lot better than i expected the interaction between the characters made the movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,the effects the cgi the voice of venom everything was action packed and full of awesome scenes while i know people arent a fan of the plot and such i greatly enjoyed this movie and i will definitely come back to see it in theaters again will be buying the dvd too
Oct 13 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics i enjoyed this movie worth going to see
Oct 13 2018,positive,overall a good movie came to watch looking at the review but i was a fun movie with good cast and a really funny venom
Oct 13 2018,positive,great comic book movie i dont understand why there are so many negative reviews it was a blast a fun silly movie funny thrilling and entertaining
Oct 13 2018,positive,the best ive seen in a long time
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved this movie where some things didnt make sense the exploding drones the movie more than made up for with the portrayal of eddie and venoms characters riot may have been your topical villain but his host was relatable extreme but still you understood his motivation i hope to get more venom movies where they can focus on the whole character more and not have to work about origins it was as good as it could be without the r rating and no spiderman i want more of this though again i loved it
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was wonderful i loved every scene as someone who hasnt read the comics just like 90 of the other viewers it was really well done not depending on if you grew up reading them so many jawdropping moments where the cgi was just amazing and the characters were just so charming not made for children obviously because when i walked into the theater there was a good hand full of children under twelve and at least six of them ended up getting too scared of venom by the first thirty minutes tdlr dont bring your kid who cant even handle the trailer amazing in a comady sense beautiful cgi as always amazing movie critics too hard on this film
Oct 13 2018,positive,its an amazing film in my point of view it may feel a bit rushed but everything else was perfect critics dont realize or dont even know what source material is being used for this film venom being chaotic and noisy a bad thing thats what venom truly is he is an antihero thats what makes him venom 
Oct 13 2018,positive,i thought some of the action scenes were exactly what was necessary at certain points in the movie action was placed exactly wherewhen needed
Oct 13 2018,positive,go watch this movie is incredible
Oct 13 2018,positive,liked movie waiting for dvd will buy
Oct 13 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie michelle williams was not my favorite in this movie but she wasnt in very many scenes so i still give this movie 45 stars
Oct 13 2018,negative,venom was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Oct 13 2018,positive,fun movie venom is a riot
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it fun and entertaining i didnt want to see an arthouse movie really enjoyed tom hardy and michelle williams in this take some friends and go see it
Oct 13 2018,positive,really really really fun to watch 
Oct 13 2018,positive,it started nice but became sort of childish afterwards still wasnt bad movie needed to be rated r
Oct 13 2018,negative,a confusing mess of comedy and darker themes creates one of the most disappointing super hero movies ever poor acting by all cast members aside from tom hardy makes this movie unintentionally laughable
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom 2018 was by no means a cinematic masterpiece but it wasnt trying to be what this movie was trying to be was a humorous engaging movie that has fun with the content venom has to offer and i personally believe that it accomplished that    there are some people who believe that the movie does not draw enough from the source material thinking of the comicbook arc in which venom is an antagonist to spiderman however venom as a character has grown beyond that and i felt that the movie highlighted the most important element of the most recent venom comics  the  relationship between eddie brock and the symbiote and venoms eagernesspotential to be a proper antihero    i do not judge films by the standards of a mold they were never trying to fill i think venom 2018 has accomplished what it set out to do and honestly this was the most fun ive had at a movie theater in a long time
Oct 13 2018,positive,very funny movie with enough darkness to give it feeling love venom hes the sappyest depressed evil alien ever
Oct 13 2018,positive,really good movie definitely flawed but fun as hell venom is a really good character
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie was fun to watch i even went back to waste my money 2 times to watch it in the theater again and again the only problem was the villain was too generic gives me no reason why the antagonist came to earth in the first place and why they want to spoiler alert feast on all of humanity
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved the movie best movie 2018 dont listen to the critics
Oct 13 2018,positive,worst movie ive ever seen in my life 1010 my favourite marvel movie of all time
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was good not great to bad sony had to change the origin but i can see when they get spiderman back its going to be a lot of fun
Oct 13 2018,positive,fuck critics they dont even start to grasp what makes a movie great this was good
Oct 13 2018,positive,a very good character development that lets the audience understand make and change views of the different characters  overall a good movie with a perfect easy following story
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom brought the character venom into a new light probably one of the best remakes i have ever seen cant wait to see more
Oct 13 2018,negative,yikes such a damn shame i think they are padding these audience reviews theres no way people actually liked this movie venom says hes sort of a loser on his planet this one too big guy
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it misunderstanding on the trailer as i thought it would be too scary however venom is my new hero completely different than what i was expecting and good i was on the edge of my seat and cant wait for venom 2 venom is the real star is born
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie really unitetion comed
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a lot of fun the reviews are way to negative
Oct 13 2018,positive,never been the type to review a movie but darn it this movie was pretty good i know its bland and like others have said feels like a 90s movie but in this day and age of superheroes and villains sometimes you need something to get you through the day id definitely watch it again just as a refresher of the past
Oct 13 2018,positive,excellent movie great pacing and very nice visuals the best thing this movie does is capture the relationship of venom and eddie brock it is very true to the comics
Oct 13 2018,positive,how this movie should be rated is would you want to watch it again yes would you love to see a second installment yes i was excited after the movie  it wasnt perfect but compared to all other superhero  villain movies it stood out for me
Oct 13 2018,positive,not sure what others are talking about  went to see it with my son and we both found it fun funny and entertaining  even my daughter who is not into marvel thought it was great
Oct 13 2018,positive,absolutely phenomenal should be up for best picture
Oct 13 2018,positive,great marvel movie  a little slow in the beginning character development i assume but overall brilliant
Oct 13 2018,positive,i liked venom a lot but they pushed the humor a little to much
Oct 13 2018,positive,its highly interesting as a romcom under the umbrella of a superhero movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,not sure why people are giving this film a bad review it is just as cheesy and whatever else as all other marvel films but it is at least unique and not 100 action i actually enjoyed this one
Oct 13 2018,positive,no this movie is not perfect but its not trying to be i will say one major complaint i have is that it didnt go far enough it should have been rated r  so that it would be more terrifying than it ended up being sure people die here but it has a tame 90s terror feeling to it which doesnt really suit the older audiences expectations most of us who wanted to see venom are adults the trailer left me with the impression we would at least see some blood but i recall none    that being said the movie was fun hardy had a great performance as expected there was dark humor my favorite and even some adorable romance in the beginning i didnt find anyone to be a bad actor and i found myself quietly berating one of the scientists for not fleeing the situation sure the side characters were mostly forgettable but isnt that normal     my second chief complaint is the length of the film it was just a little too short to satisfy me i didnt find venoms reasoning convincing enough seeing as how he had only spent 2 days with eddie the villian had clear motives he hates humanity but also wasnt villian enough for me even after receiving his own symbiote it may sound grim but i expected way more civilian deaths also the conflict between them and the villian at the end was too short just in general the film felt rushed about halfway in i know sony had the money for more maybe it was the editing but i just didnt see enough character development it felt like the first thor movie good but short     despite all that it was a marvel movie thats what made it fun to watch cgi was as expected though it sas definitely better than dcs justice league the officials critics are digging far too deep into this movie and criticizing it for non issues good movie would watch again
Oct 13 2018,positive,dont know what critics are talking about ive seen it twice in a week and i dont like most superhero flicks
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a good movie idk why people hated it
Oct 13 2018,positive,real good film that left you wanting more not the strongest film but as a first film in a franchise it works really well it looks great and entertained me through out tom hardy does a great job
Oct 13 2018,positive,dont care what critics say i enjoyed this movie it was way better than topher graces puny excuse for venom and tom hardy is spot on for this role
Oct 13 2018,positive,i had low expectations came out excited and wanting to see it again
Oct 13 2018,positive,an exciting movie that excels with the interplay between hardys character and venom it suffers due to lack of character development and racing through plot exposition the villain is very one dimensional whose motive seems to be very stereotypical again this comes down to giving the characters more depth michelle williams does not have a lot to do in this movie however the movie moves at a frenetic pace and the charisma of hardy make this a fun movie not perfect but not bad either
Oct 13 2018,positive,and once again the critics are wrong sure venom might be loud chaotic and noisy but that doesnt make it a bad film its loads of fun and tom hardy is a great eddie brock i highly recommend it
Oct 13 2018,positive,well well well things just got really interesting in the mcu not only is it a major coo for them to get tom hardy into the marvel corner but venom as an origin story is a workable entry   even though the plot is thin the story somewhat predictable to witness tom hardy bringing his onscreen intensity to venom makes it worth the admission his character is the lovable wisecracking loser that we all want to see winkind of a happy middle ground between ant man and deadpool  the first act is all tom hardy establishing the character and all his flaws as a human the second and third acts are pretty much all action the car chase scene is just greatsimple to the point and done well there isnt really much to spoil here as the plotstory are laid out before you like a bachelors banquet tater tots and chocolate   the supporting actors do their best to keep up with mr hardy the cgi is story driven and it works and there is humor galorethere are several times i guffawed emphatically   i just happen to attend the 730p show on a friday night and to watch a film where everyone is into it well thats a joy to behold this is why we go to films at the theater with other people in attendance  to get the whole entertainment experience neatly wrapped as a gift and yes i am comparing venom to a gift honestly i thought infinity war was a little too over the top and somewhat obtuse it didnt work for me venom redeems my faith in the mcu to deliver viable entertainment againwhew that was a close one mcu high five
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie is amazing  love venom
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie had some scenes in it that happened way too quickly the beginning was a bit funky but it was still a great movie
Oct 13 2018,negative,seen the awful reviews beforehand but thought tom hardy mostly makes good choices in terms of movies he takes part in oh how wrong i was very poor script and character development even chase scenes brought no excitement extremely disappointed
Oct 13 2018,positive,really good and underrated movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,its a bad movie but very entertaining
Oct 13 2018,positive,so funny how critics hate this but the people love it people enjoy all types of movies these days since entertainment is so accessible with so many options to choose from but i think people love these superhero movies cuz theyre fun its not too serious not too funny just a good time and we love the superpowers mixed with a creative visual experience it was awesome to see how they used the heroes abilities
Oct 13 2018,positive,this turned out to be a great version of the character critics prove it once again how ing useless they are as a fan of the comic book character i enjoyed this reboot
Oct 13 2018,positive,although the movie has its faults  its extremely entertaining true to the source material and tom hardy is terrific as a man on the brink of breaking
Oct 13 2018,positive,felt disappointed going into the movie due to the films reviews but thoroughly enjoyed it although felt like it needed more detail on what was happening to fully engage myself and emotionally attach myself to the character of venomeddie brock eg spiderman homecoming went into more depth with the character which i felt venom left out
Oct 13 2018,positive,fun slightly twisted great soundtrack and tom hardy is a treasure as always be sure to stay behind for both aftercredit scenes
Oct 13 2018,positive,great job sony and tom hardy in this one the humor and tone of this movie i thought perfectly captured the venom i know from the comics story was well put together and adequately captured who and what venom is i really look forward to what this potential franchise will become and eagerly await the sequel for a first entry the script wasnt perfect but i never expected it to be and its quirks i found to be very lovable i cant express enough how amazing tom hardy was definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero movies and tom hardy as an actor
Oct 13 2018,positive,this is the best marvel movie ive seen so far its funny actionpacked and perfectly brings venom to life
Oct 13 2018,positive,trust the audience a whole lot more on this one it was funny that action was great especially since i normally find action so boring and the plot and acting were all phenomenal i get how pacing may be an issue but honestly that sounds just what standard western hollywood viewing audiences are used too and its not that bad bad at all the villain is a charming sociopath and the characters all get you to feel for them i sat there with a stupid smile on my face throughout it
Oct 13 2018,positive,a sit back and have fun kind of movie absolutely no chemistry between tom hardy and michelle williams though which was distracting still  worth it
Oct 13 2018,positive,its actually really cool they got a nice story good action and i was actually shocked for how good it was
Oct 13 2018,positive,often critics do not really value one simple but very important aspect a movie must keep its promises means a comedy should be funny a suspense thriller should have suspense and a marvel movie should be an entertaining and spectacular even breathtaking show while not being too absurd and venom keeps this promise and it keeps it better than many other marvel productions although the story is lacking some depth but this movie is not intended as emotionally deep drama
Oct 13 2018,positive,its a very amusing fun picture and is very delightful to all comic readers it really shows venoms true colors
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie is simple and entertaining leave your brain at home and just enjoy it wish they would had made it a rated r movie like deadpool but oh well maybe venom 2
Oct 13 2018,positive,signed up for the sole purpose of reviewing this movie   it    is    incredible    seriously i dont see what all the fuss was about great movie would see again the dynamic between brock and venom kept me invested in the movie and the tease at the end has left me eager for more     honestly i dont see why the tomatometer is so low
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom isnt as bad as the critics say it is although it does has its flaws the movie still pulls through as a stable superheroanti hero movie tom hardy and riz ahmed were terrific in this movie and the special effects and particle effects are the best ive seen in a while lets talk about the main attraction the symbiotes  venom and riot the symbiotes look brilliant in this movie and adds a era of unease every time they are on screen especially riot who looks really menacing the special effects team really need a round of applaud
Oct 13 2018,negative,as much as seeing a comic book villain achieving a movie on himself venom does have a few comedic lines and his action scenes are passable but for his characternot at all there sadly
Oct 13 2018,positive,awesome movie tom hardy is a great actor visuals cgi are good this movie doesnt need spiderman in it
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy delivers
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie starts rather slowly especially considering how fast it gets towards the end but the middle of the movie is where it shines the main character reacts how any person would react for the most part and the conversations are very funny and the action is great to look at    definitely not a movie for critics but reccomended for average movie goer
Oct 13 2018,positive,saw it loved it will be buying it
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was amazing there was ample character introductions and a good amount of character development the movie was well paced and included a variety of comedy that i found simply hilarious this is a good movie for anyone who enjoys a hero action movie or would like to something with a different take on action it makes no sense as to why people are so negative towards this movie i think their just hurt about spider man not carrying the lead role this movie carried itself well with eddie and venom being the leads to their own story i highly recommend this movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,a pretty fun movie with no character development 
Oct 13 2018,positive,much better than i thought it would be tom hardy killed it with his role definitely worth watching
Oct 13 2018,positive,liked it a lot would recommend it
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie cant wait for more sequels
Oct 13 2018,positive,good movie really slow in the beginning but  once it picked up the movie got better and more fun to watch
Oct 13 2018,positive,a great depiction of venom didnt expect the comedy but it worked well i highly recommend going out and watching it
Oct 13 2018,positive,was really good lots of comedy and pretty cool effects
Oct 13 2018,positive,long time spiderman fan great movie that showed venoms humanity  only downside is carnage isnt in the movie also
Oct 13 2018,negative,when is a movie not a movie how do you make a bad movie worse after the predator i thought i was done with studio intervention movies for the year i was wrong this disaster of movie barely holds together as the scenes that remain skirt you across a landscape of clips it may have funny beats but they pass by so fast you can barely catch them one of the worst villains
Oct 13 2018,positive,this was a great alternate spin to his actual origin this new universe brings a new light to eddy brock the disappointment is the pg13 rating that was a hold back on the movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved it i have been a diehard venom fan from my first venom encounter i was dubious after seeing critic reviews and went in fairly open minded  i have two thoughts on this i feel as like with predator films some filmscharacters are so iconic that they will never measure up to expectationsoriginals i understand that sony didnt use back story for venom and im glad spiderman wasnt included as straight away this would become a spiderman film  i thought the content was a beautiful mix of source material or nods to and original ideas i thought the build up was perfect giving time to bond pardon the pun to a superbly cast tom hardy as eddie brock and once venom got in full swing i was loving the character struggle and psychotic violence  if had had to find criticism brock didnt want the venom symbiote to start with thus leading to the bonding scenario like he did in comics  but this is quickly overcome by the realisation of a benefit of mutual partnership so well worked around and venom used the word i once instead of we  my only serious criticism is i could have sat through another half an hour of this to allow to flesh out the plot a little better but thats not a bad thing   so moving forward venom 2  longer movie for a strong plot  keep the franchise coming i loved it and cant wait to see it again
Oct 13 2018,positive,thought it was great not perfect but what movie is would watch again
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it funny cheesy and very entertaining 
Oct 13 2018,positive,i note the professionals downgraded this  but the audiences liked it tom hardy shows his acting skills and the film mixes scifi with a bit of humour just well enough to keep on track  the creature is amazing i a very enjoyable watch
Oct 13 2018,positive,amazing film will love to see more films
Oct 13 2018,negative,it was okay really thought it was gonna be more ravenous instead gave a us a kitten like preformance plus the real venom would never call himself a loser
Oct 13 2018,positive,well rounded awsomenessss
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved it the comedic bits were genuinely funny each interaction between eddie and venom well done and fun to watch venom didnt look cheesy like some cgi characters do i would go see the movie again and recommend other to go see it
Oct 13 2018,positive,slow start in the beginning i guess they needed it to establish rock bottom for eddie give him uber loser status things definitely picked up once venom showed up overall entertaining and a nice small edition into the mcu my appreciation for michelle williams has grown exponentially really funny cameo by stan lee 
Oct 13 2018,positive,its structured so well theres something for everyone there romance heartbreak action bad vs evil everything to make a movie amazing it has
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved venom i thought it was a great marvel film that i think compares to the mcu films i thought the film was great as it had many genres of film in it including humour action and even a bit of a horror aspect to would definitely recommend it
Oct 13 2018,positive,people are expecting too much everything in is time people perfect movie 
Oct 13 2018,positive,all yall need to learn how to enjoy a good monster romcom
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it then again i loved the super mario bros movieso yeah find out for yourself if you like it dont take my opinion cause i love anything trash or not but venom wasnt trash pretty good would watch again
Oct 13 2018,positive,some parts were dumb some parts were fun
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a good movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,this film was awesome the fight scenes were great and great story probably
Oct 13 2018,positive,dont buy the critics who reviewed the movie these critics want to see a spiderman in venom and they gave it that score because to try to get sony their spiderman back but you know what they arent getting their spiderman back this movie is a really good movie make no mistake but sony needs to give venom to marveldisney with tom hardy not because of its bad but to have a proper storyline again dont buy the critics they are biased about this movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,funny action pack and for venom fans huge things are good
Oct 13 2018,positive,well the movie is aint as bad as critics saymy only complaint is the last fight was short
Oct 13 2018,positive,its the perfect trash comedy that makes you laugh your ass off
Oct 13 2018,positive,such a great movie venom was great and in my opinion didnt need spider man look at spider man 3 for example that movie blows
Oct 13 2018,positive,i thought this movie was cool i really enjoyed it and will see it again
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom is the best movie i have seen in a long time its better then avengers infinity war
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie wasnt good but it was strangely enjoyable and it dragged a bit in the beginning but i loved the buddy cop relationship and really want a sequal
Oct 13 2018,positive,tom hardy is great as venom and the movie is full of action great special effects
Oct 13 2018,positive,this film has more holes than a cheese grater and plenty of problems with the narrative and story line but its also charming and hilariously funny and good super hero flick fun absolute trash i want to watch again and again
Oct 13 2018,positive,the plot the side characters and the villain are boring but the comedy special effects and the relationship between eddie and venom make the movie worth to watch in cinema
Oct 13 2018,positive,i give this movie a b   critics were way too hard
Oct 13 2018,positive,hardy provided a funny witty and entertaining portrayal of venom and eddie brock this puts the spiderman 3 version of brock to shame as most believed it would this being said the supporting casts script came up short and ultimately was the only down side of this movie because of corny lines the cgi effects of all of the symbiotes were great and venom was made out to look like venom should a huge terrifying character unlike topher graces version who could have been mistaken for spiderman 45 stars only because of the supporting casts script
Oct 13 2018,positive,610  without tom hardy this movie could be worse the final cut cut everything out the overall story felt so rushed ill need to see the uncut version
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics and go see it
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was all i ever wanted it to be  my only issue is that it should of been rated r and been more eaty and stabby  this movie feels like it was made for a 2008 audience like could you imagine this movie coming out in 08  it would have crushed in 08  think of this movie next to the first iron man  08 venom would of attracted a much different and often alienated  audience to the mcu a group of folks that just want to see baddies get sucked into an alien digestive track tom hardy did it in this role like no one else could of i loved the symbiotes personality and character development  4 out of 5 cause no r rating   eat live and pray long live the parasite
Oct 13 2018,positive,honestly a lot of people say its bad but its actually better than i expected it was a hilarious movie and i really loved it now stop hating
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was such a disappointment movie i was expecting more actions the villain was not a very bad guy
Oct 13 2018,positive,venoms interaction and relationship with eddie brock was arguable the best part of the film driving most of venom and eddie brocks character development
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was amazing for a cgi movie i cant wai for the sequel
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom is a great movie that my brother and i enjoyed thoroughly you guys are just cowards   critics are complaining about the action scenes but i enjoyed them and thought they were great regardless of whether or not they couuld have been improved upon not only are they complaining about the action but also the comedy ive seen some reviews essentially saying that venom couldnt choose between an action or a comedy film but i thought that the movie had a very good mix of both   my final thoughts on the movie as a whole i would absolutely go see it again its probably one of my favorite movies
Oct 13 2018,positive,venom was a great movie its just not the critics cup of tea
Oct 13 2018,positive,i like this movie a lot
Oct 13 2018,positive,best superhero movie in a long time unpretentious relevant entertaining and fun
Oct 13 2018,positive,pretty good movie  it shouldve been r rating movie tho i enjoyed it but wanted more venom jokes and screen time didnt like the beginning ark tho
Oct 13 2018,positive,the plot is stupid but tom hardy and the action scenes make it one of the more enjoyable superhero flicks ive seen in years
Oct 13 2018,positive,its ok movie but what save it is tom hardy
Oct 13 2018,positive,great show despite the critics reviews
Oct 13 2018,positive,you think that venom become a video game i think it would be great
Oct 13 2018,positive,just saw it and this movie was pretty entertaining  a bit cliche maybe but still a lot of fun
Oct 13 2018,positive,not the worst marvel adaptation it was good fun 
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie was fantastic we had low expectations due to reviews the reviews got it wrong
Oct 13 2018,positive,excellent film the relationship eddie and venom the high point of the film with a good dose of humor would easily fit the standards of the films of marvel
Oct 13 2018,negative,very bad movie only hardy saves the game there are no more pluses special effects are poor the installation is ragged the cameraman is weak the action is simply zero it is not desirable for viewing
Oct 13 2018,positive,critics i guess didnt get the memo that not all comic book based movies need to be perfect adaptations and exactly what you expect why the mcu has gotten pretty boring and im pretty sure these are based on the newer comic run anyway     anyways go see venom fun dark romantic comedy
Oct 13 2018,positive,this wasnt the best hero movie i have ever seen but at the same time it wasnt the worst one either this is a movie that i would go see with friends to have a good time this wasnt a movie i was going into and expecting it to be avengers infinity war good it was just another hero movie and i enjoyed it would go see again and will go see the sequel
Oct 13 2018,positive,amazing movie good comedy good action
Oct 13 2018,positive,enjoyed it better than infinity war
Oct 13 2018,positive,awesome and enjoyable movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,my first time seeing a movie in dbox from cinemark loved it visually great 
Oct 13 2018,positive,movie was amazing yeah it didnt go the way we thought it was going to go due to what previous spiderman movies showed about how venom came to bejust know that the movie is worth watching
Oct 13 2018,positive,first of all i dont understand why other critics always find for mistakes flaws and things that will not satisy them when evaluating a movie    the story line is great i like how script will be connected on the upcoming spiderman movie homecoming the comedy is just right the action scenes are instense and the characters are great     i dont want to spoil anything like what others did ecause this movie is worth watching for and better to see it for yourself instead of reading the negatrons review
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy made by far turned it from a meh into great
Oct 13 2018,positive,so glad this movie wasnt made by garbage disney 
Oct 13 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie i have been a long time fan of venom and was so thrilled to finally get to see iit i was not disappointed and cant wait for the next one 
Oct 13 2018,positive,very good dont see in dolby its too loud of a movie its not perfect but its a lot of fun and it refreshing to see a stand alone super hero movie that isnt trying to set up for avengers or justice league
Oct 13 2018,positive,so bad that it was good
Oct 13 2018,positive,overall i enjoyed it wasnt shit wasnt amazing but overall it had good parts with good action and fun jokes deffinetly worth teh watch dont listen to the critics
Oct 13 2018,neutral,its a marvel flick not their bestthe second half is better than the first with a more pg13 deadpool humor it lacked something to give it the umph were accustom to with marvel the final final scene ends up being an advertisement for another show tho lame  
Oct 13 2018,positive,i skipped the gym to go see this movie with several friends and neednt have worried about missing my core workout because i laughed so hard it was basically the same as doing a couple sets of crunches i was afraid to drink water for fear the next scene line of dialogue the next mere twitch of tom hardys oddly and permanently sweaty face would cause me to spray and mist the row in front in childhood i had a slight problem with my lungs that occasionally rears its head when i laugh too hard and this movie nearly killed me in a year where mama mia got a sequel i didnt think id be referring to any other movie as the best romcom of the year but here it is two hours and change of tom hardy wandering about with a new yorkish accent that made me inexplicably think of mickey mouse wearing an everexpanding rufflike stain of sweat about the neck and riz ahmed flashing his bambi eyes at the audience as he for some reason plays his villainous role straight michelle williams is there with a symbiote of her own in the form of a wig that looks like it was stolen from a group of theater kids whose thesis project was a satire of suburban moms at a bake sale  at one point hardy climbs into a lobster tank and yells conspiracy theories in between bites of a fresh lobster weve all been there im sure the titular glob of goo is a delight  abusing and cajoling and ultimately comforting hardy from one end of the adventure to the other  their relationship is one of the healthiest and mutually supportive  ive ever seen in marvel and are a breath of fresh air in what is otherwise a bit of a stale bythenumbers weve got to have our mandatory awkward flirting scenes as the padding between the action scenes romances weve seen so far they do by the way make out venom and hardy i couldnt tell you what it looked like because at that point i was gasping on the sticky floor like a fish on a dock but it sounded very passionate    if you are having a bad day go see venom those twoish hours did more for my depression than three years of talk therapy
Oct 13 2018,positive,everything i wanted to see in a venom movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved this movie very glad i didnt listen to critics this movie has a good origin story with funny humor and great fight scenes 
Oct 13 2018,positive,i actually really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend a viewing not entirely sure why the critics score is so lowmaybe its time we get some new critics
Oct 13 2018,positive,tom hardy is awesome in this
Oct 13 2018,positive,3 stars out of 5 for tom hardys venom it was pretty good i can understand critics comments i do believe that it needed more gore and more action but this was not a terrible film i am looking forward to see where this goes i really would like to see where this goes
Oct 13 2018,positive,the ever charismatic tom hardy makes this solo venom journey worth the while  keen to see what carnage would bring next bring on the symbiote story
Oct 13 2018,positive,the movie was great in my opinion there were some things that couldve gone better but overall the movie was amazing great story great execution great character development heck id even want to become venom if this was real
Oct 13 2018,positive,the critics can suck my toes on this one because this is without a doubt my new favourite movie  we need lgbt representation in movies and god damn this is the way to do it an excellent romcom with great humour graphics and things are always moving to keep you on board this movie exceeded my expectations and all i can hope for its future is that it doesnt get a sequel because that will ruin it
Oct 13 2018,negative,the movie is bad but you can still enjoy it definitely worth watching thow
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie is great a perfect film to be set without spiderman it literally doesnt really need spiderman in it this movie explains that i can perfect it without any connection i mean sure some parts make no sense but in the end its still a great film and out of 10 its definitely at least a 8510 in my honest opinion
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was a good movie its weird how the audience liked it but the critics hated it it wasnt perfect had a few things you might not like but good movie 
Oct 13 2018,positive,i went with no expectations and had a fun time recommend
Oct 13 2018,positive,very exciting movie ive heard negative review stigma about venom but i was surprised and pleased with the movie 
Oct 13 2018,neutral,no character developmentfelt rushedacting was sub pardidnt really get the portrayal of tom hardys characteri dont think he did either venom the character was great and the movie was funbut not your typical marvel movie felt more like dc
Oct 13 2018,positive,good movie lots of action and tight humor
Oct 13 2018,positive,tom hardy did an excellent job with this role it is a true representation of venom from the comics and maximum carnage pretty sure the sequel will have to be rated r 
Oct 13 2018,negative,okay for me it is fun to see tom hardy have a funny interaction with venom but that actually it for the movie this movie is all about how venom got to meet his host eddie brock and then beat the bad guy which is enjoyable or fun for someone that wants to passed time for me to watch this movie and enjoy it i have to take off my brain and be a 12yearold kid that is fun watching two big black monsters fight each other it is a good movie to passed time for me yeah that literally it there is nothing more to this movie
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie starts off a bit slow but really picks it up i dont know what those bloody critics were thinking when they gave it 30  jesus
Oct 13 2018,positive,was a well put together movie funny and unexpected the trailer doesnt even show half of what the movie has to offer i was please to see the development of venoms character very enjoyable
Oct 13 2018,positive,i loved this movie  it had great dialogueincredible action and unexpected funny moments i hope theres a sequel
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie was fun stays true to the anthero venom even though the story wasnt that good its a fun movie better than what we got in 2004 also critics have you ever read the comics venom is chaotic and noisey and its based on the antihero version of venom which doesnt show spiderman you need to read that before you state what you thought and also soney wasnt aloud to show spiderman at least for now because there cant be 2 live action spiderman the fans will get confused
Oct 13 2018,positive,i thought it was amazing the action was create story line was the same as other marvel films
Oct 13 2018,positive,the critics are a bunch of fing idiots if you like tom hardy venom and damn good action scenes watch the movie you wont regret it we didnt
Oct 13 2018,positive,i dont understand the critics hate for this at all 
Oct 13 2018,positive,as one who grew up with venom as their favorite anti hero i greatly enjoyed the film venom was true to the original concept of the character and eddie brock had an accurate beginning to what led him to become the anti hero that we loved to see its astonishing how the critics hated the film yet the audience enjoyed it i would recommend avoiding any kind of review out there and watch the film yourself and let your own opinions and beliefs help create your criticism of the movie and not allow a review skew or lower any expectations
Oct 13 2018,neutral,major flaws in the movie not the worst movie though but still its reasonable its in the 30
Oct 13 2018,positive,this movie is a great example on why you shouldnt always rely on the critics this movie is for both who know venom well and those who dont even know wth it is yes it has flaws and it isnt a masterpiece but its probably one of 2018 most enjoyable movies its comedy hits the character of venom spot on from some of his original comics and although it isnt rated r it does well to make up for it so give it a try and take your gf to watch this she just enjoy it as much as you do
Oct 13 2018,negative,such a waste of a brilliant character and great cast this film desperately tries to be deadpool but the pg attempts at humour massively miss the mark none of the characters are well developed and the storyline is somehow rushed yet sluggish strangely despite the budget the visual effects also look cheap and unimpressive
Oct 13 2018,positive,i usually hate superhero flicks because the stakes are nonexistent they were entirely absent in venom as well but i like tom hardy so much i really didnt care hes a joy to watch on the screen and he was here too that being said start making superheroes vulnerable to attack or stop wasting our time when someone cant be killed there is zero tension its just choreographed dance with fake blood and loud explosions
Oct 13 2018,positive,nothing spectacular plotwise but great action great acting and so so funny
Oct 13 2018,positive,it started a lil slow but it was very good and entertaining after it got going left me wanting more
Oct 13 2018,positive,absolutely loved it cant wait for part two hope it is r rated though
Oct 13 2018,negative,oh dear they could have really made something good here but instead its just a total mess avoid
Oct 13 2018,positive,fun ride but illogical in its world
Oct 13 2018,positive,the whole family liked it
Oct 13 2018,positive,as much as i wanted and continue to hope to see spiderman in this franchise it was still great movie as much as an r rating would have made this movie ten times better the relationship between brock and venom was always entertaining as were the action sequences cant wait to see more hopefully with some web swinging action in the mix
Oct 13 2018,positive,its funny but sometimes the inner dialog between eddie and venom is kinda grayish  hope disney will pick up the sequel because i want to see carnage
Oct 13 2018,positive,awesome movie somewhat of a buddy comedy between eddie and venom as well super fun to watch and the performances are great
Oct 13 2018,positive,a lot of people hate on this movie for some reason but i really dont care it was an amazing movie as far as im concerned the only negative thing i can say about it is that it was way to short should have been 5 hours long
Oct 13 2018,negative,worst movie of the year easily script is weak story is lazy tom hardy is an amazing actor to play such a terrible character its a shame these major production companies get to ruin all the good film concepts
Oct 13 2018,positive,i thought it was a fantastic film cant wait for the sequel
Oct 13 2018,positive,great movie had lots of fun with the action and the back and forth between brock and venom was fun to watch
Oct 13 2018,neutral,it was not what i thought it would be kinda let down 
Oct 13 2018,positive,loved it great relationship between eddie and venom also an interesting plot dont listen to the critics watch it for yourself
Oct 13 2018,negative,a complete let down for a stand alone villain movie this should have been venoms time to shine however he got covered up by poor jokes over dramatics and childish antics there should have been more gore instead of another dull marvel movie love story snore venom could be toned down a bit in a spider man crossover but this should have been pure rage and violence he isnt your hero he is a chaos machine and after the dust settled spiderman should have been posed on the side of a building ready to start a fight cut next movie all in all complete garbage
Oct 13 2018,positive,awesome movie definitely enjoyed it
Oct 13 2018,positive,it was wildly fun movie i was almost apprehensive to watch it because of how much sony messed up the previous marvel films but with marvel stepping in this time it came out really good dont know how true it holds to the actually stories from the comics but this movie and story was very well put together
Oct 13 2018,positive,the entire theater laughed too many times to count some of the best cgi ive seen accurate to the comics as far as i can tell tom hardy was great loved it these critics dont know what theyre talking about if star wars the last jedi got 94 but audience said 40 venom deserves at least 90 even though the critics are saying 32 critics find a new job you are bad at yours
Oct 12 2018,positive,such a fun great movie i enjoy it
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thought it was really coolthe cgi was good cant wait for venom 2 carnage
Oct 12 2018,positive,the movie was a allround good comedy and i loved the voice overs that tom hardy has with himself
Oct 12 2018,positive,i strongly do not agree with what the critics are saying i can see their point of view but we really need to judge the movie the way the creators wanted it to be judged since we pretty much knew what to expect before it got out  the movie is enjoyable and fun to watch its clear that not having anything to do with the comics alienates the hardcore fans however though this brings more casual movie viewers into the universe which to my opinion is a good thing  the relationship between tom hardy and venom is pretty much perfect to me and it surely spikes the interest as to how can this relationship really work and evolve  the movie unfortunately was short and the plot was wear i have to mention that but to me it was clear that they were using this one as a pilot to introduce a strong movie and characters in the potential venom 2   overall is a great movie i can see the critics point of view but for me it is not necessary to criticize the movie in this way at all go watch and have fun a solid 45 stars from me
Oct 12 2018,positive,a good quality movie with what to me seems like good character moment with great moments of badassry
Oct 12 2018,negative,tom hardy was great riz ahmed did as good a job as you can do with the way that character was written the problem though is everything is written poorly if it could be cliche it is if they were supposed to explain something it maybe happens in one piece of dialogue nobody has a logical motivation especially the titular character being motivated to be good things just kinda happen and then theres an action bit most of these are pretty good to be fair except the final fight with the big bad they look too similar and at some points are a bit liquidy and its impossible to easily tell which is which add in a couple randomly placed ads and its as generic as they could do there is nothing original or inspired in the film it just is due to the lack of care i development of the story this is perfect for passive viewing and makes excellent mystery science theater material for more active viewers overall its not worth a ticket price
Oct 12 2018,positive,i like it but to many flashing lights and i would love a venom and carnage movie that has good writers and a new directer let the movie be great
Oct 12 2018,neutral,lots and lots of unnecessary foul language
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was so good and action packed not one slow time and hilarious 
Oct 12 2018,positive,this is a great entertaining movie put aside all the expectations you might have from previous marvel movies and just enjoy a solid action and humorous film
Oct 12 2018,positive,overall good movie coulda been better if it was rated r and if spiderman was in it
Oct 12 2018,positive,very enjoyable movie  would totally watch it again waiting for venom2
Oct 12 2018,positive,i love this show graphics are good cgi on point nice story line interesting characters good acting i only do not like the draggy start other than that all good
Oct 12 2018,neutral,fun movie to watch and tom hardy killed it however plot was shallow and had a lot of plot holes also the conversations between eddie and venom varied from great to extremely annoying 
Oct 12 2018,positive,ive been essentially wanting to see this movie for over twenty years  its no wolverine and its definitely got more of a cult classic feeling to it than deadpool but if you love venom and are actually familiar with his long history then this is a good investment
Oct 12 2018,positive,overall a good movie a outstanding performance by tom hardy
Oct 12 2018,negative,bad acting boring characters eddie brock sucked villain sucked story and origin was a joke venom and his voice were great though
Oct 12 2018,positive,tons of fun dont listen to the idiot reviewers like usual
Oct 12 2018,positive,really great build up and character development with action packed ending not just senseless action the whole time fantastic acting must see
Oct 12 2018,negative,mindless action that neglects the emotional complexities of brock and parkers relationship
Oct 12 2018,positive,enjoyed this movie thoroughly came into it convinced id hate it from the poor reception but ended up loving it eddie and venom have great chemistry
Oct 12 2018,negative,good popcorn flick little to no depth very messy good movie for the common audience 
Oct 12 2018,positive,perfect aside from the bad accent work by hardy
Oct 12 2018,positive,much better than i thought very entertaining as well 
Oct 12 2018,neutral,i think the movie was ehhhh at best i wanted to see more of venom and eddie together also more of that dark charming humor and i would of loved this also this movie doesnt really need a spiderman it did have some funny moments but not enough sadly
Oct 12 2018,positive,idk what critics didnt like movie was the perfect antispiderman
Oct 12 2018,positive,story could be better but was entertaining non the less
Oct 12 2018,positive,absolutely loved it
Oct 12 2018,positive,this movie was amazing i just saw it today and it was alot of fun this movie was fantastic the relationship with eddie and venom the score the cgi idk y ppl are giving it such crappy score this movie was great and if you hated it your high
Oct 12 2018,positive,i liked it more than i thought i would
Oct 12 2018,positive,better than deadpool
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom is a great movie they stuck to the source material and i believe the fact there is no spiderman made them more creative its a new story and narrative venom is his own character
Oct 12 2018,positive,i had no expectations for this movie and was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie i do have a few gripes about it i wish they had gone more violent with venom but looking forward to more
Oct 12 2018,positive,just a fan movie perfect visual efects just have to wait to the second part
Oct 12 2018,positive,nobody channels eddie brock  venom like tom hardy nobody    as someone who had hundreds of spiderman comics when i was younger i even owned a copy of amazing spiderman 300 featuring the first full appearance of venom this is the perfect venom origin story and when i see tom hardy as eddie brock venoms alter ego it makes me feel happy contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote     in the comics eddie brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast is unsure of himself and gets even more confused initially when venom entered his life and tom hardy channels eddie brock to perfection venom in the comics had some darkish humour and the humour that venom spouts in the movie is spot on  in fact venom gets the best one liners and the biggest laughs from the audience the movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between eddie brock and venom and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie     the cgi for venom is also spot on making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts it makes venom look cool and dangerous at the same time the pacing is just right and tom hardys versatility as an actor really stole the show so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show     and the postcredit sneak preview is one to die for  i definitely want to see the next venom  itll be cgi carnage    peeps forget the previous incarnation of venom this is the real deal possibly the best movie ive seen in 2018 to date stuff the stuffy professional critics they havent had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies  much like the fake news go watch venom its da bomb
Oct 12 2018,positive,saw with friends without any knowledge of ratings or reviews i was very impressed with the over all tone and balance of comedy and action absultely loved the character interation as well will most certainly be preordering the blueray
Oct 12 2018,negative,worst movie ever because of the way they butchered venom in this movie they turn the most badass villain in the spiderman world into another carbon copy of spiderman
Oct 12 2018,positive,listen ignore the critics its such a fun enjoyable movie its hilarious and actually has you on the edge of your seat the entire time i had the time of my life watching this movie all of the characters are relatable and likable the stunts are insane too it was a surprisingly good movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,not a mustsee in theaters but an exciting action movie that i would certainly recommend once it is on demand
Oct 12 2018,positive,great entertaining movies should be rated r hopefully we get more seeds on a digital release
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thought it was good it was refreshing and reminded me of tim burtons batman a little i enjoyed the humour it should have been rated r so that the humour could have been a little more provocative and to allow more alienthe thinglike violence im looking forward to the sequel
Oct 12 2018,positive,the gap between what the critics think of this movie and the rating actual people give it is hilarious i think everyone going into this movie knows what theyre wanting and they get it this isnt an avenger movie or somethingand people might be getting tired of that so they want something different boy do you get something different
Oct 12 2018,positive,excellent movie   would see again  1010
Oct 12 2018,positive,instead of hewing to the sober grimdark tone that so many action movies strike these days venom offers a refreshingly humorous take on a complex antihero in fact it is more in line with thor ragnarok or antman in terms of its lighthearted banter the movie still delves into some darker subject matter albeit in the blackandwhite morality of a mainstream super hero story the chemistry between the titular venom and his host is simply amazing and by the end of the movie both characters are so humanized that they are lovable despite their superhuman power and questionable moral code
Oct 12 2018,positive,this film is on par with xmen 1 or raimis spiderman 1 movies that critics and viewers loved without  question unfortunately it has come out post mcu it may be a bit long in the tooth during the introduction but the jaws style of savoring the symbiote is actually a positive dont worry about having a deep nuanced film going experience and just let loose and have some fun   also dont  forget its easy to judge a film when you dont have to pay for a screening the real fans paid to go and its up to them to decide if its worth it
Oct 12 2018,positive,love tom hardy and loved the movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,having venom without spiderman is a bit of a risk for sony but i really think they pulled it off and made venom a very entertaining film and a great flagship for other features in their own spidey universe  the story does have some issues with a dragging narrative like a lot of origin stories do and some of the action was hard to make out due to its chaotic nature and most of it taking place in the dark with a dark colored character  however the tone of the film is a great example of a dark comedy the story is solid the special effects are fantastic and tom hardy is amazing to watch  overall i really enjoyed the film    hello  the name is rev ron and if you feel like checking out more of my reviews including a more indepth look at venom you can visit my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom  also if the mood strikes you can follow me on twitter revronster  thanks
Oct 12 2018,positive,a little dark but loads of fun dont get why the critics dont like itits an action movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,way more funny than i was expecting 
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was an okay movie 
Oct 12 2018,positive,simply i did enjoy it  no it is not a venom story that i expected but i did enjoy it
Oct 12 2018,positive,thereelnesscom the first standalone film for the titular marvel comics character stars tom hardy mad max fury road dunkirk as the streetwise investigative reporter who stumbles upon and gets infected by the parasitic alien creature brought back from a private space mission  a mission orchestrated by an evil genius riz ahmed using san franciscos homeless population as guinea pigs to test his wacky theory to meld humans with the alien creatures so they can live in outer space um okay venom is the perfect brainless saturday afternoon matinee  silly to the point of utter ridiculousness with one dimensional characters and a sloppy holeriddled paintbythenumbers superhero script that is super moronic but none of that matters because it is surprisingly and stupidly entertaining fans of comic book films will no doubt gobble up the sony pictures cgi effects and action sequences like the cinematic junk food that it is as the film gives new meaning to the phrase bite your head off b
Oct 12 2018,positive,funny and entertaining
Oct 12 2018,positive,as a long time venom fan it was finally time for him to be on the big screen  unlike spiderman 3s venom this version of venom is more true to the character  the movie was over all good  action was nice and how eddy transformed into venom was also well done  tom did a fantastic job playing eddy brock in this film and his banter with venom mad it that much better  everything about venom was done right except for a few things i will get to in a minute  if you enjoy comics super heros or wonder about their villains  this movie is for you  if you enjoy the character venom youll enjoy this
Oct 12 2018,positive,not every superhero movie needs to be a comedy  personally i thought it was a fresh change and i have high hopes for sonys new marvel universe
Oct 12 2018,positive,i was nervous with the scores but i know scifi and fantasy movies seem to always be hit hard amongst critics   having no experience with venom other than seeing pictures and that little taste from the tobey macquire spiderman i wasnt prepared for laughing or liking venom   i loved seeing tom hardys character and venom both he plays interacting hilariously its over the top at some point and ridiculous but in a way that makes you smile and love it more   michelle williams did well but her wig drove me crazy we can make a computer generated alien but we are still using wigs that dont move in a realistic wayor at all   spoiler    i am psyched for carnage but unsure how i feel about woody playing him and yet another shitty wig lol     i will be buying this and in line for the next ignore the critics and decide for yourself
Oct 12 2018,positive,very entertaining tom hardy played eddie brock perfectly 
Oct 12 2018,positive,such a great movie the first time in a long time that i decided not to take a nap half way through the movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,the movie was fun to watch and generally entertaining in many ways its not a revolutionary film but its better than the formulaic foundations that super hero movies seem to be following these days and much better than any dc film in recent memory
Oct 12 2018,positive,critics are wrong this movie was awesome
Oct 12 2018,positive,there are a few problems with this movie but it is still an entertaining watch
Oct 12 2018,positive,a super fun movie packed with elements of jump scares but at the same time suitable for an eight year old boy to claim as his new favorite movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was an enjoyable movie but i think we could of had something better from marvel
Oct 12 2018,positive,marvel fans will continue to hate but venom is a fun movie the action balanced with the comedy perfectly
Oct 12 2018,positive,one of the best films in years better than all of the mcu crap made in the past few years exception being infinity war and black panther
Oct 12 2018,positive,best movie this year
Oct 12 2018,neutral,better then i thought lot of room for improvement 
Oct 12 2018,positive,easily on par with the first deadpool movie it starts off slowly and shows greatness as everything ties together give this movie a chance the critics are baloney
Oct 12 2018,negative,terrible effects script and acting
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved itttt so funny and cuteee i wanna be venom for halloween now
Oct 12 2018,positive,humor and entertainment hand in hand loved it
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom was a great movie and much better than i expected from all the negativity going around about it it wasnt insanely dark which i think may have thrown off some critics it was an overall engaging and surprisingly funny movie i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 12 2018,positive,people hate on this movie for the dumbest and smallest reasons for no reason i thought that the end scene introducing carnage as a villain in a new movie coming soon
Oct 12 2018,positive,i can definitely see where a film critic would sneer at the pacing of major plot points andor the rampant switching between humor  romance and action but i cant help being entertained 910 would watch again
Oct 12 2018,positive,another enjoyable marvel movie 
Oct 12 2018,positive,as a long time spiderman and especially venom fan this movie in my opinion deilvers the venom i have always wanted to see on the big screen i went into the movie with incredibly low expectations because of all the flak i had been hearing however after having just watched the movie i would say to any one mauling over the idea of going to see it please take the plunge ignoring the particularly petty reviews to deliberately portray venom in a negative light on behalf of some random people with an agenda i honestly have a really hard time seeing what all the negativity is based on on behalf of the professional critic demographic but hey im not a movie critic but what i am is a huge fan with alot of love for this character had a thing for venom since i was about 6 or 7 and i think that gives me at least some platform to say this movie hit the mark depending on what youre expecting out of the movie from a fans perspective there is definitely room for criticism however  if you take comic lines into account such as venom lethal protector which the movie parallels to some degree i think there is alot of room to highly praise this envisioning of venom not to mention tom hardy along with the rest of the cast did a phenomenal job in my humble opinion anyways again please give the movie a chance despite what you may hear i think this movie can satisfy long time venom fans such as myself while at the same time possessing the potential to foster in a new generation of venom fans
Oct 12 2018,positive,the critics were a bit harsh this was a very entertaining movie with good acting average story but great characters and effects 
Oct 12 2018,negative,this is a bad movie dont let anyone tell you different its a total trainwreck but no one ever said trainwrecks were boring
Oct 12 2018,positive,when i read these top critics i sometimes think they are watching a different movie then i do  was the movie entertaining hell yea did the plot make sense  yes it did did it have all the cool bells and whistles of a super hero movie absolutely i think with the marvel universe coming to life weve become a bit spoiled with superpowers and mind boggling spectacles  venom feels different it feels good  if you dont like this movie maybe venom should bite your head off
Oct 12 2018,negative,entertaining but not a good movie 
Oct 12 2018,positive,i wasnt expecting much from this movie when i first went to see it however i had a subtle surprise by venom it had an interesting story with tom hardy as eddie brock who i think did an incredible job portraying his fear and confusion however riz ahmed as carlton drake i feel was a lazy villain i think critics are being overly critical on this movie and it deserves a much higher rating
Oct 12 2018,negative,started off well but at the end venom is just a generic overthetop and rushed antihero film that benefits from tom hardys crazy performance but is ultimately forgettable
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved it could of been better with the colors but still great for a sony movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,good movie altogether it delivers and fulfills the missing fan request for a true venom movie 
Oct 12 2018,positive,fun movie i actually really liked it
Oct 12 2018,positive,i am definitely in the minority here but besides the weird script i would say venom was very correct towards the comic and the cgi was not bad at all
Oct 12 2018,positive,i dont understand the bad reviews because this movie is perfect and i love it tom hardy was amazing and the movie is outstanding i definitely recommend it i would love for there to be a sequel i also enjoyed the relationship between eddie and venom
Oct 12 2018,positive,love it so much havent see this kind of movie for a long time
Oct 12 2018,positive,tom hardy was great the action was great seeing venom on the big screen was great the sequel set up was great overall it was great  
Oct 12 2018,neutral,venom was more or less and average movie enjoyable and fun yes but also shallow and not much to it it was too much of a origin story for eddie a hero that didnt get his suit until the movie was halfway through you can seriously skip the first forty five minutes of the movie before the story actually picks up it focused too much and devoted too much time to his ex instead of really getting to know venom the symbiote the pacing and the story was completely out of whack the main problem of of the movie was the script andor editing it had some sony spiderman movie cheese in it
Oct 12 2018,negative,ehh pass hardy is cool though 
Oct 12 2018,positive,one of if not the best comic book movies ever made all these negativecritics are straight wrong
Oct 12 2018,negative,a half baked film lots of holes in the narrative and not even the action scenes are good enough as to rate this as a mediocre film its just disappointing to see such an interesting character in the comics be obliterated in this way not a good movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,better than critics gave it credit for not great but not bad
Oct 12 2018,positive,was a little cheesy in the fact venom was more of a hero as supposed to an antiherovillain towards the end but otherwise very enjoyable movie a welcomed edition to the mcu 
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom was excellent ignore the negative reviews until you see it yourself
Oct 12 2018,positive,i just dont understand the critical panning of this film no accounting for understanding what entertainment is about this film is entertaining and with no dead time myself wife 17 yo daughter and our friends enjoyed it for the escapism adrenalin and laugh fest it is 
Oct 12 2018,neutral,ok i just figured out who venom sounds like its cookie monster i swear he does im not a big fan of tom hardy i just dont see him as an investigative reporter with a hot well put together girlfriend hes just too grody and unkempt so venom gets a d for type casting the humor was good and so was the action that creatures tongue is disgusting for sure overall not bad but dont go out of your way to see it 
Oct 12 2018,positive,fun summer action movie and clever adaptation of the villan into and antihero 
Oct 12 2018,neutral,really a big disappointment and how they ruined that story of venom 
Oct 12 2018,positive,tom hardys performance in this movie is fantastic other than that this movie is so spread apart its almost hard to follow the villain gets no back story and he is just there because he has to be overall i thought it was good but couldve been great
Oct 12 2018,positive,awesome movie have to get into it but its worth it 
Oct 12 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie while it wasnt an oscar contender it was a thoroughly enjoyable romp
Oct 12 2018,positive,when youve realized that it was a comedy and not a horror or dark film then its one of the best films marvel sony have ever made much preferred it to most other marvel films of this year
Oct 12 2018,positive,amazing and entertaining i like that spiderman didnt have to be in the movie  it gives the venom character more depth
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was ok not amazing wouldnt be good with out tom hardy he made the movie worth watching in the cinemas
Oct 12 2018,positive,one of the best romcoms ive ever watched funny full of action critics just dont know how to have fun
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom is fun and suspenseful it is the best under rated movie of all time
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved it and cant wait for the sequel sure it is not the exact with spidey involved but at least it caught my attention throughout the movie with action comedy a bit of romance and fun typical critics always bashing movies yet audience reviews are high exactly why do we listen to them anymore
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved it definitely one of the better marvel films i dont understand why its not getting many good reviews
Oct 12 2018,positive,no this isnt going to win any oscars what this is is a highly fun and entertaining comic book movie with no worn tiresome pretenses of being anything other than that i was very pleased and had a smile on my face the entire time already cant wait for the sequel
Oct 12 2018,positive,has many problems but the main duo was pure gold didnt care for the rest
Oct 12 2018,positive,it a great film i love it alot
Oct 12 2018,positive,fun funny enjoyable few story problems but the good beats the bad in a huge way
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was fing phenomenal and i would recommend it 1210 also all of the critics are cowards for rating it so badly
Oct 12 2018,positive,really enjoyed movie specifically the symbiotic venom great pacing howeverthe relationship between mcs michelle williams and tom hardy started off a bit strange and awkward plenty of action and laughs strong 4 stars
Oct 12 2018,positive,good movie but its not what you expect from marvel
Oct 12 2018,positive,very interesting dynamic between eddie and the symbiote unique and fun movie highly recommend
Oct 12 2018,positive,fantastic film the bad reviews are just proof of immature avengers fans not wanting someone else to steal their limelight i enjoyed this film more than infinity war
Oct 12 2018,positive,a fun time at the movies what more can you ask for if you like the spider universe in general and venom in particular youre in for a good time
Oct 12 2018,positive,funny creative overall awesome 
Oct 12 2018,positive,i really liked this movie even if the critics are bashing it a bunch watch the movie dont listen to the critics watch what you want
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom was honestly an amazing movie and is now in my top 3 before i went into the theater i looked at the reviews and was disappointed that a movie i was waiting so long to see could get such a low score on rotten tomatoes i went in expect
Oct 12 2018,positive,slow building but entertaining when it gets going much different than the typical antihero trope
Oct 12 2018,positive,i love this movie i want to see part two 
Oct 12 2018,positive,all the idiots who said this movie was bad need to actually use there brains sometimes  the only thing this movie needed was better character development  but other than that it hit all the marks it needed too like it was dark it had some humor in could places great action and good writing it adapted well from comics and games into a good movie it took a hard character to weight and made it work well it would be like making a movie on rorshak very hard to capture everything quirky about the character but they did as good as they could so start actually thinking and realize this movie is great
Oct 12 2018,positive,i just got back from seeing this movie and while it isnt the best it really was not as bad as people are saying actually it was very very good i really enjoyed it i laughed it had fantastic action and was nicely paced i wouldnt say i waisted my money in the least worth every penny to go see this it was mind blowing actually one of the best of the year
Oct 12 2018,negative,movie was doing alright until the symbiote started talking in that cliched mcu villain voice and the movie turned into some sort of nonsense buddy movie imagine if beavis  butthead directed captain america by the end i just felt bad for tom hardy and anyone who paid to see it the climax is so lame and predictable it made me wish id chosen to see the crappy new predator movie again instead of this turkey
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thought it was a hoot very fun  special effects were point on  didnt  understand the critics
Oct 12 2018,positive,amazing movie although for the next movie i wouldve liked to see someone else portray carnage
Oct 12 2018,positive,the critics are too critical of this movie  it wasnt the best nor close to the worst comic book movie id actually give it 3 in a half stars im looking forward to the next one it left an obvious opening to where they want to go with the next one
Oct 12 2018,positive,tom hardy is fantastic great special effects were great and the storyline was good
Oct 12 2018,positive,always great to see the new generation  comics
Oct 12 2018,positive,those critics dont have a clue what a superhero movie is this is a great movie and a great start to a trilogy
Oct 12 2018,positive,i liked venom a lot i thought tom hardy did a great job with connecting on who he was playing really enjoyed the scenery and even thought ive heard from others saying the cgi was bad i personally didnt see a problem with it the fight scenes couldve been longer but that didnt stop me from enjoying this movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,a fun film that was worth watching and i would watch a sequel my only point of critisism is that its one that would benefit from an older age rating
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it very fun would have gotten a 5 if spiderman was in it
Oct 12 2018,positive,this is a tale of two reviews  the movie before tom hardy becomes venom and the movie after he becomes venom  if i had to rate the first half id give it a c plus  the story is rather illogical on a lot of fronts the writing itself is sub par and there is very little character development beyond hardys character  as a matter of fact michelle williams was completely wasted throughout the movie  in actually i may have given the first half a d if not for the fact that im a tom hardy fan      okay now that the bad is out of the way i can give you the good  once hardy becomes venom the whole tone of the movie changes  it turns from a melodramatic wanna be horror flick to a fun funny and actionpacked buddy movie  the interactions between venom and eddie are pretty awesome the pace of the movie steps up a hundredfold and we get to see tom hardy do some great acting largely against a voice in his head i might add  the only issues i had with the second half of the movie are pretty minor  still some sloppy writing one thing in particular involving michele williams didnt make any sense based on the parameters that had been set early on in the movie and some of the best fight sequences were awful dark so it was hard to visually follow some it  but those are minor complaints  as i truly enjoyed the second half  i would probably rate it a strong b plus    so taking the first half as a c minus and the second half as a strong b plus i averaged the movie as a whole to a b minusc  its worth watching
Oct 12 2018,neutral,entertaining but poor script and some bad acting this would have been much better premarvel
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom is now in my top 3 favorite movies of all time
Oct 12 2018,positive,movie was pretty good and pretty fun to watch there was definitey a few plot conveniences but all in all a surprisingly good movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,i loved this movie i dont know why the critics watched but it was entertaining and funny go see it youll all love it
Oct 12 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one they got it wrong this movie was amazing hands down 85 out of 10
Oct 12 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it
Oct 12 2018,positive,possibly one of the best action movies ive seen all year it has an ambience very well crossed with action comedy this will be a movie i purchase in the future
Oct 12 2018,positive,obviously not a movie critics will enjoy  this is just a fun comic book movie with some great action and humor  tom hardy did a great job as usual
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was something best and worst movie ive ever seen
Oct 12 2018,positive,amazing movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 12 2018,neutral,cgi was average at best weak script should of been r rated
Oct 12 2018,positive,great performance by tom hardy and the rest of the cast fun and visually pleasing action great use of humor odd pacing but it actually really works as they go a long with tonal shifts that are apropriate for the acts of the movie
Oct 12 2018,neutral,the telling showing of this tale is so not a marvel studios production and definitely sony studiosthe story just has gaps you can drive a mack truck throughthe acting is cheesystarts off pretty good with introduction of the evil nerd genius and anti hero host but then goes off the highway to dirt road and catches two flat tiresfix a flat is uselessthe effects are 1st rate but cant save the poorly written storylineyour left feeling that a lot was cut out and patches back together in a rush
Oct 12 2018,positive,good movie  30  you can tell the critics are not fans of spidermanthe guy that played venom did a great job cannot wait to see the next movie
Oct 12 2018,neutral,tom hardy actingand trying to sound like a new york tough guy in san francisco is little to much to handle
Oct 12 2018,positive,forget the critic reviews  awesome
Oct 12 2018,positive,best movie i dont care what anyone says this was fucking awesome
Oct 12 2018,positive,i came to see a fun action packed movie other than that i had zero expectation i enjoyed it a lot the eddie venom quips in the end really makes me want to see a sequel 35 out of  5
Oct 12 2018,neutral,poor script some cheesy scenes and just overall sloppy disappointment tom hardys performance was only bright spot
Oct 12 2018,negative,not the venom i wanted  did not enjoy the rushed plot bad acting and pacing issues  did not enjoy at all  felt like a sony production
Oct 12 2018,negative,between the bad cgi and the tone of the movie having and identity crisis there just wasnt much for me is it a fun movie in the same vein as suicide squad
Oct 12 2018,positive,there are some flaws like how does eddy keep a secret identity when many people have seen him turn into venom but other than that the cast was great the script was great the special effects were great and i cant wait to see a venom 2
Oct 12 2018,positive,nice movie to watch funny scenes and a great play by tom hardy
Oct 12 2018,positive,is not as bad as the same symbiont that appears it is popcorn movie and with hope of a good script and a better director can give an interesting result i hope that it is taken into account to include spiderman even if it is a multiverse
Oct 12 2018,positive,i actually had a good time with this movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,i loved it really hope they make sequels
Oct 12 2018,positive,i believe the movie was very rewarding in both story and actionmany were bummed with the movie being pg13 but i would say it feels r rated in many ways while not going full r  this movie really did not need to be rated r and i still believe to was very well done
Oct 12 2018,negative,well its better than the fantastic four but worse than anything else this movie is empty characters are flat plot is awful great disapointment
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved it i wish hollywood did more of this a straight forward fun film no weird awkward woke ideology just smart dialogue quirky characters and fast action
Oct 12 2018,positive,a great time at the movies  its a little slow starting out but thats to be expected from all the action were treated with in the trailers its loaded with dark humor which is probably a necessary in a film where we need to see an antihero as the protagonist while its not 100 accurate to its comic book roots taking into account that the mcu and other universes are also not 100 accurate it does use the source material fans are familiar with as a guide so fan service is definitely present would have preferred an rrated film but this version still delivers overall an enjoyable movie thats well worth the ticket price to see in theaters
Oct 12 2018,neutral,venom is a tough film to make  how do you make a villian sympathetic  i dont fault tom hardy too much for this although he did kinda     slouch his way through this movie  the plotline was pretty messy why the side story with the spaceship crash and escape exgirlfriend     trainwreck questionable science brocks transformation from hero reporter to loser  is this supposed to be a redemption story  the     villian while morally reprehensible  was not very threatening and the fight scenes with the ubersymbiote did not strike me as     particularly believable and suffered from what you could call lazy villian syndrome  instead of thinking up a creative villian they just     make whatever the hero is but bad  so hulk fights bad hulk iron man fights another iron man and i guess the symbiote fights a bad     symbiote for some reason because i guess eddie made him good somehow  huh    i guess they were going for as evil a movie as we can make and still have someone to root for  a dexter movie  not sure but it doesnt     leave a ton to root for  eventually we will be rooting for michael myers because he only slashes bad in the acting sense actresses    the tacked on ending with carnage aka woody harelson in a sideshow bob wig was stupid  i suppose to someone who followed symbiote     pedigrees it might be titillating but to the rest of us it was still woody in a sideshow bob wig
Oct 12 2018,positive,i loved it had humor had the action had the antihero elements from the main character very enjoyable not really sure why the critics got their undies twisted 
Oct 12 2018,positive,so great movie but the end is so strange but i hope session 2 be more good
Oct 12 2018,positive,go watch this movie i loved every second of it and tom hardy sold his role perfectly venom is one of the best movies i watched
Oct 12 2018,positive,refreshing this is a different fun way of looking at venom a must watch movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,its fucking awesome yall are just a bunch of annoying little bitches
Oct 12 2018,positive,awesome movie loved the action and humor
Oct 12 2018,positive,it will be a nice movie if it has more fight scenes
Oct 12 2018,positive,i really liked venom but i hated that they had woody harelson
Oct 12 2018,positive,wasnt the best origin movie ive ever seen but the actors did a good job with the script and the postcredits scene made me look forward to the possibility of another one in which they can expand into the wider universe main downsides were the slightly lacklustre vfx and the sudden emotional and ethical turnaround of venom right at the end of the movie for the latter it resulted in a more likeable protagonist  cant complain about that
Oct 12 2018,positive,venon isnt in any way a film master piece but damn was it entertaining the dialogue between eddy brock and venon felt like it came straight of a buddy cop comedy movie the script was fun at times and even with its issues came out as a very entertaining movie
Oct 12 2018,negative,disappointment doesnt begin to define venom i knew it was gonna suck when a trailer was released so quickly after the films announcement i actually wrote more but the app crashed fucking hell    ill start by saying what i liked about the film first i loved tom hardys performance in venom hes a really good fit for eddie brock and he plays his character with a passion and he knows that    i also liked the venom suit this time it was so much better compared to the rubbish we saw in topher graces venom in spider man 3    the reason people say venom didnt make sense is because venoms 1st host was peter parker eddie is the 2nd host which venom latches onto for a longer time because they have the strongest connection together thats why they say this film makes no sense without peter also venom is undetectable by spideysense thats what makes him the top 3 villains to peter    now the shit bit venoms pace was slow it took 40 minutes for us to see venom infect eddie and we still dont really see venom in full cry until an hour in the moment that happens is when the pace starts to speed up    i get that they want to build the tension up but the tone of film messes with this because its comedic at times and then it gets really serious and dark like deadpool meets hulk sometimes i find a scene funny and want to laugh but no else is laughing cause the previous scene was too serious    the villain was poorly written and his motives was just nonsense you want your audience to relate to him and say i get you but this villain doesnt have that hes just insane and he isnt the joker just dont do that    the script was just lazy terrible dialogue poor quality this isnt deadpool you dont get to write a shit script and get away with it this is why marvel needs the complete spiderman rights back    if i were to want a spiderman to battle this venom id want andrew garfields spidey cause tom hollands is just too weak and will be dead if he goes toe to toe with this venom and i hate to say this but tobey maguires spidey was the worst so he aint in my picture to fight this venom
Oct 12 2018,positive,very underrated by the critics audiences including me loved it
Oct 12 2018,negative,plot and depth of characters  0
Oct 12 2018,negative,this film kinda feel forced for a pg13 ratedthere is no build up on the final fight
Oct 12 2018,positive,i enjoyed venom as a good popcorn movie no less no more after a sloppy first hour the juicy action pops the venomtom hardy couple is very fun and efficient to save the movie but the scenario is too much consensual
Oct 12 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie was awesome you couldnt make a venom movie better than this very entertaining and the story was completely in line with the comic 
Oct 12 2018,positive,i went in thinking that this would stinkbased on reviews that i read  it was better then i was expecting  yes i was thrown that it tried to balance between the comedy and violence of deadpool to something that could be sellable to the masses  in some respects it seemed to straddle one leg on each side of the fence  unfortunately when you straddle a fence it sometimes gets a little uncomfortable  go see the movie or wait for redbox  streaming but dont skip it completely  its worth watching
Oct 12 2018,positive,i loved this movie reviews online were pretty bad and i felt i had to speak up im 19 and saw this with my friend group and we had a great time movie was hilarious i laughed out loud which i dont it was full of action and it had a plot twist i loved the story and the actors highly suggested is a must watch
Oct 12 2018,positive,unexpectedly funny and thrilling  twist and turns  very enjoyable  ive seen it twice
Oct 12 2018,positive,personally i really enjoyed it might be because im not that familiar with movies as i barely watched any in my life but i do think this movie is truly enjoyable better script characters darker setting and a bit more of dark humor would add a lot and probably would score this movie far better reviews than what it got
Oct 12 2018,positive,its not good but surly not that bad
Oct 12 2018,positive,ok so where do i begin first dont listen to the critics the audience  we are the people that matter and actually pay money to go see movies while the critics sit behind a desk waiting to give highly anticipated movies a bad rating second venom wasnt the movie of the year but it was still really good venom and eddie make a great team full of funny moments and very cool action sequences hardy plays a great venom the plot has some loop holes but overall it is still a movie worth watching to me venom still beats a lot of superhero movies from the past aka fantastic four amazing spidermans plus a few other dc titles that i dont even need to mention we are venom
Oct 12 2018,positive,monster boyfriend romantic comedy excellent
Oct 12 2018,negative,i guess its my fault for watching this without knowing that this movie was intended for children it was certainly written like a bad kids film
Oct 12 2018,positive,i have no idea what the critics were hoping for when they watched this movie and rated it so poorly i was not expecting to be pleased but the movie was exceptionally done great acting great humor just the right amount of violence cant wait to see the next edition the special effects during some action scenes were a tiny bit off otherwise an excellent movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,both my husband and i loved it  dont know what these film critics are smoking
Oct 12 2018,negative,an absolutely horrible and misguided misfire in every way and as the foundation of another comicbased cinematic universe god knows there arent enough of those venom is even less likely to succeed than universals ninth version of the mummy dark universe or sonys amazing spiderman 2 to set up silver  black sinister six andvenom still this will be a treasuretrove for youtubers who cant resist posting autopsy videos of flop comic book movies and therein i have a feeling well be hearing the words studio interference a lot  i could spend the rest of the day delineating whats wrong with venom but for the most part those nasty ol critics have honestly and succinctly done that sloppy cgi a meandering directionless script which just isnt funny or smart at all painfully fleischers excellent zombieland is funny smart and has heart a paperthin instantly forgettable villain riz ahmed was given nothing to work with here a nonsensical and slipshod originbackstory action sequences without action a fine cast of actors not doing much acting a central character whose point purpose and motivation shift every five minutes or so and so much more   bottom line despite some fine ingredients director lead actor source material venom doesnt work if you like superhero movies that you can invest in emotionally or intellectually youd be best off staying away from venom and if you liked reading any iteration of venom in comic form from secret wars to lethal protector to antivenom or dark avenger and venomverse  really stay away maybe this would appeal to a younger audience that like to see big blobs of cgi bouncing around and smashing stuff up for no apparent reason but aside from that its a weak desperate and opportunistic little stab at trying to wring some more cash from the mighty marvel cashcow
Oct 12 2018,positive,if you like venom in the comics youll like this do not go into it purposefully pointing out all the inconsistencies or differences from how you may know and like your venom this is a fun movie that offers a lot of entertainment to those who are willing to not hold it to mcu style standards
Oct 12 2018,positive,while i agree with most people that the exposition is long and a bit tedious thats the thing with origin movies other than that the movie was a really fun watch the actors performance was great and they seemed to be enjoying themselves so much which is always a plus i definitely wouldnt say no to a sequel
Oct 12 2018,positive,dont trust the critics yes it had some cheesy lines but was very enjoyable through out
Oct 12 2018,positive,dont know what these critics are talking about it was one of the best ive seen looking forward to the sequel
Oct 12 2018,positive,it is an amasing movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,whilst it had some pacing and tone issues it was able to excellently balance the comedic and dark natures of the film i am cautiously optimistic for what sony has in store for the spiderverse
Oct 12 2018,positive,critics are way too harsh on this movie because it was bomb af
Oct 12 2018,positive,solid action great performance by tom hardy
Oct 12 2018,positive,a thrown together piece of mess
Oct 12 2018,positive,much beter than expected  tom hardy is always a treat  ps the tomatometer is a joke profesional critics are a joke
Oct 12 2018,positive,it forgets what it wants to be like it switches between a rated r thriller and a campy marvel movie but its enjoyable if you dont go into it expecting to get a hardcore experience
Oct 12 2018,positive,i give 5 star bcoz of tom hardy save the movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,even though the movie got a lot of hate before it even came out i went to go see the movie it was a lot better than i expected
Oct 12 2018,positive,dont expect infinity wars iron man thor ragnarok or even ant man n the wasp if you go in w those expectations it will suck i had to see it twice to truly appreciate its genius tom hardy does a great job as both eddie brock and venom   my only complaint is the excessive amount of time the director spends telling us the back story life foundation and eddies origin story but even that only costs the flick 1 star  already looking forward to the next venom movie maybe include the story of venoms home planet klyntar and knull the leader of the symbiotes use spiderman but change it up allow them to fight together against evil symbiotes andor human advisaries like dr occ or the green goblin really enjoyed this movies action and harsh humor best part eating the bad guys
Oct 12 2018,positive,though this movie has flaws it is the acting of tom hardy in creating a chemistry with the rock bottom eddie brock and his new vicious companion that gives the film legs to be successful it was entertaining and it showed that for now venom can move forward without his heroic webslinging menace to fight it was worth the ticket and i am on board for a sequel 
Oct 12 2018,negative,a huge bomb horrible movie not interesting at all very disappointed
Oct 12 2018,positive,critics love to throw there power around this movie isnt perfect but its a fantastic movie go seee imax stop reading gogogofofo
Oct 12 2018,neutral,obvious definate potential but from half way in and poorly written hopefully theyll learn before they take spidey back uninspiring music also
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thought this movie was fun and the action was great  the relationship between eddie and venom was entertaining if you go into it thinking its gonna be an mcu masterpiece film youll only be disappointed
Oct 12 2018,positive,super enjoyable witty action packed and fun totally a must watch
Oct 12 2018,positive,the critics are dead wrong on this one if you like being entertained and laughing this movie is for you apparently a good time is out of style with these critics
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom rocks and fake critics shocked
Oct 12 2018,positive,what can i say its not that good but i just loved it so much chemistry
Oct 12 2018,positive,i thought over all the movie did what it came to the park to do gave us a super hero movie with no hero if thats your cup of tea more power to you if you are looking for the good guy to save the day it doesnt have that hes a normal guy to just wants to be normal in a normal world who gets taken over by a monster he can barely keep in check
Oct 12 2018,positive,this is a hilarious and fun movie to watch the bond by both characters works
Oct 12 2018,negative,tom hardy cannot do any wrong however just about everything else in this movie can clunky and offpaced writing anchor venom from being the movie that it could have been instead of the character study centering on issues of morality and revenge that it should have been it more or less comes off as an attempt at an odd couple buddy cop film with alien superpowers making it rated r would have automatically given it more grace as well
Oct 12 2018,positive,venom is one of my top 10 favorite movies of 2018 not perfect but it is insanely entertaining i cant wait to see it again
Oct 12 2018,positive,the scenario is interesting and special effect are really cool the personnality of brock and venom is really nice im a huge fan of venom ive all the comics from 90s tom hardy was very good like always many things are very different from the comics but i find spirit of the character is respected its another version but a good one compared to spider man homecoming which was a piece of trash   what was not nice about the atmosphere to put point of view was every vehicule motorcycle quad cars only big and all shining clean and new this contrast with the poor world messy or dirty shops and flats is weird the movie was quite short and its too bad we feel they did more but didnt show everything personal opinion was that eddy s girlfriend wasnt interesting character
Oct 12 2018,positive,just amazing would like a little more of riot and venom as the film was a bit short  but cannot understand the critics 30  5 stars
Oct 12 2018,positive,i can see where the critics come from and from where that 28 originated but the movie is so fun i loved it
Oct 12 2018,positive,loved the movie so did my kid 
Oct 12 2018,positive,how have the critics got this so wrong look at the audience score i really enjoyed this film
Oct 12 2018,positive,im so used to tom hardys badassery as bane mad max  tommy riordan his eddie brock felt a bit off but venom was a solid one quirky violent  messy as it should be still hope for mcu cross over however unlikely that is hear us sonypictures wearevenom 355scales
Oct 12 2018,positive,saw it the other night love the fighting scenes 
Oct 12 2018,positive,i love this movie its soooo cute  i wish i knew how to upgrade to a super ticket so i can own this movie when it comes out p i really loved this movie i wish it was longer though 
Oct 12 2018,positive,a kick assfundaring super hero romp that didnt even need ole webhead in it to be 1
Oct 12 2018,positive,always a please to see how the crtics are disconnected from the reality    this movie is realy entertaining and good as long as you take it for what it is an action movie with some dark comedy in it it is realy cheesy sometimes and ofc the movie as issues    but overall it does it job realy well  and its painfully obious that the movie is butchered by the critic because its a sony movie and not a pure marvel movie    the visuals are comic accurate but not the story and the characters and that was to be expected if you want to see this movie go there not waiting to see a full adaption of venom or a very very dark movie it is not but it is great the main cast does a good job  hardy is amazing  the vilain as a classical role but at the same time he is realy not the same type of character than other vilain he is all about seduction    anyway go see the movie and give more salt to the mass media critics because they will have to endure a sequel own by sony kek
Oct 12 2018,positive,fun movie but its definitely not about venom 
Oct 12 2018,positive,tom hardy acting venom cgi cheesy venom lines needed to be rated r
Oct 12 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie 
Oct 12 2018,neutral,if this new films objective is to erase the memory of venoms debut in spiderman 3 and kickstarts a new franchise then considered it done but only just at least i dont find this as abhorrent and irritating as say suicide squad or batman vs superman and i am invested and intrigued enough to return for the next instalment whilst not a bad film per se it is a mediocre one and a missed opportunity somewhere inside is a better film had they taken a few more risks and be more daring instead ruben fleischer and the screenwriters have taken a safe route and plot this as venom begins with predictable beats that can be spotted a mile away tom hardy is a decent choice as eddie brockvenom but hes held back by a film that doesnt cut him loose enough and perhaps in order to keep a more familyfriendly rating it ends up stuck in a lame deadpoollite limbo that pleases no one with its bloodless cartoonish violence when they couldve gained more bite had they gone for a harder 15 or r even tip see the recent upgrade  likewise riz ahmed and michelle williams who we all know can do better given more substantial scripts are wasted here in lacklustre roles with little to do whilst venoms cgi rendering is done well the action sequences are less inspiring though not terrible everything is just a bit meh and in a competitive market thirsty for new comic book heroes and villains or in this case someone in between venom definitely has potential to be a different kind of antihero  and while this film manages to set the scene for his arrival it doesnt quite deliver the film the character truly deserves
Oct 12 2018,positive,so i went out and watched venom and i must say i actually thoroughly enjoyed it sure it has its problems but every movie on earth has its issues generally i found that the screenplay was enjoyable that had solid humour that landed the cgi was ok not great not bad but just ok without going into a long review yes it has issues yes the cgi was ok but generally it was solid just remember this is just my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own
Oct 12 2018,positive,one of the best action movies i have seen in a while it kept me engaged and interested the whole time i was watching it and that again has not happened in a while  an out and out action movie which is not apologetic about being an action movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,anyone who grew up with venom in the 90s would agree that they actually nailed the symbiotic brock relationship and the comedy there is not the worst thing they could have done the movie does have its flaws which i wont try to defend but it also has positive points too that are worth mentioning i really dont think this movie deserves a below average rating it especially doesnt deserve it just because it wasnt what someone expected to see in october if you went into this hyping yourself up that it was going to be a horror movie then you may have been let down but also by researching the character and not letting yourself get so attached to your opinions before experiencing something can do a long way too i believe this approach will lead to disliking most things that dont turn out your way which in turn is a pretty ignorant way of thinking
Oct 12 2018,positive,so very good ignore the critics they obviously dont know what a good movie is so incredibly good and fun
Oct 12 2018,positive,this is my favourite marvelfilm after deadpool 2
Oct 12 2018,neutral,in all honesty i shouldnt of enjoyed this film as much as i did i mean it is a fun film to watch theres stuff in the film that happens for no reason like the symbiote landing in china just to end up in the damm lab made me laugh so hard because it felt like filler i wished they used that time to do more character building between venom and eddie bonding because honestly that was the best thing about this movie there chemistry was top notch the fact that all of sudden venom changed his mind because they where both losers would of worked better if it wasnt so rushed two nit picky things would be the fact the at the beginning of the movie where the little girl got shushed for trying to ask a question then carlton drake had this big speech telling the children that they shouldnt be shushed and she still didnt get to ask the questionthat annoyed me more that it should of also the car chase scene was waaaaayyy to long carlton told him not to kill venom but these mercenaries are legit trying to blow eddie up but on to the positives to a casual fan you will really enjoy this movie it has unexpected humour great special effects and a bunch of action which has been the marvel formula for a while this may be an unpopular opinion but i feel like if you are going to make a venom movie without spiderman this is the best they could of done in terms of making him into a antihero as they focused on eddies and venoms relationship instead of just saying i like being bad sam raimi spiderman fans will know what im talking about was better it may of been rushed but it wasnt nowhere near as rushed as that line last notes i would say that throughout this movie all i could think is this would be absolutely sick to see in the mcu when the current spiderman is all grown up as a final foe let him be a antihero for now but find a way to make into a legitimate villain against spiderman would be a great twist and change in 35 years time and the fact that the end credits hinted carnage got me soo gassed as weve never seen carnage get a live action adaptation so i have to see the next one in cinema wether i like it or not all in all this is a fun movie that makes no sense is that a good thing or a bad thing ill let you decide
Oct 12 2018,positive,just great funny exciting and constantly interesting
Oct 12 2018,positive,the critics are idiots the movie was fun and kept my attention could it have been better yes but it could also have been a lot worse go see it
Oct 12 2018,positive,really enjoyed the movie critics know shit
Oct 12 2018,positive,was surprised at how good it was
Oct 12 2018,positive,good brings you back to feeling like a kid again plus it has funny comedy
Oct 12 2018,positive,standard marvel movie not the best not the worst it was a still an enjoyable movie to watch and venom is much better here thanspiderman 3
Oct 12 2018,positive,i just want to see more i dont want peter parker in this i just want to see symbiotes fight it out and form a bond with their hosts
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was a lot of fun funny action rmoance whats not to like
Oct 12 2018,positive,on par with hulk and abomination film not the greatest film but very watchable would be happy to see again despite the critics hardy provided a great role and venom didnt disappoint
Oct 12 2018,positive,fun  entertaining quite liked it despite its obvious flaws
Oct 12 2018,positive,such an amazing movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,its a bland plot made slightly interesting by its actors i hate to say it but i would rather see the main players in other roles than see another generic kiddie venom story
Oct 12 2018,neutral,sonys venom starring tom hardy yes tom hardy is a bit of a letdown going into the theatre i didnt have my expectations sky high as i was well aware of the overall buzz it had created in addition to that i wasnt entirely impressed with any of the teasers they had released yet despite such low expectations the movie left me wanting  i did have fun watching the movie but i was never entirely engrossed into it there was always something that put me out the action sequences and animation doesnt help much either they are just not up to par with todays standards one particular action sequence the high speed chase was unnecessarily long to the point i was wishing for it to end and get in with the plot the vfx in this sequence and throughout the movie feels cheap and dated  in addition sony trying to copy the marvel formula really shows the jokes and witty dialogues give good laughs however adds nothing overall the decision to stay pg13 in the hopes of possibly building the spiderverse with tom hollands spiderman has held back venom from achieving its true potential the character venom brock is too pg13 and doesnt manage to show the darker antihero side apart from a few throwaway lines inconsequential threats and using people to bash people there is nothing that shows the darker side of venom and as hulk has already show heroes bash people too venom could have done with a bit more drama and struggle between venom and brock the anti part of this antihero is lost in the midst of many jokes and puns    in terms of plot venom superficially moves from one plot point to another akin to plotting lines on dots it cares more about fulfilling the criteria than it does about building up the character and whats to come everything that happens feels nothing more than a series of events even the finale the saving of the day is just another incident as it lacks the punch and the weight the lack of real sense of danger ultimately brings the movie down  to finally conclude the review venom although fun lacks a lot as a movie in terms of vfx action sequences as well as the drama and intensity with its uninventive action sequences a tone that overlooks the characters original identity and lack of whathappensnext venom to put it bluntly is a wasted opportunity i would watch this one but from my handy dandy laptop screen
Oct 12 2018,positive,despite its many many flaws in story sound editing rushed character development and of course the horrible villain venom ultimately serves enough entertainment to satisfy the experience thanks to tom hardys spectacular performance even when it comes nothing close to its potential
Oct 12 2018,negative,the film is a mess riot is woefully under developed and venoms motivation to stay on earth are flat out not explained the action scenes are pretty good except the final fight which was way too fast paced and so poorly shot it will give you a headache also despite the amount of time eddie brock and the symbiote have together their chemistry and development is poor there is no real reason why eddie brock and venom have to be bonded to one another considering eddie betrays venom and venom is detrimental to his health there are several glaring plot holes and carnage being potrayed by woodie harelson is terrible his red wig looks awful also the dialog is incredibly cringy at points the best things i can say about this film is that venom looks cool and the action scenes are mostly fun but literally everything is shown off in the trailers i was very disappointed thumbs down
Oct 12 2018,positive,a great time laugh out loud funny thrilling fight scenes and a beautiful threeway romance cant wait for the sequel
Oct 12 2018,negative,horrific terrible movie
Oct 12 2018,positive,i had rly low expectations for this movie i would concider myself as a big venom fan and i followed the production since the first announcement years ago there were so many ups and downs since than incl rumours of complete cancelation i liked the trailers but had a feeling its just an average film max and then the rating debacle and soso critics but welli watched it yesterday and i must say i really liked it its fun entertaining and makes me want more but venom definitely deserved a harder pace with some blood and gore in the sequel this one was obviously cut down to make it more family friendly
Oct 12 2018,positive,it was everything i was wanting my only complaint was woody harrison
Oct 12 2018,positive,brilliant movie brilliant acting brilliant ride  must see
Oct 12 2018,positive,starts a bit slow but things really start to pick up when venom appears  had a lot of fun watching this flic and i honestly think that it wouldve really benefited from an r rating
Oct 12 2018,positive,entertaining and fun i recommend it
Oct 12 2018,positive,this movie is awsome u must watch this movie wrarevenom
Oct 11 2018,positive,a genuinely fun and enjoyable lark thru the mind of eddie brockvenom an amazing and exiting movie cant wait for the next one
Oct 11 2018,positive,i just recently got back from the new movie venom and it is one of the best movies i have seen in awhile definitely one of the best of this year the critics are yet again completely wrong about this movie i highly recommend this movie and i would urge you to see it in theaters and vote with your wallet to show that this movie needs a sequel
Oct 11 2018,positive,i went to see this movies with critics opinions in mind but after watching the movie i just love it and want more of it the supposed critics are just hating on this awesome movie just compared the audience score with tomatometer you can clearly see all of us are enjoying  it except for those critics
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie is pretty epicthe effects are decentbut the plot lacks creativitybut holy crap is it entertaining this movie is probably the funnest ive seen in a whileits got good humorand i love the eddievenom ship a lottom hardy was greatriz ahmed was greatmichelle williams did great    everybody was telling me not to watch this because it looked  stupidif your friends are telling you not to watch thisignore them  youre gonna love this
Oct 11 2018,positive,just a fun superhero movie  shame they dumbed down a potentially compelling character especially with the talented tom hardy at the helm
Oct 11 2018,positive,fun movie just take it for what it is also the banter between eddie and venom is great
Oct 11 2018,negative,bad movie bad acting and bad effects
Oct 11 2018,positive,ignore the critics and go see this amazing movie 10 out of 10 for me very rarely does a movie exceed my expectations like this one has easily my new all time favorite the critics of this movie apparently have completely lost their touch with society and must live on a planet where excrement is a delicacy because they couldnt be any more wrong about this movie and the masses dont lie
Oct 11 2018,neutral,i dont know where is that michelle williams i saw on manchester by the sea but she certainly not on this one
Oct 11 2018,positive,its good dont let the critics fool you not perfect but its worth a watch me and my girlfriend loved it
Oct 11 2018,negative,this might be the worst movie ive seen all year thanks sony
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom was a lot better than it could have been  i went in expecting nothing but was fairly impressed
Oct 11 2018,positive,the movie was good overall the plot was sort of generic with the whole relationship thing though the animations and scifi factor was great this movie is sort of a comedy combined with a horror superhero movie the movie needed some more background on the symbiotes and the characters though the movie was still very entertaining i would give this movie a 7610 i am anticipating the next movie     would recommend
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was way under rated not the best but really good i loved the interactions between hardy and venom
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie is good you guys just dont like fun i guess
Oct 11 2018,positive,dude it was really epic
Oct 11 2018,positive,the best marvel movie ever
Oct 11 2018,negative,a complete waste of 10 would not recommend there was one good line in the entire movie which you could easily find on youtube there was no plot and it was definitely not 2 hours 20 minutes as google says very dispointing not going to see the next one
Oct 11 2018,negative,terrible    subplots that dont go anywhere characterisation is messed up for every single character motivations constantly change for the most random reasons and sometimes for no reason at all dialogs seem to have been written by children or bots poorly executed action sequences in which venom abuses his skill set to the point where there simply are no stakes a final boss that is given 3 minutes of screen time hardys performance is shaky at best because the poor guy like the viewer has no idea what his character is is he an irresponsible manchild or a violent tough dude or a hardworking journalist or a wimp or a clown no one knows my thoughts he is everything above by design in hopes that the viewer is so confused that he just retains the version he identified with the most    nothing is enganging during this movie nothing is designed to actually interest the viewer given the weird pacing and the way some scenes just suddenly pop out of nowhere im starting to think this movie was created in a lab to be the perfect movie to have playing in background while you play games on your phone
Oct 11 2018,neutral,saw this this past weekend my official review meh some good more bad just overall felt disjointed i like tom hardy though he did the best he could with what he had to work with i thought he wouldnt work as an activist reporter but surprisingly he was enjoyable
Oct 11 2018,negative,venom is to funny what hulk is to subtle
Oct 11 2018,positive,this was exactly the venom movie i always wanted theres such good humor silliness great action and while there isnt a lot of plot theres enough that it doesnt feel like the action and humor are trying to compensate but overall dont go into this movie thinking its going to be scaring your socks off or getting in depth about space fairing humanity or any of that this is an action romcom between an idiot and an alien idiot that end up saving the world and its marvelously fun to watch
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom takes an almost deadpool like approach to the film while not quite as hilarious really what is venom is a refreshing take on a character that had been slightly tarnished by previous reincarnations while it starts off slowly 1010 highly reccomend you watch
Oct 11 2018,positive,way better than what critics are giving it needs an r rating for future but solid origin story
Oct 11 2018,positive,best movie in the whole entire world and universes to me 
Oct 11 2018,positive,very good movie i liked it i prefer it was rated r but what can you do
Oct 11 2018,positive,its hilarious and the venom  eddie brock relationship plays really well
Oct 11 2018,positive,as someone that doesnt usually enjoy action movies i loved venom it was a mix between action and scifi and has just enough humour would definitely recommend
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is a perfect movie especially if you have a chance to see it in 3d  the 3d is excellent  everything is great the plot the acting the special effects the stan lee cameo  i wasnt a big fan of the rap music inexplicably thrown in or the second postcredit scene that had absolutely nothing to do with the movie but anyone who likes the characters should love this
Oct 11 2018,positive,ignore the critics on this one great pacing great acting and some amazing scenes memorable lines with excellent delivery its not the deepest movie ever made but its everything it needs to be to be a great time
Oct 11 2018,positive,heres the thing after reading the so called top critics you can only wonder what were they expecting or if they just have a stick up their bottoms audience reviews is a major thumbs up overall and named it a delightful and great movie and heres why    the plot is simple and effective it doesnt give you any extra or needless stuff which allows the movie to be concise but well developed nonetheless combined with action good effects and a pinch of comedy here and there which keeps the movie from falling into dcs dark and gloomy world but also marvels colorful light and simple comedy it keeps it within a realistic and plausible world its different to the others just right   the movie fulfills its purpose of casting tom hardy who plays venom just right as it makes it more appealing and it works simple as that   the star and symbiote venom is well written it has personality its a character all on its own  could it have some more background story maybe but you dont really need it the movie explores what it has to explore it doesnt saturate and overwhelm the story line  the eddievenom relationship is the focus and it does not make you leave the theater wondering or thinking well what was that about it leaves window for more which in the end hint to post credits scene you actually want  personally i wouldve liked some more screen time for eddie and venom or maybe get them together sooner as you may leave wanting more but isnt that the beauty you leave eager and expecting the next one  a must watch you decide afterwards
Oct 11 2018,positive,really entertaining it keeps a good pace and surprises with good laughs here and there
Oct 11 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie is somehow getting poor reviews honestly its a 810 all the way
Oct 11 2018,positive,could have been a little longer with a few more fights r rating could have made it better a lot better
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was honestly a great funny movie i dont get why the critics are so toxic
Oct 11 2018,positive,i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 11 2018,positive,noisy and chaotic hell yeah its venom damn it
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is a fun blockbuster packed with some action charm and a great performance from tom hardy if you turn off your brain for a little while you might find yourself enjoying venom
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie was fantastic over all it was an amazing break from all the series toned movies it deserves a second movie seriously though this movie deserves a 95 rating i do not know what you all watched but i saw one of the best films of 2018
Oct 11 2018,positive,i really enjoyed venom not sure why the bad reviews its worth checking out for yourself fun movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,love it it was fucking awesome i wanna see where they go with that ending scene
Oct 11 2018,positive,big monster teeth tounge instant 1010 in all seriousness venom is a great movie despite what critics what you to believe dont base your opinion on what critics say go see the movie for yourself the relationship between eddie and venom is believable and eddie interacts with his ex and her new boyfriend like an adult my only slight complaint is during a scene at the end it was moving to fast for my eyes to keep up with and just became a blur of black and grey but i do have bad vision sensory issues so thats probably just me tdlr go see the movie and form your own opinion also be wary if you have bad vision andor sensory issues
Oct 11 2018,positive,i dont care what anybody says this movie was a great movie it deserves way more than 1 and a half stars for once imdb got it right on this one they gave it 4 stars i think the plot was good and the action was nonstop i think some people are letting their biases get to them when judging this film maybe they think it doesnt go by the comic or whatever it is but i just think it was great i wasnt let down at all hell with what the critics say you should see it for yourself a make your own judgement call im glad i saw it in theaters it was worth my time and money i thought it was awesome
Oct 11 2018,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time
Oct 11 2018,negative,time and money i cant get back such a silly cheesy movie 
Oct 11 2018,positive,ive always liked the venom character so this is one of my favorite marvel flicks the fact that tom hardy plays the main character is an added bonus for me another great marvel film hardy is phenomenal as always he really knows how to emote his blind rage is spot on
Oct 11 2018,positive,enjoyable definitely not as bad as its been made out to be
Oct 11 2018,negative,tom hardy is a great actor but this wasnt  a good movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,this was much better than i expected with the reviews turning me off but i enjoyed it thoroughly
Oct 11 2018,positive,i couldnt look away it was awesome
Oct 11 2018,positive,the best vemon ever 
Oct 11 2018,positive,great fun one of the best films 2018 critics are fools
Oct 11 2018,positive,good but couldve been better
Oct 11 2018,positive,it has some good humor loved th eddie and venom realtinoship great onterpetation of thé comic book
Oct 11 2018,positive,i had fun with the movie venomhardy are funny and have a very good relationship i dont see a bad movie here
Oct 11 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics good film really brings out some of venoms character from the comics and 90s cartoon recommended to all fans
Oct 11 2018,positive,bot crowded with too much info and a really all rounded start to then venom standalone
Oct 11 2018,positive,a pretty decent superhero film  as always tom hardy is a class apart   dont mind the critics go and be entertained
Oct 11 2018,positive,amazing one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Oct 11 2018,positive,despite the many mixed reviews and the blasting that   this film received from the critics i really enjoyed it tom hardy was great in the role of brody demonstrating his usual versatility it is an action comedy and as such is not a typical scifi alien movie it is very in line with the marvel cinematic universe pictures so if you do not enjoy those then you probably wont like this film either
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie was well made with the exception of a few plot wholes i enjoyed it spoilers from here mainly the time lapse of 6 months riot shouldve been to life possessed the ceo and launched the rocket long before then i just dont understand the need for the 6 month time lapse it just destroyed the whole plot eddie wouldve been long out of a home if he had been jobless for that long yet even though hes in a crapy apartment he is still somehow haa enough money to afford it in a san francisco struggling with over population but i enjoyed the action and i liked watching venom tear people apart so even with this crappy plot 610 or 35
Oct 11 2018,positive,decent movie just wish we had some blood
Oct 11 2018,positive,the scripting in the beginning was a bit messy but overall the movie itself was phenomenal and the graphics were pretty great d
Oct 11 2018,positive,funny and enjoyable if they made a rated r version it would have been much better hopefully the sequel will be rated r and we get another deadpool style movie 
Oct 11 2018,neutral,despite a surprising amount of humor and chemistry between venom and his host venom is mostly inept as both an action and a horror film with only the slightest amount of soul peering through the thoughtful characterization of hardys role this is a movie you can enjoy while watching and forget the moment youre done
Oct 11 2018,positive,absolutely loved this movie  great film to just sit back and have fun  screw thecriticsi recommend the movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,i thought this film was really really entertaining and i enjoyed it thoroughly i totally disagree with the critics that write reviews everyone should just make up their own mind and ignore these professional reviewers who are completely out of touch
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is a fantastic addition to the superhero genre its dark humour and atmosphere makes for a new perspective that the audience hasnt really explored yet this film is made better by another amazing performance from hardy the connection between his character and venom make for a comedic and witty partnership that the audience can get behind and connect to it does have some flaws like a one dimensional villain and and an odd plot however overall this is a funny and yet intense film sony really does have something that could manifest into many more exciting movies a must watch
Oct 11 2018,positive,personally i really enjoyed venom because its a bit different from the epic superhero movies marvel are churning out and as the only spiderman film ive really enjoyed was the last one i was glad there was no spiderman link if any thing the part when hes full on venom went by really quickly and i hope we get a venom 2 to see the symbiotic duo bloom i thought the laughs were better than antman but not as good as deadpool but maybe it would need an r rating to take on deadpool properly  effects were good story was decwnt enough tom hardy excellent as usualalso maybe one criticism is he turned good a bit easy
Oct 11 2018,positive,a decent movie but nothing special if you have seen it you probably agree that its not a bad movie its really not a good movie its just kinda another comic movie and if you havent seen i wouldnt go out of your way to see it but if you ever get bored and want a movie to watch then it could be worth watching
Oct 11 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it
Oct 11 2018,positive,it wasnt perfect but it was still very entertaining
Oct 11 2018,positive,very funny and a great intro to a new spiderverse
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved this movie i never followed comics so i dont care how it adheres to those it was entertaining tons of action and great cgi my favorite marvel movie yet 
Oct 11 2018,positive,definitely better than what the tomatometer and critics have claimed  i was a little skeptical about the whole idea of this movie myself but sony pulled it off and impressed me with the whole story and venom character itself not to mention a well balanced performance by tom hardy  ill admit that there are a bunch of lines and dialogue that are quite cheesy as well as not the most engaging character developments but a very enjoyable watch nonetheless
Oct 11 2018,positive,came in wanting to f venom walked out wanting venom and eddy to get married and live happily ever after 1210 it was stupid in all the right ways
Oct 11 2018,positive,i liked it and it was a fun comic flick especially if you like the source material critically it could improve audiences will be entertained and fans will fanboy out the effects were cool and it had some good fights humor and easter eggs
Oct 11 2018,positive,absolutely loved it critics were to hard on this movie everything we loved about venom growing up was satisfied in this movie
Oct 11 2018,negative,pretty bad such amazing g source material 
Oct 11 2018,positive,surprisingly well done effort the cast did a great job with a solid script ill probably see it again 
Oct 11 2018,neutral,saw this this past weekend my official review meh some good more bad just overall felt disjointed i like tom hardy though he did the best he could with what he had to work with i thought he wouldnt work as an activist reporter but surprisingly he was enjoyable
Oct 11 2018,positive,its insane amazing spectacular the critics are ridiculous
Oct 11 2018,positive,great movie bit slow in the first 3040 minutes but after it was awesome
Oct 11 2018,positive,great acting fantastic portrayal by tom hardy and an entertaining and easy to follow story would highly recommend seeing this film if youre a fan of venom this film captures his personality perfectly
Oct 11 2018,positive,loved this movie  it was awesome
Oct 11 2018,positive,lets be honest for a sec do you really think a critic would give this movie a fair shake they dont know the comics they dont know the various tv shows etc as the fan score shows this is a fun film overall and pretty enjoyable the plot works considering they cant use spiderman but there are mentions of eddys past in ny so its there albeit in a small way if i has anything to complain about its i would want to see the full film with the extra 30 mins of footage
Oct 11 2018,positive,this was an exceptional fun movie to watch
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved it and i avidly await more i would watch a three movie of just eddie brock sitting in a dark room talking to himself and be content this movie does not deserve the low critic rating it was fantastic and actually quite refreshing to see in the over saturated hero movie genres
Oct 11 2018,positive,had a ton of fun watching this movie with 3 friends its got a thriller movie mixed in with actionpacked scenes deadpoolesque talking to self scenes a story that you can get with and a killerlooking venom would recommend also learn who carnage is and stay for the aftercredits scene
Oct 11 2018,positive,nowhere near as bad as critics are saying in fact the critical reviews make no sense this is just as good as all the other marvel movies out there
Oct 11 2018,positive,definitely better than reviews     go watch it people     its a good movie i promise
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was a pretty enjoyable movie tom hardy is very entertaining to watch and the dialogue between the symbiote and eddie brock is funny im excited for a sequel 
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is an entertaining film with near perfect pacing and humor that works knows where it should be and where it shouldnt im looking at you marvel the characters are realistic and act like we most likely would in their scenario the only issue i have with the film is that the soundtrack isnt well made 9410
Oct 11 2018,negative,i think we could all agree that this failed as a start of the spiderman universe with out spiderman
Oct 11 2018,positive,ok not the best storyline but it was so funny i love how theyve done the film
Oct 11 2018,positive,watch it if you want to entertain
Oct 11 2018,positive,very entertaining and hilarious tom hardy does a great job 
Oct 11 2018,positive,its not that good but actually quite enjoyable largely we have seen all of it before  san fran hulk spiderman 3 terminator blah blah blah hardy is good
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie isnt nearly as bad as critics say it is 
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved this i dont really care about star actors and i cant think of another tom hardy movie ive seen but i really liked his performance as eddie brock he really was a lovable loser and his character was so true to the comics it really felt like he had a personal attachment to eddie brock and venomeddie together also felt like such a wholesome representation of what fans wanted to see from venom i was greatful for the tiny bit of fanservice we got before the kiss avoiding spoilers here the cg really did service to bulk up venom and the action scenes had nice cinematography but sometimes a little too much flashing the pacing was fantastic you never got bored waiting for the next part it just kept handing you something to grab your attention     if you look at the negative reviews they are totally wild people say aliens shouldnt have earth names or some other nitpicky bs that someone probably paid them to think up maybe sony is mad marvel only bought spiderman for infinity war and wanted to give this movie bad reviews the audience and i loved this see it for yourself if you are even remotely considering it
Oct 11 2018,positive,good popcorn fun film with great actors and actresses sony is of with a good start
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie was fun and exciting a little predictable but what comicbook movie isnt these days tom hardy was wonderful as venom and brock and watching their interactions made the movie come together a fun movie one that ill recommend to action fans any day of the week
Oct 11 2018,positive,entertaining movie dont listen to the reviews not every movie has to be a deeply thought out and well written movie some of them can just be stupid fun
Oct 11 2018,positive,loved it was fun to watch and no doubt a classic to add to the collection dont listen to the bad reviews watch and judge for yourself
Oct 11 2018,positive,good comic book action flick
Oct 11 2018,positive,people are viewing the entire purpose of venom in the wrong way venom is not a superhero movie its not a comedy movie its not a horror movie it was very well represented according to the comics and a lot scenes were hilarious and packed with action and drama and a little of romance tom hardys performance was phenomenal and truly convincing in the end it all depends on the way you enter the theater if you enter with positivity then you will have a good time if u enter with negative thoughts you probably wont enjoy it as much on that note people should definitely watch the movie before judging it
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was really good for a film with a substancially low budget i would watch it again
Oct 11 2018,positive,really enjoyed this film loved the action and tom hardy was amazing
Oct 11 2018,positive,went to watch the movie last night rt is way off on this one loved it full of action and humor it was worth the watch my only downside is the should have gone for the r rating ps good work from tom hardy once again 
Oct 11 2018,positive,i thought this was great fun its funny violent and fastpaced the character arc is believable and the villain reminds me strongly of a particular big pharma guy that was in and out of the news last year tom hardy pulls this off nicely never mind the critics  grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was entertaining i really enjoyed it dont listen to the critics watch it youll have fun
Oct 11 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie brock and venom was well executed and believable the overall plot was well done but i found that the villain was very good but the secondary villain was disappointing it would have been nice to have more with that character i would have liked the final fight to have been longer but its still very enjoyable the mid credit scene was a bit fan servicey but its nice to see that sony has a plan for a sequel i am looking forward to what they do in the future
Oct 11 2018,positive,just got out of the movie and i can say it was worth the money spent on it it has action and comedy in a kind of deadpoolish way but and thats a big but venom needs more depth go check out the movie totally worth it 
Oct 11 2018,positive,its a good movie about nonhero character i think it deserve for support by money  i really dont understand why we have so many negative reviews  you shouldnt expect something special like from disneymarvel movie different styles and different budget of movies   i go with wife and enjoy it even register on this site for give my review
Oct 11 2018,positive,awesome i like the humor
Oct 11 2018,positive,not for everyone but the fun action movie just wish it was a little longer
Oct 11 2018,positive,clearly never listen to the critics they got tlj wrong solo wasnt as bad as they said and they clearly got this wrong tom hardy is the man we chuckled all the way through and even though im not a fan of action type movies im going to see this again
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom was a thoroughly enjoyable superhero movie experience
Oct 11 2018,positive,good movie tom hardy  super good  venom look  also super good
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved it it could have been better but really good
Oct 11 2018,positive,an entertaining movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,crazy fun venom tale thanks but no spidey a
Oct 11 2018,positive,great movie ignore the critics
Oct 11 2018,neutral,nothing special   another alien action movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,not bad for low budget
Oct 11 2018,positive,an absolutely fine time at a genre movie its not high art but it is super fun and worth it for tom hardys performance
Oct 11 2018,positive,tom hardy is hollywoods most underrated actor  and venom is fun if superman or ironman were critic favourites why not venom hypocrites     btw my favourite actor is daniel day lewis so that kinda adds credibility to me as a movie goer lol   watch it it is fun otherwise just watch news incase you need to wrench yourself into sorrows   venom rocks
Oct 11 2018,positive,this is a classic marvel story i went for the action and too see my favorite supervillain do cool stuff sony delivered that exactly i wasnt there to see a film i was there to see an entertaining action movie and thats what i saw
Oct 11 2018,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this movie it was fast paced with great graphics acting storyline and character development there were moments that were intense and moments that were funny
Oct 11 2018,positive,went and saw this again today absolutely adore this movie i think the only reason the critics dont like it is it doesnt follow a specific pattern for a genre and its not 100 true to the comics frankly i dont think that matters since the movie on its own is absolutely amazing
Oct 11 2018,positive,very good movie   i relly like the chemestry between eddie brock and the symbiote
Oct 11 2018,positive,dont listen to critics see the movie and make your own decision
Oct 11 2018,positive,i genuinely enjoyed watching it in theaters and would say that the critical score is definitely too harsh it was certainly a more cohesive film than suicide squad and the title character was refreshingly likable given the fact that he is not quiet the superhero trope we have grown accustom too venom has never settled as strictly a villian either so the fact that his character moves between morals in the film was not problematic     rather the larger issues in the film are the anticlimax of the main struggle between venombrock and riotdrake the underdeveloped backstory of eddie brock and his relationship with anne and the vagueness of the symbiote race and their motives     i think the 112 minute run time could have been pushed longer or the script could have done more to enhance our interest in the set up of the characters worlds and that would have improved it overall it felt like an enjoyable buddy cop like flick that i have no regrets about seeing   solid c at the worst
Oct 11 2018,positive,film critics need not apply  i loved it and thought it was well done for what was available at the pg13 level i feel it would have gone from good to great if given the ratings freedom to explore the darker side a bit more perhaps a sequel might do just that we shall see
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie has been shredded by critics but in my opinion its amazing the writers of venom have not fallen into the trap that dc have in trying ti be like the mcu they have made something fresh the cgi was great mostly at some points not so much but you must understand that with the look of venom being so other by nature it is hard to make it look realistic and they do manage to make the symbiotes look real im glad the film wasnt full of the quips and smart comments and such hunour which is throughout the mcu i love the mcu a lot but we have had that humour for 10 years now and sonys fresh take on how to make a comic book film is much needed tom hardy did a brilliant job i was worried as i hated his accent in the trailers but watching the film it didnt bother me the rest of the cast were very good also honestly this film psyched me up which hasnt really happened to me since probably age of ultron and i cant wait for the sequel it is a must watch this film dont be put off by the bad reviews i almost didnt go and im so glad i did
Oct 11 2018,positive,spoilers if youre a genuine fan of venom you can get past the  new back ground and the lack of spider mans presence this movie was good and undeserving of reviews it is getting venom is packed with necessary action and comedy the villain was also amazing and this movie was well worth the ticket price lay off you guys just want spiderman
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was great movie i was watching this and couldnt even find a reason to not like it it was amazing and i have absolutely no idea why rotten tomatoes gave it a bad score
Oct 11 2018,positive,breath of fresh air from the traditional superhero movies what a shame its not rated r the storytellingcharacter development was fine for the most part but felt rushedforced and certain parts does a good job at explaining things leaving very few plot holes hopefully there will be more hardy and venom in the future sony should work hard for a tom holland spiderman appearance otherwise this movies pg 13 rating goes to waste
Oct 11 2018,neutral,right up front venom is not as bad a catwoman that comparison is sensationalist and unfair that said its also not great but there was real potential there tom hardys excellent performance and the glimmers of awesomeness are let down by a generic script weak or nonexisting character motivations a main villain so bland they should have opted to not have a big bad an addiction to expository dialogue and ultimately a movie that is of at least two minds about everything   the film never settles on the type of experience it aims to deliver or the story it wants to tell  its distinctly lacking a thematic anchor    on the other hand for all its flaws  and there are plenty  if you are able to look past them and focus on hardy theres entertainment to be had in this throwback flick   i was able to overlook many of these issues and get some popcorn entertainment out of it unlike the predator or fant4stic however i wouldnt be rushing to own it
Oct 11 2018,positive,great fun movie liked it a lot venom is a funny dude and he and tom hardy have great chemistry also thought elin musk was good addition
Oct 11 2018,positive,not bad but shouldve been great please just let marvel make these from now on 
Oct 11 2018,positive,i dont care what the critics think about this movie i liked it 55
Oct 11 2018,positive,pretty solid movie not a masterpiece but damn entertaining
Oct 11 2018,negative,if only the rest of the movie was as cool as the animation of the blobs moving around outside the bodies
Oct 11 2018,positive,frick the critics loved it
Oct 11 2018,positive,its good for regular fans definitely entertaining and fun
Oct 11 2018,positive,30 is absurd movie was great 
Oct 11 2018,positive,im glad i read the critics before i watched the movie because i entered the theatre with low expectations and ended up loving it i dont know what people are talking about the movie was great especially when you are a marvel fanatic it had the right balance between humour and action great job marvel
Oct 11 2018,positive,the movie is funny and not bad at all
Oct 11 2018,positive,if there was any evidence that rotten tomatoâs critics are completely full of crap this film is it
Oct 11 2018,positive,its not the best depiction of venom but its one of the greatest we have seen so far venom is not great but its a fun and entertaining time
Oct 11 2018,positive,good action tom hardy is great and the dark humor keeps the movie interesting for the 1hr 52 min run time it will help if you have some understanding of the comics that the movie is based off before going to the theaters personally think that an r rating instead of pg13 would have also helped the film would definitely recommend seeing once or twice
Oct 11 2018,positive,i liked the movie and had a good time watching it   tom hardy was really good it was a lot of fun
Oct 11 2018,positive,just a really good movie excited for carnage in the sequel   the critics are overreacting
Oct 11 2018,positive,clearly the the tomato meter got this one wrong 30 critics review when the auidence at the time this was written is at 89
Oct 11 2018,positive,way better than what the top reviews says good movie overall with good laughs but the villain couldve been better
Oct 11 2018,positive,its a good popcorn flick moviefun and enjoyable
Oct 11 2018,positive,the movie is great if you are a fan of venom and a fan of action movies you will have fun people simply expect too much these days and want to decipher every line in a movie try sitting back and enjoying tom hardy did awesome 
Oct 11 2018,positive,tom hardy is great  the movie builds the plot nicely for the first half and then suddenly from the moment venom is introduced it races to the end  it makes no sense why a movie with such a short runtime and so much time spent in the first half developing the story was in such a hurry to be over  thirty minutes added to the middle for development of brock and venom would have really made this a good movie  instead it just skips what should have been the most enjoyable part of the movie to race right to the end  very weird
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is an amazing action packed film with some good laughs tom hardy played his role as brock very well and hope to see a sequel soon
Oct 11 2018,positive,fantastic movie cant wait for the next one had a great time watching
Oct 11 2018,positive,cant get enough of this movie hope the sequel come out soon
Oct 11 2018,positive,i find it really annoying that weve become so numb to hero movies its like if it isnt this grandiose event with half a dozen oscarwinning actors its a crapfest which is ridiculous ironman was the foundation for marvel for one major reason rdj sometimes a movie can be great because its central actor really meshes with the character they are meant to play i loved this movie it wasnt perfect on a scale of daredevil to infinity war but i would absolutely go see it again in theaters and to me that the sign of a great movie tom hardy made a character that has absolutely failed to make headway in any other franchise interesting and engaging and that postcredits cookie at the end will have me first in line for the sequel im really really glad that this movie has seen box office success in spite of the critics reviews the audience is who really counts whose dollars count and we have shown are support     can i also say how annoying it is that this movie has a 89 audience score and yet in the audience review section of the front page all you see is the 2 star reviews fix your algorithm rotten tomatoes the audience is speaking
Oct 11 2018,positive,one of the better movies this year
Oct 11 2018,positive,a great anti hero film eddie and venom work perfectly together
Oct 11 2018,negative,venom is a turd in the wind
Oct 11 2018,positive,some good stuff if i do say so myself
Oct 11 2018,positive,really fun hardy was amaizing but needs even more interaction with venom itself
Oct 11 2018,positive,really fun movie critics dont know what fun is
Oct 11 2018,positive,dont pay any attention to the critics  its a good movie fun entertaining and tom hardy is fricken great in it  likable as hell
Oct 11 2018,positive,dont go by the critics reviews i went for a half priced tuesday show after reading negative reviews from critics this movie is definitely much better than the ratings show one of the better movies of the year tom hardys acting was top notch and they do a good job of maintaining the comic element while conveying the serious storyline
Oct 11 2018,positive,surprisingly very good no need for spider man in this film 
Oct 11 2018,positive,a fairly effective often serious by the numbers drama offset by just the right amount of humour which is heightened after the climax lacking in surprises venom is most engaging when talented lead actor tom hardy has conversations with himself never have losers been this appealing since sam raimis original spiderman movies
Oct 11 2018,positive,ultimately despite my person early opinion that venom cannot exist without spiderman i believe the writers and director did a great job creating a venom character as true to the character as they could while being disconnected from the overall mcu that said i truly will hold on to hope that we see spiderman and venom in the same movie in the future if your a fan of a good time at the movies dont miss this one
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie has many flaws but i didnt watch for the plot i watched it to have a good time and boy did i have a good time definitely recommend it
Oct 11 2018,positive,i may not have seen it yet but this movie actually is more like the comics this movie is actually based off of venom lethal protector  comic dont listen to critics just listen to yourself and like what you want to like i like this film to be exact
Oct 11 2018,positive,a lot of fun contained well acted genuinely funny and oddly endearing not the rrated xenomorph horror flick some people were looking for but by far the best sony superhero flick yet
Oct 11 2018,positive,a bit slow to start but once venom merged with eddie it becomes an absolute action packed laugh fest definitely would watch again and again
Oct 11 2018,positive,i actually liked it    i will admit it took awhile for the action starts but when it did it was pretty decent   and i thought the venom symbiote was hilarious
Oct 11 2018,positive,i thought it was well done there are things that could have been done better but hardy was great story was fun and it was really enjoyable
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is a difficult film for me to review  i had so much fun watching it its easy to overlook its flaws  theres a lot of noise around this film from those critical of it but some of the things people stated were bad i found to be quite good  for one the cgi to me was detailed and artistic  it seems a lot of 100 million budget went towards the vfxcgi  im not sure why people are saying its bad  its better than the final battle in black panther too  secondly i found the tone to find its own  theres a certain kind of dark humor to it that i didnt find jarring or inconsistent as others are stating  maybe they just couldnt get into it and understand what it was going for i dont know  next tom hardys performance was fantastic  hes an actor that is just fun to watch do his craft on the big screen  i didnt find his accent to be bothersome like some have stated  i felt he elevated this film and makes the film worth the price of admission alone  finally i found the score to be excellent and memorable by ludwig göransson black panther creed  this was the icing on the cake of the overall package  though awards season is under way i found this flawed film to be an enjoyable experience and a reminder of the joy of going to the movie theater  if you go in with an open mind i think youll have a fun experience
Oct 11 2018,positive,venom is a fun superhero movie with a good performance by all especially tom hardy i really cant wrap my head around all the negative reviews but i have a hunch that maybe some critics were paid off to say bad things this isnt my favorite marvel movie but i enjoyed it more than several other marvel films which did receive better reviews its a case of dont believe everything you read the action is good the story solid and i even chuckled several times i will definitely be watching this again at some point
Oct 11 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant
Oct 11 2018,positive,loved it so much it was very entertaining
Oct 11 2018,positive,beginning was a little slow but watching venom and eddie grow their relationship and chemistry was by far the best part of this extremely entertaining and refreshing marvel film
Oct 11 2018,negative,what an embarrassing mess i wouldnt even know where to start it is so uneven and the jokes are aimed at 13 year olds unless they have a savvy sense of humor how viewers are giving this high marks only goes to show your their reviews cant be trusted save your money 
Oct 11 2018,positive,saw it and was thoroughly impressed by tom hardy performance no surprise there a couple of plot holes deus ex machina that could nearly wreck the movie watch it for a good time but definitely not to have your mind boggled
Oct 11 2018,positive,i was a little worried when i saw the pg13 rating and the absolute divebomb reviews given by critics but this just proves that critics arent worth listening to the trailer was very gritty which is why i was hoping the rating would be higher but honestly they made the most of it and it was phenomenal the cgi used in the film worked and the fight scenes were incredible especially the standard action movie car chase scene it was so fun to watch and at times played out like a buddy comedy with the back and forth between eddie tom hardy and venom i plan on watching it in theatres again
Oct 11 2018,positive,id definitely watch it over and over again and most would probably do the same
Oct 11 2018,positive,an absolutely enjoyable movie that was better than it had any right to be
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie is worth watching
Oct 11 2018,positive,critics wrong this was good fun maybe not a particularly well structured movie but i had a lot of fun
Oct 11 2018,positive,it was a really good movie tom hardy does a good job building eddie brock as a character and the interaction between venom and eddie is hilarious there where some meh moments but i enjoyed 80 of it the cgi on venom was not the greatest but not awful but riot was very beautiful on screen whish venom looked as great because he looked great   the characters where good and some okay the villain was a bit underwhelming this is more a eddie brock and venom friend story than a beat the villain story and i really like that   really good job on the fight scenes they are incredible and jaw dropping whish it was r rated though   overall a really nice movie from sony
Oct 11 2018,positive,the sequence of how venom came to light in this movie was nicely captured
Oct 11 2018,positive,this is an okay movie the critics tomatometer is probably a excessively harsh the audience score might be a bit lenienti found myself bored in the middle frankly because it is full of white noise action scenes that arent needed  the interactions venom has with itself the interactions between eddie and the alien symbiote are great the growth of the character as the two sides learn more about and gain more influence over each other is wonderful the interactions of venom with others in the world are great too there should have been more of it  cut down the time before we are actually introduced to venom cut down the white noise and keep the action on point and increase the scenes with eddiesymbiote or venom and other characters and i think youve got yourself a great movie  oh and i have a real problem with the film establishing early the very rare occurrence of someone being compatible with a symbiote and then every man and his dog being compatible later on because plot
Oct 11 2018,positive,looking forward to the sequel 
Oct 11 2018,positive,very good and funny action flick
Oct 11 2018,positive,actually a great movie im not sure why critics hated it so much it really was an awesome movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,i had fun watching this film just need to sit back amd just enjoy the film dont pick it apart venom himself was fantastic my only real issue was riots screen time he didnt really have a good amount of it im really keen for the next movie and i plan on seeing venom again this weekend
Oct 11 2018,positive,a fun time and tom hardy sells it all the right way
Oct 11 2018,positive,it had good pacing with enough action and humour to make it an entertaining watch
Oct 11 2018,positive,do not listen to the bad reviews by critics for this movie it was absolutely brilliant  funny great story and hardy as venom was perfect cant wait for the next one
Oct 11 2018,positive,this movie is amazing   recommend watching
Oct 11 2018,positive,not a comic book fan my only complaint is michelle william wig what was happening there it was distracting total miscast 
Oct 11 2018,positive,tom hardys performance the voice actor for venom unique soundtrack and great visual character effects save the subpar story how did they get talent like michelle williams to take this script 
Oct 11 2018,negative,first quartet of the movie was mildly entertaining then fell off wish it would have stayed true to the comic books as to where venom came from
Oct 11 2018,positive,very intense and suspenseful throughout
Oct 11 2018,positive,little too much language for my liking but overall a great movie tom hardy plays an excellent eddie broc venom 
Oct 11 2018,positive,the critics are way off with this movie they cant understand the character at all yes its not the best movie out there but its a good one
Oct 11 2018,positive,a different twist on a super antihero movie   great and cant wait to see carnage in the next installment
Oct 11 2018,positive,this is why you shouldnt listen to critics this movie was great it was funny with plenty of action sequences that will keep you on the edge of your seat the only thing i didnt like was the voice of venom and tom hardys accent other than that it was quite decent and definitely worth watching again
Oct 11 2018,positive,overall its good but it doesnt go out of its way to be anything more than an action movie with a predictable plot and action sequences i do wish they had developed venom as a character more in the movie his sudden urge to save the planet just doesnt make sense hopefully the second one improves on a solid base of a movie franchise 
Oct 11 2018,positive,loved it very funny
Oct 11 2018,positive,a great depiction of venom as he should be symbiotes are not inherently evil they are just otherworldly they were created by a selfserving god who doesnt care about them they have no higher aspirations than to bond with the strongest host they can symbiotes only get stronger as the lineage goes on so venom is comparatively weak to other symbiotes  essentially being like a great great granddaddy to many of the many of the other symbiotes he fights this is very much an underdog film every other symbiote venom encounters will be stronger he is essentially the bumblebee of the symbiote universe they flesh out brocks character quite a bit before they actually have him encounter the symbiote so you dont see venom himself for quite a while that said there is more than enough venom fanservice in this movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,seen it twice sick movie
Oct 11 2018,positive,no matter what you will hear this is a very enjoyable and fun movie
Oct 11 2018,negative,another addition to the epidemic of studio interference and mediocrity in modern cinema this film should be mentioned in the same breath as the amazing spiderman series for its blatant attempt to springboard into a franchise without making any attempt to create a movie audiences havent seen a thousand times before this portrayal of the titular character also falls flat by no fault of hardys acting i found a lot of problems with the script for instance all of the characters are very one dimensional also why did the studio opt to make a movie about an alien symbiote that eats people pg13 most of the deaths happen offscreen or just cut away making the violence seem like it has no consequences a waste of a great character and concept 
Oct 11 2018,positive,oh man had a blast watching this hardy was terrific i go to movies to have fun and be entertained and was its not perfect but i want to see it again and highly anticipate sequel
Oct 11 2018,positive,its nice action and funny
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved it but if it had a r rating im sure it would have done alot better than it did but im hoping they make a sequel with carnige in it
Oct 11 2018,positive,very good superhero movie solid plot well acted cool special effects solid ending i enjoyed it immensely i will add my voice to the first part of the movie being slow but that was fine because then you were eager and receptive of the non stop action of the second half and slow doesnt equal bad listen to the audience and not the critics if youre a purist fan of the comics you might not be as big of a fan they changed some origin stuff obviously 
Oct 11 2018,positive,a lot of fun and the performances a good cant wait fir the sequel
Oct 11 2018,positive,excellent popcorn movie  it doesnt pretend to be anything but that
Oct 11 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in 2018 have to watch it again soon
Oct 11 2018,negative,conveyor movie bad antagonist bad love story very rushed pg13 very short
Oct 11 2018,negative,this movie blows do not go see this spare yourself 
Oct 11 2018,positive,its funny dont think too hard and you will enjoy it
Oct 11 2018,positive,better than i thought 
Oct 11 2018,positive,movies like venom are exactly why i ignore critics opinions on films the relationship between venom and brock was fleshed out very well decent action scenes with enough laughs to keep it light hearted wouldve preferred a tighter accuracy towards the comics but when you disregard what you already know its a good film with some great ideas
Oct 11 2018,positive,best song spiderman based film could have used more build up about eddie the loss of his relationship felt very flat when he lost it all  cgi was quite good other than the last fight scene the best part is the relationship between venom and edddie
Oct 11 2018,positive,eddie and venoms chemistry was great
Oct 11 2018,positive,set a timer to wake yourself up after the first 35 minutes of snooze fest and the rest of the movie is not too bad
Oct 11 2018,positive,been a longterm venom fan right from the start old school and wished for a movie the time was right for his movie debut and i can say for myself i am not disappointed dont hold back it is a good movie with some flaws only because there is no spiderman the sequel will make up for the missing spider for sure will also be buying this on 4k when it gets released music is good the start has a et feel to it and some funny parts during the movie a
Oct 11 2018,positive,awesome way to introduce venom love the special effects and the different story line 
Oct 11 2018,positive,its fun and entertain and easy to watch for people who doesnt read a comic before recommended
Oct 11 2018,positive,great action scenes solid plot definitely would watch again brilliant special effects occasionally odd script but overall really good
Oct 11 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics 
Oct 11 2018,positive,fun comic book movie the critic rating baffles me
Oct 11 2018,positive,entertaining and interesting would go see a sequel
Oct 10 2018,positive,all i got to say is that it was good 
Oct 10 2018,positive,over all a great movie in general one scene got very jump cut heavy which hurt my eyes is the only complaint against it
Oct 10 2018,positive,funny cgi was fake but nice story
Oct 10 2018,positive,saw it today thought it was really good
Oct 10 2018,positive,a wonderful film its unfortunate that critics only purpose is to shit on movies which is why i pay them little mind trust in the audience score always     this film is funny action packed and poignant well deserving of a franchise let the box office numbers and user reviews speak for themselves its obvious that the critics are severely out of touch and werent loved enough as children i d reticule them further but its just too damn easy
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie saw it with my friend worth watching 
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was a total blast with a great performance by tom hardy but i understand why its been as divisive as it is
Oct 10 2018,positive,i think this is the venom movie i expected without a spiderman connection and at this point i think it would be lesser with his inclusion as a fan of both the hero and antihero i am more than happy to see a darker character get lead billing instead of twenty minutes plotting to take over the world    i thought they did a good job making him independent and interesting including a lot of comic book references without making it inaccessible with those just coming in it was visually exciting i will admit some fight sequences were a little too close and speedy to be 100 certain what might have been happening but it felt true to character    i may not be a movie critic but as a fan going to see one of his favorite characters i was very pleased and am now eager for another film if they continue to go down this path
Oct 10 2018,positive,wow i loved this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,i absolutely love the movie going to go see it like three more times probably more mainly because i am a huge marvel fan but also a huge tom hardy fan as well
Oct 10 2018,positive,for my surprise venom is better that the critics are saying not a perfect movie but i have a lotof fun if sony will make a sequel it needs to correct a lot of things
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie and fun cast i cant wait for part 2
Oct 10 2018,positive,seems to me that its very possible that a lot of critics were paid to be critical and might not have actually watched the movie if they did they probably would not be running what looks like a smear campaign against it
Oct 10 2018,positive,liked it but i wished we got to see riot more
Oct 10 2018,negative,its a shame that this might have been decent if it werent for the missing second act and rushed incomplete climax tom hardys performance as eddievenom is the only thing holding the movie together it feels like he was destined for a better film but wound up stuck in this one
Oct 10 2018,positive,the critics are just nitpicking and hating a lil bit this movie was actually very entertaining  5
Oct 10 2018,positive,hi this film is not as bad as they say it is a generic superhero movie where the most violent parts are slightly covered up to reach a wider audience what is missing is deadpools black comedy this film is too serious for a marvel franchise i think over edited but a  thier is a great cameo at the end stick around for some carnidge
Oct 10 2018,positive,pros nice little story not too great a never seen before side of tom hardy symbiot art is almost perfect and ringed true to the comic books fight scenes were great entertaining cons needed to be longer story needed some curves romantic chemistry was absentneeded better villian
Oct 10 2018,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies different and fun and comic relief for sure tom hardy makes the character all that and more
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom was a pleasant surprise it was a fun movie and i would actually like to own it when it comes out of theaters
Oct 10 2018,positive,was entertaining funny and cool effects story about weak but worth the time
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved venom as a kid and this was really fun happy to see this come to life
Oct 10 2018,positive,easily some of the most fun ive had watching a movie people are just mad it wasnt a gritty with commentary on humanity
Oct 10 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie especially the chemistry between eddy brook and venom the graphics are not the best as we are used to in marvels movies but its fine this movie definitely do not deserve these bad reviews it has received from critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,i just loved this movie  i for one came in to this movie thinking i was gonna hate it but man i did not expect to laugh so much 
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is fun refreshing well played by all the actors and most importantly it sparked conversations amongst audience members  nerdy brilliant epic conversations and expectations for whats next to come i usually agree with rotten tomatoes critics but they definitely got it wrong this time around dont believe me go see it for yourself and for once you be the judge
Oct 10 2018,positive,rotten tomatoes has this one wrong it was a great movie the only thing i would have liked to see is some more back story for all the parasites
Oct 10 2018,positive,really enjoyed it still an action movie with a touch of humor
Oct 10 2018,positive,honestly didint think it would be nearly as awesome as it was great movie loved the eddievenom parts
Oct 10 2018,positive,simple really good acting
Oct 10 2018,positive,seriously a great movie dont listen to the i am a professional critics that critisize everything they are people like the rest of us and do not speak for everyone its a good movie has alot of laughs built in and kind of a romance thing love the action scenes brock personally probably would be better played by jeremy renner or better known as hawk eye from the avengers all in all a great movie and hopefully a second will come out and they will figure out how to tie it in with spiderman and maybe more
Oct 10 2018,negative,this was hot garbage disappointing  cant have venom without spiderman  it was close to being as bad as a dc movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,totally true to the comics with a natural feeling splash of modern day to it i was pleased to see venom depicted as the goofy loser alien ape ive always known overall a really great movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,movie does kinda take a little to long to build up to the part were brock and venom combine with each other but other than that it is a fantastic movie and already have seen it twice since opening night in theaters and will go see it more tom hardy is a great actor for venom and eddy brock overall outstanding movie cant wait until the sequel when carnage and venom fight so excited
Oct 10 2018,negative,so unbelievably horrible ive watched it twice and i am sad to say it doesnt get better the second time it actually gets worse this movie had so much potential and it failed to deliver anything meaningful with side plots that go nowhere characters that lack any depth ex the female doctor that i cant remember the name of this is what i mean unnecessary slow motion usage hard cuts that make scenes feel clunky scenes that feel shorter than they should be leaving you wondering if you missed something a main character that is portrayed by the worst acting tom hardy has ever shown a secondary main character venom that changes motivations for reasons that are unclear useless exposition about how the symbiote works that either is followed by the movie showing us exactly what they just said or the opposite showing you the abilities and weaknesses of the symbiote and then explicitly telling you exactly what you just saw it is all made much better when you realize that most of the time the symbiote doesnt react to the things it should react to unless its pertinent to the plot most of this is just rambling but there is nothing to enjoy about this movie except for 1 scene that is only half as good as it could have been but that doesnt mean the movie is worth a watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,great action movie with a little comedy
Oct 10 2018,positive,intense good the simbiote is awesome and funny tom hardy rocks
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie is mediocre at best critics were fair it gets 3 and a half stars from me because tom hardy carried this movie all the way without him it would be all over
Oct 10 2018,positive,i havent had this much fun watching a movie in a long time tom hardy really nailed it with his performance of both eddy and venom the action was intense which made the jokes that much more enjoyable im hoping they make the next one r seemed like the rating ending up nerfing a real badass film if youre looking for a serious faithful to the comics movie maybe temper your expectations its a fun ride and i plan on seeing it again in theaters ive been encouraging friends to go heres hoping they make more    pascal
Oct 10 2018,positive,hey  this is a good movie   why is everybody hating on it i love it no   offense   really funny   but love it i hate it doesnt matter   its because i love them a lot a lot a lot a lot from this movie its from his origin  so yeah   if youre like me then go watch this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom in my opinion is a generally great movie sure it has flaws like the villain could have been way better as well as the story and the weak relationship between eddie and anne but at its core its a really fun movie to watch tom hardys eddie brock and venoms relationship in this film is what really made me love this movie the constant struggle between the two and their eventual cooperation is such a great element and is really why this movie is great i personally think you should watch this movie despite what the critics say
Oct 10 2018,positive,sony can create its own universe
Oct 10 2018,positive,funnest non spider spiderman movie  yes it would have been better with spiderman but it would not have been able to be a venom film with spiderman
Oct 10 2018,positive,sorry critics but i had such a fun and great time watching venom     it was fast paced funny full of action really really entertaining in the end thats what movies should do entertain
Oct 10 2018,negative,honestly there was hardly a storyline i think tom hardy is an amazing actor usually but this role did nothing for him very weak script
Oct 10 2018,positive,outstanding truly better than i thought it was going to be sure it had a few unnecessary scenes but that doesnt mean it deserved a freakin 29100
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was amazing i cant wait for the next one
Oct 10 2018,neutral,good time in the theater cgi better than justice league 
Oct 10 2018,positive,when it comes to comic movies its all personal preference  that matters  i loved the movie as much as ironman 1 
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a fun movie if you think of it like a comic book the imagery corny jokes and decisions characters make is not meant to be overly realistic venom stays true to what marvel used to be comics for kids avoiding the profanity and gore seen in my adult style marvel movies today keeping all this in mind it sets up the next spiderman movie better than critics give it credt for
Oct 10 2018,positive,i think this was very well done especially having read the critics reviews before going in this isnt supposed to be a super hero movie but rather a monster rivalry between symbiotes setting itself up to stand with hopefully the mcu it was funny fluid and well made it isnt a super serious oscar nomination but it was a kick ass thrill ride that portrayed the relationship between a protagonist in constant battle with his dark side it was fun enjoy it for what it is
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie was great dont listen to the critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,critics wrong again remind me again why they have jobs 
Oct 10 2018,positive,so im going to try to keep this short and i as a comic book fan had a few issues with the movie but the bottom line of it all the movie is fun once the action kicks up it is a non stop ride through the mind of eddy brock and venom tom hardy plays a great eddie brock and would make an amazing addition to the mcu if allowed to do so and venom has a personality all his own i dont want to give up much but i went in with very high expectations for this movie and i still had a great time considering watching the movie stop and do it worth the theatre experience i will be fully supporting a sequel and thats without the amazing end credit scene
Oct 10 2018,positive,action packed entertaining great acting by tom hardy
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie lots of action good acting to much cussing
Oct 10 2018,positive,plot was a bit whimsical at times however the great character acting of hardy and the personality of the super villain venom make this film quite enjoyable would watch again
Oct 10 2018,negative,the first half was really interesting  the second half seemed like it was phoned in
Oct 10 2018,positive,very entertaining movie i really liked this one despite the bad reviews  just watch the movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom was definitely better than i thought and this is coming from a massive fan solid 710 for me
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was great it was funny and all the things i wanted give venom some respect it was a good movie and i have no complaints
Oct 10 2018,positive,its was a great movie tom hardy delivered a not too strong brock so the second one will really be interesting
Oct 10 2018,negative,i dont get it the make this cringe cgi with 100 million budget
Oct 10 2018,positive,best movie ever even better than your mom
Oct 10 2018,positive,i really liked this movie  eddie is not eddie from the comic books and that is a good thing  venom is great no spiderman needed in this story
Oct 10 2018,positive,fuckin superb would recommend
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a venom movie without spiderman so it isnt bad at all
Oct 10 2018,positive,in 2007 spiderman 3 hit theaters while it still received an overall positive reception from media outlets ie its rotten tomatoes score of 62 it faced a mixed reaction from fans and from many of the film critics who reviewed it this was for many reasons the overabundance of villains and the emo peter scene were a couple but the criticism that stood out the most was the films mistreatment of eddie brock  venom many believed topher grace was miscast in the role and that the character wasnt done justice by the script or the actor as a result the film went down infamously in the history books of film nerds and comics fans now in 2018 sony has released a form of apology for spiderman 3 in the form of venom an origin story of the villain  antihero that every fan of the spiderman character has been waiting to see done right    venom stars tom hardy as eddie brock a journalist who spends his time exposing seedy businessmen and defending the poor and homeless of san francisco that is until his life is turned upsidedown by the shady life foundation and he is bonded with the venom symbiote hardys casting as brock is my first praise of the film he is excellent in the role and i found the change of personality from the vengeful eddie seen in the comics to the more valiant one seen in this film refreshing and enjoyable the backandforth banter between him and the symbiote made for some great comedy and a great representation of their conflicting goals and personalities he also looks the part much more than topher grace did bulky muscular and intimidating traits that are multiplied whenever the symbiote takes over which by the way looks awesome the design for the venom character in this film is much closer to what comics fans including myself wanted it is understandably cgi heavy but i thought it was very well done    as far as other characters in venom are concerned theyre well lacking in quality tom hardy undoubtedly steals the show here which is unfortunate when considering the surprising amount of acting talent that surrounds him riz ahmed plays the villainous head of the life foundation carlton drake who later dons the riot symbiote his character is as bland and boring as they come and is one of the most poorly written and poorly acted evilbusinessmantype villains that ive seen in a while its hard to decide if ahmeds acting is to blame but im more inclined to lend that blame to the writers due to his stellar performance from 2014s nightcrawler and his great role from rogue one michelle williams is also underutilized in the film but i thought the criticism directed towards her characters uselessness was harsher than was merited the remaining supporting cast is small and serviceable not particularly memorable or creative nor particularly bad    now its time to address some of the criticisms that have filled the majority of reviews for venom for most films i try to avoid watching  reading too many reviews if i plan to see the picture in question however i couldnt really help myself with venom so i think im just going to state my agreement  disagreement with some of the more common points that were made first of all should the film have been rated r yes i think it should have while it was fine as a pg13 film it definitely would have benefited from showing some decapitations and exploring more of the bodyhorror elements that would have made the film great next is the action bad no i dont agree with this one sure venom is a darklycolored character and many of the action scenes take place at night but i still very much enjoyed these scenes the cgiheavy finale definitely wasnt as impactful as the cool car chase sequence or the swat team encounter shown in the trailers but it worked well enough for me next is the films beginning boring no not completely this isnt to say that the films first half is exciting but i overall enjoyed the exposition that led to brocks encounter with the venom symbiote it was relatively interesting and fueled by the charisma that hardy brings to the film finally is it any good actually yes i think venom is a film that will receive a much warmer audience reception than the predominantly negative reaction coming from film critics despite its lack of spiderman or connection to the mcu it somehow manages to work as a standalone film it does justice to the character and im intrigued by the potential of other similar spiderman villain origin films in the future    of course while i enjoyed venom i still wouldnt call it amazing or any word much stronger than good like i already mentioned the villain is poorly written and presented which wouldnt be a problem in some films however venoms story relies heavily on the elon musklike carlton drake so his importance hurts the film quite a bit the writing is also very scattershot there are several events that happen way too quickly or are brushed aside mindlessly character motivations switch around without explanation and some of the dialogue is downright cringy the shottoshot editing in the film also stood out to me for seeming careless on several occasions possibly due to reshoots or the removal of certain frames the sound and music make the film feel needlessly loud at times and finally the cgi while better than what was shown in the trailers isnt quite topnotch    venom acts as a fitting apology to the mistreatment of the character that we saw over 10 years ago tom hardy portrays a fantastic version of eddie brock and is accompanied by a satisfyingly large menacing and badasslooking venom i think its safe to say objectively that the film does the character justice i only wish that the rest of the film matched the quality of its leading characters beat for beat despite its handful of flaws and imperfections i walked out of venom happy and pleasantly surprised so im giving it 3 out of 5 stars
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a turn your brain off movie that takes humour dark themes and action and mashes it together into a thrilling movie that everyone should see
Oct 10 2018,positive,i really liked venom i thought it was an awesome movie the action was good venom looked great and riot was a scary villain i think the final battle could have used less shaky cam but overall i enjoyed it
Oct 10 2018,positive,one of the best  i have seen for tom hardy he is a unique actor only he can potrait this character  venom is good story line good be bigger and little more dramatic but with all else venom is a superb movie 
Oct 10 2018,positive,thought it was good idk it was just different then most movies
Oct 10 2018,positive,kinda like deadpool but toned down definitely worth a watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,i appreciate the references to the comics and stuff like the chocolate or the eating brains or riot in general or j jonah jamesons son but the story lacked a captivating plotline and was honestly kind of weak
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy was amazing
Oct 10 2018,positive,this may not be the 616 eddie brock but damn did this movie hit all the right notes violence a bit of insanity a believable brock played by tom hardy and so many nods to the comics the pg13 rating is sure the by the amount of brutality but with minimal bloodloss  the critics are wrong this venom needs no webhead at all
Oct 10 2018,positive,not bad even without spiderman in it it was fun tom hardy did a good job in my opinion
Oct 10 2018,positive,awesome movie yall movie critics are dumb to think venom was bad
Oct 10 2018,positive,awesome movie nice build up and mind blowing aftercredit scene 
Oct 10 2018,positive,it delivers what its supposed to deliver loud fun entertaining no it doesnt need to make that much sense to be entertaining
Oct 10 2018,negative,oh boy where do i begin    sony desperately join the superheroes movies bandwagon with venom a standalone character film which supposedly tied with spiderman but in this movie because of legal issues mumbojumbo he isnt    welp lets give it benefit of the doubt right but hey sony when will you ever learn man venom like the others that come and gone it is just a manufactured corporate product that was made in a rush and a halfass result    the plot is bland the cinematography are boring and underwhelming to say the least most of the characters have no personallity and no character development that will make you invested whatsoever    also i think theyre gonna make it into rrated or deadpoolesque but i think theyre changing their mind so it look so halfassed    some of the humor feels kinda forced and not works but some of the serious scene are so bad but it turn out to be funny at least for me    however tom hardy performance sometimes is quite over the top and unintentionally hillarous    and with a cast like tom hardy michelle williams and surprise woody harrelson you think at least the acting was good but they do not even trying in this movie except tom hardy which i think hes having fun and that is good for him    the visual are the worst and considering it was made with 100 million usd budget you expect to see better visual effect but hey at least we see a lot fun venom fluid animatic movement    also the final battle god that awful ps2esque cutscene    but despite all of this venom is still enjoyable to some extent    ps if you want to watch better venom movie watch upgrade2018 instead
Oct 10 2018,negative,boring at best not viewable at worst this movie is a clean case of avoid or regret almost all aspects of moviemaking was subpar  graphics action direction acting scriptwriting story etc the movie makes you realize that time is precious dont waste it on this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,a very average movie at best however the scenes with venom make up for it
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is right on how the comic book is written the movie hits on all levels dont know what the critics are mad about
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved it saw it twice already the cgi is very well placed in that it still looked natural and realistic i love the angle theyre going for with venom and their motivation although i feel like characterization couldve been expressed better a second watch does give you a better understanding of venoms character arc the action was as beautifully choreographed and witty lines were well placed and in pacing with the show   im already looking for dates to the sequel i just might like this a bit better than deadpool
Oct 10 2018,positive,they made the back story and graphics so realllll i rate that
Oct 10 2018,negative,wasnt what i was expecting and thought it would be so much better if it was rated r
Oct 10 2018,positive,screw the critics that never picked up a comic book use your own brain and go enjoy this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,i dont why all critics hate this movie is fine nothing amazing but is enjoyable i guees sometimes people  just dont want to accept a marvel character can get a good movie outside of marvel studios  all critics are talking shit
Oct 10 2018,positive,if you go to see a movie based on a comic book that tells the tale of a guy whose body merges with an alien and youre expecting a cerebral film you should probably stay home
Oct 10 2018,positive,i dont know why these critics think they know what a good movie is i watched it and would watch more loved it and had a good laugh
Oct 10 2018,positive,critics l good movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,amazing movie and you critics were totally wrong about it thoroughly enjoyed it a good balance of comedy and action a few lines missed the post but most were great
Oct 10 2018,negative,entertaining to a very small degree but overall sloppy inconsistent and pointless 410
Oct 10 2018,positive,critics are wrong fun film
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was witty fun and the relationship between eddie brock and venom was accurate and fun i personally enjoyed the nonattachment to spiderman because that way this character was its own thing the car scene change was awesome was expecting more gore for an r rating but thats just my two cents
Oct 10 2018,positive,i honestly really liked the movie its clear that the difference between the audience and the critics opinion is very different i wonder why that is
Oct 10 2018,positive,one of those movies that fans will love and critics are destined to hate
Oct 10 2018,positive,its crazy that they think this is only worth 30 this movie was amazing
Oct 10 2018,positive,thought it was a great movie despite the critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,wtf is wrong with these critics 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i love venoms personality it is so funny if you watch the movie to have fun you will if you watch the movie to point out every mistake you will if you watch the movie to have a bad time you will
Oct 10 2018,positive,i dont care what the critics say this movie was great it was a little silly but that made it better in my opinion it was a funny movie that was truly fun to watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,a solid superhero film that focuses on its own story but has a great future in a broader universe
Oct 10 2018,positive,such a good movie so funny amazing actors eddie and venom were amazing together and kept me engaged throughout the entire movie this is the best comic book movie that ive seen its just phenomenal a definite must see
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie  action with a lil bit of comedy
Oct 10 2018,positive,bad review from reviewer but this one is movie that i rrally enjoyed the humour the action is really goodwaiting for venom 2
Oct 10 2018,negative,october 5 2018    ive a feeling the studio that released venom didnt have a whole lot of faith in it watching it one gets the sense it was made as a sort of a throwaway superhero movie not to be taken seriously especially since this marvel characters first standalone picture doesnt even take place in the familiar marvel comics universe alongside wellestablished heroes like iron man spiderman and black panther perhaps the powers that be felt that venoms inherently evil nature was too unsuitable and grotesque for the likes of the mcus more beloved and squeakyclean avengers team and therefore wanted to keep him a safe distance from their safer more familyfriendly goldmine properties in a way it almost feels like venom was set up to fail but as it turns out it actually has a style and personality of its own and never stops moving     thats not to say venom is a good film in fact its a bit of a small mess but i do believe it sets up a promising series because were never quite sure which direction the titular character will swing as far as acting as hero or villain and such an ambiguous trait makes him fundamentally more interesting generally speaking marvel superhero characters tend to be fairly cut and dry in regard to their morals values and noble intentions with little wiggle room but in the case of venom its not just his physicality that can shiftso can his mood his behavior and his principles and that gives future installment a wide range of possibilities    for now though we have this inaugural venom chapter which gets a bit out of control as far as plot action and characters are concerned even though it has a constant momentum the presentation feels rushed scrambled and often too silly for its own good it has a bmovie quality to it although given the director is ruben fleischer who helmed the irreverent and uproarious zombieland im not writing this off as his intention perhaps fleischer wanted the movie to reflect venoms temperament in that its sort of marvels wildcard entry into the ubiquitous superhero genre maybe he wanted it to come across as a rebellious antisuperhero movie with a rude impudent carefree attitude one that doesnt subscribe to the same old trajectory as its brethren whatever the case venom despite its brief moments of audacity and impertinence never fully gels or comes together in an overall satisfying way but at least its never boring like its main character it could go any number of ways    as is typical of the genre the plot of venom finds an ordinary pathetic man suddenly infused with extraordinary abilities whos then unsure of how to handle them eddie brock tom hardy is an investigative news reporter with his own tv show in san francisco his mo is exposing big bad people for what they are in order to hold them accountable for their harmful actions and effects on society eddie is a dogooder but hes also a little rough around the edges     his latest target is a billionaire megalomaniac named carlton drake riz ahmed who founded the life foundation a large corporation which in spite of its name is linked to various wrongful deaths and has several lawsuits pending against it the firm representing drakes company employs eddies fiancée anne the always angelic michelle williams whose grace and elegance makes us wonder what shes doing in a movie like this when eddie tries to probe drake on camera and get him to admit to malfeasance both anne and eddie are fired and anne subsequently gives eddie her engagement ring back    as it turns out eddie is right about drake he came across documents that revealed how four astronauts died during one of life foundations missions to outer space to retrieve symbiotic life forms its part of drakes larger scheme to bond alien symbiotes to human hosts as a way to ensure humans will one day be able to survive on distant planets since he sees the environmental collapse of earth as inevitable and of course with drake being the villain his methods are hasty and egodriven and he demands his chief scientist dr dora skirth jenny slate immediately start human testing with the parasites but skirth argues this could deadly and so she seeks brock out to expose the truth     cut to eddie infiltrating drakes lab and becoming infected by one of the symbiotes a black gooey mesh named venom who has a personality and voice of his own when venom bonds to eddie he manifests as a large beastly creature with big white eyes razor sharp teeth and a long curly tongue he gets inside eddies head talks to him and uses his body among other things to feed fight and form gigantic weapons like axes hammers and blades our initial impression is that venom only wants to spread evil and wreak havoc on the inferior human population but as he tells eddie i like you eddie and im starting to like it here on my planet im a loser like you    surprisingly venom is not just a onenote character he actually forms more than just a physical bond with eddie and the two develop a sort of lovehate relationship as they vie for control of eddies body once they reach an understanding they attempt to stop drake from launching another space mission that would bring additional symbiotes from venoms home planet back to earth which could be catastrophic     following its quick setup venom ultimately turns into a series of perfunctory superhero movie scenes including an extended chase sequence inevitable for any action movie especially one that takes place in san francisco eddievenom fending off drakes goons which showcase venoms shapeshifting abilities and short interstices of humor and plot exposition its familiar structure doesnt really give us anything we havent seen before which make the action and plot rather underwhelming and unambitious     where venom holds its own however are the scenes between eddie and venom as they interact and actually have discussions about who they are and what they feel i liked how the screenplay by jeff pinker scott rosenberg and kelly marcel adapting the character conceived by todd mcfarlane and david michelinie for spiderman comics gives venom something to say you may recall his first cinematic appearance was in the muchmaligned spiderman 3 in which he was ultimately relegated to a forgettable side character but here obviously he has a more substantial role he talks frankly and honestly with eddie even confides in him this is something i wasnt expecting and their exchanges proved more interesting than all the standard superhero stuff when it comes time for venom 2 i hope the filmmakers take this into account and expand on eddie and venoms tugofwar relationship and what makes them tick as individuals instead of just flaunting venoms physical powers     if venom was to one day make his way into the avengers version of the marvel comics universe its difficult to say where hed fit in but thats part of his appeal he doesnt adhere to the normal rules and although this first movie doesnt quite pay off its got me curious about future venom entries because with more focus and cohesion from the filmmakers not to mention more apparent faith from the studio i believe the character could go places and who knows maybe it would have to be the traditional mcu that would have to be worthy of him and not the other way around
Oct 10 2018,negative,its too bad i cant leave a lower rating
Oct 10 2018,neutral,interesting concept but not the venom movie we deserve tom hardy does an amazing job trying to balance the tone of the movie with the tone of venom from the comics  the best part of the movie is the relationship between eddie brock and venom everything else is not in order and in need of a more competent overseer say kevin feige
Oct 10 2018,positive,just as fun as deadpool reminds me of upgrade great movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,the only reason this film gets criticism is due to its lack of advertisements or should i say advertisements on the wrong features if you want a fun mostly light hearted horror with an marvel film this would be an ideal film however the dark gritty reality is not what u would expect throughout the majority of the film
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was good different twist the main actor looked drunk all the time even when he was soberlol
Oct 10 2018,positive,predictable but really fun
Oct 10 2018,positive,its pretty funny to watch theres a lot of action which doesnt make it boring
Oct 10 2018,positive,i thought it was a great movie tom hardy gave an outstanding performance a lot of you are too spoiled by a1 movies to appreciate any damn thing it seems im glad venom one of my favorite characters growing up has come to the big screen
Oct 10 2018,positive,really enjoyed it but felt the plot line was a little rushed the rest of the movie makes up for it
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was an overall good movie better than any other spider man out although it could have been faster building up the story and it could have been more fight scenes
Oct 10 2018,positive,not a perfect film but ss a huge venom fan i loved it socalled professional critics havent got a clue what theyre talking about
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a fun movie and my teen age boys loved it venom was lacking a bit in back story but i think that its because 30 minutes of it was removed i may get the blue ray version just to see the cuts
Oct 10 2018,positive,not the best antiheroe movie sure but its a fun easy to digest film with the potential to explore diferent genres
Oct 10 2018,positive,i went to see this film having seen that it had a low rating i went looking for negativity assuming it would be a terrible film instead i came out having had an amazing time the action sequences are intense the effects are incredible and the biplay between eddie and venom was done amazingly i would recommend this to am of my friends and am in the process of doing so definitely preferred to a lot of recent marvel films and found to be a refreshingly fun film
Oct 10 2018,positive,why everyone is hating on this movie just because spiderman isnt in it    i loved this movie a lot so please pay attention to the audience opinions and we definitely liked this film
Oct 10 2018,positive,a fine fun 90s romp  i am amazed at the critics score being so wrong on this
Oct 10 2018,negative,sony really needs to let go of spiderman this movie is just goofy and dumb only the venom symbiote has an arc yes you heard me not even eddie got an arc the story felt random at times as well as feeling like the writers just made things up as they go when something good does happen its just forgotten about i want to bring up how venom itself is ironically goofy at times that made me wish they went for an rrating on this one sony shouldve learned from spiderman 3 and the tasm trilogy its like a turd in the wind
Oct 10 2018,positive,very good and enjoyable the beginning was a little bit boring but you forget that when the action starts
Oct 10 2018,positive,was not expecting to love it but did my daughter didnt know a thing about venom but thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well funnier than i thought it would be and the acting was spot on will it win any huge awards nope  not likely will i see it again and again like guardians of the galaxy and the avengers movies yep its just good fun  dont try and read more into it than that and youll likely love it too 
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was fun watching it i loved that the character is not entirely good but also not entirely bad
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie but couldve been much much better
Oct 10 2018,positive,it a dark version of a super hero flick 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved the movie i went in without seeing the trailer and hearing how bad it was from others i thought it was great  very funny i love venom he is now my favorite bad guy
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie true to the character been a venom fan for most my life walked away pleased with how the movie went
Oct 10 2018,positive,fun and critics dont know how to have it   the conversation between characters is fun  the story is a bit flawed but why did you come here for that  the action can get messy but when it isnt its great violent
Oct 10 2018,positive,a bit clunky at times but it delivers a good mix of action and comedy the struggles might be rising from a trying to fit in a good story and introduce a new universe to some viewers the universe being the introduction of symbiotes i have high hopes for the next two and expect them to be great
Oct 10 2018,positive,not a big fan of spider man universe but this movie was great it gave a good background story and didnt overload with cg 
Oct 10 2018,positive,honestly such a good film my friends all loved it too cant always go by critics clearly
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved the movie it showed the raw power of venom the only flaw was that when venom transferred his power to another host they look the same as the host before him that was the only problem with it i thought bc in the comics venom looks different on every host like with spider man he just is wearing a black suit but when he transfers his power to eddie brock he got bigger and more villines bc of all the hatred brock had
Oct 10 2018,positive,what do critics know absolutely nothing  see it a fantastic film that i didnt want to see end tom hardy with his rough edges is perfect as brockmanvenom and the film whizzes along with enough action to keep you watching the venom brockman interaction is brilliant and funny just as marvel films should be go see it
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie great actors great story great soundtrack lately i have been tired of how long and complicated superhero movies are this one is funny action packed and smart this and more in an hour and forty minutes thumpsup
Oct 10 2018,positive,best super hero movie since guardians of the galaxy volume 1
Oct 10 2018,positive,funny characters and great writing
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is best comic book movie ive ever seen i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 10 2018,positive,besides the plot holes venom is overall a great ride from beginning to end great action and the relationship with venom is hilarious 
Oct 10 2018,positive,will watch again one of the funniest and best movies ever
Oct 10 2018,negative,its enjoyable at times with the interaction btween venom and eddie repeats the old marvel formula showing an origin of a hero where  at the climax battles a literally gray version of himself with th adition of the most stupid love arc also venomsw arc is really dunb when he dicedes to save the earth  also the whole symbiote in asia looks more like a way to make tencent happy and cash some money since all of that was useless for the plot
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is great but you really cant cut the blood and violence also this felt rushed through the symbiote story line im glad it had humor but i cant get past the lack of blood they better not do this to carnage
Oct 10 2018,negative,without spiderman i thought venom wouldnt stand alone still believe that after watching dialogue was forced humor or attempt at it wasnt funny tom hardy played a decent eddie brock but the way he talked was weird started great but fizzled out at the end a lot of cheese in this movie wasnt expecting a comedy
Oct 10 2018,negative,while venom was nowhere near the kind of disaster everyone has saidpredicted as there are some decent sequences and tom hardy looking like hes having fun it still feels like something is missing they probably could have gotten away with doing this film without spiderman being involved but when you have the symbiote saying lines like im like you eddie im a loser and giving himself the name without context along with the last action scene looking like something out of a transformers movie and 90s action movie style editinghonestly i wish they made this film r rated and go all out just so i could have some kind of substance
Oct 10 2018,positive,whopper if you dont like it for what it is which is hilarious then you have no soul
Oct 10 2018,positive,after watching the movie i realized that it could have definitely been longer but then i saw a video where tom hardy tells an interviewer that most of his favorite scenes were cut from the film the movie was a bit too actiony and didnt have much of a traditional marvel story line but as a venom fanboy i really just enjoyed seeing the adaptation on the big screen secretly hoping for more to come from venom
Oct 10 2018,positive,amazing movie 1010 would recommend its great to see venom as a hero the cgi on venom was amazing this is the venom we marvel fans deserved
Oct 10 2018,negative,its like the mask but no one involved knows theyre making a comedy
Oct 10 2018,positive,i liked it its a good and entertaining movie not the most catching story but cool charecter and cool scenes with venom and hardy
Oct 10 2018,positive,dont listen to any of the critics i dont know if there is some conspiracy against sony or something but the film was great and very entertaining its a must watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,stupid plot bad acting on some characters and a weak villain i wouldve really disliked this movie if it wasnt for the character of venom himself and the action those things alone are good enough to make the movie decent its a fun time just dont dig to deep into the other things 
Oct 10 2018,positive,just remember these critics are the ones who gave star wars the last jedi a good rating go see this movie and judge for yourself tom hardy made this role quite memorable and the darker tone of this movie is a welcome change of pace from marvels usual formula
Oct 10 2018,positive,i was extremely excited to see this movie and it was even better than what i could have ever imagined
Oct 10 2018,positive,still a five star from me for its genre despite all the hate great stuff from tom hardy nice setup for future installments and good music cheers
Oct 10 2018,positive,loved it  really good movie 
Oct 10 2018,positive,continuity and pacing is awkward but story acting and plot twists massively make up for it
Oct 10 2018,positive,not winning any oscars but a lot of fun
Oct 10 2018,positive,genuinely so good dont know what the critics are on about theyre dumb seriously a really enjoyable film actually hilarious
Oct 10 2018,positive,not winning any oscars but definitely a lot of fun
Oct 10 2018,positive,better than other marvel movies my favorite so far recommend watching this movie in theaters or when it come out on dvd buy it
Oct 10 2018,positive,fun movieeddie brock venom relationship movie is awesomereally fun and funny experience
Oct 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed every campy silly weird moment of this dark carnival ride reminscent of gremlins or crampus this is a slightly daft strangely compelling joyful and goonie riot there was very little for me to complain about  as long as tom hardy was chewing scenery along with faces in the most pg13 way possible and riz ahmeds sociopathic version of elon musk made for a disquieting villain    the most fun ive had in a theater in a while
Oct 10 2018,positive,the most unique and hilarious comic book film ive seen ever  as you always should do ignore what the critics say and go see what youre interested in
Oct 10 2018,negative,the whole venom mythos has gone a bit loopy in the comic books so its hardly surprising that sony would risk stripping all the spiderman out of their attempt to reboot the character as a stand alone thats not a problem in and of itself however what they didnt do was backfill that mythology enough to allow the script to make much sense the notion that riz ahmeds character is exploring other worlds is ludicrous on its face there are no habitable spaces in our solar system that are viable though a mars mission is somewhat conceivable but the idea that the symbiotes are just tooling around in space on a comet how are they conquering worlds with no ability to navigate and considering how hungry they appear to be on earth what are they eating in the vacuum of space i get that they dont need oxygen but riding for millennia on the off chance that theyll encounter an intelligent host species isnt the best strategy not for nothing having a meteor impact the planet makes a lot more sense ahmed could have picked up the story with his research team recovering specimens with very little difference to the plot structure    then theres the whole perfect host mcguffin the riot symbiote appears to body hop perfectly fine one imagines that the feeble malaysian woman he coopted should have been burned out even faster than the emt who wandered all the way through the rainforest on her way to the city and then the little american girl did her mom not notice that she was attacked in the bathroom did she board the plane by herself on an international flight with her mother on her itinerary    and what was the third act plan anyway hop on the shuttle track down the comet and bring more symbiotes home how space launches arent like plotting a trip on google maps theres a bajillion calculations not to mention crew prep yet were to believe that riotahmed can man the mission themselves after literally destroying all the equipment in the launch center sheesh    as an aside i found michelle williams character interpretation wildly uneven shes a supportive fiancée then angry scorned ex then sympathetic ex then symbiotedecapitating badass then love triangle setup for the likely sequel all this while in an uncanny gwen stacy wig for a notgwen character it was an unnecessary styling choice especially since they are attempting to distance the character from its spidey origins without question this movie hews more to the marvel tone than the dreadful dc offerings and fwiw my tenyearold loved it however i was rolling my eyes at the somewhat desperate profanity and the ludicrous plot holes eg a billionaire genius is using customized drones and vehicles to destroy the city in pursuit of brockvenom does he not have a liability lawyer and how did the symbiotic end up choosing the name venom venomous hatred of spiderman drove the name in the comics but who is this symbiote hating certainly not its hosts and ahmed is actually working for the symbiotes sooooooooo    i liked this movie better when it was called upgrade thankfully the animated spiderverse movie appears to strike the right tone    ps cgi is ok why hes full on venom but horrible as he transforms or is only partly venom and the third act battle was so dark as to be almost unwatchable maybe if riot were a demonstrably different color like carnages red
Oct 10 2018,positive,tom hardy shines once again as venom full of action comedy suspense and drama venom is an extremely entertaining ride
Oct 10 2018,positive,excellent funny tom hardy was fab very entertaining everyone in the cinema seemed gripped by it great graphics i cant believe the critics are panning this film i would see it again
Oct 10 2018,positive,best film ive seen in a long time funny and adding a new anti hero to the marvell universe was the best decision they have made
Oct 10 2018,positive,fun doesnt take itself too seriously could have been a little more cleaner tom hardy gives a great performance that should he matched by the rest of the cast in the next one 
Oct 10 2018,positive,no clue what the critics are talking about the movie was really good aside from some choppy cgi go see it
Oct 10 2018,positive,a really good coherent and funny movie with some great performances dont always trust the critics 
Oct 10 2018,positive,story cast vfx etc everthing is tremendous  amazing scifi film  rated 1010  regards
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie its a must watch hopefully there will be multiple sequels
Oct 10 2018,positive,entertaining movie not exactly canon so if you look at it with a fresh face it is truly enjoyable made an account just to give it good stars would buy the dvd as well
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was why to short you can tell sony just wanted to get it made but it was good for now
Oct 10 2018,positive,the film was very enjoyable with cool action scenes
Oct 10 2018,positive,reports from critics of this movie sucking are greatly exageratted a very fun endearing ride from start to finish despite its clear faults 810 high recommendation
Oct 10 2018,positive,im a long time comic fan and was having a hard time seeing how they could make a veniom movie without spiderman i went and saw this opening night and im glad i did i thoroughly enjoyed it and everyone that i went with did too i mean its not perfect but very enjoyable
Oct 10 2018,positive,love this movie venom has always been my favorite character and i feel like this is a great portrayal i cant believe it has a low rating it was so good
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is amazing everything is great venom is hilarious 
Oct 10 2018,positive,just watch the movie and do not read the reviews before
Oct 10 2018,positive,the critics got this one all wrong entertaining from start to finish
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie really enjoyed it
Oct 10 2018,positive,definitely a blast to watch this film was needed after the splash of superhero films that flood the theaters today will buy on bluray
Oct 10 2018,positive,sloppy story bad dialogue  and a weak villain but actors came and did their jobs and made up for it when venom came into play with fun action sequences i cant be too mad because the previous venom spiderman 3 was a complete dumpster fire i will take this and hope for a better future in the next venom film because this will have a sequel
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is not a perfect film it is in fact a very flawed film is it as bad as catwoman or fan4stic certainly not so why the dichotomy between critics and fans many of the criticisms arent wrong the tone does shift several times and there are some plot holes particularly with regards to the life foundation and riz ahmeds villain carlton drake however what the film does get right is the dynamic between tom hardys eddie brock and the symbiote venom if not for this dynamic the film wouldnt work at all one of the biggest surprises is that eddie and the symbiote both grow as characters during the course of the movie its not a great film but its not a bad film it is however an entertaining popcorn film
Oct 10 2018,positive,best movie ever loved the character development and the plot twists looking forward to the sequel   friend said that movie was anxiety producing in the middle but everything works out in the end
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie critics are wrong 
Oct 10 2018,negative,dumpster fires are more entertaining thats really all i can say about this massive turd if you like bad comic book movies that almost completely ignores the source material then youll love this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,great visual effects
Oct 10 2018,neutral,we went to the cinema together my 14 year old kid  and i we loved it  venom and eddy are great together theyve accomplished a very hard achievement such as incorporating brotherhood romance and a sense of humor in one body in a scifi movie everybody in the audience was laughing and aweing  every single person that i saw there left a movie theater with a satisfied smile on their face  haters will hate endlessly and the majority of the public will be saying i cant wait to see the second part
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is a fun movie to watch for what it isa marvel flick  i think the critics are taking themselves too seriously with their poor reviews   its not a masterpience but it takes you on a wild ride while cracking a few good jokes along the way
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was amazing i had my doubts and while i will say the story itself was weak and the whole saving the world bit at the end was kinda dumb like ive seen enough of that i dont need to see it in a villain movie of all things it shoulda just been venom wanting to kill riot that woulda been fine by me but other than that it was fun i thought the humor was actually done well better than most mcu films can pull off and the cgi was spectacular while the story was kinda meh it wasnt a bad story just wasnt special but the film itself had enough fun action cool scenes and a good character choice and even alright character arc that fit the villain persona where he doesnt change to a good guy just gets powerful was good a story doesnt have to be outstanding to be a really good and great movie it just has to have me entertained throughout something i would enjoy watching thats what a movie is at its core i loved this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to have a fun time though ill still admit it woulda been a lot better with an r rating
Oct 10 2018,positive,i watched the film twice and both times i was amazed i had my doubts at first however those were quickly dismissed soon after the movie began hardy brought to life a beloved marvel villain who has his own story to tell the lack of spiderman does not take away from the movie in the slightest in fact it makes the movie stronger as a whole
Oct 10 2018,positive,let it stand on its own  its a good movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,really enjoyable venom was awesome this movie is funny and just all around fun not sure what the critics are thinking plus tom hardy helllo
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is pretty much a solid movie right down the line solid action solid comic relief solid acting etc not necessarily memorable or groundbreaking in any way but rather a simple harmless break from reality like many movies end up being
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was good and amazing sony really did a good job on this movie and if you ask me its worth another watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,they did a really good job on getting the character right on both  eddie and venom the interactions were awesome and it was an all around fun movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,while venom drags itself during the first act that doesnt mean it is an awful movie because most superhero movies suffer from this crawl to action however when tom hardy does come into contact with venom  the movie is consistently good until its end would love to see him and spiderman fight in the mcu
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom movie has a short screen running time and a little less of a good ending other than thata complete comedy action packed movietom hardy is perfect again and the action sequence are awesome with venom dialogues
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie funny action packed and it makes you really love  venom as a character tom hardy did a great job as well nothing short from amazing
Oct 10 2018,positive,has a few plot holes and mistakes but venom himself is great
Oct 10 2018,positive,these critics are full of it the movie was great and definetly worth a watch ill definetly be getting it on blue ray
Oct 10 2018,positive,good story good acting this was a fun movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,ignore the bad reviews if you like action and marvel then youll be happy nice teaser at the end for the sequel too
Oct 10 2018,neutral,good movie if you dont know much about eh spierman universe but for fans of venom this movie is ratehr dissappoting
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom was an outstanding movie i love how well developed the plot and characters are most marvel movies are so packed with action that you cant truly fall in love with the characters however venom has just enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat while still falling in love with the amazing characters i cant wait for a sequel this was one of the best marvel movies ive ever seen this is must see for any marvel fans
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom movie has roller coaster thrilling experience me and my family really enjoyed it last night
Oct 10 2018,positive,such an underrated movie even though it had way too many generic props and scenes tom managed to make it a lot more special i dont believe they could have done it much better
Oct 10 2018,positive,truly love the movie  a sorta good mixture of every theatrical elements
Oct 10 2018,positive,yellow kid  published by kristian casiano  22 hrs    i dont know what yall critics trippin for marvel tomhardy  venom this movie is so much more than what it seems to already offer from a fan keep it coming love the film and i need more wearevenom sick breh but sony needs to remove that pg13
Oct 10 2018,positive,love this movie cant wait for venom 2
Oct 10 2018,positive,no part of the movie was slow the movie had it all
Oct 10 2018,positive,i really dont understand where all the hate came from with this movie i enjoyed it even though it was indeed a little choppy excited to see what venom 2 has in store for us
Oct 10 2018,positive,i went to go see the movie 10418 at 1100 pm i legit have never posted a review about any movie ever but i enjoy movies as if i was a kid i went with my girlfriend who is kinda picky with movies she cant enjoy them like me she says movies pook fake and all that point is she like the movie now as for my self i loved the movie and highly suggest it stop over analyzing movies and just sit back enjoy it as if you were a kid
Oct 10 2018,positive,i hardly see anything to dislike about the movie besides the predictability and slightly annoying side characters our focus is on venom he is the title of the movie and thus deserves the right to have the spotlight but it would be nice to have more character from the others tom hardy gives an amazing performance as both venom and eddie was excellent its not a movie i would watch again in theaters but it is one that i will happily buy when it comes out on bluray
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is one of the best superhero movies ive seen i do not understand why the critics say its very bad you critics if you read this review i want you to know that you are not right about this movie this movie is very good full of action comedy and many very good things i admit that if you have some errors in the script but this movie is not up to the level of cat woman or fantastic four of 2015 those if they are very bad movies of superheroes but this one is very good compared to those garbage  please change your opinion about this movie and if you are well and critically this please please integrate this movie to the ucm please  and well thats my opinion about the criticism of this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,was great had everything needed for the 1st standalone venom film
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is very entertaining with a mixture of hard core action and violence and also has an interesting story acted and casted quite well but but there are multiple scenes that seemed to be not only bad but shouldnt have been in the movie at all theyre all tom hardy acting out due to his newly obtained partner that he was sharing his body with all in all a very good movie but poorly edited and simply had quite a few scenes that were not good or necessary the whole movie it seemed obvious to me but the ending was basically like pausing a movie right in the middle to set up for the sequel 
Oct 10 2018,positive,good movie the fight scene could have been longer
Oct 10 2018,positive,this is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it i cant say for either one really to me its a meh but i recommend seeing it if you like the character or spiderman
Oct 10 2018,positive,so funny  the trailer was totally wrong for the movie but the movie was hillarious with good action  would have gotten 5 stars if some of the action scenes were easier to follow
Oct 10 2018,positive,a good movie not a great movie but a good movie and was very entertaining and for me it was better than infinity war i dont know why they gave it so less rating this is unfair for film like venom they should give it atleast 75 for me the public citric is accurate 87 is the exact score that film deserve
Oct 10 2018,positive,i was entertained i laughed i enjoyed the eddievenom relationship the action was mostly enjoyable just a few transformers like shots  where it was too up close and i couldnt tell what was going on i felt one plot point wasnt resolved by the end that could have been easily addressed loved the end credits scene i did wonder how the symbiote came with the knowledge of all the internal organ names he wanted to eat scene can be seen in the trailer
Oct 10 2018,positive,yeah idk what the critics were talking about did we watch the same movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was lots of fun by no means was it a great movie but it was a solid enjoyable film that entertains  its very strange that movie critics dont base their scores on entertainment factor these days they dont seem to engage with a film unless it has some overt message or person they want to support  i go to the cinema to be entertained not to be preached at or to effect some sort socal change  edit strange that rt wouldnt let me post this at the time but its ok to post now
Oct 10 2018,positive,screw the criticss this was one of sonys best work
Oct 10 2018,negative,all the actors seemed to have a lot of potential that seemed to fall short due to bad dialogue choppy timeline progession and glaring plotholes
Oct 10 2018,positive,way better than i thought it was gonna be
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved this movie aside form waiting half of the movie to actually see venom and the villain written as sort of a twisted elon musk type i couldnt help but leave with a gigantic smile on my face i love venom
Oct 10 2018,neutral,i dont know what is wrong with this movie the first part of the movie its ok so dark and so serious the second part is done with fast just to end the movie some scenes are dumb and whitout sense and venom is not bad at all but we discover that in his planet venom is a loser
Oct 10 2018,positive,simple not a good movie but it is a good venom movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,not as bad as people like to make out i thought they had to make venom funny in order to enjoy the movie more and like the character in my opinion
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie  loved tom hardy
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was pretty much exactly what youd expect  that said it was not as bad as i thought it would be   i had a good time with it  the stupid like a turd in the wind line does make it into the film but it is just a little addon at the end  by that point i had already had enough fun with the film to forgive that awful line
Oct 10 2018,positive,i almost passed on this film due to the horrible 30 rating i was surprised to find the movie was excellent not perfect due to some slow spots and no spidey relationship overall a very good fun movie with great special effects great action scenes and good acting performances forget the critics on this one and follow the audience
Oct 10 2018,positive,dont understand all the negative reviews i thought this movie was great lots of fun entertaining and great special effects why are critics and regular movie people so critical of movies   movies are entertainment and venom was an incredibly entertaining movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,was a solid film overall  tom hardy is perfect as both eddie brock and venom mirroring the comics with his vicious demented sense of humor the action is solid though the film was on the short side and had it been longer i feel it would have fixed the story and pacing issues but venom isnt looking to be an oscar film its looking to be a fun edgy cultlike action flick and it does so with attitude
Oct 10 2018,positive,realy great movie i want to see it again
Oct 10 2018,positive,soooooooooooo enjoyed this movie such a breath of fresh air i am in no way surprised that official so called critics didnt like this movie the usual ignore them and please please please go see this movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,well i really liked the movie i mean alot but there are something why i am rating 4 stars is because the movie was actually planned to be r rated but sony unfortunately forced it to have it on pg13 and many scenes 3040 minutes were deleted the movie just could be longer and more exciting but yeah   spoiler i am excited for the next venom movie its about carnage
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie was awesome and am hopeful for a sequel enjoyed every moment eddie and the symbiote interacted critics were wrong about this film never listen to them
Oct 10 2018,positive,just omg this movie was amazing
Oct 10 2018,positive,i really liked it overall tom hardy excellent acting of the two characters  cgi was on point with fight scenes
Oct 10 2018,positive,i saw the reviews before going to the theater and i thought it was going to be terrible but i was wrong  i really liked it it was entertaining and had alot of comedic moments i would definately see it again
Oct 10 2018,negative,the pacing was terrible and the script was terribly inconsistent
Oct 10 2018,positive,i honestly dont get where some of these critics are coming fromi read an article about plot holes where it was mostly complaining about inaccurate depictions of how mri machines work and stuff like that  hey buds  its called suspension of disbelief  give it a chance  to be perfectly honest it seems with a lot of critics once they got a sniff of a pile on they just went with it  i really dont know why so many had it out for this movie    in other words i loved the movie and honestly only wish it had been a little longer so we could have a little more time to flesh out a few things  i guess i found it easier to see characters motivations than most of the official critics did and i wanted to see a deeper exploration of it  but still im happy with what i got
Oct 10 2018,positive,actually a decent movie got everything i wanted out of it for a venom flick
Oct 10 2018,negative,i have no clue why people are giving this movie a good score its terrible from the opening scene on i love venoms character venom vs carnage is one of my favorite comic series but this movie is horrible
Oct 10 2018,positive,have to stop reading the critics these days go back to back in the day without the internet you just went to see a movie and you didnt know how it was or not or saw any reviews
Oct 10 2018,positive,is not bad   but missing something
Oct 10 2018,positive,i liked it good story line and good direction
Oct 10 2018,positive,honestly dont know why critics gave this so much hate oh right because they never picked up a comic book i loved this movie and ive been waiting for a long time to see venom portrayed correctly
Oct 10 2018,positive,i saw this movie the day it was release  i went it thinking the worst thanks to the reviews  i had a great time seeing this movie it was good and fun
Oct 10 2018,positive,very fun and enjoyable movie and the pacing is so good i wanted more the switching between venom and eddie is very well done and you can remember each part clearly afterwards my main complaint was lack of action i wouldve liked to see even more of venom beating up dudes but hopefully ill see that in the sequel one of my favourites superhero movies for sure
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was intense fun and just the right pace i have no idea why all of the hate tom hardy actually did a good job with this one and the cgi and use of venom as well as venoms personality development was great they make him what he is the sometimes villain sometimes antihero love venom 5 stars all day
Oct 10 2018,positive,good movie dont expect academy award levels of art but for what it is its great the whole family enjoyed it critics look for high art i look for something the family enjoys
Oct 10 2018,positive,never live up to expectations the trailer is even better than the film
Oct 10 2018,positive,quite fun and enjoyable comicbook movie all the hater critics are wrong they should definitely go for r rating next time tom hardy was awesome
Oct 10 2018,positive,during the first half of the movie the audience laughed in places that seemed inappropriate myself included so i wasnt sure if this was a failed horror movie or a tongueincheek piece  by the end i decided the director and writers intended this to be a lessviolent lessprofane deadpool wannabe
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom says puy and i laughed really hard 55
Oct 10 2018,positive,one of the movies i most expected and i loved it the story is very simple and very good i liked them a great cast tom hardy as eddie brock and venom is excellent i loved how both characters complement each other and the great performance of him his chemistry with michelle williams is very good and he loved anne riz ahmed as a very good villain i love this actor i loved the easter eggs and the action scenes that are excellent and the special effects very good i loved the first postcredits scene i want to see the sequel it is one of the best superhero movies of the year
Oct 10 2018,positive,its really an enjoyable movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,i throughly enjoyed this movie and would watch it again i rarely watch a movie twice very entertaining
Oct 10 2018,positive,pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out even without spiderman or peter parker in it loved how true they kept to both the character of eddie and venom individually
Oct 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed this marvel movie it has funny and a lot of action with good special effects looking forward to seen my more from tom hardy
Oct 10 2018,positive,not as good as i was expecting but not the worst either didnt like how venom mentioned hes kinda a loser where he is from 
Oct 10 2018,positive,great film critics are too picky i believe something fishy is going on between disney and critics in terms of dodgey dealings to destroy other franchises while i believe that spiderman will need to be incorporated at some point this film as an origin was funny awesome action packed and apart from the last half an hour paced well brilliant film the post credits scenes perfectly set up the future for sonys venomverse
Oct 10 2018,positive,amazing movie dont listen to critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,good movie not a great movie but it has a lot of potential and future if they decide to make a sequel hopefully the sequel is rated r
Oct 10 2018,positive,not sure why the critics are so hard on their reviews for venom i went last night and saw it with my family and we all loved it great action comedy and leaves you ready for the sequel
Oct 10 2018,negative,first half of the movie was slow and the acting subpar they tried too hard  to be funny second half got better with venom and the action kicked in the less the dialog the better for this one
Oct 10 2018,positive,superb film funny and action packed one of my fav marvel films
Oct 10 2018,positive,dont understand the hate for this movie i loved it
Oct 10 2018,positive,saw yesterday after reading all negative critics and its a definitely good movie with more to come in sequels fun well made and entertaining  on this occasion do not follow the negative critics opinion  i dont know where all that negativity came from
Oct 10 2018,positive,this film may not work as an edgy and deep creature feature but it does work as a horror comedy which i think was the point theres too many moments where the comedy is derived from the scary or suspenseful moments for it to be an accident that said i loved it and i want to see it again
Oct 10 2018,negative,this movie was absolutely amazing it was fun exciting  really great it didnt have the most indepth story but the rest of the movie made up for that  dont listen to the movie critics especially if your a venom fan it was awesome
Oct 10 2018,positive,a great film with a nice characters development and cgi not a masterpiece but it simply works
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom was a fun and funny movie that i had fun watching with friends the movies main star tom hardy as eddie brock and venom was a great fit for the dark anti hero this movie gave me a lot of laughs intentional or not the movie could have been darker but its the venom from the comics just toned down for a family audience the story was okay we have seen it before but tom hardy and his performance was amazing the action scenes were cool and entertaining but venom moved so fast i couldnt tell what was going on but by the end of the film i was left wanting more eddie and venom but that post credits scene makes me really excited for the squeal
Oct 10 2018,positive,awesome and great entertaining movie a must watch at a 4dx theater as this movie is well done made 
Oct 10 2018,positive,it fun cheerful movie just dont expect dark knight kinda movie and u love it
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was a good movie but it had some bad and cringy parts too besides all that it was a good movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie wasnt as bad as the critics claimed i liked it my younger brother liked it 
Oct 10 2018,positive,the beging was pretty poor production quality but it gets so much better after venom shows up the movie went from cb to a real quick and stayed there
Oct 10 2018,positive,did watch the movie yesterday after reading several reviews upfront my expectations were low movie starts its ok  gets better  i expect the turning point were it goes to sht  but it never happend  the final fight is a bit of a mess but thats basically the problem with almost every comic adaptation      is it perfekt nope  but is it bad far from      this is the first time the critics are so far away from my personal experience  had to write my first review ever just because of that
Oct 10 2018,positive,critics are such sad people this movie isnt great but it was fun it needed a hard r rating and more venom tom hardy was great and his conversations with himself were the best part hoping for an unrated cut on blu ray
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom had great special effects and i loved the bond between eddie and venom
Oct 10 2018,positive,terrific performance from tom hardy the rest of the movie is average
Oct 10 2018,positive,i thought is was great so did my teenage son who i took along tom did a great job it was fun and different
Oct 10 2018,positive,its true to the comics and is entertaining what more do you want 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i am a die hard comic book fan and watched this open minded and wow great movie saw it twice
Oct 10 2018,positive,felt slow at the start but overall a really good film i dont know why critics dont seem to like it
Oct 10 2018,positive,decent fall entertainment clearly not to be taken seriously but was good enough for a matinee 
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom is an insanely fun ride the interaction between eddie and venom was the best part of the film tom hardys acting made the film worth it
Oct 10 2018,positive,great film brought the character to life
Oct 10 2018,positive,sony didnt overcomplicated the plot as they have done in other movies giving enough screen time for a wellpaced plot and a great introduction to venom
Oct 10 2018,positive,i genuinely enjoyed this movie i had no idea what to think going in so i really didnt have any expectations my excitement from the trailers faded with the critical reception but i had a great time watching it tom hardy is fantastic i honestly wish it was 20 minutes longer
Oct 10 2018,positive,this is has the making of a good movie for just passing the time its a comic book movie which took me back to the days of reading a venom comic for the first time   story seemed a bit rushed but didnt need spiderman to complete the character  but this movie arrived a bit too late to make it a really good movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,awesome movie i enjoyed it for what it was
Oct 10 2018,positive,visual effects were very pleseant the way venon was brought to life was amazing and felt very real
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie dont understand bad critic ratings
Oct 10 2018,negative,critics are right on this one terrible 
Oct 10 2018,positive,personally i liked it a lot
Oct 10 2018,positive,gritty violent and with plenty of funny moments in between loved it hardy was perfect for the role the venom film we deserved in my opinion the absence of spiderman did not affect the film and allowed us to focus on venom and the symbiosis process
Oct 10 2018,neutral,painfully average  uninteresting plot  weak villain  pg13  cringeworthy  attempt at humour   venom looked great and was well acted by tom hardy really wish the people who made deadpool had this in their hands
Oct 10 2018,positive,went into this with low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised it was super fun and entertaining and i feel they sony did a good job doing a venom movie without spiderman even though having spider man interact with this venom would be awesome 
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is so awesome tom is a very good actor did awesome as eddie
Oct 10 2018,positive,perfect flick do venompool come on flex your big multimillion dollar movie business merger muscles
Oct 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed this good story good action and some comedy 
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom deserves to be more than a mary sou
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie i my favourite movie of all time the jokes were good the action was good the back story about eddie brock was good and making venom and eddie both losers on there own planets was really good because these two losers finally got a chance to prove them selfthis movie was beyond amazing just saying antivenom was also amazing
Oct 10 2018,positive,at bare minimum this is a 35 star movie at most  4  i thoroughly enjoyed the film and i really wanted it to be a 5 star it actually started off that way but somewhere towards the middle i realized that this was as good as it was going to get no real deep character story arc and the relationship between venom and eddie is entertaining but somewhat cheesy very action filled and worth a second viewing  but not quite good enough to get that 4 or 5 star
Oct 10 2018,positive,really enjoyed this yes some downside but damn the attitude of venom as i imagined that tom hardy is fkn awesome im this nailed it
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved it the music was amazing and the new ways to view venom where spectacular do not go in expecting a marvel movie go in expecting a venom movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,definitely enjoyed it the villain was kinda dull  but i definitely dont see why the critics reacted the way it did  look at the approval rating difference from critics to audiencejust makes me wonder why we even have critics  pretty sure the audiencepublic opinion is the only one that matters 
Oct 10 2018,positive,have some flaws but is a watchable film despite theres no spidey around
Oct 10 2018,negative,lacked total potential missing key elements in the lethal protector storyline including spiderman which they chose to omit bonus points for the post credits scene 
Oct 10 2018,negative,what a loud and bombastic film with plot holes and silly dialogue dumb
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a really enjoyable movie i dont know why critics gave this movie such a bad score its not a perfect movie but i would definitely recommend to my friends its a must watch for any comic fan 
Oct 10 2018,positive,good movie better then i expected 
Oct 10 2018,neutral,look this movie isnt great but it isnt garbage either people saying the critics cant rate movies are wrong because the score they gave accurately reflects the writing and plot structure of the film the only reason i dont think it is trash is because it is at times still entertaining which is what a movie should be but with poor cg and poor acting all round excluding tom hardy it isnt a masterpiece
Oct 10 2018,positive,crazy how wrong the critics got this review everyone in the theater loved it laughing cheering and venom himself is a great cgi character that can stand on his own without eddie packed house on a tuesday night too this movie was a surprise and as much fun as the first deadpool movie if you get my meaning the movie has a great buildup a few twists and great final battle scene with riot very solid 810 for the record if you value critics scoresthe 2007 spiderman 3 received a 63 fresh critic rating
Oct 10 2018,negative,venom review venom is sonys new marvel movie about one of the best antiheroes venom i was excited for this movie i love spiderman a lot and venom is my favorite spiderman villain sony also just did spiderman homecoming which is one of my favorite marvel movies and actually movies of all time because it was done so well the trailers didnt look that great but i was still hoping it would be good the reviews came in and i got less exited this was a huge disappointment it was trying so hard to be great but there were so many problems before the long list of negative here are some positives i liked tom hardy as usual he wasnt my favorite choice for eddie brock but i liked him i liked the twisted relationship with him and venom i really liked the after credit scenes especially the very last one the movie seemed to get more entertaining to watch as it went along too thats about it now the negatives wow what a bad script you could tell some scenes were rewritten because they just didnt seem to fit after one another in some cases this made the pacing choppy speaking of pacing the first 45 minutes were so boring nothing was happening i was wondering if we were ever going to get to venom because there was just about only one hour left finally venom comes in and it get a little interesting the cgi wasnt that good i will add there was action scenes that were just ok venom is black and most of the action scenes were at night so you couldnt really tell what was going on sometimes also it felt weird when it ended for me the poor writing just made it seem that the climax of the film wasnt but i guess it was speaking of poor writing and i wont spoil what it is but if you have a good ear there is a small dc reference in it this is a marvel universe film where dc doesnt exist that bugged me a lot the tone felt off for me too it was an action film that was trying to be like a horror movie with more funny moments in it which i can kind of see because venom is supposed to have a twisted sense of humor the way it came off though didnt work i think the movie wouldve also benefited from an r rating everything was censored when it shouldnt have been rated r marvel movies like logan and the deadpool movies were great without those r ratings i think those movies wouldnt be as good they rating really needed to be changed alrighty on to characters riz ahmed played the antagonist carlton drake and hes a pretty good actor i really liked him in nightcrawler he was horrible in this i think it was because of his character drake was a scientist who doesnt care about people and just about his experiment and power nothing else it reminded me of yellow jacket in the first antman michelle williams was also in this and i didnt enjoy her character much either also she was barely in it shes a very talented actress so i thought they would use her maybe a little more i dont know what else to write about all i can say is that im very disappointed especially with a good director ruben fleischer who director zombieland if you want to see it dont be too surprised if you dont like it i knew i wasnt going to like it based on the 30 rotten tomatoes gave it and 35 by metascore for some reason some audiences have been liking it on imdb it has a 7110 and audience score on rotten tomatoes is an 89 somehow which is higher than a star is born very good movie and i will have the review posted soon i dont know there was a good performance good relationship and it kind of got better as it went along also good after credit scenes though one is setting up for a sequel which im happy for but theyll probably mess up like they did with this see it if youd like id suggest a star is born the better release of this past weekend my grade c
Oct 10 2018,positive,the critics are wrong  though it is a chaotic movie it is sort of the point of venom  there is no desperation as the critic review states  i absolutely loved the movie the lack of spiderman is necessary for the movie to truly be about venom  otherwise spiderman would steal the show basically unless venom actually beat spiderman  the eddie brocks story is still kind of similar with the exception that he is not hellbent on just getting revenge    whatever critic wrote the review has to be a hippie
Oct 10 2018,positive,youve got this one all wrong   venom is a fun addition to our comic book roster its not perfect but its enjoyable and comedic value adds an unexpected take on the dark antihero well done sony 7510
Oct 10 2018,positive,3  not a fan of the villain or the love interest but aside from that  not bad wish it couldve been rated r though
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom starts slow but when it picks up the pace it doesnt stop such a good movie and surprisingly funny
Oct 10 2018,positive,i actually liked rhis movie
Oct 10 2018,positive, it just goes to show that critics suck and dont know what they are talking about the audience rating got it right on this one great movie even my husband who thought it was going to suck loved it 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i have no idea what the critics are talking about the movie us freaking awesome
Oct 10 2018,positive,it turn out really good now that there was a spoiler alert much more interesting
Oct 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie not sure why the critics are slamming it venom looked good and moved well only complaint is the obvious lack of spiderman the villain served his purpose but i felt they could have spent more time exploring eddie and the symbiote over all a solid film i hope they can tie it into mcu but i look forward to a sequel 
Oct 10 2018,positive,incredible movie  totally based on venom s comic book origin  keeping it real   loved it 
Oct 10 2018,positive,just amazing tom hardy as venom go watch it
Oct 10 2018,positive,good movie nice to actually see an antihero movie for a change 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i loved it screw the critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie is great not gonna lie but i think the movie is not quite ready yet i feel like th movie is just too short we dont get too many background of of venom i mean we here him that at his home his weak but thats really all it
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was really good
Oct 10 2018,positive,beat bad movie ive ever seen endure the first 30 mins for the greatest early 2000s since the early 200s
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie great special effects
Oct 10 2018,positive,one of the best films this year dont listen to the critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,an amazing movie just the right amount of fun without it ruining the serious scenes made me love my favorite character in marvel and dc even more definitely one i am planning on seeing again
Oct 10 2018,positive,even when it had good comedy and action sequences and great acting from the cast venom falls into the endless pit of mediocre films thanks to its poorly paced script and cliched story even the short runtime was responsible for the failure as it denied the characters from any sort of proper development  though the movie took the wrong route in a lot of areas it did do venom right the symbiote from outerspace who has been a wellknown nemesis of spiderman was interpreted as a straight out evil character with zero emotions in sam raimis third spiderman film and was portrayed the same way in many of the animated adaptations of the character but venom took a different route as opposed to its predecessors and that was being honest to the comics venom was not as funny as he was in this movie but it did manage to show the inner struggle of venom and its host  eddie brock which instantly makes both of them likable   the major mistake and disappointment was riot the villain of the story who suffered from the same problem every other character suffered from  insufficient screen time he was portrayed as another generic villain with a lame conquering the world evil motivation even the life foundation and its head carlton drake who was constantly mentioned to have a strong and powerful influence was only mentioned to have it and was never really shown properly when it had the chance to  the only other thing left to say is to wait for the midcredit scene as it sets up a potential sequel
Oct 10 2018,positive,good story and the special effects are great
Oct 10 2018,positive,i thought a venom movie without spiderman wouldnt be any good i was wrong excellent film definitely will be seeing it again 
Oct 10 2018,positive,tom is genius in this entertaining throughout 
Oct 10 2018,positive,comedy is its strong suit even if the rest is a mess
Oct 10 2018,positive,good would watch again
Oct 10 2018,positive,cant wait to see the follow up 
Oct 10 2018,positive,it does suffer storytelling on certain part during the movie  4 i counted  but if the scenes is added this movie would be perfect but this as an origin story are not like what the low rating that critics gave calling this movie turd in the wind comparing it to catwoman just show how people in power doesnt understand what the generic public wants and this is why superhero movies labeled dceu are usually screwed so far
Oct 10 2018,positive,tom hardy delivers a fun performance as eddie brock along with a strong supporting case the actors cant be faulted here the issue with this film mainly comes from the script and final cut a lot of the lines meant to sound scary or funny seem to just fall flat and character motivations seem to completely change in an instance as if chunks of the film have been ripped out with complete disregard for the characters development overall the film was enjoyable but clearly flawed however it does set up for what could be a more exciting sequel if given better direction
Oct 10 2018,negative,first tom hardy is one of my favorite actors i was looking forward to seeing his take on a franchise super hero movie his character was confusing to me was he supposed to be a loser the beginning of the movie certainly didnt support that premise he seemed to slip in and out of really dumb tom hardy without warning i was disappointed in the movie and am hopeful the sequel will be better 
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom was awesome this is a must see if you love comic books and action movies
Oct 10 2018,positive,amazing movie blow my mind best  fight  scene compare to any other superhero movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie i went not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised with how good it was forget the haters they did a great job and made venom really stand out as a great stand alone movie 
Oct 10 2018,positive,its a very good movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,i like the movie very entertaining
Oct 10 2018,positive,tom hardy delivers a fun performance as eddie brock along with a strong supporting case the actors cant be faulted here the issue with this film mainly comes from the script and final cut a lot of the lines meant to sound scary or funny seem to just fall flat and character motivations seem to completely change in an instance as if chunks of the film have been ripped out with complete disregard for the characters development overall the film was enjoyable but clearly flawed however it does set up for what could be a more exciting sequel if given better direction
Oct 10 2018,neutral,good simple movie but way off from the comic too bad it not part of the mcu 
Oct 10 2018,positive,this is a good movie dont expect a spiderman connection but there are some nods to the comic storys  of venom as his origination has been retold more than a couple times with a little different begining each time there is some comedy but not much remember  venom is a bad guy well actually he is an anti hero so dont expect lovey dove flowers and unicorns considering it is a pg13 movie starring a monster that eats people id say they did pretty good see it on the big screen and enjoy the detail
Oct 10 2018,positive,so venom movie was awesome  not just awesome it superb    it was so good that i will go and watch it again    i love how tom hardy played the role as well  he managed to get a bit of humor in the role to make the movie even better  30 minutes after the movie i still had adrenaline pumping    all in all 1010  must watch
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie was amaxing tge comedy between venom and eddy was great also the fight scene wss fantastic
Oct 10 2018,positive,great antihero movie great acting and effects cant wait for number 2
Oct 10 2018,positive,this was a good popcorn flick the story touch on some of the comic book but then it went some place else it was interesting to see tom hardy act with himself i feel thats what made the movie funny yeah it lets you know there will be a 2nd flick but after that wo spiderman theres no point to continue the soundtrack to this film is horrible love the score
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie was awesome i wasnt expecting to be that good but just imagine how much better the special effects could have been if they had a budget like the spiderkid homecoming movie i enjoyed the movie and laughed a lot which is not usual to me and after the movie i left with a good vibe this movie really made my day looking forward for part 2
Oct 10 2018,positive,venom as a movie only works because of tom hardy his portrayal of eddie brockvenom is extremely well done and makes up for all the shortcomings making them almost normal
Oct 10 2018,positive,started off slow but definitely worth the wait once the action started i was thrilled the cgi wasnt the greatest but the plot really makes up for it im excited for the next venom movie already the coagulation  that kept happening between brock and venom was awesome
Oct 10 2018,positive,its not the best movie of the years but thats a good movie we have a great fight scene but we have a bad directing in few scene the vilain is maybe very simple but i think tom hardy give a great performance of eddie and venom but i think its a good movie but simple because the vilain is too much simple but i think the next movie will be great
Oct 10 2018,positive,absolutely loved this movie 
Oct 10 2018,negative,i wanted to like this movie as venom looks amazing but i just couldnt this film is a dumpster fire of a movie for the first time ever i agree with the critics
Oct 10 2018,positive,loved it didnt expect the smart ass alien
Oct 10 2018,negative,corny dialogue thin characters and a thorough misunderstanding of its titular character make venom a drastic misfire of an antihero movie
Oct 10 2018,positive,this movie is awesome 
Oct 10 2018,positive,fantastic movie a mix of light humor and terror tom hardy perfect choice
Oct 10 2018,negative,lazy script good performance from tom hardy action scenes with venom were poorly choreographed bad villain some funny moments but overall this movie suffers from horrible insulting writing
Oct 10 2018,positive,i kept seeing all these reviews online about how bad this movie is and i decided to go see it anyways and it was really good i thought the humor was pretty great too its a movie that doesnt take itself too seriously the cgi left a little to be desired but thats fine it didnt impact the movie in the least and it isnt as bad as some would have you believe   all together my girlfriend and i loved it     it is a little weird to have a venom movie without spiderman though
Oct 10 2018,positive,much better than most reviews are stating there were some missed opportunities especially with the while riot fight as well as the build up to the fightat night loved hardy and the character of venom
Oct 10 2018,positive,great movie    we are big fans of venom and carnage and if you like venom comics you will love this movie it was a true anti hero marvel movie there was just the right amount of action that there needed to be but also a good amount of laughs over all this movie was action packed funny and true to marvel we give it five stars
Oct 10 2018,positive,nice movie not perfect good performance by tom hardy
Oct 10 2018,positive,it was a great movie despite the bad reviews it is worth watching 
Oct 10 2018,positive,i like this its a great movie i think about venom is a fantastic monster  and eddy brock is a good adaptation
Oct 10 2018,positive,a good easy watching popcorn flick
Oct 10 2018,positive,i enjoyed every second i feel like people just wanted to hate this i refused to do that very good must see
Oct 10 2018,positive,liked the theme and the plot of the movie they tried something new and i think would be great if we get to see the sequel
Oct 10 2018,positive,the movie is awesome
Oct 10 2018,positive,a fun action flick with some good jokes venom is mindless entertainment in line with commando or demolition man it isnt any kind of milestone in cinema but its a fun distraction
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie is far better than what these so called professional critics are giving it i am a huge fan of comics especially spiderman so to see his nemesis get his own movie only to be discouraged by the bad ratings critics were giving it i still decided to give it a chance the honest truth after hearing the reviews i was skeptical but the movie exceeded my expectations    does it follow the original origins of eddie brock from the comics no but does it pull you into complete awareness and give you a full feel of what the character is yes is it entertaining yes  would i pay to see it again yes
Oct 9 2018,positive,sure it wasnt perfect but damn was it fun to watch a very good movie confused why critics are whining about it if anything i went in with low expectations thanks to that and was very impressed
Oct 9 2018,positive,dumping the original origin story and replacing it with the story that new comic fans will know proved to be the way to go with this antihero the film showed that with a pg13 rating that it could still tell a damn decent venom story tom hardys portrayal of eddie brock was something that we needed 11 years ago if the film had been ratedr then maybe we could have gotten more of the venom we wanted more horrific and darker sense of humor it felt like it was missing somewhat of an edge i highly suggest watching this film and go in with an open mind forget everything you know or think you know about venom and watch it really enjoyable
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome movie the antihero movie is really good crazy eddie and crazy venom work great together because they need one another
Oct 9 2018,positive,plot jumped around a bit more than it needed to with some gaping holes ignore this and its a really good time and really nicely sets up the venom dynamic great watch and worth it to see in theaters
Oct 9 2018,positive,this was a really fun movie hardy was really good critics waaaaay too harsh on this movie not the best marvel movie but better than some with a higher score far superior to ant man and the wasp
Oct 9 2018,positive,warning spoilers ahead for all the whiners out there please stop if you went in expecting a iron man one or infinity war caliber movie then you arent a smart movie fan to begin with the movie wasnt meant to blow you away rather to just toss out an idea and see if any of it sticks the writers of the movie obviously knew there were huge plot holes that needed fillers so there was an excruciatingly long beginning lacking action for the first 40 minutes was hella brutal but once the ball got rollingwell it went well beyond my expectations the relationships were not anything extra ordinary but the most important one of all was the great acting of tom hardy and the amazing cgi of the venom symbiot it was funny entertaining and most importantly tom hardy and venom were a perfect match pun intended i cant wait to see were it goes but i would highly suggest an rated r next to the next one woody harrelson as carnage is also a very tantalizing idea 
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie wouldve been even better if it were rated r and much more graphic and dark  with that said i still loved it and it was refreshing to see a villain movie
Oct 9 2018,negative,very disappointed especially great acting actors in the film
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny movie good action and venom is so awesome i highly recommend it
Oct 9 2018,positive,the guy who is saying cgi is cringeworthy go f yourself
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it great in 3d hope venom series stays  with tech  special effects they can only get better fun times 
Oct 9 2018,positive,not sure why there is so much hate from critics this was a really fun movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,good flick it was fun and funny i laughed
Oct 9 2018,negative,very bad plot and poor cgi
Oct 9 2018,positive,from now on i will only look at audience reviews for movies because the critics stink venom was great fun
Oct 9 2018,positive,tom hardy is always a delight to see and enjoy his acting  i really was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie as a whole  the critics are wrong30 presentno 97 per cent
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics literally are wrong on this one spiderman doesnt need to be in the movie venom is a great stand alone film f the critics score audience score speaks for itself
Oct 9 2018,positive,one of the top 5 best movies i have watched it is a must watch i hope they make a part 2
Oct 9 2018,negative,entertaining and typically marvel witty humor but the overall story and character development was inexistentboring the pivotal point in the plot came out of nowhere and felt like a cheap scifi script visual effects and fight scenes were good but thats about it
Oct 9 2018,positive,horror comedy action packed movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,no idea how it has a 30 score  this movie was one of the best ive seen in a long time  well done
Oct 9 2018,positive,adding to my list of favorite movies
Oct 9 2018,positive,tom hardy does it again portraying an investigative journalist in the san francisco bay area hardy takes on the role of eddie brock an inquisitive and audacious reporter trying to make a living by reporting news and exposing injustice in the world with his journalism hardys performance as brock brings a down to earth presence on screen that is perfectly interwoven with the inner conflict of chaos brought to him by the alien lifeform venom who has entered his body as a parasite the story quickly introduces multiple conflicts at the beginning of the movie and they begin to unravel the action all the way through until the end with the heart of the matter being brocks lovehate relationship with venom who is living inside him the action is fantastic and includes high intensity chases through sanfrancisco and various fight scenes enhanced by the super abilities brock has gained from his new parasitic friend to lighten the mood plenty of laughs are sure to delight as the ridiculousness ensues when venom fights for control of brocks body this movie has some of the best scenic views and images of san francisco in cinematic history with a reminiscent feeling of sean connerys and nicolas cages the rock the entire cast gives a stellar performance and the audience can easily escape the reality of life and join the characters on this actionpacked and humorous roller coaster ride that is venom
Oct 9 2018,negative,the script was really predictable which led to a very disappointing plot the color palette was consistent throughout the film but the lack of directing didnt highlight it i do think tom hardys performance was quite good the problem was the script
Oct 9 2018,neutral,i mean the actor is hot this movie is messy its like milks run on rupauls drag race all stars 3 i felt it was too short and pooly edited i expect that the second one is actually r rated as this movie shouldve been by the way sony of youre reading this stop trying to make sony smartphones happen in your movies theyre never going to happen k k
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved every part of this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics yall got it wrong thats all im saying fun movie to watch
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics dont know what they are talking about venom was everything and more tom hardy did well with his portrayal of eddie brock i loved it from start to finish
Oct 9 2018,negative,i wanted to like  it when comic book movies started coming in the 90s i vowed to see them all my thought was that would be the way to get the characters i wanted to see on the screen now that we are there this proves its time that we can pick and choose what we like and this was not good
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is such a fun campy film that wont be for everyone but if you like cheesy one liners and action youll be getting this in spades    the best thing about the movie is eddie and venoms relationship the character is literally oozing with charisma making dumb lines like turd in the wind hit home in the best of ways the interactions of these two characters was worth the price of admission alone    but the movie is still rather flawed the plot is very one dimensional though that doesnt slow it down what does slow it down is how long it takes to see venom but this is a common issue with origin films    honestly the only thing i desperately wanted from this was some connection to spiderman the character is so much better when he starts out as a spurned spiderman villain but for what the film gave us i was thoroughly satisfied and hope to see more from tom hadys performances here
Oct 9 2018,positive,since the alleged butchery of the character that ensued within spiderman 3 comic book fans have been clamoring for a real and true interpretation of venom to emerge one that would really encapsulate and more importantly appreciate him for what he is a dark terrifying and ultimately iconic piece of what spiderman means to so many this is not that movie dear god is it not that movie however speaking as a spidey fan who knows and loves what venom means to him without needing the stylings of any movie adaptation to validate it i had a good amount of fun with this lets not be mistaken though  this movie is supremely stupid so many scenes of horrifically bad dialogue plotting and character work come to pass but i was almost never bored by any of it this is a deeply flawed yet almost ceaselessly watchable mess of a movie with an undeniably odd yet still fun central performance from tom hardy i hesitate to say i want more of these but ill see em if they provide em
Oct 9 2018,positive,i like your movie with 9000000
Oct 9 2018,positive,is not that bad love venoms voice and look
Oct 9 2018,positive,good movie critics are worthless
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie was great it was comical like the deadpool movie im not sure what half of you people were expecting but dont be poor losers and bad critics get a life in the end 95 percent of the people on google said they liked the movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,had me laughing had me scared had me worried had me excited imo this was a perfect balance of heroismvillainy in one character
Oct 9 2018,positive,ok lets talk about venom i read so many articles about how bad of a movie venom was i heard from friends how terrible it was all of the dont waste your times and it could have been greats so i went into this movie expecting some cringe worthy scenes and a terrible story all of that and i still left the movie disappointed but i was disappointed because i actually enjoyed the movie everyone said this movie was bad but i kept sitting in my seat wondering when is this movie going to plummet then the credits rolled now yes there are some things that they could have done better but honestly for a spiderman lacking venom origin story i thought it was good without spoiling anything venom is still a villain in this movie everything he does is for his own selfish agenda or to make sure he survives tom hardy was so enjoyable to watch as eddie brock and the dynamic between eddie and venom is wonderful i am hopeful for this series and i was surprised by how much i didnt hate in this movie also that end credit scene has me very excited now i will let you know upfront this is what i would call a hard pg13 lots of cussing throughout and some terror scenes so keep that in mind if you are bothered by such things sony knocked this movie down from an r rating but barely so should you go see venom if you are a fan of the character and are on the fence i would say go and form an opinion for yourself if you dont know anything about venom i think you would still enjoy it its not the movie i was hoping for but it is also not the let down i was expecting
Oct 9 2018,positive,just saw venom in the theatre today and it was a very fun movie would recommend
Oct 9 2018,positive,as someone with little interest in the film after watching the teaser as it didnt show much after watching the two official trailers released later had me insanely hyped up for this movie where i  couldnt get enough of fan theories and videos on youtube explaining the comic that the film is based off of lethal protector and planet of the symbiotes  i could not wait for this film and went to see it opening night with a friend who only really enjoys a movie if it is actually made well  and i went in with pretty high expectations as a result  of looking into it so much although opart of me feared they showed a little bit too much in the last trailers and tv spots about a week before the films release however despite those worries my friend and really really loved this movie the comedy was great the action was awesome and the cgi was done really well the acting was good for all the other characters excluding tom hardy as eddie brock and venom we thought this film was a ton of fun in a good way and the worries that they showed too much proved to be very wrong as i was pleasantly surprised at many events and lines in the film the only thing i would say is i wish it wouldve been longer it was a little rushed towards the 3rd act and you can definitely notice that they cut out 40 mins of the film unfortunately so i wish it was longer but i am really glad that this is its own thing  and its own universe without spiderman cause it lets venom be a really cool version of an antihero instead of a straightup villain wouldve been extremely dissapointed if spiderman came in and fought venom at the end instead of the fight we got i and many others i believe wouldve had to route for spiderman even though this movie is a venom film so i am very glad that he wasnt in this movie at all and hope he  isnt in the sequels as this is his movie and hopefully movies and gives him and eddie room to grow and develop and therefore should be about him not an insanely loved character that jumps in at some random time to please the fans and fight venom or any other character that is or will be in the future films that i really hope get green lit to become a reality however if spiderman came in and chose to help venom andor eddie in a fight against a common enemy i would love that as long as spiderman isnt given scenes that outshine venom in closure i loved this movie and find myself wanting to watch it more and more despite seeing it 4 times in theaters 2 times in 2d and 2 times in imax 3d and loved it the only thing that is keeping from looking for a copy online to watch every night is the fear that i wont be able to get a good night sleep from watching it too much cause i loved it that much 9810
Oct 9 2018,positive,a great playsafe attempt from sony to get venom going while most of the characters are forgettable while still playing their part tom hardys interactions with venom are totally amusing believable and enjoyable making the film worth watching will definitely hope to see sony gamble a few more chips with a rated r venom 2 sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,i can see how people would be disappointed with this movie when comparing it to the superhero movies of the past decade theres been some reviews labeling this as a horroraction over a superhero movie both takes are valid although the acting and script are a bit lacking here the action and cgi are spot on make sure you stick around for the post credits scene which sets up the inevitable sequel i was shocked carnage was not included in this movie and would have definitely upped the stakes for this one
Oct 9 2018,positive,i felt like this was a brilliant retelling of an old story   if youre a fan of the old i would suggest going in with the expectation that this movie will be extremely loosely based on the old story
Oct 9 2018,positive,a lot of people give a bad wrap to this movie but give it a chance i promise if you see it you will love it unless you love to critique every minsicule detail of a film it will leave you exiting the theater exhilarated it was a very nice blend of suspense humor horror drama and thrill that made it such a fresh movie that was refreshing from all of the movies coming out recently one of the things i particularly noticed and loved about this film was that it was so relatable because some of the things not him becoming venom obviously were very relatable as well as the emotions i feel like the actors also did well portraying their characters and the situations their characters were in in this outstanding movie i would suggest you see it as soon as possible
Oct 9 2018,positive,the relationship between venom and brock is what makes this movie stand out fantastic film and a must watch for any marvel fan
Oct 9 2018,positive,terrific film from start to finish tom hardy is fantastic as venom the villain was better than the yellowjacket venom and hardys chemistry are undeniable and i see no end in sight for this franchise it arguably has its dull moments but are quickly recovered by many other amazing scenes that envelop the minor moments and the fact that spiderman does not exist in the storyjust yet in turn making them into something were able to sink our teeth into no pun intended i will return for anotherand hopefully r rated this time for we are venom thank you marvel thank you tom for bringing life to this creature
Oct 9 2018,positive,good movie well its not the same as the comics but i enjoy it a lot
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome movie tom hardy killed it as venom and it had some funny parts too worth the watch
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun movie great opener for venom not sure why all the critic hate maybe because its not last jedi lol wish it was rated r though
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun tom hardy is hilarious and charming great amount of humor and violence
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie with much needed and surprising humor will definitely watch it again
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun movie  it isnt bad   worth watching if you like marvel even if the origin took a different route
Oct 9 2018,positive,it look awesome was fun to watch has some good jokes
Oct 9 2018,positive,outstanding movie i dont understand the hate
Oct 9 2018,positive,what the critics fail to understand about this movie is that venom is fashioned to be an antihero one that breaks away from the stereotypical marvel and dc stories without going over the edge like deadpool the critics claim that venom needs a stronger attachment to spiderman yet forget that this so called attachment is what drove toby maguires trilogy out seeing as how the quintessential bad guy of the spiderman universe was underperformed and utterly wasted in his potential tom hardys venom manages to bring new life to an overly repetitive genre and delivers an entertaining and surprisingly funny performance that will make you anxious for more
Oct 9 2018,positive,was super funny and loved the action in it
Oct 9 2018,positive,despite having very low expectations for this film venom was a fun time  i knocked off half a star because they had some messy action scenes that need a little work beyond that i loved the movie love eddy  venom venom had a learning curve by the end of the film i was in love  cant wait for the next movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie is a prime example of why i dont listen to critcs
Oct 9 2018,positive,although far from a typical marvel movie it had strong humor and a fun experience it did fail to deliver on a plot twist or much of any meaningful plot but i still had a great time venom had much more personality than i expected and also had a very nice protagonist who felt more like an every day guy before he met his more powerful other half that was refreshing after all the other marvel movies that always feature people with crazy pasts
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely loved this movie venom and eddie brocks dialogue was hilarious venom as a character yet again hilarious tom hardy as eddie brock yet again hilarious but also great all around plot was iffy and i think itd be much better rated r but overall 9510 for what it was
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thought it was a great balance of comedy and thrill loved it
Oct 9 2018,positive,man this movie is awesome worth the watch in theaters and definitely buying on dvd
Oct 9 2018,positive,just saw the movie movie is fantastic i have no idea why this has 30 here it has good bit of funny scenes nice action sequences and a decent story  note i have never read the comics about venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,the synergies between characters and interactions between them is what makes this movie unique and fun the relationships between man and symbiote man to man symbiote to symbiote man to woman etc it was an enjoyable interaction all the way through may only appeal to comic book knowledgeable fans it seems some of the other reviewers were expecting a cookie cutter superhero movie instead of an antihero comic book movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,just enjoy it for what it is i started off overly critical about some plot holes  it really got into it
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thought it was pretty good but would of been better with an r rating
Oct 9 2018,positive,this was a great movie  despite what anybody thinks highly recommend it
Oct 9 2018,positive,had a great time and some good laughs this was a great movie i realize im in the minority but i vote a must see
Oct 9 2018,positive,solid take on the character tom hardy was great his chemistry with michelle williams made the love story work venom was easily the funniest character overall a solid movie that couldve used a bit more attachment to spiderman
Oct 9 2018,positive,i liked it a lot tom hardy is the best
Oct 9 2018,positive,its fun and different a must watch
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely love this film it was done very well and did a great service to the original material i feel the film critics missed the bar on this one it is hard to make an origin film entertaining when you have seen so many but this is a film worthy of the mcu and i hope sony and disney can collaborate to enter him into the mcu my only criticism for this movie is it deserved an r rating i needed the blood and gore that venom is famous for  i understand you want to attract a wider audiance but you can get knocked out of the realism when people are getting decapitated and stabbed and there is next to no blood    in short excellent film and i truly hope they make more tom hardy knocked it out of the park
Oct 9 2018,negative,a mess of a movie that never knows what it wants to be with a script that fails at basic storytelling one of the worst comic book movies of the past 5 years
Oct 9 2018,positive,a must see loved it seen it twice already once in 3d brilliant film tom hardy is untouchable love him
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics have this wrong i think there is a major issue with critics jumping bandwagons afraid it will hurt their reputation if they dont join the hivemind    venom was genuinely a good and fun movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,me and my gf went to see it and i gotta say it suprised me with how good it was it had us both laughing and the action scenes where riveting
Oct 9 2018,positive,just watched it and was impressed its a thrill to watch venom through down and the actors were awesome the evil guy makes me think of the google ceo for some reason my group of 9 were all  talking about it cant wait to see a sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,way better than some of the reviews ive seen  i never write reviews but after reading a lot of negative stuff about this film i thought id give it more credit than what its been given  go see it  its a comic movie take it for what it is  its not a waste of money
Oct 9 2018,positive,i am giving venom 5 stars in hopes that audiences will give this movie a chance is it perfect no but projects like these should excite the public even if they dont excite the critics super fun movie suspend your disbeilef
Oct 9 2018,negative,it was terrible horrible unfeasible plot with bad acting soo cheesy like a parody of a movie worst marvel movie and completely cliche why does the alien help eddie why does the bf help eddie dumb
Oct 9 2018,positive,while no cinematic masterpiece venom is certainly entertaining and has its moments tom hardys performance as eddie brock and the titular venom thankfully carries you through the dreadfully dull introduction and when the movie hits its stride it works well
Oct 9 2018,positive,excellent movie critics were totally wrong 
Oct 9 2018,neutral,probably one of the least liked marvel movies for me just didnt connect
Oct 9 2018,positive,must suck to be a critic  i dont know what part of being a critic makes one not enjoy this movie  but it must suck  because this movie was swell
Oct 9 2018,positive,everything that was done to develop the character of venom left me satisfied but the brevity in the build up a little bad acting and the strange venomlovestheworld took one star off this review it was clear this movie was to make a wall for spiderman to knock down later
Oct 9 2018,positive,so funny and quick i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun and action packed love the fact they kept many things original to the lethal protector series
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie i dont have any problem if ithe story is different than the comic as long as it satisfy my eyes
Oct 9 2018,positive,this is my favorite movie now it is so funny with action and awsomenessvenom is my favorite hero  now you might say but hes a villain but villians dont save the planet who thought venom will be so funny
Oct 9 2018,positive,phenomenal movie tok hardy did amazing seriously recommend
Oct 9 2018,positive,as a stand alone movie it was fun and good i miss spider man being a part of venom but in this case not having spiderman does not take away from the movie at all
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it and i normally hate superhero movies 
Oct 9 2018,positive,pretty good film hope venom can find it way in the mcu
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie better then most these days rotten tomatoes dont know what there talking about
Oct 9 2018,positive,excellent tom hardy was incredible as venom  we want to see more of tom hardy as venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome very good action packed but since it talks a little smack about religion i am giving it a 35
Oct 9 2018,positive,surprise the pros thought it sucked proving once more how out of touch they are with what the public wants in a movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,good but not great well worth admission 
Oct 9 2018,positive,i dont know what all reviewers were talking about its not a perfect movie but its a good movie i never felt bored watching this one a little cringy but its okay
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie   im glad i didnt listen to the reviews i watched and read  yes the pacing was bad and it was a quick film  but it was fun and hardy was great  and the venom voice was awesome and pretty funny  i would definitely recommend this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome movie anyone who disagrees must suck as a person
Oct 9 2018,positive,not too much twist and turn but the action is amazing very entertaining
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun movie really enjoyed it 
Oct 9 2018,positive,super fun not forced comedy and no over the top violence 
Oct 9 2018,positive,really good funny movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,so the writing and dialogue in the film seemed awkward at alot of points  not that great  but   my sweet lord venom was portrayed so well and this is coming from an avid venom fan  from someone who has read the og comics and some of the new they did a great job
Oct 9 2018,positive,went in without expectations left excited and enjoyed it liked it more then black panther
Oct 9 2018,positive,bad movie incredibly entertaining
Oct 9 2018,positive,why are the critics always wrong
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics were definitely too rough on this movie i enjoyed every bit of it and cant wait for the next
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thought it was very good the action seemed a little lazy towards the end and there were some corny lines but the corny lines may come with every movie the 2 previews at the end did not seem worth the wait although i do stay for them a bonus is tom hardys hard work and good looks i would see again
Oct 9 2018,negative,venom has succeeded in being one of the strangest films i have seen in a while tom hardy doesnt do a bad job and the best scenes are his interactions with venom also played by tom which are usually quite charming and funny really this movie would be completely not enjoyable if it did not have such a talented actor in the title role hardys performance is not great nor is it good it just works with the tone i think they were going for most of the effects were good except say a few moments where things looked more plastic than gooey that is about it for the positives however because this movie is not very good first of all the tone is just all over the place it goes from being a gross out body horror film with tom hardy gnawing down on some chicken to a fun action buddy comedy the movie just doesnt know what it wants to be and it ends up feeling utterly pointless by the end the movie also has some god awful writing and when i say god awful i mean absolutely dreadful it has some of the most annoying and on the nose pieces of dialogue ever put to film and yet it feels fine the movie has utterly annoying dialogue but somehow it doesnt seem to bad  i think this is all on tom hardy who is so talented that when he says stuff it doesnt sound that bad one last problem i had was that the movie sets up something in the opening scene and then keeps cutting back to the plotline now this would be fine if the scenes had any over all effect on the film or plot but they dont there is a decision made at the beginning that creates this whole plotline but if this one decision was not made by the thing in the movie the film would not have changed the entire plotline feels rushed boring predictable and most of all useless overall venom isnt all bad and if you treat it like the average 90s movie it can be fun but the constant shifts in tone and the horrible writing this film just cant seem to hold itself up for more than a few scenes
Oct 9 2018,positive,i love this venom movie so much funits truely a dream come true for me to see the comic book character come to life   much love to the creative process and talented people who made this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,ignore the bad reviews the movie is a good watch
Oct 9 2018,positive,i have seen this movie once and it is great some of the dialogue seemed a little rushed but it was still great none the less 455
Oct 9 2018,positive,was a good fun time all the action scenes were done really well and the actors put on a great performance could have used an r rating
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was very good and funny
Oct 9 2018,positive,it has some good and a lot of bad but is still somehow very fun a lot of lapses in logic but still enjoyable
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it had marveldisney had this movie it wouldnt have the gritty feel and this character needed it hardy was amazing
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics are way to harshit is fun i want to see more of tom and venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved it  so funny
Oct 9 2018,negative,poor cgi excesive time in other non important characters so cliche
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was really good i loved it
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny action packed and all around enjoyable movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,entertaining if youre expecting a fabulous acting think again its funny and very comic movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,i had a great enjoyable time watching venom hardy was terrific in this film he was able to cover both the terrifying schizophrenia mood of brock merging with venom but also the humor and lightheartedness of the pairing communicating with one another cgi looks very well plot had its issues specifically a weak villain and his motivations but overall a fun film an original comic book movie with an origin story we have not seen before worth a viewing and sets up a very exciting sony spiderverse world
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely fantastic tom hardy brings such a wonderful air to the character just like you might expect from someone having a parasite attached as well as some of the personality quirks like in the cartoons the only issues were minor a little bit too easy to see the cg in fight sequences a plot device a little easily reavealed but overall fantastic great characters good story  thrilling music like a horror movie mashed with an action adventure sounds like venom to me
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was incredible just like the comics i will be watching it a 2nd time the critics are clearly blind
Oct 9 2018,positive,if you have any knowledge of comic book version of venom you will leave very satisfied  my guess is the critics with bad reviews have no idea  excellent
Oct 9 2018,positive,not bad but not series worthy
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie keeps you entertained the entire movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,idk why the critics are hating on this movie it was great funny and tom hardy is bae for sure
Oct 9 2018,negative,awful movie what a waste of time money and good actors there the hardys brock is souless loser cans see the anger the bad feelings about all the world falling in his face only a bored guy who wons the lottery of freaks and having a little fun whith his new toy    pure garbage
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics are dumb movie is a lot better than what they are saying listen to the fans
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a very entertaining movie it was just a fun movie somethings were confusing but overall it was a great experience  i think people enjoy it
Oct 9 2018,positive,do not believe the negative reviews  the movie was outstanding   tom hardy kills it as this new soft reboot version of brock   i dont see where all the hate came from its very faithful to the lethal defender arc of venom and to the complaints about his trademark symbol on his chest not being there  ultimate venom didnt start out with spider symbol either  stick around after the ending for a treat venom is done justice in this movie trust me
Oct 9 2018,positive,not amazing but not bad either
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved this movie tom hardy was great the poor ratings wanted me to  see for myself i recommend anyone watch
Oct 9 2018,neutral,venom the monster was well done but the movie lacked depth and world building 
Oct 9 2018,positive,brilliant hilarious great ride never cared for hardy until this movie
Oct 9 2018,neutral,suffers from not directly being connected to the mcu and a pg13 rating
Oct 9 2018,positive,not a masterpiece by any stretch but still found it to be entertaining despite some flaws i found myself interested and excited by the movie for the entire run time as it provided what i wanted from a venom movie it was big dumb and funny the movie proked laughs from the entire audience of the screening i went to and the majority of the people in the cinema left having enjoyed what they had just spent money to see i understand that to some critics this movie comes across as a mess but its because they were looking for more than what they got venom was never supposed to be a character piece on eddie brock it was simply made to entertain made obvious to anyone who watched a trailer or the movie it achieved this and i definitely recommend you watch the film
Oct 9 2018,positive,these socalled critics are out of their minds this move was a great venom flick
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it i have no idea why the critics hated it so much
Oct 9 2018,positive,better than  each of the original spiderman movies better than a handful of mcu movies as well harsh critics out there for this one definitely enjoyed it
Oct 9 2018,positive,overall enjoyable movie will vote the movie with my wallet
Oct 9 2018,negative,venom kept me entertained throughout but there are so many issues that i couldnt look past michelle williams and tom hardy have zero chemistry jeezez and its probably caused by the crummy dialogue who wrote this a sixth grader i couldnt help but think of various other options while watching the film thats bad when you have an audience member fixing the movie in his head you dont even see venom until about 25 minutes into the film and man does it drag i got up and went to the bathroom i never go to the bathroom during a movie i didnt even have to go that bad i just could what else is there oh another one dimensional villain halfwitted cinematography okay enough of the bad stuff venom is pretty funny and entertaining the banter between venom and eddie is the highlight of the entire film its what kept me seated no spoilers but i was so excited for that first postcredit scene and whenever it ended it reminded me of the rest of the movie stupid dialogue oh my gawd sony stop hiring the guy who wrote the amazing spiderman 2 when will you learn that that movie was garbage that last postcredit was really good though it has nothing to do with venom well thats my rant 2 out of 5 thwips
Oct 9 2018,positive,it exceeded my expectations  it was funny and entertaining  my entire family enjoyed it  the critics are dead wrong just like the last jedi  hardys performance deserves an oscar nod
Oct 9 2018,positive,actually its not bad and i love tom
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics gripes are nonsense most things were explained in the film tom hardy put a stellar performance as usual along with the rest of the cast the film had good pacing and an interesting story i didnt buy riz ahmed in a villian role but overall the film was enjoyable
Oct 9 2018,positive,dope movie film critics failed on this one
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie the critics are there to critique the movie not enjoy it i along with my family enjoyed this movie some people just want it to be true to the original origins of the character but as we can all plainly see spiderman is a little preoccupied right nowso enjoy the movie or dont either way it was good
Oct 9 2018,negative,wasnt terrible but wasnt great very slow until about 40 minutes in definitely missing the thing that makes him an interesting character spiderman id you can get past that and just enjoy the humor and some loud action youre in for a good time
Oct 9 2018,positive,is it an awardwinning perfect movie by no means is it a fun movie to go watch yes completely will the pretentious critics care about this movie not at all will a normal person that just wants to escape and have a good laugh like this movie completely in the end remember that paid critics are not fans  so theyre going to trash it but fans of superhero movies will enjoy
Oct 9 2018,positive,after that awful rendition of venom in spiderman 3 im glad they made a movie that did him justice definitely a must see
Oct 9 2018,positive,i have just signed up to rotten tomatoes to post this venom showed the relationship and dynamic between eddie and venom in depth it showed the main male character is more in tune to his feelings than countless other superhero movies and it had comedy and lore wrapped up pretty well together i strongly recommend it if youre looking for a good time
Oct 9 2018,positive,a great bad movie  simple plot we knew what was going to happen but it works  the relationship between venom and eddie is funny and cool
Oct 9 2018,positive,no idea what the critics are saying absolute a must see
Oct 9 2018,positive,way better than what the critics say im very wary of the lowquality movies hollywood has been pumping out so i came into watching this movie a little skeptical but at least openminded i was not disappointed in a good way venom is a mustsee im thinking about seeing it again i agree that this movie needed to be rated r to fully achieve what it was going for but this venom has a serious  slightly darker tone to it with more tension created in it than the new alien movie lets just say it works there are a couple things that arent explained and i wish it was longer with more development of the main characters involved i think this movies needs heat esque conversations between the characters besides that i also thought it was funnier than guardians of the galaxy venom is just so cool in this movie check it out as long as you dont try to hate it youll like it also of note there is some pc stuff but its not super overt 1 the latino guard makes a comment to brock that his daughter got a full ride scholarship to mit and eddie exclaims woo it seemed planted for obvious reasons 2 global warming is mentioned surprise surprise other than that they kept the pc stuff to a minimum the aftercredits scenes dont add much of anything to the movie i hope they release an rrated cersion of this in 4k
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was very entertaining but they should improve the cgi a bit and consider releasing a rated r version
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really liked the whole movie the fx were good the humor stuck with me and this version was way better than the spiderman 3 version we got 11 years ago i also thought that tom hardy and riz ahmed did really good jobs as their respective roles the only things i didnt like were anns wig there was little to no chemistry with hardy and williams and riot was not on screen enough other than those few little mistakes this thing is ready for franchise
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics very well done 
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie isnt nearly as bad as the critics have made it out to be it has some great comedy action and cgi the pacing is scrambled and the villain is generic but other than that all around solid movie far better than tasm movies
Oct 9 2018,negative,the movie poorly reflects the venom from the comics it was really corny and the audience in the theater were utterly unimpressed im going to give this movie half a star out of generosity 
Oct 9 2018,positive,i will most likely buy this movie i hated that it was pg13 to please people who had kids i never read the comics so as a first time buyer 
Oct 9 2018,positive,epic moviethe relationship beetween eddie and venom is soo cuteee
Oct 9 2018,positive,i love this movie tons of easter eggs funny and amazing cgi
Oct 9 2018,positive,super fun  entertaining movie to watch got to see an early screening and tom hardy made a guest appearance  just want to say the man is a class act cant wait for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,negative,i love tom hardy as much as anyone  this movie is mindless trash the writing is incredibly bad and tommy cant save it   if you enjoyed this you need to start reading real books   sad
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont listen to all these moronic critics venom is a fantastic movie with amazing cinematography and good actors i am a spiderman lover since the first movies and i feel venom got a good movie with this one cant wait to see the next movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,wow yea did i see a different movie then the critics it was unbelievable  silly etc  but  a lot of fun  in ithe end its fun  i want a sequel and i was highly entertained
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was an unexpected surprise i went into the film with low expectations due to reviews i had read and viewed on youtube however the film was funny filled with action and overall fun is it going to change the way you feel about super hero movies no this is a movie you see if youre a fan of the genre or a fan of the spiderman would have been better as a rated r film or if the friendly neighborhood spiderman himself were to have appeared 
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it i highly suggest you go see the movie and decide for yourself instead of listening to stuck up movie critics shooting it down
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics didnt get it right not my favorite marvel movie but thoroughly enjoyed it tom hardy is the man 
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie could not have been better 
Oct 9 2018,positive,good film one of the best films to come out in the past 2 months
Oct 9 2018,positive,best movie ive seen in the theaters  would rate 9 googleplextilion stars if i could
Oct 9 2018,positive,i have no idea why critics hate this so much its different from the comics origin story but its still a really good movie everyone i watched it with agrees it was very fun very cool and very worth your time i highly suggest it for anyone who wants an exciting interesting movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is increible is perfect but they have their points against the spider web but it was incredible
Oct 9 2018,positive,to be honest at first i did not want to see this movie i thought that it was going to be bad but in the end i found my self laughing and having fun while watching this moviewhile its not the best movie and has some faults like a formulaic script it was an entertaining movie that i would recommend
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is a marvel superhero movie if you know anything about their work such as spider man they were consistent with their theme and made it ever better no its not a comedy but marvel production always ads funny parts to their movie the movie was great the theme was easy to follow the 3d scenes were on point and it as an awesome movie overall i feel like i am 16 again they finally made a superhero movie that i will watch over  over
Oct 9 2018,positive,enjoyable  tom hardy great as always
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie all in all was entertaining many refrences to the alien and what its purpose is the plot has its downsides and problems but the action was amazing ive been a venom fan since i was five this movie definitely makes me feel like im watching a reallife venom overall a 4455
Oct 9 2018,positive,most movies now a day tend to use a huge build up then cram all action into a couple minutes then end with a win not venom this movie is packed with action scenes from beginning to end and has a fair ammount of crude humor to entertain all ages you will not even notice this is a pg13 rated film i will be going back to watch again on imax anf recommend you go watch it today if you havent done so already
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont let anyone stop you from seeing this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie was everything i wanted a in a venom movie tom hardy absolutely killed this role looking forward to the sequel and orhopefully a venom spiderman mash up
Oct 9 2018,positive,a very action filled movie with a well balanced amount if comedy critics may say it is a bad movie because it had no spiderman and tried to add a element of horror or creepiness to venom but that is just venom
Oct 9 2018,negative,despite an excellent performance by tom hardy the film suffers from a bad script lacklustre action sequences and a need for sony to make it as kid friendly as possible i think it would be best if sony gave marvel full control of the character
Oct 9 2018,positive,ive seen the film and its absolutely amazing its my new favourite film i dont understand the rarings
Oct 9 2018,positive,really dont know why the critics are beating up on this one we really enjoyed it dark humor and lots of violence in a good if preposterous story tom hardy as always is very good he has amazing range michelle williams is fun to look at and does a great job the only reason for 4 stars is because sometimes the cgi was so fast i lost track of the action but a good marvel movie and worth catching if you dont mind violence
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing movie hope for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,i expected this movie to disappoint me i found myself laughing several times enjoying myself and wanting more by the time it ended as a fan of venom i am glad the casting was so good however the after credit scene both excited and let me down as who they cast for the reveal is not someone i would expect to play that role i will say i was wrong about venom going in so perhaps i will be wrong ifwhen venom 2 is made either way would watch again and will watch the sequel ifwhen it comes out     and yes i would have preferred an rrated version as it sometimes left me feeling it was censored too heavily
Oct 9 2018,positive,very fun film it doesnt skimp on character or plot development at all extremely well paced tom hardy plays an excellent role and the movie manages to be funny in quite a few sections with venom himself providing quite a bit of the comedy the comedy works too youre not expecting it and its delivered well    worth watching and very fun
Oct 9 2018,negative,its not good per say but i wont lie i find some moments that were inadvertently funny if youre looking for a good story or plot you wont find it here if youre look for hilarious stephen king tv movie quality superhero movie this is probably the closest youre going to get for the foreseeable future
Oct 9 2018,positive,while the story isnt anything special i find it fantastic and creative how they crafted around the lack of spiderman and still adapting venoms comic roots and it workssurprisingly well    the plot is very straight forward but the films strength is definitely its characters particularly tom hardys performance of both eddie and venom as well as its action scenes    the cg is top notch and blends well and the symbiotes and venom himself look stunning  the film can be both serious and hilarious at the right moments and i love all the references and nods to the comics marvel films are known for  i came into this with low expectations and believed i was in for sonys usual something not great but not too bad and venom just blew me away and i was honestly surprised how much i enjoyed this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny and actionpacked with a great performance from tom hardy the critics definitely got it wrong on this one cuz it was great
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved it a little bit more savage would have been food but i loved it only for fans
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie wasnt as bad as the critics say was kinda bored for first half until venom shows up then the movie gets good would definitely see a sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a fun movie tom hardy is perfect as usual
Oct 9 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed well worth the wait and would definitely see it again
Oct 9 2018,positive,after hearing the reviews for venom i didnt have high hope entering the cinema surprisingly i enjoyed the movie and if your a fan of marval or dc theres no reason why u wouldnt like this
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thought venom was a good first movie and set up for a good sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,great film it takes itself as seriously as a comic book the trouble with these superhero movies is they try and naturalize the story to make it more relatable to a wider audience not the case with venom venom is exactly what i was looking for in a film inspired by a comic book ps the fight scenes were great
Oct 9 2018,positive,bloody class is what this film is
Oct 9 2018,positive,i enjoyed it guessing that sony didnt pay off the critics like disney
Oct 9 2018,positive,just a great movie if you go in with an open mind 
Oct 9 2018,positive,was a bit sad we didnt see spidey in this but it was still a really good movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was very entertaining yes parts of the story where a little weak however it doesnt take away from the value of the movie as a whole
Oct 9 2018,positive,i am a huge comic book man and this approach delivered the goods i cannot believe how well tom hardy played both characters i am beyond belief excited for the sequel and there better be a sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,honestly a fun and funny movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,not perfect but perfectly solid and entertaining a fun way to spend 2 hours for anyone who digs comic books or the classic venom character
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie for a venom solo film dont know why rotten tomatoes gave it a 30
Oct 9 2018,positive,this needed to be r rate pure and simple the film is on shaky ground from the beginning much like ghost rider failed to capture the essence of the character the biggest issue i had was the short timeframe of brock and venom being together this needed to happen much earlier its the same with riot and drake the rushed post production editing leaves the character moments on the floor this review is based on the cinematic experience and ill review if they reedit this film into the r rating it deserves the film fails to find a consistent tone in this age of superhero films the darkness of the movie does not match the style of the film the producers and studio obviously did not want to spend 100 million on a r rated film that fair enough thats their choice but remember deadpool was a risky venture that paid off in spades hollywood needs to start releasing two versions of the films the mould for cinema releases has changed and if they keep aiming at the teenage audience these franchises will fail the trailer promised darker moments but this was quite tame in the end 09102018
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie doesnt deserve the hate if youre a fan of venom or spiderman this movie was great if you are a film critic you will tear it apart because its clunky go see it and decide for yourself but theres a reason theres a huge divide from fans and critics
Oct 9 2018,positive,definitely a must see movie if you are into the marvel universe
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was simply a perfect movie for venom in comics we see eddie brock and venom as perfect mates and now we saw it in the big screen i wont delete points for time because even if it was a short movie it was worth every second would see again and again and again
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics missed the mark badly here venom was my favorite character growing up as a marvel fan and i was nervous theyd screw it up especially after the reviews but i think its a very good movie exactly what i hoped to see as a fan hardy does a great job lots of the type of humor youd see in the comics and fantastic effects plus a solid plot im really not sure what movie the critics saw or if they just dont get the concept of an antihero but swing and a miss from them as they sit and applaud whatever indie garbage comes along and trash a great fun movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,bloody brilliant movie faithful to the character and comics everything i would have ever wanted out of a standalone venom movie it was funny action packed amd a bit over the top at time truly fitting with venoms character it didnt need all the crazy things blockbuster super hero movies do these days with crossovers and such felt like a classic super hero movie with a modern twist loved it would definitely watch again
Oct 9 2018,positive,film is unexpectedly funny which isnt a bad thing either story is great although the film could be a bit longer with maybe the story being streched out a bit more i dont get why there are so many bad reviews about this film
Oct 9 2018,positive,not a bad movie but not a great movie either tom hardy as eddievenom is the highlight of the film
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont know what the critics were smoking but they are dead wrong kinda like the last jedi great movie more like this from hollywood please
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a great movie and it got bad reissues from critics they must be 70 years old
Oct 9 2018,positive,was amazing a very poor rating by rotten tomatoes
Oct 9 2018,positive,i do not understand why people are saying venom was bad because it is absolutely not highly recommend a must see
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was good and funny whatare people bitching about
Oct 9 2018,positive,tom hardy a  venom a  cgi a  comedy a  action a  script d
Oct 9 2018,positive,expectations wasnt high and result was much better than i thought 
Oct 9 2018,positive,i love it its better than i expected awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,went in with little expectations and loved it because tom hardy was so entertaining  as both eddie brock and venom sometimes a great performance  can raise a weak   movie to a great time for me this was the case with venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom has a lot of personalities that needed to be explored the story itself is a bit off and slow however venom and tom hardy made it more interesting for moviegoers to want more overall its a good movie and cant wait for venom 2
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie gave us the venom we deserve
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant film it had a great story and the relationship between eddie and venom been excited since the first trailer and now i cant wait for it to come out on dvd

Oct 9 2018,positive,i was pleasantly surprised of how much i loved this movie brings a dark side to marvel there was great character development great fight scenes a good story line and really funny comic relief better than expected
Oct 9 2018,positive,i found it entertaining worth the time an money the surprises at the end are good
Oct 9 2018,positive,in the beginning it was not bad and kind of interesting but then it started getting slower and  eventually they decided to save the planet
Oct 9 2018,positive,excellent these critics on rotten tomatoes must have something against venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,just saw the venom movie and for a stand alone film it did incredibly well it took a good amount of the source material and built upon it since it is not apart of the whole mcu it was a huge improvement over venom from spiderman 3 and even without the web slinger it was a good film would recommend if you enjoy venom with a good bit of humor and can go without the webslinger we all know and love
Oct 9 2018,positive,under rated movie must watch tom hardy is perfect for the role
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie is worth seeing
Oct 9 2018,positive,once again movie critics miss the mark and confirm they are out of touch with audiences the movie was funny action packed and overall an enjoyable experience
Oct 9 2018,negative,eddie brock wasnt played by topher grace no even a cameo smh
Oct 9 2018,negative,poor movie that was only engaging by the money fueled in explosions and tom hardy
Oct 9 2018,positive,a fun entertaing popcorn movie and i cant wait for carnage in venom 2
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun with funny jampacked action sequences
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was amazing in my top 5 movies already the interacting between eddie and venom especially towards the end was fantastic the action was great and i loved the eddie portrayal by tom
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie had a very very slow start at the beginning and i would say about halfway through it started picking up and then last 45 minutes is when the movie started to really get entertaining im actually excited for a sequel and i hope there is a darker tone in the next one
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie is greatfair better then i thought it would bei had a lot of laughingmaybe best marvel movie so fartop three definitely
Oct 9 2018,neutral,was definitely expecting a better movie from marvel it started slow and the character development was so slow that it took until the end of the movie for things to really make sense special effects were good
Oct 9 2018,negative,actual garbage this movie makes elektra daredevil catwoman suicide squad batman v superman justice league green lantern and the fantastic 4 movies look like high art
Oct 9 2018,positive,good film not enough time to build up a vendetta against the villain though you only hear about the bad things hes done but dont really see him to anything really evil however still a good film
Oct 9 2018,negative,although the relationship between hardys eddie and the symbiote venom is comedic and fun it doesnt come close to saving the film from its awful story and even worse pacing
Oct 9 2018,positive,would love to watch again
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun  a few misses but overall a great movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,a lot better than critics have rated it not mcu level but still a very enjoyable time
Oct 9 2018,neutral,this is what seemed to me sonys big attempt to save what is left of their comic book movie rights to me this was such a mediocre comic book film the action scenes were a little boring and there wasnt a lot to impact me and get into the character they are trying too hard in my opinion all that said and done i didnt hate it and it was mildly entertaining we will see how carnage goes in the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,i found venom to be a perfectly fun and enjoable movie that knew what it was going for and has a great performance with tom hardy as eddie brock some elements could have been improved as the main plot and structure of the film was a bit messy but i disagree with the critics on this one as this film made up for its mediocure quality with so much of a blast of entertainment
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thought this movie was going to be one of its kind a real bad guy movie it turns out that even the antagonist wants to save earth i was a little down on this part but over all its a great movie graphics are amazing and the action is there
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie was pretty good i dont know what kind of shit rotten tomatoes is on
Oct 9 2018,positive,i though the movie was really good despite the ratings it was a great action movie with some humor sprinkled throughout it
Oct 9 2018,positive,its not bad for me so i will give 455 love
Oct 9 2018,positive,i was told that this movie was terrible  other than a few lacklustre lines i loved every second of this will watch the fuck out of this
Oct 9 2018,negative,wery weak film in this movie weak all plot characters bettet in this film this tom hardy
Oct 9 2018,positive,i honestly enjoyed the film hell it had a few flaws but it had a nice touch of comedy as well
Oct 9 2018,negative,its its a movie    i mean its writing fits action romps style albeit a dated style more in line with the early 2000s sense of writing see daredevil or ghost rider although it does have its moments that feel at home in this age of comic based hero movies but its a huge departure from the titular character and i will note that this was kind of what i expected and it didnt fully work for me though there were some moments it did    to avoid spoilers the best aspect this film has for it is some some of the action scenes as most are well shot but at times a bit too shaky and at times some odd editing bits that shift your focus suddenly but they slowly get you back on track the final fight being the best example of the good and the odd editing its not bad editing persay it holds your attention and allows you to follow but the action for the most part is okay though most of it lacks good direction as this film seems to only rely on the bare minimum of plot and every bit of said plot is fed through dialogue       the actors do the best they can with what they have and which isnt too much especially since the pacing doesnt allow anyone to really shine no beat to breathe no room to allow the ideas present to actually grow into something interesting and that which felt interesting in the moment somewhat immediately gets sidelined because by a little bit of sudden moments where a character says they went through a change but it is neither present within their character then or after they say they changed bro im totally different now am not that guy anymore and ten seconds later behold i am completely the same like nothing feels earned with this film nothing    as it stands this film is it just is not really bad though by all measures not that good    this film is completely a sony film nothing is earned nothing feels like it matters and yet here it is it was made for money and unfortunately it seems to be the last bit i plan to give them like if they made a bad movie something along the lines of fan4stic i feel i would be actually angry actually frustrated and not in that fanboy way of hitting up sonys twitter and tweeting a storm at them actually youd have to do a lot to get me to that thats just too extra dude but i am frustrated by the fact that this film is hallow so damn hallow its clearly their attempt to make a movie universe as they dont see the point of making movies yeah money but also its supposed to be a passion the worst part is that they made money from it a great amount and even though word of mouth might kill its run it still made quite a bit maybe enough to make them think its decent enough to make their universe with no heart and no real attempt to make good stories
Oct 9 2018,positive,a lot of fun not gonna win any awards but has great visuals a fun relationship between eddie and venom great action sequences and overall very entertaining
Oct 9 2018,neutral,a movie for 7years kids
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics are cowards this movie was fuckign good
Oct 9 2018,positive,before seeing the film i had heard of all the negative reviews it was getting after watcheing the film i can without a doubt say that whatever movie they were watching it was not venom venom is exactly what i wanted to see from tom hardy with it still being a sony film i was nervous about it but pacing felt smooth there was a great amount of action and a surprising amount of comedy what i would have liked to see is more character development from the vilian seemed to just me thrown in because they needed someone some points the cgi was spotty felt like a perfect mix of dc and marvel cgi great movie overall i plan to see it again if you like the character or marvel go see the movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics reviews are wrong this is great movie better than new the spiderman
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics they no nothing
Oct 9 2018,positive,why are the three highlighted audience reviews for this movie completely negative when the audience score is almost 90 positive  the movie wasnt fantastic but it definitely wasnt bad  the negative reviews for this movie are so over the top bad im having trouble believing their authenticity the movie was good
Oct 9 2018,positive,ignore the critics its dark funny and action packed
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really enjoyed venom it goes in detail of venom and broke and it fairy friendly to the comics
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really enjoy this movie i went into the cinema expecting it to be fine but i was happy to be proven wrong it was more than fine out of all 4 marvel related movies that came out this year its is my 2nd favourite behind avengers infinity war   my biggest problem was that there wasnt enough humour i understand venom isnt supposed to be s funny character but i still expected a descent amount of humour considering its marvel related overall i give it 4 of of 5 stars and i would highly recommend it  the critics are either full of total nonsense or they were watching a different movie to what i was watching
Oct 9 2018,positive,better than expected smaller lower budget experience but a good base to launch from
Oct 9 2018,positive,everyone hating on this movie needs to relax they were trying to make a fun movie that look good and you know what they did it venom was a blast people need to adjust their expectations depending on what theyre watching
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was fun and entertaining didnt hold true to the comic book but it was fun in its own way
Oct 9 2018,negative,it almost made it it was super close but the 3rd act get really really far from everything in the movie it self and the source material tom hardy does a better job at this than i thought any one had any right to do
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was terrific do not listen to movie critics on this one cant wait to see it again
Oct 9 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie tom hardys vision for venom and eddie brock is a welcomed change of the expected oh i hate spiderman because hes better than me gibberish that has plagued this character since the amazing days
Oct 9 2018,positive,really enjoyed venom with the kids over the weekend  stays true to marvel with a good story and just enough humor  likeable characters hope too see more
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely awesome movie i realize that everyone has their own opinion on how they would have done it  that is exactly why you should not believe trust your own opinion   its a very entertaining moviegets lots of popcorn
Oct 9 2018,positive,why are the critics always wrong
Oct 9 2018,positive,really good movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny and entertaining one of the best movies i genuinely enjoyed it
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome movie my wife and me loved it tom hardy is great good action with humor
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny and entertaining but not a strong backbone for another 2 films  i enjoyed the bromance between eddie and venom special effects were better than expected and tom hardy did a brilliant job rest of the cast wasnt that good though the script felt really rushed and non action scenes had a romcom feel to them which didnt appreciate ill watch it again before carnage movie comes out hopefully theyll learn from their mistakes
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was very exciting never a dull moment in the film story was easy to follow and post credit scene was a nice touch to keep us excited for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was fantastic entertaining witty and the storyline definitely takes a turn from what the trailers portray ill be buying this dvd when its out
Oct 9 2018,positive,an instant classic all the establishment slaggy critics who cant take it can eat it
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie has a slow start but this gives you time to see the character develop the dialogue between brock and the symbiote is comical and endearing  i think the rotten tomatoes critics have been dazzled by too many run of the mill hero movies to truly appreciate venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie has good jokes a good amount of action
Oct 9 2018,positive,tom hardy proved to us all that he was the perfect pick for eddie brock story is the best at the end of the day were here to see one thing and one thing only eddie brock well done tom hardy
Oct 9 2018,positive,while this film is definitely a disappointing venture that doesnt mean it isnt enjoyable the film does try to be many different things at once and in doing so doesnt hit the mark on them however many laughs are to be had throughout and tom hardys performance is great the dynamic between eddie brock and venom is enjoyable with a buddycop feel to it longtime hardcore fans of venom and marvel like myself will certainly find enjoyment in the antics and fun it has to offer but certainly still craving more disappointing but fun all the same
Oct 9 2018,positive,while venom does have its flaws it is undeniable that tom hardy was great and every time venom was on screen it wasnt boring the comedic comments made by venom are worthwhile i recommend seeing this
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a really good story and the special effects were on point the only thing i would change is the script i feel like since they made it in a rush the script was rushed as well
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie is awesome and it doesnt deserve this criticism
Oct 9 2018,positive,this film was amazing they got everything right even the symbeeote symbyeote controversy that was going around it was funny and tense at moments tom hardy did an amazing job in my opinion he needs an apology from the critics and those who slated the premier  a must go see
Oct 9 2018,positive,saw it with my brother i dont know whats going on with the critics im a film lover one of my favorite films i saw on the the cimema  overall 910
Oct 9 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie brock and venom is very entertaining and pretty darn funny that relationship brings about what i think is one of the flaws in the movie eddie and venom should have been introduced earlier in the movie i feel like we missed out on what could have been more of the pairing that drives the movie the plot was a little formulaic and predictable  i think one of the biggest missed opportunities was the moving being rated pg13 instead of r venom is a notoriously violent character that had to be masked a bit in order to keep the pg13 rating which i get them doing because you open yourself up to a much larger ticketbuying audience it worked for deadpool  all told i enjoyed it im sure ill buy it when it comes out on disc i really look forward to a sequel where eddievenom relationship is established from the start
Oct 9 2018,positive,all things considered no spidey  not a bad movie the beginning was completely unnecessary  but once it really begins its fun not a huge fan of tweakerlike eddie brock tom hardy was good nonetheless villain is a newagey silicon valley futurist dirt bag perfect frisco bad guy humor was almost a bit much but in these postmcu superhero movie times i guess it comes with the territory contains during and post credit treats
Oct 9 2018,positive,i saw it twice in the same night and although im not the biggest fan of the girlfriend anne im also not a big fan of the casting choice with her either so maybe theres that but i found the character eddie to be pretty brilliantly played by tom holland and while he really cant do an american accent without letting his homegrown accent slipping through it totally worked in this case and his relationship with venom was hilarious yet scary which just drew me in even more im not a comic book fanatic but venoms violence and sarcasm and just pure ugliness took my breath away
Oct 9 2018,positive,i honestly loved it a unique kind of super hero movie for an antihero kind of super hero lol
Oct 9 2018,positive,while it has its flaws it really manages to be an entertaining piece it doesnt lead to a catharsis true but the film finds its way to be fun and approachable to the viewer who is not familiar with this antihero i really think they have done a good job with this movie when i walked into the theatre i was expecting a nearly twohour toy commercial or a dark and gritty film with no joy and only gore to try to cover up script flaws etc this wasnt what i found and i am really grateful for that venoms flaws can be easily fixed on its sequel and i think it can be a rival to marvel with time
Oct 9 2018,positive,power packfun to watchtom hardy killed it once again eddie brock way to go waiting for the second part
Oct 9 2018,positive,screw all of these stupid critics venom is actually a fun movie and a decent first standalone
Oct 9 2018,positive,i went into the movie with somewhat low expectations due to the critics reviews i was very happy with the movie lots of great dialogue between venom and eddie great character development although that did make the beginning slow but it was worth it as a comic book fan i was pretty happy even though the origin story is almost completely different than the comics the only way the movie could have been better is if spiderman was in it and to be honest that probably would have taken away a little from the development of eddie and venoms relationship
Oct 9 2018,positive,what a movie dude i love it it was awesome  i love venom    if i get a chance to meet the venom caracter or director obiosly i will meet and thank them  for making  such a great movie         by venoms fan                                               sujal jadhav 
Oct 9 2018,positive,bring on the carnage amazing movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was a fun movie with great pacing and did a good job in building the world that they live in while still giving gentle nods to several storylines in venoms career though eddie brock is not the eddie many fans are used to i thought it was a great adaptation of the character with the restrictions placed on sony and the directors a must see for comic book fans
Oct 9 2018,positive,fantastic movie  critics suck and dont deserve to rate movies  this is an awesome movie and everyone should see it  great acting and story and action  wow
Oct 9 2018,positive,definitely not a perfect movie but i dont think it deserves all the hate it is getting from critics the film could have benefited from a better script and more cohesive tones but its still a fun film and tom hardy gives a great and enjoyable performance
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was a good film because it was true to the comics and the filmmakers listened to the fans
Oct 9 2018,negative,some gold nuggets in the movie but mostly a cringefest the humor was terrible and i hated venoms voiceover not enough action the story was weak and predictable
Oct 9 2018,positive,its always fun to watch a franchise first movie i liked it
Oct 9 2018,positive,thought it was pretty decent much better than i expected really enjoyed tom hardys performance and how they realized the venom character even without the spiderman connection it is goofy weird and dark how it should be
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is shown to be a more relatable charecter with a higher sense of communication and iq than comic venom as a movie it is worth going to well directed
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was amazing everything i hoped venom to be it was short because of deleted scenes but a major improvement from that god awful spiderman 3 even without spiderman the character development is still there the 2nd best comic book movie to come out this year by far
Oct 9 2018,positive,box office explanins everything
Oct 9 2018,positive,i like thi movie it is not the greatest movie nor bad and i love venom comic books  so i think it is good super hero film
Oct 9 2018,positive,biggest venom fan ever definitely going to watch it over and over again loved the movie and already have seen it twice
Oct 9 2018,positive,questionable story but if you just want a good time youll enjoy it
Oct 9 2018,positive,origin stories in comic movies are certainly something i have grown a little weary of as of late but venom after a slow start is fun  the inner conflict between tom hardy and venom is interesting and funny at the same time  i can see where this movie has been picked apart somewhat  some of the action is frenetic and the film kind of jumps from scene to scene with no rhyme or reason  however im giving that a pass somewhat because i just had a good time with it  i do think it wouldve been a better film had it been r rated like logan but the money from opening weekend i guess was too much to resist
Oct 9 2018,positive,great depiction of a venom story will never understand why professional critics are not satisfied woth movies the oublic generally likes this movie blew my expectations by far tom hardy is a great casting decision and the venom character was fun to see i plan to see it again
Oct 9 2018,positive,when in doubt about the tomatometer remember this critics rated the titans tv show an 80
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was awesome started a little slow to give eddie some background but as soon as the auction starts its pretty much non stop i hope for a venom 2 where even more can be explained and take venom to another level
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun movie with loads of action intensity and charm   venom is a winner for people who want to have a good time at the theater on multiple levels of laughter and psychosis
Oct 9 2018,positive,well the weirdness of the character is delivered somehow perfectly and didnt come of as awkward or cringey its a very enjoyable movie right amount of action and humor that you wont get bored of wish there were blood though then again its way better than spider man 3s version of venom people should definitely watch this
Oct 9 2018,positive,i saw a bunch of reviews that said it didnt know what tone its going for they might be tone deaf this a a dark action comedy and it fires on all cylinders i was skeptical when tom hardy was quoted that the characters have a ren and stimpy relationship that is accurate and it works way better than i could have imagined loved this movie cant wait for more of tom hardy in this role there are two scenes that will be a little cooler if they can do a r rated directors cut but this film is strong as is
Oct 9 2018,negative,funny but thats it dumb story
Oct 9 2018,positive,i live in a terrible place called reality  when i go to a movie based on a comic book i expect to spend my time in a place called fantacy  venom is a fantastic tour through crazy and fun  well done         of course if you prefer movies about frustrated young love a spool of thread or learning to play the piano you might not understand venom  i plan to get it when its released
Oct 9 2018,positive,for all the pretentious idiots reviewing this by that i mean all these top reviewersnewspaper columnist the fact that non of you see the actual point of this movie is beyond me the movie is meant to draw you into the series and its not meant to have anything to do with spiderman yes obviously it is derived from the spiderman comics but this movie is an opener and interduction for the series of venom movies to come i realize that it was kind of all over the place script wise but what do you expect when they make a pg13 movie that should of been rated r the movie was good but the charicters need to be brought to there full potential and shouldnt be healed back because of the rated pg13 venom in himself should be more openly expressive to his evil side the movie dampins the characters to make a more wide range viewer base the follow up to this movie needs to be rated r and needs to bring out the characters full potential also ignore the critics reviews because all they care about is how closesly it relates to the comic books honesty rarely anyone cares about that as long as its a great movie this interduction to venom was very well plotted out to now hive following movies a better handle on what we could expect from this amazing character
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie not spetacular but i enjoyed
Oct 9 2018,positive,went to see the movie yesterday and the critics were full of it this movie was actually really good
Oct 9 2018,positive,never listen to the critics if you want to watch a film then watch it i personally loved the film and has definitely done the character more justice then people who haven the seen the film believe its not exactly comic book accurate however it is still pretty close and boarderline perfect considering spider man isnt in it duh its about venom not spiderman
Oct 9 2018,positive,definitely like the new story makes me curious on how they going to merge with spiderman plus the extra clip at the end makes it more interesting to see a second movie 
Oct 9 2018,positive,some issues without a doubt but surprised and pleased as a whole some of the editing and effects were not the greatest but the venom character was hashed out very well
Oct 9 2018,positive,i dont care about critics this movie is a lot  better than they say its really good movie and does have a good story line as with the comic i dont know whats wrong with them
Oct 9 2018,positive,for a diehard marvel fan
Oct 9 2018,positive,this was a fun movie i think a lot of critics expect every comic book movie to have deeply connected and intertwined  plots like infinity wars venom is an action popcorn flick that is unique and fun tom hardy makes the movie as both eddie and the voice of venom i would have rated the movie higher if they made it rated r every action scene screams for more gore and violence would have improved the money in almost every way they could have dialed up the horror as well if it were rated r best parts were when
Oct 9 2018,positive,simply put venom is amazing tom hardy plays the role to perfection and the dark vibe of the movie has a ton of funny unintentional but intentional comedy its more for fans of dark humor more than anything else the only thing that kind of threw me off was how venom sounded i was hoping for the producers to give venom a thundering calm voice as was shown in some of the trailers however its more wrath like and i know its very similar to venom cartoons back in the day which is okay i give it 55 stars as it was one hell of an experience and i got a free limited edition comic book with the preordering of a ticket
Oct 9 2018,positive,should have scored 70 
Oct 9 2018,positive,fantasic movie loved every bit of it and doesnt need spider man to make it a good movie i thought it was done perfect and everything i wanted
Oct 9 2018,positive,nice move really too good  i watched in hindi language and it was too good      sooooo funny
Oct 9 2018,negative,unwarranted hype     fun movie with quite nice jokes good cgi good fight scenes but kinda lazy writingi wish the storyplot to be more meaningfulthere is so many scene that dosent have any logical explanation sadly but i can not give more than 310 
Oct 9 2018,neutral,that r rating was sorely missed i saw it with my mother in law and she thought the film was a silly little movie that shows how tame it is
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing its a great movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,this is not the story of venom it is a reimagining action is good but dont go see this movie youll probably be disappointed
Oct 9 2018,positive,i found this film to be highly enjoyable such a 90s nostalgia trip and the tom hardy vs tom hardy dynamic is awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,so much fun loved it tom hardy was perfect and venom looked awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,this film was really fun to watch tom hardy was amazing it starts off slow but gets really good after he bonds with the symbiote story isnt too amazing and the villain wasnt done super well but overall the film was quite good definately worth watching
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie was frigging awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in awhile the most  said thing about this movie is is it a comedy but i wouldnt say its a comedy per say because what makes it funny is that he responds how a real person would instead of just excepting it
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved it the only thing i didnt like was the spotty cgi of the symbiots at the very beginning the other cgi was great
Oct 9 2018,positive,ive been a fan of venom since he debuted in the 1994 spiderman animated series  this captures the same feelings i had as a child watching that cartoon and brings them back in a more dark and grownup style  its a great thrill ride of a film and despite a certain webslingers absence the creative team did a great job writing a story that retells the origins of my favorite antihero  its not true to the comics but in this world of mixed up licensing and film rights its the best we could ask for
Oct 9 2018,positive,i am not sure what the critics who slammed this were expecting  i thought it was enjoyable and a bit different from the usual marvel movies and the darkness of dc  i felt its somewhere in the middle of those movies  i also thought the cast especially tom hardy was excellent
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics dont like it because it doesnt have the   usual pc stuff in it this movie is just pure  entertainment
Oct 9 2018,positive,very good movie that surpassed my expectations
Oct 9 2018,positive,look its not going to win any oscars but its just fun its a movie that doesnt take itself too seriously yet skillfully fluctuates between horror scifi and comedy hardy is perfect casting and his relationship with his parasite is what youre paying to see
Oct 9 2018,negative,its shite its proper shite from script to directing from editing to cgi a mess save for hardys incessant attempts at making it work but alas there is no raw material to work with
Oct 9 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie thoroughly not sure why critics are being so harsh on it i would and probably will go watch this movie again
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing critic reviews dont reflect the movie nitpickers
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was amazing saw it twice in the same day great humor great action had some plot it isnt the dark knight or anything but it was still an awesome and fun movie my biggest complaint was that it was a bit loud but honestly im sensitive about that kind of thing dont believe the critics
Oct 9 2018,positive,this is a great joy ride
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics arent good enough to understand what audiences wants
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved this movie i thought the story was simple but built the characters well i would have liked it to have a bit more blood and guts it was pretty tame by venom standards i really dont think the critics get it thank you for making a good venom movie i am ready for a r rated carnage
Oct 9 2018,positive,after seeing some of the critic reviews i wasnt expecting much but i honestly enjoyed the movie im a venom fan but it wasnt just me laughing in the theatre theres a good energy to the movie and it doesnt disappoint in offering an action filled gritty super hero experience the interaction between brock and venom really makes the movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,if you didnt know who venom was youd love it if you know who he is you have to toss out a whole lot to enjoy this film but i did enjoy it its basically upgrade with a black goo suit  you have to just accept some really stupid things like the symbiotes have earth english names why would aliens have names like venom and riot i guess we just have to accept it like we accept a guy from zenla being called a surfer why would that word be in their lexicon and the suit is vicious and brock isnt as we know in spiderman lore brock is the angry guy and the suit just feels rejected and goes along with him brock is actually the voice of reason in this pairup  besides that and a few more misstepschanges the film is fun once he gets the suit  after that its just a lot of smashing bashing and thrashing it did seem kind a quick pace but i like that it left a lot fo stuff up in the air and yes the end credit is what a venom fan would want to see hopefully they will have the spiderman vs venom movie at some point but marvel should do it to make it great hell if youre a comic book fan youre going to see it anyway so go ahead just dont expect  it to hold to canon but it was pretty funny and if they make a r rated film next time itll be even better
Oct 9 2018,positive,fuk the critics they dont understand what its like to enjoy anything
Oct 9 2018,positive,saw venom and thought it was fantastic has good pacing and characters the plot is griping and allows for an enjoyable experience while keeping you on the edge of your seat
Oct 9 2018,positive,i think it was awesome intensefunny
Oct 9 2018,positive,at first i had my doubts about this movie because it was change from rrated to pg13 but i have to chew my own words this movie was very welldeveloped it was really good all the performances were good to a t especially tom hardy he did this character justicethis movie deserves the number one spot
Oct 9 2018,positive,if you want to see a semi depressing well done movie go see a star is born if you want to see a funny kick ass action adventure this is the one
Oct 9 2018,negative,quite poor plot but the effects and hardys performance carry this movie somewhere not sure what michelle williams was doing in this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,a entertaining movie that creates a story that reminded me of some of the comics that didnt involve spiderman tom hardy does a great performance of eddie and vemon and even with the ok story this is a c movie i hope the sequel is rated r but if not then i hope the next movie will be a fun ride like this one
Oct 9 2018,negative,if you wanna have your senses bombarded by the cgi mess that is venom then please be my guest
Oct 9 2018,positive,i went into this movie feeling very uncertain the critic reviews said nothing good about the film and i already had my doubts about being able to have a venom film without spiderman but not only do i think sony pulled it off i think they blew it out of the water it offered a new and enjoyable take on a classic character while also staying fairly close to some of the source material like any movie it wasnt perfect however the good definitely outweighed the bad
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom was overall great i do not understand the bad critic reviews but its clear that the general audience disagrees
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie of the year other than infinity war
Oct 9 2018,negative,another let down it doesnt have history nor continuity everyone was acting as if they were at the room set my gf left for 3 minutes when she came back ask me why venom was good and riot bad so suddenly i couldnt respond i tried but that showed me the mediocre of a film it was
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved venom the character not so much the movie but i am a character based viewer i have a dark sense of humor and i loved this version of brockvenom even if it didnt really match the characters as i knew them to be the movie needed a slap of reality dont make rules and immediately break them also not every hero needs to fight a version of themselves for every climax he could have fought kraven or anyone who wasnt a carbon copy of him and it would have been much more interesting
Oct 9 2018,positive,once again the critics are clueless  i went in concerned due to their stodgy reviews but was rewarded high above my own expectations  the movie is charming fun explosive and just a very enjoyable ride from beginning to end  tom hardy is perfect  looking forward to the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,fun entertaining great acting by tom hardy  delivered good character development
Oct 9 2018,positive,i loved the movie i just wish they would have went with the r ratings they wanted to go either it would have fit the movie just like dead pool and logan
Oct 9 2018,positive,brilliant performance by tom hardythe venom conversations were funny and awesome and venom was almost close to the comic book versionoverall a great movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,hilarious action packed overall a really good movie
Oct 9 2018,negative,forceful cringeworthy cgi dialogue and humor venom needs more than just its witty charming chemistry from hardy and his symbiotic counterpart to save what seems to be just another subpar entry in sonys attempt to salvage what universe it has or is trying to create 235
Oct 9 2018,positive,was way better than i expected it had an amazing cast i cant way to see what comes next
Oct 9 2018,positive,this was just a fun movie through and through tom hardy did a killer performance leaving me smiling and laughing the entire time
Oct 9 2018,positive,this is my new favorite marvel film even though it is not part of the mcu  there was a lot of great dialogue between eddie and venom  the cgi was mostly fantastic  the character motivation was very clear and developed for both of them  the final fight camera work got a little too tight into the characters but i could still tell what was going on  i hate sony as a company but i cannot deny that they made a great first film with venom as the main character  i have no idea what is wrong with these critics  usually there is a political reason for the critic and audience scores but there is nothing political in this film
Oct 9 2018,positive,not deep and introspective but fun and obnoxious and engaging dont get pretentious about it and youll like it just fine
Oct 9 2018,positive,really interesting film
Oct 9 2018,negative,terrible cash grab  dont waste your time and money on this one
Oct 9 2018,positive,tom hardys performance made this movie as good as it was however i was hoping for more symbiotes to take part in the dynamic other than merely venom and riot in addition i think the movie really should have displayed the graphic violence of cannibalism and the like because that is what venom is actually about now it seemed like that they were afraid to make the movie darker in that way in order to please the mainstream audience if they are going to do the sequal than they should definitely make the theme darker since they would do both venom and carnage characters a disservice otherwise
Oct 9 2018,positive,stayed true to the comics tom hardy put on an amazing performance the cgi was amazing and i thought the acting was great too all around
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing highly recommend
Oct 9 2018,positive,made me laugh cry and wow looking forward to more
Oct 9 2018,positive,for you it may be a garbage but for me it is brilliant idea
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is a good introducing for new marvel superhero  the story has some problems such like that the real reason why venom suddenly starts to support humans against his leader  the events that related to moving to space and real motive were not drawn well nevertheless the action was great  the comedy and drama parts were good
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was not groundbreaking but it knew what it was and had fun with it this really translates to the audience
Oct 9 2018,positive,its an origin movie getting to meet eddie tom hardy and venom a symbiote not from earth eddie was down on his luck life went to hell and suddenly he has a symbiote inside him and he talks not a hey whats up im going to keep you company for awhile kind of talk venom flashes his face for the first time to eddie to prove there is something there and eddies imagination has taken a turn for the worse i laughed so hard i had to cover my mouth and try not crying rude neighbor venom flashes his face i bet that neighbor will not only buy headphones he will by soundless slippers venom became a protector of earth venom  hasnt really gotten to explore it yet but he sees there is beauty when he wasnt expecting it eddies thoughts  help to establish this bond so venom can tell the good from the bad   this s just an eddievenom movie and to try and change what it is isnt cool i found it sad then charming funny and antihero perfect tom did a great job and i see the movie for what it is a great starting point to a couple more sequels if anyone thinks this movie sucks you obviously havent watched the blair witch projects i walked out of blair witch project a little less than half way through the movie i have gone and seen venom twice now and i am going back i have found my antihero and we has stolen my heart
Oct 9 2018,positive,pleasantly surprised at how well they pulled off venom with no spiderman overall fun movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie was fun and entertaining the only thing that would have made this movie better would be a rated r rating not sure what critics are looking for in a movie maybe they are looking for a lifechanging reflection im just looking for a good time at the movie theater we either need new critics or we need to stop soliciting their opinions
Oct 9 2018,positive,very fun and enjoyable should have gotten a 70 percent rating or higher
Oct 9 2018,positive,there is only one major flaw in the movie that really bothered me  it was just that what did brock do to change venoms mind other than that really fun film
Oct 9 2018,positive,come on im a marvel fan   as the movie is set to be without involved of spiderman  they have done a good  job  the action comedy romanceetc they have put everything in a good manner
Oct 9 2018,positive,although the critics cleary hate it the film is an easy watch with some great comedic moments and visually pleasing action sequences and cgi tom hardys acting is memorable as always and is great watch for any action movie  comic book fan even better in imax 
Oct 9 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive seen aince infinity war
Oct 9 2018,positive,everyone needs a friend like venom sure the movie wasnt perfect but it was fun thats all you can ask for from a superhero movie we are venom bum da da bum bum bum bum bum recited in the farmers insurance jingle format
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a fun romp  prefer this venom to the one previously put on screen
Oct 9 2018,positive,very good movie really enjoyed it would recommend
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont listen to these critics this movie was wonderful it was not a carbon copy of marvels current formula i love that so its not a dig but makes it own path with one of our favorite anti heroes tom hardy is good as ever and the after credit scene had me grinning like a little girl this movie is fun action packed and everything i hoped for the full venom was perfect please go see
Oct 9 2018,neutral,not bad enough to be good this movie features all your standard sub plots  a guy who cant keep it together a girlfriend who is perfect and does all the emotional financial and physical labor then dumps him but of course shes still the heroin a stereotypical young bald white giuvwith a bad guy face as the bad guys lackey there were been there done that subplots that had nothing unique about them to make them better than their predecessors it was entertaining enough and had a few decent points but there was simply nothing special about it even the cg and fight scenes were lack luster
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie was amazing the relationship between venom and eddie was perfect the humor was spoton the critics are absolutely crazy for their reviews because this movie has it all i loved it
Oct 9 2018,positive,it was a fun movie tom hardy really made the movie maybe if they took a little longer with the script and fleshing the characters out it could be alot better but hopeully they get a sequel to flesh out the world some more
Oct 9 2018,positive,just outstanding  the critics have no job but to post  paid negative reviews my suggestion to the audience would be to go and watch the movie thorough enjoyment and yeah we are venom we can do whatever we want 
Oct 9 2018,positive,over all it wasnt as bad as people led it up to be  genuine decent comedy  and really i just in my opinion honestly liked the film
Oct 9 2018,positive,awesome movie     tom hardy knocked it out of the park in this movie cannot wait for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,whatever you do dont listen to the critics this movie was awesome  i loved it
Oct 9 2018,positive,great movie its worth watching in theatre
Oct 9 2018,positive,looking at all the reviews i had second thoughts if i should go watch it but being a spidey fan for a long time i couldnt miss venom let me tell you do not believe the critics i loved the movie and my wife who is not into superhero movies also loved it in her words this was one of best superhero movies she had watched we found it to be funny dark dramatic with lots of plots to continue the story with go watch it yourself and make an opinion every movie has flaws this one has a couple but definitely not more than the things that are going for it
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie will be so good
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie was great and i loved it  i was always on the edge of my seat to see what happens next i hope they make more of these movies and cant wait to see carnage my only complain is that they did a poor job in explaining why venom  a loser on his planet would fight his group leader which might cost him his life
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics the movie was surprisingly good and i would like to see more of this it was refreshing
Oct 9 2018,positive,i came into this movie with the lowest of expectations as the movie went along i just kept being surprised by how entertaining and funny it was i left the theater with one overwhelming thought this movie ranks up there with deadpool you get attached to the main character but also to the antihero that is venom what starts out like an alien invasion type film ends up with a very funny and badass antihero you cant help but love i wholeheartedly do not agree with the low score this movie is getting from critics again i came into this movie with lower expectations than i had with batman vs superman i get the rating if youve only seen the trailer i highly recommend this movie in theaters i can just hope to see this become a franchise on its own
Oct 9 2018,positive,not perfect but not disappointing i think it would have done it better with an r rating insted of the pg13    will watch again
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie was fun dont go by critics
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie was pretty good and better that expected given the horrible reviews it was given which i still dont understand tom hardy plays brock very well and does a great job overall the interaction with venom is great and adds a good element to the movie definitely see this as a good sign of things to come for this series would give it 5 stars if they would have gone for the r rating i hope this will be done next time as this was one thing i feel was missing
Oct 9 2018,positive,one of the best dark superhero movies ever definitely top 5
Oct 9 2018,neutral,all characters apart from eddie needed a little more backstory as i felt there was no emotional attachment to them i didnt really care for them as i had invested no time in learning about them    the first act felt rushed and needed a bit more work     the car chase had good individual moments but didnt feel like it was going anywhere     the fighting scenes were well choreographed and were really smooth however i think myself and others were expecting a little more gore not a massive amount more but a tasteful amount enough to make you whine    for me there was a little too much humour in what was supposed to be a darker film dont get me wrong keep a a few laugh out loud moments but keep it at that to make you think you should fear the character    not a terrible film but had so much potential to be a great
Oct 9 2018,positive,the critics are so out of touch with good movies these days  they push agendas take bribes and sit on their tall horse rather than advocate good fun films  who cares if the film isnt the next casablanca  this had a solid origin story tom hardy was great and its a good superhero comic book movie and its ten times better than the last jedi and on par with black panther  literally shot for shot dialogue graphics cinematography etc
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing film well directed despite not having spiderman surprisingly true to the comics and features symbiotes weve never seen on screen ebfore like riot and carnage and she venom amazing film dont listen to the critics they just dont understand the comics and the passion but as a fan of the comics and venom as an anti hero this movie portayed him perfectly and i love how venom and eddie brock are two seperate entities that communicate and bond throughout the movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,the movie is not bad it has it moments and by the end youll be hoping to watch more of eddie brock and symbiote venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,i saw the movie and while it had problems it was still a good movie that was fun to watch
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont listen to the idiots who call themselves movie critics this movie was amazing and does justice to for venom the casting was great tom hardy killed it as venom and the story was simple yet elegant definitely worth the time and money
Oct 9 2018,positive,critics have no idea what theyre talking about the movie was great
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie is hilarious tom hardy is outstanding as he plays off of the voice in his head who pretty much says whatever he likes the only problem with this movie is that it doesnt quite know what it wants to be it is only a third into the movie that we realize it is a darkbuddycomedy fanatastic movie would definitely watch again
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film at first i was unsure what to expect but overall it had a good mix of action humour and tom hardy lets hope we get more venom
Oct 9 2018,positive,easily the best sonymarvel offering the wife not a comic book movie girl loved it it is fun characters were good and the whole movie was funny and had you by the heart strings early on well worth seeing in the theater
Oct 9 2018,positive,loved the movie especially the chemistry between venom and tom hardy
Oct 9 2018,positive,venom is what you call a good marvel movie it has all what marvel movies need  action comedy and of course that glorious stan lee cameo     venom may have been destroyed by critics but in my and many others opinions venom was one of the best marvel movies ive ever seen the only problem i had is that the first 3040 mins felt a little too long but when venom got introduced then it got good     but that doesnt mean it was a bad first act  having the spoiler guy loose the girl to activate the plot was still a good way to go even know it felt long     in my own opinion venom deserves more love cause of how it brings the titles character to life i liked the spiderman 3 version as well but he didnt do or look like venom from the comics but this version 2018 did and thats what made me excited    thats my review for sonys venom  go watch it cause its amazing and it really isnt as what critics are saying    verdict  95
Oct 9 2018,negative,great movie but unclear if it is part of the mcu
Oct 9 2018,positive,when critics dont know the venom character lol movie is good go see it
Oct 9 2018,positive,i dont know why critics didnt like it but for me it was good
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont understand why critics are so harsh on this movie this movie was above average
Oct 9 2018,positive,i was skeptical of going to this movie but after watching the moviei had only one word to describe it awesome every penny of what i paid was totally worth watching itcant wait for the sequel
Oct 9 2018,positive,i love the interaction between eddie and venom they like buddies this film is great i hope they make a sequel of it
Oct 9 2018,positive,movie is just awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,dont trust critics this is one of the best movies i ever saw
Oct 9 2018,positive,way far better and best than deadpool 2
Oct 9 2018,positive,i dont know why u guys didnt like it but l liked this movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,i liked this film it was goodtom hardy is the best
Oct 9 2018,positive,a great origin story that sadly is weighed down a little by its pg rating but otherwise manages to be an entertaining romcom disguised as a bad superhero movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,perfect balance of comedy and action a film that you can watch a hundred times and still enjoy
Oct 9 2018,negative,poor action  talk more action less  i have a big expectation in this movie but i think this time marvel make me a bit disappointed
Oct 9 2018,positive,was a hell of a lot better the critics say it is yes it has it flaws but besides that its a great movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,a great movie for an origin purposes without having to involve spiderman in anyway
Oct 9 2018,positive,its a quiet entertaining movie pretty much enjoyable
Oct 9 2018,positive,all the power none of the responsibility i feel bad for the people that let critics and the rest of the internet do the thinking for them and didnt give this movie a chance  yes the spiderman connective tissue is sparse but present if youre paying attention flaws you betcha about 20 minutes couldhave been cut from the first act that nobody would miss however once tom hardys eddie brock and venom make are brought together the movie kicks into high gear and stays in the red zone well into the credits marvel is holding on looseley to this film but they havent let govso you should definitely stay for the after credits scene and even though spidey isnt in the film they show a chunk of spiderman into the spiderverse after the final credits  this one of thosse movies that will succeed on the strengths of the cast and delivering enough of what venom fans have been wanting to see on the big screen for decades tom hardy is a much better match for this symbiote than topher grace could ever have been and if the movie is the success i think it might be financially maybe marvel will bring venom into the fold and fans can see hardys venom and hollands spidey squareoff teamup and generally bring that 90 era mcfarlane spiderman to the big screen
Oct 9 2018,positive,this is a great sony marvel anti hero movie i like btter than antman 2 and spiderman homecoming i like the relation of venom and eddie is make me laugh soo hard
Oct 9 2018,positive,actually enjoyed it more than the spiderman films
Oct 9 2018,positive,of course movie have a lot of bad moments but if just see and enjoy the movie it is really good
Oct 9 2018,positive,very entertaining funny parts were funny and action scenes were cool
Oct 9 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie alot it was fun to watch good action good humor and very good tom hardy
Oct 9 2018,positive,although its not a traditional marvel movieit is still a very good movie the story is well organized and interesting dont know why there are so many negative reviews online its like a movie version of prototype i like it
Oct 9 2018,positive,honestly i watched the venom with the mindset of it being totally different from spiderman 3 which it mostly was but the 1st half or so of the movie the introduction to eddie was so boring and so out of nowhere style like a last min thing  if your going to make a movie almost 2 hours make it good or make it 2hours and 30mins and put the detail and correct intro we all need  ok symbiotes were on the ship but at least show a quick clip of it  but i think we deserved a lot more venom then half of t being eddie  i loved all the venom scenes but the whole movie i would say is in a dire need of spiderman cause when u watch this movie you know something is missing but i loved the action i loved the cgi some of the story i wish i saw more of  riot introduction but thats my opinion but if your going to watch this movie dont go in as a comic person go in as a movie person i would love to see carnage tho so if they make a squeal hopefully sony learns from their mistake on venom or else its going to be the same spiderman 3 flopall has been said based of my opinion and other reviews
Oct 9 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was a nice twist of the character alright it would of been better if it was rated r there was obvious scenes that should of been r or intended to be i say its a must watch if your a spiderman fan
Oct 9 2018,positive,really great action and cgi scenes it also kinda proved that venom can exist without spiderman which is important for sony since spiderman belongs to marvel also the dialog was nice  the jokes were on pointmost of them highly recommended if you want to have a good time
Oct 9 2018,positive,really fantastic film it is good to get more variety than beside marvel  i did not find it boring at all and that it was really cool dont listen to the critics
Oct 9 2018,positive,it is fun is it whats expected in 2018 but it is fun tom hardy does venom justice
Oct 9 2018,positive,thought it was awesome
Oct 9 2018,positive,very entertaining film   there is a good balance of action humor and tension with a very good performance from tom hardy the villain isnt the best youll see but it definitely sets up a good sequel
Oct 9 2018,negative,i dont know how the audience gave this film a 89 it was mindnumbing and very unintelligent this movie getting posotive reviews shows me what americans today will pass off as a good film this is sad go see a simple favor for a much better time
Oct 9 2018,positive,neither well shot nor well structured but just enough fun and a solid tom hardy makes it quite enjoyable in the way a bcomic movie does
Oct 9 2018,positive,is it a great movie no but is it an enjoyable and fun film that has a pretty good cast and a great dynamic between eddie and the symboyote heck yeah it has its own take on venoms origin thats interesting in itself and at least sees venom as more than just a spiderman villainantihero would definitely be interested in seeing an rrated cut too
Oct 9 2018,positive,a very good movie  and tom hardy was great
Oct 9 2018,positive,excited to finally have these characters showing up love it
Oct 9 2018,positive,funny and one of the best movies this year
Oct 9 2018,positive,this film is marvelous
Oct 9 2018,positive,the last third of the movie was worth it
Oct 9 2018,positive,greta fun film those that dont like seemed to have walked in with specific expectations that seemingly werent met shame because some great performances hardy really throws himself in to what is a really likeable villain would love to see the sequel hope it happens
Oct 9 2018,positive,i really fun and enjoy to watch itidc how ppl say but its sooo great filmgj
Oct 9 2018,positive,unrated movie plain and simple
Oct 9 2018,positive,made with fans in mind fans of venom will love it overall crowd pleaser
Oct 9 2018,positive,i absolutely loved it i think they rushed the relationship between venom and brody and would have liked to see more of an internal battle for control but ultimately i think it was awesome 
Oct 9 2018,positive,sooo im sure its an unpopular opinion but remind me again why all the hate for venom     i had a lot of fun watching that film there were a few plot issueslike tech guys with military grade gear blowing up dt san fran and with way to fast of a narrative ie no real time to learnbond and have an origin story of sorts but tbh it just jumped to all the fun stuff and setup an interesting character     another thought just like in the predatornew one suddenly the supporting female had to be part of the final showdown too even if that meant her being an olympic class marathon runner to get to where she was at just the right time against all odds it was bad writingplacating in both movies     all that aside i would give it a solid 35 and just a fun movie enjoy it for what it is sort of thing it was no worse than iron man 3still imo the worst current marvel movie to date and no worse than transformers in the entertainment department
Oct 9 2018,positive,this movie was absolutely fantastic went to go see it with my boyfriend and we both loved it
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing movie loved every second
Oct 9 2018,positive,definitely enjoyed the movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,way better than i expected it to be  tom hardy did a great job
Oct 9 2018,positive,one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seenwatch it then judge it
Oct 9 2018,positive,personally i enjoyed the film
Oct 9 2018,positive,the problem with moviegoers and renowned critics is that they think this is just the age for supercommercial 8 year old movies which should focus towards only highpaced action sequences with a bag of loopholes  for obvious reasons that is not the case with the filmmaking industry these days there are pictures which focus on storytelling by all means whilst also making sense considering that these are comic book movies  venom by action movie genre exceeds all expectations  building a concrete backstory which leads towards the symbiote venom fusing with its host eddie brock is simply fantastic   the conversation between eddie  venom is masterfully displayed by tom hardy and brings out the humor which the complete cinema laughed on    the action sequences are not at all short in supply while the pace of the picture never dulls for a moment    highly recommended
Oct 9 2018,positive,amazing movie had a few flaws but still an amazing  movie
Oct 9 2018,positive,understandable why critics didnt like it tbh having not had huge expectations for it it was great i also want to shake the cg and editors hands because holy crap the effects in that last fight were just something else my only real criticism is that the film didnt feel nearly long enough and venom bar murder was scarily relatable
Oct 9 2018,negative,great kids movie is all i have to say
Oct 9 2018,positive,great first enstallment of a very interesting character story was a bit rushed but extremely entertaining
Oct 9 2018,negative,lots of inconsistencies action was fine with the exception of the final battle tom hardys performance was fine overall the movie was trash though
Oct 8 2018,negative,not great not the worst still wanna see those scenes tom hardy was talking about
Oct 8 2018,positive,quite simply a great movie with fantastic cgi and is surprisingly funny i didnt expect venom to provide me with so many laughs and the chemistry between tom hardy and venom is breathtakingly good this movies has infected my mind since i watched it would definatly recomend despite what professinal critics may think
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is a must to see intense graphics superb characters and acting leave the critics and bad reveiws behind see yourself and decide amazing movie that everyone must watch becoming a fan
Oct 8 2018,positive,great addition to the mcu really hope it gets combined with the new marvel universe after avengers 4 venoms personality combined with tom hardys character worked really well was amusing eithout being cheesy really enjoyed the film and left wanting to know what happens nexts dont know what film the critics watched but thinki they missed the point lol
Oct 8 2018,positive,pretty good  but not perfect  no spiderman so that was a let down
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy is perfect for this roll first bane now the deadly venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to critics just go and watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy the perfect person to play venom after the disastrous appearance of venom in spider man 3  kudos to the vfx team for amazing graphics mention to riz ahmed for nice role overall a genuine origin story  and a must watch for all comic fans   would be a 5 starer if all the loose ends in story plot were tied thank you sony
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was fun i was entertained changed my mind about venom as an out and out villain
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was good but it should have been rrated it needed a bit more darkness to it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i could watch a whole movie with tom hardy and venom just walking down the street
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved watching this movie im not afraid to leave a movie if i dont like it but i was on the edge of my seat the entire time great story and action
Oct 8 2018,positive,a prime example where critics can not be trusted great fun movie watch for yourself
Oct 8 2018,positive,this will be a film of extremesif you dont like it youl hate it but if you like it boy will you love it
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a great movie couldwould have done some things different but mostly a really wonderful film sure venom is my favorite character but here are reasons why i truly believe its a great movie that deserved a better rating but also some cons lets start with the cons 1 like deadpool it should have been rated r so it could have been more bloody 2 show the heads being ripped off dont dumb down the gore on a man eating creature 3 like so many are saying they should have gotten into peoples backgrounds and relationships much more than they did everything else awesome the effects and graphics were wonderful not too much cgi as some complained i mean how else could they have shown what they did without the cgi venoms voice was exactly as i imagined in the comics his bond with eric is perfect and you can tell the actor truly cares about the roll already a skilled actor he only proved himself more with this role brilliant acting also i love how you see evil venom funnyhumorous venom and also his soft side for a very brief moment it proved why so many always ask and wonder if venom is a villain or a good guy i also dont agree that it started too slow it starts with action and suspense and while it took some time for venom and eric to meet they keep you intrigued until that moment arrives my biggest issue was not going more in depth with the characters and that is it but they can easily achieve that in the following movie this was a starter to break the ice and get him into the mess now venom is here and we can explore his background along with everyone elses   last review posted randomly so made new account to do this again

Oct 8 2018,positive,everything i wanted to see in a venom movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,coming from someone really sceptical and not too big of a fan of sony films i loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,whos ever idea it was to have the opening sequence like ang lees hulk should have a stern talking to 
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing critics suck go see it
Oct 8 2018,positive,it kinda start slow but as it progresses you start liking it a lot it has good action plus good comedy  plus some dark jokes as well
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought this was an amazing movie tom hardy played eddie brock very well the voice of venom by hardy as well the humor the cgi and tone of the movie was all amazing hope to see a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie hardy was great 2nd half seemed a but rushed but a thoroughly enjoyable movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was really funny suspenseful action packed and a great story plot 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i have seen movies far worse than this besides it was good enough to be fun a sequel could use better directing and a better script but this movie was well worth a night at the theater
Oct 8 2018,positive,great film as a venom fan of course could be better but its a great introduction to the character and whats to come in future films i recommend to anyone interested in venom as a character this film is great not sure what the critics saw but what i saw what a good film definitely will watch it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,definitely could have been better if it was rated r but for a stand alone venom movie without spiderman it was as good as i could have hoped
Oct 8 2018,positive,i had reservations even though i love tom hardythis movie was greatentertainment and fun 
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was beyond incredible i expected a lot and it blew those expectations
Oct 8 2018,positive,very well done by the actors that pulled this story line along very well a bit to melodramatic when going from extremes of evil to humorous good guy without the actors very well done roles this would have fallen apart quickly
Oct 8 2018,positive,the comic show venom as a bad guy the movie shows him a good guy the human side that is the reason that the fans are not very happy the movie is really good the special effects are really good
Oct 8 2018,positive,fantastic movie loved how the character was done and tom hardy played eddie well i think the pg13 rating hurt it from becoming a 1010
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie had some flaws but overall i enjoyed it a lot and hope to see him in theaters again in the near future
Oct 8 2018,positive,super entertaining movie cant wait for the next one 
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to these dumbass critics this movie wasnt the best super hero flick but still it isnt the worst but i mean come on you have to look at it this way sony couldnt put spiderman in the film so i already give them a a in my book because they didnt fail at making a venom movie with out spiderman so i definitely recommend it my rating for venom is 8510 
Oct 8 2018,positive,the first half is quite bad but once venom gets in the picture it gets really fun and enjoyable
Oct 8 2018,negative,relentlessly awful writing and overall movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie that showed venom of the 2000s in a decent light critics must have been paid off or something
Oct 8 2018,positive,if youre into the super hero films and comics then youll really appreciate this film for venom tom hardy really stays true to the character and its like venom came of the pages onto the big screen only thing is i wish it would have stayed rated r
Oct 8 2018,neutral,most comic fans will like it because they get venom right well the way he looks and sounds anyway but the writing is bad and theres no spiderman so its just weird it would be one thing if it was a good story but its not poor villain and nothing is explained or built up the movie really struggles if it wasnt venom from the comics i think most people would be disappointed with this film 
Oct 8 2018,neutral,this movie needed to be ma15 and spiderman however this is a big let down of a movie only positives are tension between eddie brock and venom but venom was a hero soyeah
Oct 8 2018,positive,best romantic comedy ive seen in years  tom hardy had great chemistry with his cgi deepvoiced alter ego  i belted our laughing several times during the venom hijinks think restaurant scene  this is the venom i never expected and am surprised we got that brought all the best of the character outno shitty grimdark drama or macabre fixation on the folks who got eaten along the way  just a quirky guy and his new alien partnerslashlover out to save the day chow down on junk food and try to figure this whole relationship thing out while juggling morals and powerhungry megalomaniacs and their awkward exes  1010 will watch again
Oct 8 2018,positive,love the chemistry between brock and the symbyote the tone does shift too much and the villains are boring
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was great just left you wanting more they did a good job bringing the comic book characters to the screen and i think tom hardy was a great choice for venom look forward to the next one
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont understand the hate four this movie its not in the marvel top 10 bit its still really good funny my girlfriend liked it so for me a very good distraction without being a classic
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved venom many may argue that the mixture of tone hindered the quality of the movie but i found the dark humor with super hero feel to be refreshing i felt like the movie reached a broader range of audiences and i am excited to see the next one
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a good movie but it was a little confusing and it was action all the way through non stop it does have funny moments and good fight scenes i recommend watching it
Oct 8 2018,positive,had a lot of fun hope they do the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,people are hating this movie because they say how bad the movie was portrayed or how it was set up this movie is amazing coming from a comic book fan and the bond in this movie is good dont listen to the critics they dont now a good movie if it slapped them in the face
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was enjoyable and great i dont know why people are giving bad reviews
Oct 8 2018,positive,way better than expected
Oct 8 2018,positive,a few pacing issues and storywise the film could use some work but overall a good movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,great origin story considering you cant have spiderman in the film lots of fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,it turned out to be a great movie  really enjoyable  there may be a few scenes that are sub par but what movie doesnt  it was nice the direction that they went with the horror aspect rumors say they will continue in this direction with certain characters it will be a nice change from what we are used to in comic book movies both for the comic book lover and your everyday movie watcher 
Oct 8 2018,positive,scifi horror superherovillain action and comedy all rolled into one in an efficient and coherent manner homage paid where it counts and creativity applied where it works a simply amazing genrehybrid movie experience
Oct 8 2018,positive,not bad but not great a decent effort that had uneven pacing but overall is a good movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,i personally loved this film
Oct 8 2018,positive,totally blown away by how funny and good the movie was
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was falsely criticized
Oct 8 2018,positive,the critics are mad because it isnt really like the comicsbut honestly the actual cinematic product was so enjoyable funny bits character development story line consistency and awesome action go see it dont let critics stop you i or we hehe very much recommend it
Oct 8 2018,negative,sorry but this is not a quality film this is a b movie at best tom hardy is a great actor no doubt but his portrayal was spotty at best his relationship to michelle williams was awkward as hell and riz ahmed was dumbed down to a clicked villian those reports of this film feeling like a movie that was made in 2004 during the dark ages of comic book cinema are pretty accurate venom deserved better
Oct 8 2018,positive,pacing is bad but otherwise not too much to complain about some of the acting from tertiary characters is pretty wooden but tom hardy absolutely nails eddy brock and the venombrock dynamic is really fun and makes for a good movie stay through the credits
Oct 8 2018,positive,an overall fun time pacing can get a little slow in the middle visual effects are good and the venom character was enjoyable to watch 
Oct 8 2018,negative,bad special effects inconsistent tones and an awful script at least the performances are good 
Oct 8 2018,negative,super disappointed with the movie interpretation of this awesome character has almost nothing to do with the comics and theres no spidey why does the symbiotie look like spidey then walked out at the final battle cgi scene total snooze fest 
Oct 8 2018,neutral,typical cookiecutter villain the plot was very weak the action sequences were great but the fight sequence was subpar the purpose of the villain is the same as every other villain and like everything other villain their methods make no sense if the sequel is going to work it needs to be rated r and needs to have a better plot not a big fan of the director and writers tom hardy did his best with the material
Oct 8 2018,positive,started off slow but got better 
Oct 8 2018,positive,at first when i saw that it had a poor ratings i was discouraged to even watch it ive always been a fan of the comic books so i took a chance and hoped for best in my opinion it was a good movie in the likes of any any superhero movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,best part lf this movie is the relationship between eddie and venom action scenes are fantastic would go into detail but im hella tired lol
Oct 8 2018,positive,i surprisingly had fun with this movie i liked seeing venom and eddie slowly come to under each other i thought that id hate the cgi but the nonrealistic graphic actually added some excitement for me the action scenes were shot and paced really well the fight choreography was fast and entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,a fun middle of the road antihero movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,while this movie does suffer from inconsistent tones a somewhat poor script and an over the top messy third act venom is still a very entertaining and enjoyable film the humour is fantastic when done well the action scenes are well executed and the interactions and relationship between eddie brock and venom is brilliant
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a casual venom fan i really enjoyed the movie  who are these critics anyway
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was amazing it was fun to watch hilarious and has really awesome action scenes
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was a very enjoyable experience for me as an avid moviegoer and comic book fan the film hits key areas that i think makes a great film it had good action pacing actingespecially hardy and a great villain i didnt know what to expect when i first came in due to poor reviews and overall concern but im glad to report that venom is sonys first successful attempt to relaunch their marvel movies separate from disney i hope there is a sequel and for eddie brockvenom to hopefully face off against spiderman either in the mcu or any other spiderman sony chooses to use 910
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy is what saves this film venom is an extremely violent comic and the director did not do it justice by making this film pg 13 michelle williams has about as much chemistry as a rock and she should have never been casted the scenes with her were painful
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics watch it for venom its awesome 
Oct 8 2018,positive,there were quite a few awkward lines of dialogue and some action scenes were a little hard to follow but overall venom was a good movie the simpler fight scenes were amazing and the relationship between venom and eddie brock was portrayed really well the plot wasnt the strongest but it didnt seem to hold the movie back much
Oct 8 2018,positive,came in with little expectations due to some of the bad reviews ive been seeing oh my god its actually a pretty good flick definitely a 910 rewatchability in my book
Oct 8 2018,positive,a very refreshing break from the normal super hero genre this movie actually really surprised me i was expecting yet another comic book movie disaster and i was very happy to finally get a good representation of venom if you are a fan of venom you will be very pleased with this movie ignore what all the critics they have clearly lost their touch with movie goers expectations
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it has simple story and awesome action sequences with lots of humour
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun to watch tom hardy was great
Oct 8 2018,positive,go along for the ride and enjoy yourself  i sure did 
Oct 8 2018,negative,i am an avid fan of this character and a fan of film in general  this movie completely misses the mark on both fronts  they completely misinterpreted the titular character  and the blatant disregard for consistencyhaving any attention to detail takes away from the already weak narrative  there is just no real content to this plot without having an origin without spiderman for the fans of the franchise and any basic writer for a comic movie should know by now to develop the villain properly  this villain is dull despite having strong convictions and there is no effort made for an explanation for why he is so strongly motivated to do what he does  the biggest problem the movie had despite its poor cg editing and composition was the dialogue  characters seem to react calmly in the face of a giant alien killing people when its convenient and the alien symbiote seemed to be a brutal killing machine sometimes but have a heart of gold at others  it was so unbelievable that it took me out of the scene a lot of the time  terrible all around sony  if you have half a brain youll pass
Oct 8 2018,positive,man critics are stupid
Oct 8 2018,positive,next movie needs to be rated r
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was great lots of action and a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat i dont really understand why the critics are giving it bad reviews but overall a great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was really good im just sad because of how underrated the movie is but overall a great and must watch movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,those critics couldnt review their way out of a wet paper bag
Oct 8 2018,negative,well it was a movie goofy dialogiue uncompelling characters weird unresolved plot the actions scenes lasted like 30 minutes each 410 definitely wouldnt see again but not the worst movie ever
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than i expected great credits scene 
Oct 8 2018,positive,very good movie i dont know why critics always like boring movies and the one regular folks like they give horrible scores
Oct 8 2018,neutral,venom is not the worst marvel movie ive seen but thats not saying much   brilliant cast tom hardy  great performance definately suspenseful and funny however the script was all over the place i was often too confused to fully engage in the story while venom looked scary he had far too many cheesy lines for me to take him seriously equally cheesy and painful was the song during the credits the last scene after the credits was pointless and boring 
Oct 8 2018,positive,well played tom hardy
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie loved harys performance
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was a popcorn flick loved the chemistry between the symbiote and eddie but there were some unexplained scenarioshope they sort it out with the sequel just go watch it and have some fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are all wrong on this it was perfect dark humorous strong and accurate to the comics cant wait for the next film
Oct 8 2018,positive,reading critic reviews before watching the movie discouraged me highly as i was eagerly waiting on a true venom big screen adaptation after bearing witness to the catastrophie which was venom in spiderman 3 most critics stated the film was an utter mess and unjoyable after watching the movie all i can say is that this film is possibly one of the best superherovillian adaptation into a movie as far as the first spiderman movie by sam reimi tom hardy played exceptional as both eddie brock and the venom symbiote the story was simple to follow and i praise the precise balance of background storytelling and current storytelling the fight scenes are what i only dreamed of what a fight scene with venom would be like besides all the actionvenom is also a pretty comedic film thanks to tom hardys venom voice providing viewers with quirky yet hilarious punchlines and jokes the only minor problem i had watching the film is how the main villian symbiote riot made its journey into the events of the movie it was a very longredundant and honestly a very dumb choice to follow riot through different hosts basically just walking around travelling across the world in a matter of what it seemed to be just a couple of days besides that i can say that the critics that originally wrote their initial reviews were just clueless individuals who have no idea on the comic book antihero or even comic books in general and just based their reviews on how mixed up the story was because they could not find anything else wrong with the film take it from me a superherocomic book junkie that venom is one the best marvel origin movies since the first spiderman and the first captain america but be warned to those who view with children venom has alot of strong language for a pg13 movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics it is a lot of fun and laughs loved it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie love venom and brocks relationship
Oct 8 2018,positive,lemme start this off by saying it was a really good movie its unique in some ways you dont see a bond between characters like this tom hardy as eddie was amazing thought that was absolutely the best choice and he fit the role so well venom was hilarious and really showed what a good friend is like tbh he was kind of like a wingman in one of the scenes venom had so many scenes where he was funny and had the best reactions it was also interesting to see him change his mind and be a really good symbiote all of the action sequences were interesting to watch and were very cool to see how confused eddie was and realize that he had a parasite you never really see a strong connection like they have and it is hard time bromance and you just wanna see them more and how they will connect more in the future although almost everything was good it wasnt perfect the beginning was sort of slow and it felt like it finished way too quickly riot as a villain was strange he was described as a big bad guy which he was and he was like the leader of everybody but he was just a easy kill like i said the ending was short so thats probably why he died so quickly it was interesting to see riot though he looked like that yee dinosaur carlton drake was a major douche but riz ahmad playing him did a really good job i loved seeing him in it overall i give it a solid 9510 and i do recommend go seeing it if you havent already im looking forward to seeing more of these two
Oct 8 2018,positive,i liked it a lot it was chaotic and very comic book like it was a fun ride
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is just all around fun and the character venom is portrayed perfectly yea the villain isnt the best but you pay admission to see venom all the critic ratings do zero justice for what this movie really is a fun origin story of a fan favorite antihero from the spiderman saga i would say the only thing missing is spidey 
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the reviews venom was amazing
Oct 8 2018,positive,good visuals great acting from all sides dialogue can be a bit cliche but overall a fantastic movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved this movie there beginning takes its time to develope eddie brock as a guy who loses everything and lands in a rut which i enjoyed from there the movie takes off and its a blast cant wait for the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,was amazing highly recommend
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy and venoms connection was great and fun movies went well to follow the comic books with good background to understand if you hadnt read them
Oct 8 2018,positive,everyone keeps saying that venom isnt a good movie but it is theres great character development plot and acting in this film i would love to see a sequel to it
Oct 8 2018,positive,while my boys ages 13 and 15 thought the movie was excellent i thought it was ok the writing could have bern better and some interactions seemed forced and unrealistic even for a comic book character
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy was fantastic in this lots of action broken up by funny moments the carmotorcycle chase was well done the relationship between venom and eddie brock started off rocky but became a friendship that i want to see more of
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than critics give credit for
Oct 8 2018,negative,sony does not stop making comedy with characters that we grew up with and doesnt even make an effort to deliver what the public expects as a result i left with a big disappointment because im a venom fan and i know hes an evil sinister character and above all violent  thing that was lost after the movie went from being classified r rated to being pg13 and it left a lot to desire i personally would not go to see the sequel    tom hardy is a great actor and had been in great roles as bane in batmam or in dunkerque but in this movie he just does not stand out as expected 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont know why the score is low even though the movie is good  i love it its bruttal and funny at same time  sony never disapoint me for sound effect  it is because there is no spiderman read it the tittle dude its fuking venom on the tittle not spiderman
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was such a fun movie i laughed a lot at the jokes and enjoyed the events that unfolded the pacing was of course way too quick but what do you expect from a movie that has to introduce the main character give him a reason to do what he does and feel the way he feels and the give the antagonist the light they deserve i think its appropriate pacing honestly i loved it and really want to see it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is my venom venom has always been my comic book character and topher ruined it this is a total redemption i loved it they kept the die hard nerd in me happy and entertained me i loved the dynamic between venom and broch and i loved how venom looked my new favorite marvel movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is not a great film but it is entertaining as heck yes the villain is one not and the writing can be cheesy but tom hardys performance is amazing the interactions between eddy brock and venom are what makes this film if they make a second film and learn from this films short comings we may have comicbook movie genius
Oct 8 2018,positive,people who find this movie tonedeaf or this movie bad really needs help   give props to the creators of the film who literally made a movie this awesome without the usual protagonistspiderman  venom was very well written a little darker than most superhero movies but at the same time it isnt talking about a superhero but just a simple journalist wanting to expose a mad genius who tries to be god the interaction with the symbiote was hilarious and showed the audience how anyone would have reacted if some creepy alien liquid thing just starts talking to us inside our head the action scenes were also very good
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was not awful but certainly not great the writing was stiff and awkward though the premise was entertaining tom hardy did quite well especially considering the poor writing i would like to see more of venom but please do not let the same people write it
Oct 8 2018,positive,the negative reviews are highly exaggerated
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it  not sure why all the hate  tom hardy did a good job and the way venom was portrayed was flawless to the original comics i read when i was younger  i want to go see this in the theater again
Oct 8 2018,positive,it didnt need spiderman to be a great movie the venom character made the entire movie funny and action packed i believe i was pleasantly surprised multiple times throughout the movie it doesnt deserve nearly the level of negativity that critics have given it the world building of venom was something i never thought of growing up with the spiderman series but there have been so many spiderman movies and as far as the big screen in concerned the last time spiderman was involved the movie was just terrible i would go again and enjoyed the dynamic within the movie between eddie and venom would definitely go again and i just went about thirty minutes ago
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than thor 2 iron man 3 and ed nortons hulk bvs and justice league  on par with suicide squad wonder woman and man of steel    the first 30 minutes starts where the film life ends for 30 mins its a solid horror film straight out of night of the creeps they should consider sticking with that vibe in the sequelgoing a little darker will go a long way
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is good the problem is that people dosent seem to understand that this is a supeheroe movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,not that good yall have dumb people jeans
Oct 8 2018,positive,fairly solid movie   has nostalgic feels of the early 2000s spiderman movies which can be bad and formulaic at times but no where near the train wreck of fantastic four cgi is good not great and the story moves fast there are some great nods to the comics definitely worth seeing in theater
Oct 8 2018,positive,went not expecting much good movie not great but not hot trash like critics make it seem
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie despite ignoring a lot of the source
Oct 8 2018,negative,so i couldnt believe e that almost 90 of the audience really liked this movie or that the average viewer rating was 43 starsand i was right  i read the reviews of the audience members who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars and you dont  describe a movie as flawed ups and downs rough could have been better  cacophonous or even good unless your trying to skew the numbers none of the people who had issues should have given it more than 45 stars and most of these comments suggest closer to 3 or 35 stars
Oct 8 2018,positive,really good tom hardy was amazing in it
Oct 8 2018,negative,no consistent tone  poor casting namely michelle williams  venoms sudden switch to helping the human race was unmotivated and poorly done
Oct 8 2018,positive,tomator meter you are way wrong  this was a great movie  i loved all the funny lines
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a lifelong venom fan i was very happy with this depiction did the movie itself have some technical errors and classic tropes yes but as a whole seeing venom on the big screen and seeing how tom hardy played both roles was awesome i loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,alot of fun was it a oscar winner absolutely notbut definitely some good action and laughs even some jumpy scary movie moments as a venom fan as a kid this hit the right notes looking forward to the bigger better seque
Oct 8 2018,positive,this film was entertaining and i did not find myself checking the time waiting for it to end however i didnt find myself thinking about it for hours afterwards which i usually do when a film is fantastic it was enjoyable but slightly forgettable the special effects were all very adequate and the length of the film was perfect not too long tom hardy definitely was the best part of the entire film  this role fit him perfectly hardy was very good at acting ingenuous but very likable at the same time this film is not scary at all  the only thing that might be scary is venoms face so i dont recommend any kids under 8 years old
Oct 8 2018,positive,visually it was great i was on the fence with tom hardy but his brock really grew on me as the movie went on my biggest gripe with this movie is that tries for things it doesnt earn especially with the relationship between brock and venom venom sees himself in brock show us venom was a loser in his own world show us brock sees venoms redeemable qualities show us
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was great little silly at times but it was really fun to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie better than i expected tom hardy is badass
Oct 8 2018,positive,a portion of the audience who shows interest for these kind of movies grow a cinematic masterpiece expectation numb part of their minds are hard to accept this is a comics based antihero character that became very much relevant as is open your minds and accept it as a mild action movie with interesting content to make you watch the story for its full lenght
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was a great movie it had action and humor i would highly recommend
Oct 8 2018,positive,a great start cant wait for the next one
Oct 8 2018,positive,for starters i love superhero style movies i was a bit hesitant to see it since i heard a lot of not so great comments but i am glad that i stuck with my gut and went to see it anyways i absolutely loved this movie i found that it was entertaining funny and dark in all the right ways it was funny in a way that i personally didnt find cheesy and helped to lighten the story i thought going into the movie that i would hate venom what normally happens with villains in movies but surprisingly by the end of it i loved him and loved that they gave it a realistic and humanizing spin cant wait to see this movie again
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie ignore the critic reviews and go and enjoy this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved the movie perfect balance of storyline comedy and action would definitely see it again 
Oct 8 2018,positive,a great venom maybe a not so great movie but its fun enough plus we have tom hardy thats something that always make things better
Oct 8 2018,negative,with little to no character work and barely any meaningful action to support the plot venom has me conflicted this movie can be fun as long as you see it with the right people in the right mood the average viewer will enjoy this although a critic will see it as a mediocre action hero film if you think you will like it you will enjoy it
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie did a great job explaining how some symbiose reflect their host feel like these are going to be standalone movies no spiderman included
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was a very fun movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,ignore the critics and see the movie very good and entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,entertaining   and love tom hardy 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie i disliked the fact that they had to make it family friendly but i totally understand the need to garner a wider audience it would be a misstep if they make anything less than an rrated movie for the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,one of the best damn movies i have ever seen ever move over spider man you can go roll around like a turd in the wind venom is here
Oct 8 2018,negative,comedy for a 5 year old tom hardy has sold out with his gimmicky acting ive seen better cgi from a playstation 2 shit movie i wouldnt even rent it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was an amazing movie again another example where critics that know nothing about comics hate a movie made for fans go watch it to have fun yes its not the original story but for not being able to use spiderman they did an amazing job and to be honest this movie didnt need spiderman
Oct 8 2018,negative,its steel for a new generation
Oct 8 2018,positive,amaaaazing movie not sure what people are saying negative things for it exceeded my expectations definitely will be going to see it again because it was so good must see for all marvel fans and great action movie for those who dont like marvel not to mention tom hardy is a hottie great movie for all
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy is awesome as always and it was an original take on venom loved when venom was sinister and somewhat villainous nice
Oct 8 2018,positive,absolutely funny enough comic book reference and the endeding was quite wonderful a bunch of marve fans will get a good kick out of it
Oct 8 2018,positive,not a masterpiece but its worth the ticket   i love eddie and venom interactions
Oct 8 2018,positive,i came to see this movie with a very skeptic mindset however it slowly got me invested in the relationship between venom and eddie it was a great fun way to reimagine venom and eddie as good guys because all my life and our lives we know eddie as bad evil guys with no sense of morality this was fun to see yes the story was rushed and everything else could have been worked on a lot more but the villain was amazing and well acted he didnt seem like an evil bad guy to me at first ad we get to see his motive a little more than other villains we see that he has a purpose and had a good intention so to speak and it made his transition into an evil mastermind a lot more understandable and made his death very satisfying and eddie and venoms relationship is very very very well done like an old married couple totally didnt need spiderman in this film or world
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was the best movie ive seen since deadpool 2 it had just the right amount of comedy and action i would definitely suggest you see the movie it made me laugh and it made my night
Oct 8 2018,positive,a extremely fun action film thats all kinds of entertaining to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,very fun movie go and see if for yourself critic as usual expect mcu tier movies even the bad ones went in with low expectations was very amused and excited for a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,the first half of the movie went into setting up the character howeverthe second half  was amazing really loved venoms voice humor and action sequences
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont know what these rottentomatoes people were watching but this is one of the better movies ive seen in a while 5 stars cant wait for the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,first hour  1 star second hour after venom appears  5 stars  averages to 3 stars  venommovie is the new definitive 4dx movie superseding legobatmanmovie
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved this movie great action decent comedy good standalone to setup future sequels in the sony universe cant wait for venom 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,great film loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,honestly loved the movie it was funny and never was i ever uninterested
Oct 8 2018,positive,very enjoyable movie the critics are wrong its a rewatchable movie i would recommend to everyone that likes action and comic book inspired movies tom hardy always delivers 
Oct 8 2018,positive,overall an enjoyable movie with everything i came to see critics can be too critical at times and struggle to sit back and just enjoy what this movie is the movie is not perfect but it is exactly the movie i wanted it to be
Oct 8 2018,positive,a venom we dont want but a venom we deserve a non stop thrill ride
Oct 8 2018,positive,very entertaining movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,all these negative reviews are pretty bogus in my opinion if anyone has ever read the actual venom comics hardy portrays the character exactly how he is in the stories venom is always erratic in tone and how it is perceived he jumps from villan to hero multiple times within single stories hes savage and hilarious all at once he eats people and at the same time craves chocolate and tater tots in this film which i thought was great i mean what more do you want from this film he hit it right on as far as who venom is yes it could have had more story development material yes some of it was drawn out in a michael bay kind of transformers fight scene kind of way but you know what thats awesome to a lot of us in itself tom hardy you get my vote man i cracked up at a lot of points in this movie and enjoyed venoms character i for one really hope they push this forward with the scenes at the end forecasting carnages debut
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoy it i think tom did a wonderful job the movie had everything it was hilarious it had action and i really liked the storyline i think the actors did amazing i was like a kid again and it was a lot of fun ill definetly recommend it some people can try to take greatness down but it was so far more than worth my money loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved it yes it is very much super hero genre going for the action the laughs the goof ball moments and of course the love interest but i like it a lot and am already hoping for a 2nd venom movie with carnage as the main villain my one complaint and hopefully something that will be rectified for venom 2 it needs an r rating so that venom and more specifically carnage can let loose
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is so amazing everyone go watch it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i tend to never go by roten tomatoes ratings  venom was a great movie and i cant wait for the next one
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was a great movie from beginning to end i dont understand why it got so trashed by supposedly professional critics i guess that there is a community of people that has to trash a fun movie all of the time  my opinion top 5 in the mcu
Oct 8 2018,positive,im not sure what film the critics saw but i saw a fun spooky surprisingly funny genre movie with memorable action sequences and and an unexpectedly hilarious symbiote
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was okay  not the real venom story of spiderman comics but a reasonable interpretation of the lethal protector version of venom  i preferred upgrades action and story but this was decent and enjoyable if you enjoy superhero movies i appreciated the satire of the giant muscled monster fight turning into a splatter of goop tentacles
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesomeeeeeeee venom  tom hardy  we can do whatever we want
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was pretty good loved all symbiotes and venom was looking very good and the relationship between all symbiotes were on point but the fight was kinda rushed but that leaves just for a better sequel so it was a great movie indeed
Oct 8 2018,neutral,movie isnt has bad like movie critics want us to think not either good like some fans want us to think female character doesnt work at all to cheesy no real purpose having her and villain is weak
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was an okay start at what may turn out to be a thriving and eventful series rules of powers were often shaky and the chemistry between tom hardy and michelle williams was not there however the dynamic of venom inside eddie brocks head played out very well and i hope they dont sleep on that in the sequel overall a decent movie that can improve in the future
Oct 8 2018,positive,superb acting by tom hardy great specialized effects rather poor storytelling but occasionally good comedic dialogues definitely not family movies recommended to watch 710
Oct 8 2018,positive,its not the best comicbook movie but it is a fun to watch movie  venom was such a great representation  tom hardy did such a great job at interpretating eddy brook  i am trilled to see carnage in the next movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,forget the critics theyre routinely out of touch character development was awesome acting was great story was thoroughly enjoyable and made easy sense  for venom fans and nonfans alike go see this movie go we know youll love it
Oct 8 2018,negative,as a fan of the characters of venom and eddie brock i cant say i enjoyed their portrayal on the big screen as a movie goer the movie was okay at best with a weak supporting cast the villain was disappointing and the only characters i cared to see was eddie and venom i cant even remember the names of any of the other characters if that says anything i dont necessarily think it was the actors fault as much as it was just a weak script written by someone who didnt understand the characters themselves lastly i get that the movie is rated pg13 but with what they were attempting on big screen they really needed an r rating it worked for movies like deadpool and logan that understood that their audience could handle mature content and focused on making likable characters no matter how little screen time they got in the end if you enjoyed the movie then good on you but i just believe that it could have been executed so much better than it was and i think everybody deserves that
Oct 8 2018,positive,dark edgy and fun tom is great as always and the off kilt humor is right on its not a mcu film but not meant to be youll be torn between holding your breathe and belly laughing it out go see it
Oct 8 2018,positive,seems to be receiving a lot of negative feedback but i found the movie refreshing in comparison to the other marvel flicks the concept of the antihero as barely been explored and something i enjoyed
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was an amazing film to say the least it was thrilling during the fighting scenes and i loved the interactions between venom and eddie
Oct 8 2018,positive,i like the movie is a good one
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a hilarious mess i liked it
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was great made venom very likeable as a being not just as a villain
Oct 8 2018,positive,a solid movie some of the script was formulaic and some of the acting from the supporting cast was meh but overall it was refreshing to see an antihero movie about my favorite childhood character i liked it enough that i would purchase it when released for bluray
Oct 8 2018,negative,this was not venom at all they made a completly new charactor  sony should stop makin marel movies
Oct 8 2018,positive,it wasnt terrible and it wasnt great it did feel like the movie was a little rushed and to be honest the whole back story was a bit drawn out if sony did a better job at least sticking closer to the original back stories i dont think they would have an issue making a successful super hero movie that and i wish the would let tom hardy play more rough around the edges character even if you made him have better morals than your typical criminal i will say seeing venom was a bad arse experience and i would still recommend it regardless of the critics  so stop listening to rotten tomatoes thats what their critics are rotten
Oct 8 2018,positive,really good mix between humor action etc
Oct 8 2018,positive,not being able to  use spider man starts this movie with its arms tied behind its back somehow it succeeds
Oct 8 2018,neutral,better than i thought it would be
Oct 8 2018,positive,i cant wait for venom 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie would see again
Oct 8 2018,positive,excellent movie is a movie with different emotions i want to see one more time
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a lifelong spidey fan i was wholly surprised how well they did my favorite spiderman villian without the webhead in the comics brock is such a mess of a character due to different writers having varying perspective on who he is villian antihero antivillain but hardy captures the best parts of brocks lethal protector personality and distills the character to a well fleshed out coherent antihero venom brock and the symbiote combined are still the same violent slightly unhinged monster venom fans love but no longer is he a mess of queationable motivations and inconsistent ethics there is mention of brocks incident at the daily globe providing a possible history with spiderman down the road the pacing was a little too fast and the villain needed more time to develop but the acting was great and the action was a blast dont listen to the critics venom was a fantastic first foray into a venom universe
Oct 8 2018,positive,if i went by the so call experts ratings i would of missed a fun film i liked it a lot  710 i wish the villain was more charismatic and lead woman had more chemistry with eddievenom in venom 2 i would like recast except tom
Oct 8 2018,positive,i think venom was a funny movie but with still a good amount of action perfect actor to play eddie brock cant wait so the the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,i didnt had high expectation for this movie because of the average rating of tomatometer but i really liked it its different from alll the other movies of marvels and it brings us in another new world  i really enjoyed it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,added humor to the movie thought it was great just needed a little more action but was a great fun movie to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics would have a hard time finding their way out of a room with 4 doors  this movie was funny and had a lot of action
Oct 8 2018,positive,the critic system for rotten tomatoes is poor because the expert reviewers have to watch almost every movie whether they like what its about or not of course venom is not everyones taste and so the people who have a bias against it before they go in yet who   are forced to watch it are obviously going to give it a bad review the audience score is high because it is given by people who actually were interested in the movie before it came out i almost didnt see this movie because of the bad reviews im so glad i went to see it anyways its my favorite movie of all time
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie finally a venom movie is made  been waiting a long time  a favorite antihero of mine since i was a kid
Oct 8 2018,positive,not the best movie but definitely not as bad as the critics say the comedy was just right and other than the chaotic ending it was good still craving the cut 40 mins
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont care what other critics say this movie was pretty damn good
Oct 8 2018,positive,this film takes place in the ultimatelife foundation universe and it shows venom for everything that he is in this universe not a hero or a villain but more of an antihero
Oct 8 2018,positive,i feel this movie was funny unique and had an amazing story especially considering they werent allowed to use spiderman has a much better balance of humor action and plot than most marvel movies that more than double this movies score due to critic bias and marvel supersaturating the movie market
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is a nuanced performance from hardy evidently missed by much of  this sites critics  tom plays the loser with a conscience struggling with his own inner voice alongside of his parasitic friend as ever brilliantly   for me the only problem with this film is the territory it covered was too great for the time given and i would be interested to see what remained on the cutting room floor    too little time was also given to villian on venom encounters and character creation of supporting actors  my rating 63
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun and exciting movie tom hardys performance and his relationship with venom made this movie a great film to watch dont listen to the critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was great nuff said
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was very entertaining and tom hardy was great in the lead role i also thought it had just the right amount of humor
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics totally got it wrong  loved the action the fight scenes the graphics the humor tom hardy  did a great job as eddie brock and venom  ready to watch again
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont understand all the hate this movie is getting it by no means the greatest thing ive ever watched but was still really enjoyable and a lot of fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,way more than i expected thanks to the critics they give outstanding scores to movies that dont appeal to audiences concentrating on their own biased taste and feelings very entertaining movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved this movie dont know what film the critics watched but i found this to be hilarious  action packed  and just overall badass cant wait for the sequel 
Oct 8 2018,positive,good pace little fast but overall good film
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie good enemy funny good action ect
Oct 8 2018,positive,i greatly enjoyed the film
Oct 8 2018,positive,one of my favourite marvel movies needs to keep going and make a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie that entertains  i hate movies that take it self to seriously
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a hard line comic fan especially marvel comics i simply dont understand the ridiculous critic hate for this movie sure its not like the comics but it was still a fun movie will it win any awards  no  but if you want just a fun time with a superheroantihero movie then venom is a good choice
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie the fight scenes were pretty great the story line was kind of cliche but still very good characters 
Oct 8 2018,positive,doesnt deserve the critic hate strong cast interesting story and just plain fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,great tom hardy makes this film
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie dont listen to ctrtics
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing freaking movie f the critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,very enjoyable watch perfect lead acting from tom hardy whats not to like 
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was very entertaining and very fun to watch its a simple plot that was made to just entrain brock and venoms banter was excellent
Oct 8 2018,positive,a bit different origin of the symbiote the first part of the movie is a bit dragging action scenes a bit lacking for me in terms of excitement in general its an ok movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,many reviews i have seen are badin my opinion i disagree this movie was greatfunny and enjoyable i recommend this movie 100
Oct 8 2018,positive,in a story point if view it is a regular hero vs villan movie though venom is an antibiotic hero but the vfx and tom hardys undoubtedly humorous comedy with the dialogues of the film it is a feast to watch the association between eddy brock tom hardy and venom is an unusual and exciting relationship as seen by the audience however a similar association is seen in the movie upgrade of 2018 all in all venom is a good start for a new universe and possibly a last resort for the avengers
Oct 8 2018,positive,solid first real movie adaptation 8510  eddie brock develops as a character throughout the film tom hardy shows great range in his acting abilities     the villain is what keep this movie from recieving a higher score while he gets the job done he will he forgotten about easily especially after the end credits scene 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed it keep pumping em out ill keep watching new content is new content lol i
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom be roasting poor eddie but in my opinion dope ass movie hope they make second part 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really liked it well acted and a good plot the action and comedy combined worked really well
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy was awesome
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was dope even though i believe it had a lot of humor towards the character seeing venom with that side of humor along with him still carrying that scary effect to him it was great
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was spot on being loosely based on lethal protecor blood in the water it was very good to see it come alive into the venom we all know and love many people dont understand the story line seeing this is the first venom movie in general people are used to seeing him with spiderman hence why critic review was so bad venom has two storys and this one will most likely tie to venom as it should very great movie and  phenomenally depicted from the comic book
Oct 8 2018,positive,i had a good time watching this it sucks that they cut 40 minutes out but it didnt make it terrible for me this is not the greatest thing but i was entertained thats just my two cents
Oct 8 2018,positive,great film critics are wrong here
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a casual moviegoer i really enjoyed this movie the action was great the humour fantastic
Oct 8 2018,positive,it should of been more violent thats the only reason im giving it a 4 instead of a 5it dominated the box office in sales but the critic score is lowrotten tomatoes do betteri went it thinking it would be bad but it wasnt
Oct 8 2018,positive,don t listen to te critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,first off dont listen to the critics the movie was great  ive been a fan of venom and marvel in general since i was a kid in the 80s and i gotta say after the flop that was spider man 3 venom definitely delivered a better version of the character while its not on par with disney marvel the movie is a great watch tom hardy did the character justice and the banter between the two is very entertaining this is a movie that i will be watching again at the theater and will be owning on blu ray
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed it  it was a great movie  they should definitely make a part 2 just make sure to make it more rated r  really display the gruesome character of venom 
Oct 8 2018,positive,the tomato critics have no taste 1010
Oct 8 2018,positive,can i see where the movie might have benefited from the r rating yes does it ruin the movie no it was a fun intro to the character and the movie was entertaining i would see it
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics must have been watching spiderman 3
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoy it very much tons of action loved the interaction between venom and ediie great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,of course it had its small faults but overall it is a great movie  good acting and good humor i wish i could have seen it before it was disneyfied and made pg13 despite that crutch it is still a great movie to see in theaters maybe its time to remove the critics scoring area they simply pander to what they think the masses what and not what the masses feel
Oct 8 2018,positive,this film amazing  i absolutely didt regret that i went we had a great time watching this movie acting game specifics  no words only emotions one nuances  we want more thnx for this emotion
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is a fun movie to watch tom hardy was very good but maybe there was too much of him and not enough of anyone else the final fight scene was dribble but overall was enjoyable not optomistic about the sequal tho as this story was bang average
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was very enjoyable the only gripe i have is the limited development of the villain ill leave his name out it to spoil it if you like superhero movies you wont be disappointed
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie nice comedy and entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,im still amazed by the movie i admit i had the fear that its was goin to disappoint  but it was perfect the kid in me is happy the adult is pleased  for me it was a solid 1010  perfect retelling of venom without spidey first  for me it made it more interesting  and i really bonded heh with the characters  got that goodie feelin in mah belly the whole movie  dont understand the low scores but i do try to respect nonhating low reviews  it is my favorite movie of 2018 so far  but like i said respectin opinions hereim still amazed by the movie i admit i had the fear that its was goin to disappoint  but it was perfect the kid in me is happy the adult is pleased  for me it was a solid 1010  perfect retelling of venom without spidey first  for me it made it more interesting  and i really bonded heh with the characters  got that goodie feelin in mah belly the whole movie  dont understand the low scores but i do try to respect nonhating low reviews  it is my favorite movie of 2018 so far  but like i said respectin opinions here
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a fun film 
Oct 8 2018,positive,not as bad as the critics say is
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was actually really enjoyable and hardy had a great performance
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics must have been drunk the movie is awesome
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was surprisingly funny really glad its not part of the mcu and spiderman because he would just be a cookie cutter marvel civilian this movie went by really fast finally not a 3 hour movie with too many story lines nor that comicbook space jargon
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics were wrong fun film loved tom hardy and venom itself was awesome
Oct 8 2018,neutral,please do not listen to all the fans who claim to love this film they know noting about the character or his universe ultimately the film was just decent enough to be mediocre as many aspects of the film including its acting and special effects were subpar the only thing this film has going for it that its better than most dceu films so i guess in this case you can still make mine marvel
Oct 8 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyable sure its all over the place regarding tone but venom is a mess of a character tom hardy nails it talking to himself eating tatertots and chocolate to avoid biting peoples heads off it fits perfectly if you are a comic book purist youre asking where spider man isbut as far as general entertainment valueexcellent fun 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved this movie all i wish was that there was more fight scenes for venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,surprisingly good would i like to have seen a tiein to the spiderverse sure but it stands alone as a decent movie with sequel potential
Oct 8 2018,positive,i believe that they could have done better on this film like make it r rated or make me care for the characters but the movie was definitely good i thought the violence was great and well worth my time it was to predictable though 
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie is great for what it is enjoyed the film and eddie and venoms relationship is funny
Oct 8 2018,positive,this could be the best spider spin off made by sony pretty interesting
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is good old fashioned fun a lot of action with some quality comedy mixed in tom hardy is outstanding as eddie brock venom himself is funny and wild awesome movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,yeah a lot of things dont really add up and the story isnt the best but i must admit i really enjoyed it for what it was a kick ass superhero flick was worth the viewing
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie as did my family  i cant wait for number 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing movie critics are crazy for scoring this so badly
Oct 8 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie tom hardy is my new favorite actor
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing movie loved venoms voice got to take my son which was great
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie is way underrated beginning is slow but the middle and end make up for it it is a must see
Oct 8 2018,negative,dull boring bad story and murky colors
Oct 8 2018,positive,just saw it and it was nowhere near as bad as some of these critics were trying to say it was tom hardys performance as the titular venom eddie brock mirrors what most of our reactions would be to having an alien creature inside of us my problem stems from this though venom was supposed to be a dark gritty movie but ended up feeling like your typical mcu flick though the action was solid there was no real grit to it there was none of the rratedness that the character deserved major disappointment there but if youre looking for a good time definitley check it out
Oct 8 2018,positive,very good movie had a classic sam raimi spiderman vibe to it
Oct 8 2018,positive,not the best but not bad the cgi while muddy in parts was spot on to the comic hardy seemed to phone in on parts but most of the acting besides him was decent the villain went from visionary to psychopath with any real arc to get him there most of the motivations in this movie are questionable but the pacing was good and the action was exciting overall it was an entertaining homage to the comic 
Oct 8 2018,positive,the  critics dont know what theyre talking about
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie venom representation is on point and tom hardy is a great eddy brock
Oct 8 2018,positive,much better than anticipated thoroughly enjoyed it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i love the movie  i went to cinema to see venom and brock  and i was very pleased dont believe the reviews 
Oct 8 2018,positive,other than being a little too fast paced 2030 min longer bet wouldve been better it was pretty good not avengers good but i was very entertained would love to see a deadpool partnership
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie liked everything about it
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is way better than critics say its funny has great action and the story is pretty good i will give them that the villain isnt the best but still a really solid movie will definitely go watch it a couple more times
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy was amazing in venom my 12year old daughter and 9yearold son love venom more than spiderman now great action and special effects stay to the very end
Oct 8 2018,positive,i had a great time watching this movie the overall comedy with tom hardy and venom was great although i wish they streched the story out through multiple days
Oct 8 2018,positive,tons of fun tom hardy fits the role so well and the humour was great only thing that would love is an r rating
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was funny and intersting
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was great funny and entertaining only complaint is they skipped the later part of the movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are being way too hard on this movie tom hardy is awesome as always and knocks it out of the park in this cant wait to see more of him in this role
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is kind of a run of a mill comic book movie  the symbiotes were the most interesting part of the movie and venom supplied some unexpected humor  michelle williams played a role any female actress could have filled and hardy was just adequate and i dont see him as having the star quality to carry a movie  the evil millenial villian was just meh  the movie was just entertaining enough to pass the time
Oct 8 2018,positive,i had my reservations about this one but i actually really enjoyed venom the ending fight scene felt slightly rushed and there were some bits that seemed unnecessary however i am very interested to see the follow up
Oct 8 2018,positive,i can see why critics may not have liked it it seemed a bit rushed and goofy but it was good and strangely i didnt mind it at all
Oct 8 2018,positive,pretty frickin neato boss i dont understand why critics keep calling it a turd
Oct 8 2018,positive,i saw this movie i loved it  i dont understand why this still has 30 critic views but 89 of audience loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i like bed venom tom hardy is amazingly funny and i really  liked the fact that he wasnt a pretty boy hero i loved that he was scared i went into this movie vie expecting so little because of the reviews and so i was pleasantly surprised by how much fun i had 4 stars
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was a fun ride it felt more like a buddy cop adventure than a traditional superhero movie but i would recommend you check it out
Oct 8 2018,positive,its quite entertaining i enjoyed it
Oct 8 2018,positive,reading what these movie critics and im going to use that term loosely had to say about this film made me question whether i would go and see venom however im glad i did tom hardy is a sensational eddie brock and even tho many said the chi was to heavy i myself did not notice it tom hardys performance of venom is like a subtle wade wilson unlinke ryan reynolds he does not rely on loud witty remarks but his onliners make every seen enjoyable
Oct 8 2018,positive,not your normal superhero movie funny action and a story line good characters and a good description of the relationship between host and symbionte cleverer jokes than deadpool   good movie gonna watch it a second time
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie i wanted to see a bit more of carnage but still a great movie ps movie is better if you really like venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie tom hardy was good 
Oct 8 2018,positive,was good super hero movie hold over
Oct 8 2018,positive,there were some ups and downs but overall its a very entertaining movie it makes me want to watch it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a great movie the story is also great and you should see it
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved the movie very entertaining and tom hardy did a great job
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was great i loved it i loved the interaction between venom and eddie the character venom himself  looked great
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie does a lot have pacing problems some of the jokes can fall flat and the supporting cast doesnt bring much regardless of its negative critical reviews this movie is enjoyable the eddie brock and venom chemistry really works well and makes it really enjoyable when you see them both on screen the pacing of the movie really hold it back from it becoming more enjoyable to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to critics its great
Oct 8 2018,positive,most critics are saying that this is a bad movie but for me as an audience i think that the movie was funny entertaining and the acting was good especially tom hardy to conclude you will enjoy seeing it
Oct 8 2018,positive,sony  go for the r rating next time while the direction is is lighttouch on storytelling and making impactful moments its still a fun ride with great performances from tom hardy jenny slate and riz ahmed plus venom looks real cool 
Oct 8 2018,positive,so bad its good  a good description  the movie does not take itself too seriously and the only real point of contention for me was the blazing quick action sequences  otherwise i was grinning from beginning to end
Oct 8 2018,positive,i just came back from watching venom and its really good the movie is different from the original story but keeps the same idea of the original story the movie has a lot of good jokes and thankfully venom is not shown for just 5 minutesbtw i watched in real 3d    i just came back from watching venom and its really good the movie is different from the original story but keeps the same idea of the original story the movie has a lot of good jokes and thankfully venom is not shown for just 5 minutesbtw i watched in real 3d        after credits carnige if you kno what i mean 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed it it took a while to start but when seeing venom on the screen was pretty cool
Oct 8 2018,positive,i will admit that the plot was very rushed and a lot seemed forced but the cgi was amazing the humor was very effective and welltimed and although i think that there were a couple problems castingwise riz ahmed gave a spectacular performance as carlton drake
Oct 8 2018,positive,im gonna be honest i dont know where all the hate for this movie is coming from to me this was a perfectly acceptable movie thats getting bashed for relatively minor things    the action scenes were great the comedy was actually golden the acting was actually very good and it was overall a great time spent at the theater i understand that it has its flaws and all but i think that the good in the movie heavily outweighs the bad     movies are meant to entertain correct so if you come out entertained then isnt that a job well done not every movie has to be a master piece just like how everything doesnt need to be a fun movie thats just what venom is a fun time at the theater could it have been better yes but did it really need to be when we have so many great superhero movies on the horizon i dont think so    i enjoyed venom immensely i know a lot of other who also enjoyed it like i did and after watching it i cant help but feel that a lot of people are being unfair to it
Oct 8 2018,positive,needed that r rating and blood
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie its quite dark darker than any of the other marvel movies until dark pheonix comes is released in 2019 yes there were a couple of corny scenes but who doesnt like a bit of corn every once in a while movies like this should be about suspense borderline scares and a couple of laughs forget the critics   apparently tom hardy signed up for a 3movie deal so we have more venom movies to look forward to and hopefully each one will be better than the last    oh yeah dont forget to stick around for the two after credit clips 
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy was perfect for the role was delightfully surprised at how well he played the titular character venom which made it totally entertaining and believable dont bother with the critics reviews somethings not right when theres such a big gap between the critics and audiences reviews had a lot of fun watching it dont miss it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,of course the film has its downsides but me and my three friends who went to see it loved it it was funny tom hardy was great as eddie brock and the relationship between him and venom was great to see on screen
Oct 8 2018,positive,a mixed bag yes some jokes land some dont some good cgi some bad some cameos are great others are goofy its clear this movie has divided audiences but its simply a film you need to let your own sensibilities process judge for yourself but i believe its worth a viewing as much as i desist sonys film department this is not catwoman
Oct 8 2018,positive,i liked it a lot dont know what critics are complaining about want to watch it again
Oct 8 2018,negative,the main villain comes off as cartoonish and onedimensional  actual venom is cool but comes fully formed way too late  the final showdown is shot horribly so you cant understand whats going on
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it could have been better but still a great time
Oct 8 2018,positive,the cgi is very good the acting is good the action scenes are good and the jokes made me laugh the antagonist is bad there are some plot holes and the post credits scene is bad but i liked it
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing funny and all around good movie 90s esque
Oct 8 2018,positive,why do people hate it its a good movie haters venom lacks violence yet action and i love it
Oct 8 2018,positive,the film is flawed but its the right kind of flawed in my opinion i enjoyed the visuals and the action the humor while ridiculous worked for me i really dont get the hate this film is getting
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics have no idea this movie was great start to finish it perfectly explains the characters and the development was great best it could have been without spiderman even my wife who hates these movies enjoyed it i hope the critics dont kill this franchise
Oct 8 2018,positive,really good move solid 8 out of 10 it also broke the record at 80million dollars from the box office next one will be even better as they left it open for another at the end
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is not as good as i expected it to be but this is not a bad start i hope next time it will be rated r
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont know why the critics are rating this movie so low its a great movie so stfu
Oct 8 2018,positive,wtf is wrong with critics these days this is a fun film its entertainment at its best stupendous action sequences venom and eddie are awesome go see this film if you want to have a blast time flies and you are never bored
Oct 8 2018,positive,100 great movie going to see it again cant  wait for part 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,lemme tell you this now if it werent already obvious there are tons of comic nerds who had doubts over the new venom movie that it wouldnt be good because of a lack of spiderman that it rearranged his their origin story lets not forget the prerelease critics who said it was awful    well in a character enthusiasts humble opinion well theyre wrong venom 2018 was amazing    the first ever good big screen adaptation of venom and eddie brock    it touched subtly but incredibly on venoms status as an outsider amongst his own species    brock went from being a mostly one track antagonist to an updatedforthetimes reporter while still being the idiotthrownintoabadsituation type we all love    do youdid you like comics where the venom symbiote wasis increasingly talkative and smartassey to eddie well my dude this movie is for you i love it    remember watch the movie like youd read a comic book tones will change there will be a few cheesy lines in otherwise serious scenes and dont expect every plot point to be neatly wrapped up theyre prepping for a series fam and im diggin it 200    to summarize venom despite the subtraction of spiderman in his origincreation storys was absolutely amazing the casting was perfect the cameos unexpected and a morethansatisfying amount of violence for a pg13 film    95 outta 10 5 cause no peterboi if you havent seen it set some time aside and bless your eyes with it
Oct 8 2018,positive,reviewers got this movie so wrong it had its flaws but it was such an enjoyable experience
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was interesting and i would like to see it again and the post credit scene excites me for venom 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved the movie and how much they got away with showingsaying in it for a pg13 film my only complaint would be that the chase scenes audio was loud but despite that it was a good movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are bought out shills this movie was actually very enjoyable sure there could have been a little more detail in areas the action was excellent and it had just enough humor put in its not comic book accurate but i can look past that they adapted a decent story either way i feel bad for everyone who worked hard on this movie only to be put down by these awful critics this is a 45 for me but will give it 5 just to offset the negative bots out there
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is awesome 3 cute and funny theres a story there and action tom hardy rock
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing movie also has very fun moments i would rate 55 if it werent for a few parts of the plot that werent fully developed but those parts are easy to ignore other than that it is a mustwatch movie with many enjoyable scenes overall great movie i really enjoyed it
Oct 8 2018,positive,honestly idk why critics hate this movie the cgi for venom is great the acting is pretty good but not great very funny and entertaining definitely worth seeing overall screw critics audience is right
Oct 8 2018,negative,i really hated this movie 110 for me honestly i would much rather watch the amazing spiderman 2 again and i hate that movie the plot of this film was like a bad tv pilot the film was just 2 hours of cringe  how are venom fans not disappointed by this film it doesnt do justice toward the character because its bodged down with some of the most lazy writing i have ever seen  i usually disagree with the critics toward superhero movies but this time i have to side with them my friends and i made fun of this piece of shit during and after the movie this film also wouldve benefited a tiny bit with an r rating but a complete rewrite of the film would have helped it the most the editing was really choppy and the first 15 minutes are embarrassing as hell its one of the worst superhero films ive ever watched i wasnt even expecting much and i was disappointed i really regret seeing this in theaters because the more money this makes the more sony is going to put out garbage content like this heck i saw this on a matinee and i feel cheated i could have bought a 5 bluray and watched something good with my friends i could have rented a movie for 3 and bought off brand soda but i made a bad decision by going to this film and handing the man on the counter 5 im never gonna see my money again because venom consumed it and my stupid brain let it happen
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie would recommend i love the jokes and silly scenes i just feel like thats how a comic book movie should be
Oct 8 2018,positive,was a good movie for me it just needed like 29 more minutes to it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,despite the movie having some obvious issues like the tone of the movie the bad script the generic villain a short final battle and some bad acting venom had some upsides too tom hardys acting was fantastic and i really enjoyed how the venom and eddie relationship was handled the two post credit scenes were worth the wait and the comedy in the movie was good the movie wasnt anything special but its worth a watch if you  have an open mind and dont care much for plot
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont know what you guys are talking about it was a great actioncomedy also seriously chaotic and noisy have you never read a venom comic book
Oct 8 2018,positive,love it super fun and nice action
Oct 8 2018,positive,it has a few rough edges but overall the movie is quite entertaining and i for one am looking forward to a sequel  crossing my fingers for eventually seeing a spiderman crossover 
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was a lot better than i expected considering all the bad reviews from critics funny thing is that all the average normal people seem to love it surprise surprise definitely not the first time critics and rt hated something but all of us plebs actually loved it its just a movie people and it was fun the only thing i had a problem with is that some of the cgi could have been better
Oct 8 2018,positive,went in with very low expectations since it was a spiderman villain usually without spiderman i am pleased to say that i loved it its in no way a perfect movie there were many plotholes and underdeveloped characters but the good vastly outweighed the bad for me bad typically being when sony tried to play it safe
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it and i am quite impressed because the critic score kind of shocked me but i guess sometimes the critics arent always accurate with their opinions however there is quite a bit of shaky cam and sometimes a hazy grain over the screen but maybe it was supposed to add to the effect i dont really know
Oct 8 2018,positive,to get right to the meat of the issue i think many people were expecting more spiderman and to really give this movie a fair chance you have to be into the character of venom i thought this movie was great and represented both brock and the venom symbiote fantastically if you genuinely like the character venom and dont really need spiderman to validate your presence in the theater you will love this movie four stars
Oct 8 2018,positive,i needed a venom movie it was so great for a first film the story was easy to follow and i got attached to all of the characters
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie with a good dose of comedy
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont care about what people say about this movie but this is the greatest film ive ever seen in my life
Oct 8 2018,positive,surprisingly pleased
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film it had a lot of good action scenes and it was funny when it needed to be and the trailers did not give away very much of the plot overall i think it was a good film
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is great movie and please dont read what the critics have to say not sure what they been smoking 
Oct 8 2018,positive,overall i enjoyed this movie immensely my only two issues are some of the fight scenes and the trailers     during some of the fight scenes it felt like sony didnt really want us to see venom one seen is quickly shrouded with smoke and another is a fast pace blur and gci on gci gooeyness    the trailers are garbage and all they did was reaffirm the idea that i would not see this movie willingly how ever my wife wanted to see it so we went and it was far far better then the trailers lead me to believe     i believe the sole purpose of the trailer was to reduce expectations of the film dramatically just so it starts at the bottom and can only go up from there     aside from the 2 missteps i think the movie was enjoyable fun and well worth a watch or two certainly believe this movie will probably only get better with the intake of alcohol as well
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to idiot critics such a good movie so fun hi
Oct 8 2018,positive,pretty good introduction to the venom character didnt do too much as to confuse but showcased the great interactions between eddie brock and venom with some great comedic lines hardy done a great job and the end credits only left me excited for whats coming next
Oct 8 2018,positive,i was entertained tom hardy was great dont let professional reviews dissuade you
Oct 8 2018,positive,an absolutely enjoyable film it definitely showed signs of a restricted budget but the cast were good and editing was a hallmark i cant wait for an extended cut to see more of the film
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont know why all the critics have to be so harsh on this movie i thought this was great
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is nowhere near perfect but it still pulls off being entertaining the movie has an almost 2007 bayformers feel as in while the story is definitely lacking in areas it still contains that sense of wonder that keeps you interested in these creatures
Oct 8 2018,positive,i love venom and i watched the movie   my point of view venom is a good movie 
Oct 8 2018,positive,the critics must be high this movie is soooooooo goooood
Oct 8 2018,positive,i had wannit gurobut   venom is dark i love venom but in movie 
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was much better than the critics would have you believe while not perfect and kind of slow moving in parts i found it to be more than watchable its not a completely fleshed out plot but for the first in what is hopefully three movies it was really good
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is a lot of fun and  it really is a better representation of venom then the one in spiderman 3 although there are some flaws the movie is a great experience
Oct 8 2018,positive,very good movie the critics were way wrong on this surprisingly funny and has lots of action in it venom is a mix of hulk and spiderman this movie is by far better than any spiderman movie its a must see  if you like marvel movies it strays far away from the comicbook but is very good
Oct 8 2018,positive,excellent movie dont know what the critics are talking about 2 adults and 3 kids loved it venom has a great personality
Oct 8 2018,positive,an original story a must see movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it would of been better with the normal story with spiderman but if you think of the multiverse the movie in a whole was actually pretty good
Oct 8 2018,positive,it has issues yes but it was entertaining nontheless
Oct 8 2018,positive,im not much of a movie critic but this movie was very entertaining
Oct 8 2018,neutral,definitely not a on par marvel movie because to me its not the traditional superhero narrative the character venom is eventually an antagonist to parker in the comics and the eddievenom relationship thrives from the combined hatred of spiderman so to adapt a standalone movie where you have a antihero lead thats an ugly alien monster you have to switch up a little of the tone and themes of a superhero movie personally when i go to see the avengers or antman and the wasp i want to feel like theres a challenge to over come a conflict between pure good and evil with the venom movie it was fun to still be rooting for the main character and still seeing him bite peoples heads off i was mostly excited to see the type of fight scenes and action they would pack into this movie and it definitely surpassed my expectations choreography design even down to the fact it took so long to see venom in full form it made me appreciate the movie more i feel like the movie did fall flat at parts especially with dialogue but i never was bored or knew what was next the narrative kinda went haywire as soon as eddie linked up with the science chick i feel in this day in age many critics try to pick and pull apart a superhero movie but much like a comic book theyre telling stories that are not in the norm comics were visual masterpieces that focused more on the action and abilities of characters yes there are beautiful stories told by comics but honesty when i go to the movies to see a superhero movie i wanna have a good combination of action and suspense and storytelling also character development is important in protagonists of course the venom movie did a good job from the opening scene with the musical score dark and suspenseful but still cool and grungeish thats why i like the venom character this monster who also has a human counterpart that is just doing its own thing theres no killed parents or great power and responsibility lectures its tom hardy being a good actor over a meh script with amazing visuals theres conflict resolution satisfaction and a whole lot of coolness 810 is my rating just like the backwood i smoked before seeing it   totoe out
Oct 8 2018,positive,slow in the begging but picks up in the second quarter fun movie over all would see again and will buy on blue ray
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it stayed true to the comic character
Oct 8 2018,positive,despite what people say about this movie i actually thoroughly enjoyed it ive wanted a dedicated venom movie for a long time now and this has done an admirable job at being that movie it has some flaws here and there like a forgettable soundtrack and an ending that felt rather rushed but for what it is i genuinely felt it was worth my money to see it hopefully this doesnt mess up the carnage sequel teased at the end spoiler as im not majorly looking forward to hearing about that too go see this for yourself and you be the judge dont let other peoples opinions make yours
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was an amazing fresh new take on the chaeacter it was a great movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,the movie that i saw venom for my review that was a lousiest marvel movie that i ever seen no humor nothing exciting and devouring on humans that is not natural i hate to say it this movie is off my list to collect marvel movies
Oct 8 2018,positive,well done tom hardy great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,i liked it over all there is a bright future if they go with a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,really fun movie it has its flaws but i dont see a reason for it to be recieving 30 all in all i really liked it really hoping for a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved the movie alot fun only wish would been to bit longer and not so many cuts to the movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,its a tonal mess and the lack of an r rating did not help it any
Oct 8 2018,neutral,mindless entertainment with a very inconsistent tone and it felt like i was watching something made in the mid 2000s watch upgrade instead
Oct 8 2018,positive,good film very entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,my expectations were low but when i saw the chatter on twitter that the film was better than expected i decided to hold my nose it was worth it in an era of so many bloated and overcomplicated superhero films venom is a nice breath if fresh air it doesnt waste time with the original story and is essentially nonstop action with humorous bits i dont lunch out loud often but this movie managed to get at the least two public chuckles from me good work     this proves that the dynamic characters in the spiderverse dont necessarily need spiderman or other heroes as an anchor and i say that as a lifelong spider fan i wholly welcome the inevitable venomverse and all of the fanboy handwringing that comes with it
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was interesting in seeing how venom could be a main character without spiderman to me personally i enjoyed the film it was fun to see the bond of eddie brock and venom  the film was rushed and seemed short but was a good watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,we thought this was a great movie  dont listen to the critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,not so original storyline but great performance by tom hardy very funny and entertaining to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,hardy is a super actor great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,starts slow but gets way better
Oct 8 2018,positive,a very enjoyable flick but the final sequence is a bit of a cgi mess the back an fourths between venom and eddie are exceedingly entertaining and the villain though generic is fine he has more personality than lots of other villains of superhero films and gets even more menacing when riot is paired with him the movie does feel butchered however to reach a wider audience in america but an extended home cut should be released fixing that also it is too tame for a 15 rating in the uk it seemed a waste the story is an interesting premise but the darker subplots seem to dissappear too fast overall its certainly no dark knight but its worth a watch for fans of the character and in my opinion it is suitable for younger audiences and families
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie  it is choppy but overall a good time  you could wait on this one
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved this movie from start to finish the critics are idiots and proof that critical reviews should not be relied upon
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie is really good
Oct 8 2018,positive,this has been the movie fans have been waiting for do yourself a favor and ignore the critics how i see it this was a movie made for fans not critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved venom and hardys relationship
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont take any movie review from any critic on this this movie was enjoyable from start to finish it had just the right amount of back story once the action got going it kicked into high gear and never disappointed there were great references and nods to some of the venom story lines in comics and really did a great job of balancing action drama and comedy it resembles the same formula as thos ragnorok and didnt  disappoint its totally worth seeing we even received special edition comics given out just before the showing of the movie its movies like this that make me love my amc theaters red carpet membership
Oct 8 2018,positive,really fun movie with funny moments and engaging action dont believe what the critics say guarantee youll enjoy it
Oct 8 2018,negative,hardy and company do good work in this film but the script and its goofy attempts at humor fail them with all connections to spiderman erased and altered originsmotivations for its main character fans of the comics might feel like this is venom in name alone
Oct 8 2018,positive,fuck the critics movie was awesome
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,a very good movie altogether
Oct 8 2018,positive,yes it started a bit slow and hit all the cliches but in the end it turned out to be highly enjoyable
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved it im not a hard core comic guy but i do know my way around venoms story although this movie was a interesting adaptation to the comics i still would strongly recommend it i feel that the producers and writers did their best with what they had available to work with considering the sonys limitations on the character
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is pure comic book fun tom hardy sells the absurdity of the character so well that the entire world of venom feels distinctive and a refreshing departure from the homogenized comic book movies weve been getting from disneymarvel for the past decade nothing about this movie feels like it was made to please the lowest common denominator
Oct 8 2018,negative,it wasnt a steaming pile of crap close but not quite  the big problem is that apparently nobody who worked on this movie has any understanding of the character eddie brock is a jealous spiteful jerk but not in the movie venom looks upon our world as a combo farmplayground but not in the movie the movie should have been gritty and bloody but it wasnt
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was awesome for comic book lovers   very well down
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was awesome and venom was wicked the critics were way off on this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy is as brilliant as ever this movie was an obvious first movie to numerous movies with its cast venom was very entertaining  cant wait for the sequel which will likely be crazier than the first
Oct 8 2018,positive,no where near as bad as the critics are making it out to be in my opinion the actors are great especially tom hardy as eddie brockvenom and the fight scenes are pretty well done the tone was a bit inconsistent sometimes being quite dark and violent and other times being more lighthearted and fun but overall was a pretty fun and enjoyable movie definitely worth a watch if youre not marveld out yet
Oct 8 2018,positive,personally i enjoyed this film i can understand certain points of these so called  film critics but i think theyre a little too harsh to have an overall score of 30 or whatever it is doesnt do the movie any justice tom hardy was great at eddie brock the relationship between brock and venom is awesome im very excited about the future of this character and how theyre going to move forward with the introduction of other popular comic book characters as well this movie is worth the watch hopefully one day we get to see venom v spidermanthen the critics ratings will be much higher because im pretty sure thats the main part of what was missing for them i would go to the theatre and watch this again 
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie delivers on everything i expected and moreit is venom from the comics with a slight twist1010 would watch again
Oct 8 2018,positive,one of the greatest film of 2018 period
Oct 8 2018,positive,a lot better then i thought it would be  loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,funnyadventurous and a break from serious superhero movies its good watch wort it
Oct 8 2018,negative,i personally am very disappointed while venom looks like venom this should have been an r rating it doesnt capture the character too well and instead tries to add humor to a character that has little to laugh with
Oct 8 2018,positive,great film i dont understand why it got such bad reviews i really liked the way tom hardy portrays eddie brock excellent choice for actor
Oct 8 2018,positive,aweosme movie lots of action ans thankfully not full of cursing and sex scenes so great for kids
Oct 8 2018,positive,could of used an r rating would be cool to see spiderman crossover but for what it is the movie is excellent comedic and tom hardy is phenominal
Oct 8 2018,neutral,predictable plot but still an ok movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was super fun amazing better then infinity war btw my parents loved the movie too i went to see the movie on my birthday and wasnt dissapointed
Oct 8 2018,positive,even though upgrade did a better job with this concept that doesnt mean that the film isnt enjoyable in fact it was very funny on most instances
Oct 8 2018,positive,so funny and entertaining cast is amazing excellent and acting badass stunts and incredible special effects i laughed i cried i was on the edge of my seat
Oct 8 2018,positive,i went into the movie with no predetermined thoughts of what it should be or shouldnt be  hoping for an entertaining movie and that was delivered  there was decent action and humor  it left me wanting to see it again after i left and that doesnt happen too often  if you go in expecting to see things or how the character should be or shouldnt be you might be a little disappointed  but if you leave that all at the door and just go to enjoy a movie you will be glad you did
Oct 8 2018,positive,good action good acting funny oneliners and great animaton going to ser ut again for sure
Oct 8 2018,positive,would have liked to see more of the story focus on the symbiotes origins but overall good antihero movie  interestingly the romantic interest didnt seem to slow it down as some action movies are susceptible to
Oct 8 2018,positive,hilarious the critics suck i love this film next time around when it comes to the next movie is where ill be more critical you cant do as funny as this one with a character like carnage
Oct 8 2018,positive,i watched it in 3d definitely worth it very impressed by how eddie and venoms bond strengthens throughout the movie easy 5 stars
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are stupid they probably dont know anything about venom they just want to see venom to be with spider man stupid critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,great acion  great for casualy waching with friends
Oct 8 2018,positive,went in with low expectations and came out impressed only thing i didnt enjoy was parts of the end
Oct 8 2018,positive,a flawed but fun superhero antihero origin story with a lackluster conclusion tom hardys eddie brock and the venom symbiote have a fun to watch buddy cop dynamic that keeps you invested throughout
Oct 8 2018,positive,everything youd want in a a venom movie amazing graphics too
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie should be r not pg13 but its very fun i enyoy it
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it ive been waiting for this movie since before it was was even announced and tom hardy definitely didnt disappoint
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a fun time but would be way better with a r rating
Oct 8 2018,positive,not a movie for anyone who thinks they can only love or hate a thing it was a fine movie with a decent plot started out slow had a couple lines of dialogue that fell flat and a few that nailed it overall it was a solid movie definitely better than its currentl 31 score imo
Oct 8 2018,positive,a fun streamlined movie without the fluff that surrounds most film these days
Oct 8 2018,positive,was this the best and most exciting super antihero movie no was it gory and twisted as deadpool no was it enjoyable and worthy of being added to the marvel universe yes there is so much potential here that can still be explored and it is a lot of fun to watch this is not i repeat not a horror flick by any stretch of the imagination keeping it a pg 13 movie was smart for only one reason integrating with marvel for future movies no spiderman references and there didnt need to be
Oct 8 2018,positive,really enjoyed it a great popcorn flick
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was fun yes it veers very far from the actual story but the action scenes more than make up for it so much better than what the critics are saying see it in theatre
Oct 8 2018,positive,not sure what movie the critics are talking about this was fantastic although did take a lil long to get rolling  but far exceeded my expectations and didnt leave the super hero hangoverloved venoms side of the personality too
Oct 8 2018,positive,such a fun movie to watch i really loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,everything was solid i just think that it would be nice if they had flushed out venoms motivations more this is something that could easily be covered by a squeal
Oct 8 2018,positive,an absolute blast tom hardy is perfect for the role of eddie brock and brings to life a fresh take on venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,i saw this movie over the weekend and after hearing they dropped it to pg13 i was a little worried as to how it ended up with 40min of movie cut out turns out it was much better than i expected i was afraid they wouldve made it much more of a childrens movie than anything else but they had some more adult themes throughout the movie that kept me hooked venom is much better than i expected it to be
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun action packed and just all around well done  not sure why the critics hated it but dont really care
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was good i thought the acting was good not what the critics are saying cgi was good the whole movie in my opinion i think the movie will be ok for kids not to spoil but there are some parts where he bites heads off or eats people but it hardly shows it so your choice if you want to take your kids all in all awesome movie worth a watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,how does antman and wasp have 88 its super boring by the way and venom gets a rotten rating sorry flip it the other way around which is what the audience score is venoms plot is dumb has massive holes a kindergartener could have written more coherent scifi script his love interest is a cringe the bad guy is a cringe but tom hardy and the portrayal of venom in this particular move are the best period i barfed when i saw venom last in spiderman 3 the animation was terrible and topher grace was less than convincing critics who claim the new movie lacks soul try rewatching spidey 3 venom scenes they are soulstealers this version of venom actually has a lot of character potential to it the voice the animation the conflict between eddie and venom and the action bits in beautiful san francisco is what you need to watch this movie for i guess by that virtue it feeling like an extension to the trailer but theres more stuff you havent seen
Oct 8 2018,positive,me and my wife saw it and while its not an epic movie we both did enjoy it kind of a slow start but not really bad and we were never bored with it
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is a really good movie there are some plot holes but they dont take away from great things about this film
Oct 8 2018,positive,the critic review for this movie is biased this is the perfect example of how rotten tomatoes bashes all the mcu competition at the expense of trying to make people not to watch it venom is a great movie in its own unique way i had a great time watching this movie and recommend everyone to go watch it really looking forward to the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,who would you consider 200 random critics 30 or 20 000 movie goers 89 fun movie yes fun i go to this kind of movie to have fun and enjoy myself if i have fun i enjoyed the film if i do not have fun then i did not enjoy the film great relationship between brock  venom which left me wanting more sure this is not a masterpiece and some of the relationships around brock are a bit fluff but i do read and enjoy comic books and i like dark comedies and monster films there was a lot for me in this film even with its other issues
Oct 8 2018,positive,like any start up movie it had its minor flaws but the dialogue was hilarious and the the action was great very entertaining movie would easily see it again and look forward to the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was great although some of the cgi was missing the hit it still gave me goosebumps leading up to the first scene when  venom and eddy finally meet if your a venom fan this movie is a must see
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing movie funny and action packed was concerned about the ratingviolence for my kids 9 and 6 year old boys but they loved it and it was not that bad
Oct 8 2018,positive,my only issue was the pacing it was a bit too fast but understandably so as there was a lot to cover with introductions and whatnot of an antiheros first appearance on the big screen also i would have liked the cgi budget increased i would definitely like to see the sequel and will be purchasing venom in ultra 4k come on marvel and sony polish this up a bit slow down the story a little and add a bit more tension and you have yourself a goldmine franchise plus some of the shots of eddie in san francisco were done extremely well literally had a wow that was a great shot moment when heading was on his motorcycle
Oct 8 2018,neutral,no horrible but not very good either think it reminds me of the same feeling i had watching the amazing spiderman 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie but could have been written directed better
Oct 8 2018,positive,i liked it  mid credits scene is sick
Oct 8 2018,negative,i thought films of this style died in 2004 but yet here we are sony finally got what they wanted  a spiderman movie without spiderman its hilariously bad in spots and somewhat familiar in others the final product is a mixed bag of bad cg and bad storytelling
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont ever go with the critics score
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is right eddie brock is okay but he can be better more badass i dont understand the change of mind of venom i need more explication but in resume its good no more
Oct 8 2018,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever definitely going to see again
Oct 8 2018,negative,so thats an hour of my life i wont get back
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie ignore the critics
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was a good movie i dontt understand why the critics disagree  cant wait for the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a fan i thought the movie was entertaining and worth the watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,venum was a very enjoyable movie i loved it it is pretty obvious that the top critics dont understand who venum is  venum is both humor and action the way stan intended
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a fun ride but the story and the tone are very off
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom  is a fun and exiting film with lots of action and a good amount of story i was pretty shook when shevenom was in the film when about to watch the film i felt it was going to be bad and not make sense because of spider man but i didnt really think about spider man it felt like a venom movie 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie finally a marvel character that would improve the mcu if it were brought in my only complaint is how quick the final act wrapped up cant wait to see what they do next
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie good mix of comedy and action
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a good messy movie that u will enjoy trust me
Oct 8 2018,negative,venom  average user score 63  oct 8 2018  4  venom imagethe good   tom hardy gives a solid performance   the backandforth between eddie brock and venom is very entertaining venoms humor is a little childish at times but i chuckled quite a bit  if you turn your brain completely off before it starts you will be entertained      the bad   this is a messy cgi fest of a film it looks entirely fake at times and the action scenes were a huge let down  riot may be one of the weakest villains ive seen in a comic book film in a long time riz ahmed is a great actor but this wasnt the role for him the final fight of the film was a bit of a joke   this script is far from great the dialogue is weak and the story is all over the place   the pg13 rating significantly hurt this films potential as far as violence goes because for a venom film there was a severe lack of violence  i laughed several times at moments that were clearly meant to be taken seriously  i commend sony for trying out a different kind of spinoff film focusing on a character other than spiderman but this was a huge swing and a miss
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont think its as bad as people say i came out of the cinema thinking it was a decent film i wouldnt say its a brilliant movie but through the course of the film whenever venom and eddie broc were on screen i found it pretty entertaining as i loved the chemistry between the two of course there a plot holes and some points to criticise but its not at all as bad as the critics claim it to be
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy is great he is amazing and its was such fun i hope they do a rrated bluray 
Oct 8 2018,positive,not bad go not expecting a marvel movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,the good   tom hardy gives a solid performance   the backandforth between eddie brock and venom is very entertaining venoms humor is a little childish at times but i chuckled quite a bit    if you turn your brain completely off before it starts you will be entertained     the bad   this is a messy cgi fest of a film it looks entirely fake at times and the action scenes were a huge let down    riot may be one of the weakest villains ive seen in a comic book film in a long time riz ahmed is a great actor but this wasnt the role for him the final fight of the film was a bit of a joke   this script is far from great the dialogue is weak and the story is all over the place   the pg13 rating significantly hurt this films potential as far as violence goes because for a venom film there was a severe lack of violence    i laughed several times at moments that were clearly meant to be taken seriously    i commend sony for trying out a different kind of spinoff film focusing on a character other than spiderman but this was a huge swing and a miss
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought the film was decent it could of been a lot better and it definitely had a few problems overall the good outweighs the bad and i liked it
Oct 8 2018,positive,definitely worth watching it was pretty action packed with some scary moments pretty much on the edge of my seat the last half
Oct 8 2018,negative,so much of it doesnt make sense but visually venom waa brought to life i wanted so much more and they didnt deliver
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a fun movie  would have loved to see more of the original story line but its a well done movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was a fun watch although it didnt have spiderman in it the movie was still amazing
Oct 8 2018,positive,not a perfect movie but i went in expecting garbage and i left enjoying myself it has a few flaws but i cant believe how excited i am for a sequel now
Oct 8 2018,positive,is there a more useless job than movie critics the movie was great its a great introduction  to venom and the symbiotes already hyped for the 2nd one because of the end credit scene at first i didnt like how eddie brock didnt take control as much but in the end he took back control only thing i wish this movie had was an r rating
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved this movie the storyline was good the character relationship between venom and eddie was what made the movie for me
Oct 8 2018,neutral,i actually really enjoyed it tom hardy was phenomenal and his banter with venom was hilarious
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie not great had potential fell alittle short  felt more like a monster movie than a marvel movie the interaction between  eddie brock and venom where the best parts fun movie and hope there is another one in the future
Oct 8 2018,negative,tom hardy kind of saved this movie but not for long venom will be easily forgotten soon
Oct 8 2018,positive,besides the pacing of the movie which was slow in the beginning and fast near the end the movie did a fantastic job of reinventing venom into a new being along with eddie i think the divergence from spiderman was a fantastic idea  highly recommend this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it should have been rated r but it did its job th was great as usual the end
Oct 8 2018,positive,good start to a potential franchise definitely think the pg13 rating hurt it story telling wise venom should be rated r give us the blood and gory we want hollywood
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved this movie more than the amazing spiderman movies critics dont know what theyre missing out on
Oct 8 2018,positive,the main fight was not very long but other than that the movie was amazing
Oct 8 2018,positive,started a littled slow but picked up quick
Oct 8 2018,positive,i wasnt going to see venom but it was sunday and you can only have so many baths in one day before you get bored so i headed off to the cinema  i expected to hate the film based upon what i had heard critics say but surprisingly i actually enjoyed the film   its a dumb film but an enjoyable fun in a 90s action film kind of way the type where the audience laughs with the film and not at it   it was clear that the actors and producers thought lets just have fun with this and it really comes across as it doesnt  take itself seriously and once the story gets into gear just goes from one action scene or joke to another similar style to the mask  would i go to see this again not any time soon but if i was at a friends house and they put it on to watch and just have  laugh with then yes i would  if you go to watch it then be like the people who made this film just have fun with it
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie must see action packed
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was much better than anyone had said it was glad i didnt listen to reviews and went to see it for myself refreshing take on a super cool character def a 4k buy when it hits shelves
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was cartoony and has had some shitty cgi but i did enjoy this movie in the same way many people enjoy many movies like step brother or fourty year old virgin
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it wish it was more violent though could have used more blood and guts for such a violent character 
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie if you dont want to nitpick the orgin story i have been waiting for this movie since i was a little kid i was not dissappointed
Oct 8 2018,neutral,i dont know if it wanted to be a comedic or serious comic book movie i just know that neither of it worked well the writing is pretty sloppy hardy and williams have no chemistry and the movie establishes rules that it doesnt follow much venom is my favorite spiderman villain and for a second time he was a let down in cinematic form
Oct 8 2018,positive,i could tell by the trailers that this was going to be a different type of venom movie you have to take your comic glasses off and just let the movie tell you the story i loved the movie it was funny people die and it didnt take it self so seriously btw i bet next comic con is going to be filled with lady venoms
Oct 8 2018,positive,good fun but think tom is a bit misplaced  could have chosen a more suitable actorhes too good for this
Oct 8 2018,positive,entertaining movie few flaws but fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are snobs movie was super fun
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was a solid movie enjoyed the darker tone mixed with comedy and the bromance going on between the symbiote and eddy brock also tom hardy was the soul of this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics venom was a great movie and was very successful at bringing the venom we all know and love from the comics and cartoons to the big screen tom hardy as usual was killed it and im looking forward to whats next
Oct 8 2018,positive,slow at first but when it picked up it was really good
Oct 8 2018,positive,everything i wanted to see in a venom movie i love eddie and venoms relationship and riot was a great villain
Oct 8 2018,negative,this movie is so stupid that some other reviewers need to make up their own story to make sense of it and then they love their own version of the story so much that they give this a good score
Oct 8 2018,positive,this was a absolute fun movie  im a huge comic book fan and i will admit i was worried going into this film being im not the biggest sony fan in the world and i felt this was a money grab for sony before disney gets venom into the mcu  a huge suprise was sony delivered ignore the critics on this one  even if your not a comic book fan venom is a fun ride and worth the 10  make sure to stay at the end for the post credit scene  you will get a little taste on whats to come with venom and what sony also has in stored for december
Oct 8 2018,neutral,its a 25 stars movie for me solid but not really a standout    pros   great acting by tom hardy stands out by far   fun interactions between eddie brock and venom   some jokes land and others are straight up laugh out loud moments   satisfying action scenes   stan lee cameo free space    cons   the movie feels too short it needs an extra 2030 minutes   all scenes prior to eddie sitting at the bar could and should have been cut   the final battle happens during night time which makes it hard to see whats happening   the symbiote villain riot gets too little screentime must have been 3 minutes   venom has an incredibly sudden change of heart in the final moments of the movie   even though some are fun this movies has too many jokes   pg13 rating
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was great fun and enjoyable the critics are being too harsh
Oct 8 2018,positive,i went to go see venom with my son i was not expecting much but i have to say i enjoyed it the relationship between the two was very interesting and entertaining i left saying that i will go see the sequel to see how their relationship grows
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movies overall
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie the action is great but storyline could be better
Oct 8 2018,positive,fuck yeah this movie was epic
Oct 8 2018,positive,underrated by critics if you pay attention the movie is amazing
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is a fun action packed film i dont understand why the critics are so harsh on this one it is an origin story and the movie delivers what it promises tom hardy is fascinating the cgi is on point and for those claiming that the movie is tone deaf and somehow doesnt attain the the standards set by other marvel movies i strongly disagree this is a new universe its dark but funny simplistic yet brilliant venom to me was better than many other origin stories cant wait for the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was electrifying the movie created the perfect sense of action horror comedy into creating a very static movie with great promises for a sequel in the future loved the movie i would spend more money to watch again
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing movie great plot and relationships the villain just wasnt there and some of the characters were very serious while others were having a fun time other than that great movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,spoilers    venom is way better than most of these negative reviews are saying  it is a fantastic but quick ride to the introduction of venom in the mcu  it was obvious why sony went pg13 so they had some kind of way of hopefully getting venom in a spiderman film or vice versa but even with the pg13 rating you still get what makes venom fun a friggin comic book character biting off peoples headsliterally in the movie he is eating people on screen    venom had a ton of fun moments including the standout introduction of venom fully formed on screen using powers of all sorts  the inevitable comedic moments were great and one may be the funniest comedic moment of all comic book films for me on screen when venom asks eddie to jump from a high building  it actually made me laugh out loud along with just about all the other movie goers there with me maybe 20 people at a monday 11am showing    the ending setup for a future villain is amazing due to their incredible casting of venoms biggest most sadistic villain  this movie is fantastic good fun and i cant wait for the inevitable sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,holy  it has everything i wanted from vemon way better than the 2007 version
Oct 8 2018,positive,i adore the relationship between venom and eddie this movie made me happy
Oct 8 2018,negative,the movie was boring cheesy and predictable so many things dont make any sense also the only latin actor in the movie was a thief and had 3 lines lacking of diversity and enforces the classic hollywood stereotypes we thought we had moved on
Oct 8 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive seen
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was a complete meson a movie with plot holes left right and center however i had so much fun watching it at the end of the day i left the theatre with a smile and isnt that all that really counts
Oct 8 2018,positive,if you just wanna watch a movie and not care about accuracy this is it i found it more entertainig then avengers
Oct 8 2018,positive,extremely entertaining would totally see this again
Oct 8 2018,positive,i did not expect this movie to be that good way better than infinity wars its a movie you have to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it throwback to the 90s in the best way as the character was peak in the 90s tom hardy was great as eddie brock
Oct 8 2018,positive,a bit slow in the beginning but once it gets going boy does it get going really fun ride from start to finish
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved this movie so fun and so funny hardys nervous performance carries the whole film especially that scene in the restaurant who knew he was this funny and had such comedic timing ahmeds acting was great as usual but the dialogue for him and everyone except venombrock was just mediocre id  have to say i had an issue with the cutting away of every head bite or violent act and wished to get a little more intensity in the violence cant believe i ended up being thankful spiderman wasnt in this movie after all tom holland does not belong in this universe and neither does the mcu aesthetic cant wait to see what they do next
Oct 8 2018,positive,as a venom fan i was excited that they were making this film i had read the reviews and was a little worried but still gave it a chance i can say i am glad i did the story is a detour from the original story but i think it was a good idea it was less focused on the spiderman universe and more building a world for venom they really did a good job of showing off venoms powers in a fun way there were some faults to the film but i feel those made it some how better by giving it more character it was a fun over the top action movie and i would watch it against if i had the chance
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun my daughter  both scared at times and laughing at punch lines  gave it a thumbs up great efx and it seems they took time to create  the origin story it is a sony and not disney and they tried to make it look and feel like they align with marvel would be great if they pushed more to show how  this can crossover to mcus spiderman sony and disney
Oct 8 2018,positive,excellent movie very accurate to the comics as can be expected from a movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,a pretty good and unique superhero film though the final act was quite clearly rushed the venom and brock chemistry makes this movie better than the trailers show i was pleasantly surprised on how much i ended up like the alien character venom which the trailers again make him seem like a harmful entity rather that an actual being with a personality i loved venom the most not for the action but for the conversation and remarks both brock and his alien parasite have between one another i will for sure be looking forward to the sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,while the pg13 rating does harshly affect the tone of the movie there are many great things that came out of the movie case in point venom he had his annoying moments but most of the time he was comedic and a badass unfortunately there are many wrong things with the film the et reference the movie cant really seem to decide whether it wants to be a dark antihero movie or a comedic antihero movie either way the film is a fun and enjoyable ride and it is a good movie if you are a fan of this spidey villain and the comics
Oct 8 2018,positive,if you let go of the draw of wanting a r rated movie this is a good pg13 stand alone movie it does take a bit to get moving so those easily frustrated with 30 to 40 minutes of character development will find an easy and somewhat valid complaint this first post credit scene begs for a sequel with the character and actor set to star in the role tom over topher any day in the venom role but still just a good popcorn movie worth the price of admission not the level of mcu but not the pain of most dc universe
Oct 8 2018,positive,good at most if you watch it for fun your gonna enjoy it if you want the film of the year its not this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was amazing it was an awesome introduction into the klyntar backstory and intro to my personally favorite antihero venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,it may have not been what people wanted spiderman but i can tell you what it is not boring  it takes a lot of time to establish characters in the beginning but the buildup pays off once venom comes in to play hardys eddy brock came off less like the comic eddy and more like always sunnys charlie kelly which makes for some funny moments when eddy tries to cope with venoms sudden emergence into eddys mind i would give it a five if it had done two things different one the goals of the symbiotes were kinda out of character for the source material two the damn shitty hook from eminems venom they paid money for that
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movies but there should be a fight scenes with villan in the middle of the movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,sony strikes again way to waste one of the alltime best spiderverse characters this is a mess a hot mess at that
Oct 8 2018,positive,are critics rating this movie for oscarpotential because venom isnt that kind of a movieobviously  what is was was highly entertaining and an opportunity to finally see venom played out on screen i got out of it exactly what i wanted a fun superhero movie with a great lead actor i was entertained done
Oct 8 2018,positive,the story was short and sweet not overly complicated the character interactions were fun to watch and really engaging venoms appearance grew on me quite a bit even though i didnt like it from seeing it in the trailers
Oct 8 2018,positive,its not a bad movie at all not excellent but not a bad movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,really entertaining misses on theme has a believable plot in place with some great venom moments trailers give away too much some great surprises that comic fans will love would see it again at home when its released on digital streaming
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie had a slow start but once it found its legs it took off running
Oct 8 2018,positive,to anyone who actually reads the comic this adaptation sticks very close to the true form of the character was enjoyable to watch and it did well in explaining venoms origins with the exclusion of spiderman excited to see what comes next
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved tom hardy and i love that they did venom justice people are tripping i didnt want to watch it cuz no spidey but this is the venom that shouldve been in spiderman three it was a good movie people are tripping were yall expecting a dark movie or something with a great plot its about venom if u aint a fan of venom dont rate
Oct 8 2018,positive,not good cinema but good entertainment
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved it  must watch very thrilling tom hardy is amazing1 perfect for venom  cant wait to see the second one
Oct 8 2018,positive,an absolutely amazing movie good things coming our way if they continue making them
Oct 8 2018,positive,not the greatest marvel movie but it was fun riz ahmed was a compelling villain and tom hardy was great as eddie brock the script could have been a bit better but they did a good job with the venom character and his actions
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a really fun movie overall but sadly fun isnt what the trailers advertised us   the comedy part was well done the interaction between eddie and venom is most definitely the highlight of this film sure wish there was more of that because the story is wonky and the last action scene is trying a bit too hard to look cool
Oct 8 2018,positive,i was entertained few hiccups in the script but the story was good
Oct 8 2018,positive,best movie i have ever seen the action was amazing the plot was amazing when the film wanted to be funny it was funny and the actors where brilliant
Oct 8 2018,positive,i dont think the top critics or wannabe critics and i were watching the same movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,great film i realy dont understand the hate
Oct 8 2018,positive,i did see it and i thought it was great  action packed good costume design and tom hardy was hilarious  i dont know why critics are being so negative about it  its not a movie about a superhero its not a love story and its not trying to be either  its an action movie  stop being so critical  this is going to be just like the fast and the furious  remember how bad the critics reamed it  yet the audience gave the franchise incredibily high marks  and theyve done how many more movies since then  critics be silenced
Oct 8 2018,positive,funny and entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie big action would see again
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is a pacy stylish dark antihero movie with tom hardys stellar performance riz ahmed delivers a very well done performance of dr carlton drake and michelle williams delivers to the audience a great performance as anne weying venom is a very good film
Oct 8 2018,positive,great and entertaining movie i would relate this to a thriller movie but has some plot mistakes
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it did have some story issues but i still loved it i finally get to act like spiderman 3 didnt happen no disrespect to topher grace
Oct 8 2018,positive,good but too fast the r rated version is needed
Oct 8 2018,positive,very good entertaining all the way through some action scenes get heavy on cuts and cgi but the acting is great the story is logical the character motivations are consistent the dialogue is just a treat
Oct 8 2018,positive,i honestly dont understand the hate around this movie yes its a timetested yet formulaic movie but it does work tom hardy is hilarious and ahmed is brilliant yet underutilized if youre coming in hoping to see the venom of the comics youre probably going to be disappointed but as someone coming in with little knowledge of the franchise i think it works very well as an actioncomedy
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing the fact that cirtics trash this a well done dark but funny and original take on a movie but praise the cookie cutter style of black panther simply amazes me
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i feel like the critics have missed what the fans were looking for as evident by the drastic diffence in critic v viewer rating tom hardy was perfectly cast for venom and the eddie brockvenom relationship was everything i wanted yes the story was predictable and linear but it was nonstop excitement from start to finish i know this is a universe without spiderman but honestly not once in this film did i miss it venom didnt need the webslinger to be enjoyable and even if spidey was never introduced i would be happy watching sequels of venom fighting a world of symbiotes give us more
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie  i knew not to trust critics on this one
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is awesome like the movie and venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved tom hardy in this it was different from the other super hero films it was entertaining dark comedic and just plain delightful
Oct 8 2018,positive,this a good movie i dont understand why the critic hate it
Oct 8 2018,positive,in some parts of the movie it was more funny than the writers intended which is why it gets a lot of hate i enjoyed the humor and i also thought the storyline was not bad at all
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics definitely got this one wrong great comic book movie i really like venom and i feel this was a good adaptation of him in a nonspiderman universe tom hardy was great and the movie was actually pretty funny
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun to watch but not great
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is a fun ride the first time through but on repeat viewings the film is remarkably stale
Oct 8 2018,negative,i was thoroughly entertained by how horrible venom was the movie was cliché as fuck and so easy to call i was calling out entire scenes to my friend 40 minutes before they happened the writing was complete shit each character fell out of their established character constantly the dialogue was unintentionally cringe inducing or so clunky it was hilarious and the plot completely falls apart when you start to think about it non of the characters have any arcs or personality whenever they starting setting up a joke i would call the most obvious least funny punchline i could think of and i was right every time the cinematography was above average for a superhero movie i guess it was nothing crazy though sidenote for some reason whenever they enter the lab they use the exact same establishing shot of the lab even though we would immediately know what the lab looks like from the inside the music was all temp music and you will have heard every track from somewhere before the action straight up was missing shots sometimes the pg13 completely hurt the movie they tear a guys head of and there wasnt even any blood this movie was really dumb 15
Oct 8 2018,positive,saw this last night and critics have it wrong this time its bonkers funny dark exactly what it needed to be
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie with many flaws such as boring characters and a bland camera work but what saves this movie is tom hardy and venom himself giving an outside performance and in my eyes does warrant a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,1  tom hardy was excellent  2  great chemistry between venom and eddie brock  3  gave a strong base to be built on going forward
Oct 8 2018,positive,it wasnt perfect but seeing a comic accurate venom kick ass all over san francisco was well worth the price of admission
Oct 8 2018,positive,was a good movie idk what the critics are looking at solid movie will watch again next weekend
Oct 8 2018,positive,i love the darker side of marvel and this one was amazing
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than the gotg
Oct 8 2018,positive,eddie and venoms relationship had more development and depth than most superhero movie trilogies altogether
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it one of the best super hero movie this year
Oct 8 2018,positive,when movie critics and audiences are so far out of sync on a movie i usually hedge towards my fellow movie goer  i mean really the english patient and the piano were godawful boring movies and dumb and dumber was one of the funniest movies i ever saw  venom is one of those movies that defies that paradox between critical failure and pure entertainment  i had fun my family had fun and i was entertained
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie must watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought the film was fun and entertaining  tom hardy was great and his relationship with venom and the backandforth they have   the plot is alright nothing too crazy or in depth but i enjoyed the movie and was entertained  my only wish is that they would have gone for an r rating then they could have made the violence a little more graphic and i think they could have really made the humor a little more vulgar  allinall i enjoyed it
Oct 8 2018,positive,everyone was so upset at the movie they wanted to see they didnt bother to focus on the movie they actually saw and thats a shame
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a good crazy movie wach it judge it yourself
Oct 8 2018,positive,a great representation of venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,to be fair i genuinely enjoyed this movie it follows a rather simplistic plot and not the best script yet it didnt bore me at any point many reviewing this movie have to much to say on how it doesnt compare to mcu films i believe watching it and seeing it for what it really is may allow viewers to have an overall better experience the bond between eddie and venom is definitely what made this movie this so enjoyable
Oct 8 2018,positive,done right for sure loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is awesome must see if your into super hero movies the critics opinions are absolutely trash and they are completely out of touch with the american movie goer 
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics do not understand venom he is not a cute and cuddly villian like dr ockhes a vicious killer and this movie did a good job of keeping to the characters actual comic book origins than anything seen in past spider mans which were terrible throw in some comedic fun and a great tease at the end and comic book fans are rejoicing everywhere
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome funny you saw more of venoms personally
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was way better than the 30 its got it wasnt super deep but was definitely entertaining i enjoyed seeing it
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom isnt groundbreaking and certainly isnt perfect but it accurately brings a beloved character from the comic books to the big screen entertaining and downright funny at times im not saying it deserves a certified fresh but i am saying it deserves at least a 52 because there are way worse movies put in the same percentile this movie deserves more credit but not too much more credit
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was very fun and i enjoyed watching it those who didnt too bad you have no taste
Oct 8 2018,positive,so much fun a real classic while the plot might not be as strong as it could have been i guarantee watching venom is the most fun and laughs you will have this month classic characters eddie brock and venom represented in a great way that make them instantly lovable and memorable scenes are comedic and sincere its easy to follow and get invested
Oct 8 2018,positive,outstanding performance by tom hardy
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie had blew me away the action the comedy everything about it i wanted to watch this i was atacpating to watch movie it delivered i love the story and characters for movie the darkness just works cant wait for a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,the script may have been a little weak but tom hardy was an amazing venom the dark and satricical relationshop between eddie and venom is a relationship that really shines on screena r rating would have probally bumped this to a 5 along wit hthe stronger dialoug but over all this movie was very enjoyabel
Oct 8 2018,positive,having high expectations for this film i walked out feeling very conflicted  the film just never truly clicked for me  i thought the story was somewhat sloppy and in a way a wasted opportunity  tom hardy seemed to force the issue a lot in this film i never truly felt he embraced eddie brock especially during the first half of the film      the film takes a while to get going and when it does the action pieces are superb  however the second half is pretty predictable and full of cliche ridden set pieces  the puzzle pieces were there but they just didnt fit together it was a very sloppy screenplay that could of been so much more     marvel films of past that have met or exceed expectations threw a strong emotional punch while blending humor perfectly  the humor here was fine but the punch wasnt thrown  for such a dark character the opportunity seemed to be there to take a fantastic actor and blend it together to form a knockout performance  it just was never there  a good popcorn flick to watch on a rainy day but nothing more
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a fantastic movie i loved it you have to watch it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i am not a comic book snob or guru so i dont know the story of him and spiderman i enjoyed the movie and thought is was better without spiderman  i hope there is a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was much better then the critics lead me to believe no where near perfect but good enough for a first venom film
Oct 8 2018,positive,the comedy and overall tone of the film really worked for me this film scratches an itch because it is just different from current mcu or dc movie offerings
Oct 8 2018,negative,me and  my boyfriend fell asleep during this movie and hes a big time spiderman nerd the story felt it was meant to go one direction that was good and ended up going a whole new direction that made no sense only question i have is how did the life foundation have enough money for drones with security cameras but couldnt afford security cameras at the lab sony please explain
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie we loved it not sure why critics even review these movies anymore we need more audience scoresratings critics are constantly getting it wrong
Oct 8 2018,positive,though it has a hard time figuring out what it is venom is a fun ride throughout
Oct 8 2018,positive,although the current marvel movie expectations are quite high venom achieves a fresh start avoiding cliche like girlfriend hostages girlfriend comeback i liked how the main struggle wasnt a great internal fight with venom itself instead venom personality and pal empathy make it one of the best duets of losers in the marvel universe
Oct 8 2018,negative,while venom features an entertaining title character and a committed performance by tom hardy it nevertheless feels like a soulless product and a lazy attempt to spark a cinematic universe
Oct 8 2018,positive,really enjoyed this
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie is a great time lots of cool stuff
Oct 8 2018,positive,was a really big change  but i totally enjoyed the movie it had to of been a new step up away from a superhero and adding a super villian instead i recommend this movie slow paced at first but it gets there eventually id like to see a sequel to this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,fun movie to watch good take on venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,it isnt best comic movie out there but it def doesnt belong in the shitpile of last fantastic 4 or latest dc movies i recommend seeing it not sure why critics were hating so hard 
Oct 8 2018,positive,short and sweet its an origin very straight forward not a crowded narrative funny and fun graphics are great lots of venom easter eggs for fans the venom everyone wanted to see in spiderman 3 we are where we need to be great work only thing i was a little shaky on was the symbiotes diet interpretation in the movie thats all without spoilers go see it i will go again in theaters and buy the bluray when its out
Oct 8 2018,positive,this film does exactly what every venom fan wanted have a movie that focuses on our favorite character  venom we have an original origin story for brock venom and the merger of the two the story ultimately settles on the bromance between eddy and venom and its wonderful there was a tedmark wahlberg aspect to the relationship that left us all wanting more it mad us laugh cry my girlfriend and gasp while the script could be better the movie did the character justice it even gave venom a lovable quality similar to a scruffy dog that destroys everything in your house but is also the most lovable adorable pup on the planet to quote my girl you cant help but love venom yeah he eats people but its not because hes bad its just because of his dietary needs enjoy with an open mind the film which i covered from day 1 and knew of every available piece of information still surprised me i liked it and im ready for spoiler alert stop reading now carnage
Oct 8 2018,positive,wonder woman got 90 and this gets 30 i call bs audience score is more accurate this was as enjoyable and def a whole lot funnier almost didnt see it bc critics but glad i did kind of scary that critic scores can make such an influence on our choices makes me wonder what other movies critics hate but id prob love 
Oct 8 2018,positive,very entertaining and fun to watch  its not the best marvel associated movie but fun anyway  i would definitely watch it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,far better than i expected  looking forward to the sequel to see how woody does
Oct 8 2018,positive,i love venom i think the some critics are way over theor head for making the movie sound sloppy and boring but it is not
Oct 8 2018,positive,i truly enjoyed that movie amazing action scene great cast really funny the story doesnt follow the bd but since when marvel follow there own bd for the movie   it was entertaining new story new fun people are so critical
Oct 8 2018,positive,it may not be the most thought provoking film or the most original but where venom really shines with its fun action sequences excellent special effects and tom hardys stellar performance
Oct 8 2018,neutral,fairly corny weak back story and not as scarythrilling as needed for a great movie venom shouldnt have spoke english
Oct 8 2018,positive,way better than expected
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a good dc movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,even with all story issues and tone inconsistency venom still is quite entertaining majority of the praise goes to tom hardys portrayal of the character funny and creepy although i wouldve enjoyed the movie a lot more if tone was darker just the way the character is supposed to be its understandable why the studio wanted to keep the movie pg13 im certainly eager for a sequel with the inclusion of the far more brutal carnage the studio will have to give it an r rating which would make for a much better movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,let me say that movie lacks a good script good camera shots and takes too fing long for venom to finally kick in well then again im talking about a sony movie and there was no need to grab on my hopes to begin with as it managed to fup almost all hero movies it has done  venom has its bright but few moments  tom hardy plays well a loser eddy brock without the true acid and envydamaged attitude from the comics the cg nails it its somehow a fun movie but dont expect much
Oct 8 2018,positive,i love the fight scene between venom and riot the cops fight scene is pretty good too
Oct 8 2018,positive,despite the ever growing critic opinion this movie was a good movie it had its flaws as do many a film such as the first act being somewhat slow though filling this snail pace beginning with a curious insight into the character of eddie brock it didnt dwell too long on who he his or what he does and gave just the right amount of information to let audiences know who the character is without going through a painstakingly stale and overdone backstory flashback its when the awaited scenes of venom revealing his power and finally taking control of brocks body that the movie starts to feel less slow story and more action story and the fight scenes we are given are some amazing pieces of work including one toward the end the boss fight if you will that has an amazing work of graphics and cg   one common complaint is that the movie ties in too many genres action thriller comedy superhero my question is why does it have to be one or the other we as humans are multifaceted creatures who have multiple different skills feelings loves and passions if this is the case for humans how is a movie any less interesting for capturing this very same multifaceted nature of a human it is especially relevant with the inclusion of a nonhuman antagonist
Oct 8 2018,positive,what a fun movie to go see really enjoyed it
Oct 8 2018,positive,full of sharp dark humor funny action filled entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,was a very fun movie with great action and even better performance from tom hardy only problems with it was pacing which seemed to happen too quickly and the cgi could have been better
Oct 8 2018,positive,i liked it it wasnt great but it was a good origins movie took a little while longer than it should have for the set up but overall it was a good movie i would enjoy a sequel
Oct 8 2018,positive,only reason im giving it a 45 is because its a different origin than what were use to since marvel had to get greedy and buy spider man back the movie was told differently other than that loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a good movie i enjoy it a lot
Oct 8 2018,positive,funny and action packed diverged from the comic book a little but that was made up for when they casted tom hardy
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the hate it was a better movie than ant man 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,i actually enjoyed tom hardy in this role the film stepped up in the second half when the tormented hardy was in conflict with venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,like all sony movies this was a rush to screen problem where the plot and dialogue do suffer but ultimately it delivers on a great venom movie and tom hardy is epic as both brock and venom delivering some great lines and acting
Oct 8 2018,positive,love the comedy in it despite some bad reviews i thought it was an awsome movie different and more interesting that every other normal superheromovie
Oct 8 2018,positive,a good movie its not going to win any oscar but in fact is a real good one despite the critics consensus
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome if i had one complaint its that the action was a little hard to follow at the very end  i know its not easy cuz of the color similarity between the symbiotes in addition to how fluidly they move around other than that though i thought it was an excellent movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to critics this is a great movie if you enjoy the whole marvel universe or even if you enjoy spidermanvenom history i feel like there couldve been a bit more explaining for people who are new to the whole venom background but other than that great to see venom finally in action
Oct 8 2018,positive,its a movie based off a comic book lets not lose sight of this its not meant to be a 4 star movie my wife and i had a blast with it it was fun had funny moments tom hardy was great as usual and venom looked absolutely badass dont listen to the critics listen to yourself go into it with an open mind realising its based off a comic the only way to do venom right is by computer or youre going to get that lame ass spider man version  and dont expect the shawshank redemption good times looking forward to the dvd when it comes out
Oct 8 2018,positive,that was great love it
Oct 8 2018,negative,terrible script needs more spiderman violence and less shitty dialog between tom hardy and tom hardy with a deeper voice a couple easter eggs might have made it more watchable what the fuck was on woody harrelsons head at the end looked like annie had a symbiotic wig that preferred his head
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than i expected
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was a solid movie the script was abit weak but what it lacked in writing it made up in character
Oct 8 2018,positive,its funny how everyones critiquing  how bad the movie was but i thought it was pretty good aside from the fact that we went to watch it in 3d and there was really no 3d    the movie industry needs to do a way better job when it comes to 3d movies
Oct 8 2018,positive,rating it a 5 because its a freaking blast  tons of fun  not sure if its groundbreaking or great as a film because i dont care i was too busy enjoying it and having a great time doing it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,my family enjoyed this movie so much  it was so entertaining and action packed venom is a must watch 
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is very enjoyable in many ways  the visuals are intense and welldone the action is wild and hyperfast and the venom character doesnt take itself too seriously which actually works better than it sounds  i went in expecting a deadly serious horror movie but its really a true comic book movie with mature graphic novels elements interspersed throughout  the midcredits scene hints at a sequel and im looking forward to it
Oct 8 2018,positive,i  enjoyed venom i was pleasantly surprised its worth the watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,ignore the critics for sure this is a great movie if maybe a little short in running time but it is great fun tom hardy was fantastic in the role and the venom voice  sometimes funny was the best part of the movie loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,even know i wished spiderman was in the movie and that venom would have his original origin from the comics this movie was more amazing than i thought it would be cant wait for a sequel and a possibility of mcu spiderman crossover
Oct 8 2018,neutral,the movie had some fun parts and exciting action but it ultimately left me wanting the action was often too hectic and hard to follow the humor was forced and lackluster at times and the pacing of the movie was off lets put it this way if i was interrupted and had to leave half way through the film without finishing it it wouldnt have bothered me at all 
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is plain fun did not expect much but i still loved it
Oct 8 2018,negative,very good showcase of venoms abilities but painfully drawn out into an awful scriptfelt cheesy and almost cringy at times the cgi and action scenes were very well done
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie did well in establishing its main story beats and characters despite all the restrictions and lack of time  they had during productionobviously the lack of spiderman still lingers in the back of my head but tom hardy and ruben fleischer managed to pull it off to a well enough extent for me and many others to have a great time seeing venom finally done right on the silver screen
Oct 8 2018,negative,somewhat dull beginning the acting was soso im not sure the portrayal of eddie brock was good for tom hardy if you are a die hard fan of the comics i guess this will be a must see for you for the rest of us id recommend to wait for it on netflix or on demand
Oct 8 2018,positive,ofc better than predator ofc better than justice legue if you want to have fun while watching it and have goosebumps whenever you see venom go and watch it
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie loved the humor loved tom hardy i only wish it had taken it up a step and gone for the r rating
Oct 8 2018,positive,this is a classic example of why you never listen to what a critic or so called expert says go see it for yourself its a well done marvel movie with a bit of sarcasm built in
Oct 8 2018,positive,really enjoyable ride loved the stan lee she  venom and carnage cameos happy with the direction they took the story stay for the post credits if you like spider man 
Oct 8 2018,positive,very fun wish they had made it rrated
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it seen it twice and will probably see it again soon
Oct 8 2018,negative,this movie is a kinder egg with poo inside the toyegg   on the plus side the venom graphics are pretty cool and do justice to the character from the comics which the topher grace version did not   everythings else about this movie sucks i thought tom hardy would be good in this he is not all the dialog is totally stilted everything about this movie is safe boring and forgettable   at thus point im just done with super heros in general they muck up the ones i like and pile on the ones i dont care about this movie suffers from being like the other hero movies it has some ok cgi but the plot is weak and billions are not compelling the conflicts in gwneralso contrived i really hope something awful happens which forces all studios to halt these abysmal films about men and women in spandex ive had enough
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is an entertaining yet unoriginal superhero flick tom hardy is easily the best part of the film but the rest of the characters are dull his ability to act opposite himself was amazing i havent seen acting like that in a superhero movie in quite awhile however that doesnt make up for the rest of the movies mistakes the first act was dull and the third act went by too quickly i wouldve much rather spent more time watching the dynamic between eddie brock and venom venom himself looks decent the cgi isnt awful but couldve been better still a large improvement from spiderman 3s attempt at bringing the character to the big screen im very interested in seeing the 3040 minutes that got cut which hardy liked the most overall it was a fun movie with plenty of missteps but a great lead performance that is a solid standalone film for a great character 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i just enjoyed this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,entertaining and fun movie exactly what i expected from marvel 
Oct 8 2018,positive,was it perfect no  but it sure was fun to watch
Oct 8 2018,negative,i saw this movie the day after the opening night and i gotta i was not impressed there is more wrong then right when the first trailer for this movie came out i was like okay its another superhero movie but as the movie came closer i was pumped only to see tom hardy kick some ass and the end product was we got none of that some of the problems i had were it took too long to introduce venom like more towards the middle of the movie another problem is at the climatic battle i got sidetracked in my own thoughts then actually watching the movie a third problem none of the fight or chase scenes are really that memorable then they try to set up another movie with that scene in the credits the two saving graces to this movie are venom and eddie brocks relationship that forms and some of the jokes
Oct 8 2018,negative,thought venom was a villain not a super hero the movie was more like a comedy then anything
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it great movie we have been waiting for
Oct 8 2018,positive,first 60 of movie was poorly written character development that was slow with bad acting  the last 40 was funny with some nice action sequences  weakest marvel movie in a while
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved venom everything i wanted from a venom movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,after an extremely drawnout expository introduction the movie kicks into high gear once eddie and the symbiote get together the highlight of this move is the interaction between the venom symbiote whose wisecracks and revelations about its personality make the creature funny and interesting riz ahmed tries to play a zuckerberglike villain but theres just not enough menace behind the acting to believe he is any real threat all of the consequences of his villainy are carried out by other people a lackluster fight at the end of the third act seems almost perfunctory but the effects of bringing the symbiotes to life cannot be dismissed the effects have made venom exactly as i had pictured him to be tongue and all
Oct 8 2018,positive,the action and acting are excellent  one million aliens on a meteor trying to survive on other planets and having each character have names like rampage venom and carnage  gives it a transformers feel  comes across as unoriginal and detracted i thought  carnage was a genetic offspring of spidermans and venoms dna  we havent seen spiderman yet  how can there already be a carnage  im not a comicpurist however this deviates toward the absurd it felt to me
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont believe the bad reviews this isnt a marvel superhero movie this is an antihero movie and it works very entertaining i hope the sequel happens
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the tomatometer nor the critics this is a must watch movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,not sure what everyone was expecting its a stand alone story just like the mainstay venom comic series likewise every disney marvel film is pg13pg so im not why theres so much pressure for sony to push for an r clearly the critics saw a different film than the rest of us as we all seemed to like it its fun and at the end of the day thats the whole point
Oct 8 2018,positive,fantastic film if you like cheesy b horror and dark comedy than this one is definitely for you
Oct 8 2018,positive,not as bad as critics says it has flaws but enjoyable ride tom hardy was awesome you can watch it
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie was great lots of fun really enjoyed the film if you are any fan of venom go watch it you wont be disappointed 
Oct 8 2018,positive,not bad and entertaining
Oct 8 2018,negative,it makes every single marvel movie look pretty amazing how can no one else in hollywood crack the writing code of marvel and use it to write compelling characterdriven stories that marvel has become so good af
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is better than some of the mcu movies but got a score worse than all of them it still should have been rated r tho
Oct 8 2018,negative,im confused by why venom is now a superhero the acting is subpar and humor is misplaced the voice of venom wasnt done well 
Oct 8 2018,positive,way better than critics have given it credit for fun cohesive great action venom has a fluid funny storyline anyone who didnt like this didnt like the source material
Oct 8 2018,positive,despite some off putting reviews you must ask yourself who is venom made for   is it the fanbase having loved venom growing up or the critics who rated the long winded and boring gravity and let the right one in so highly yet cant get past the plot here its obvious the more these self appointed experts dislike the venom film the more speed and personal enjoyment the diehard fans of spiderman are enjoying it  myself personally i wouldnt change anything the trailers gave away lots but the film still made me think oh thats how theyre doing it this time regarding the venom symbiote becoming one with eddie and it works happily to my approval plus having tom hardy is the best signing they couldve asked for hes exceptional and in time the better more accurate reviews will outweigh the negative im certain just like the dark knight rises did  the cgi couldve been slowed slightly just to be able to take in the fight scenes in more detail but it doesnt matter overall the story all parts of it i loved and the characters too although my wife didnt like anne played by michelle williams but my wife who is new to the whole thing and thought the trailers were cheesy and had no high hopes for a good 2hr viewing really enjoyed it and preordered me the bluray steel book with 4k and bonus disc we both want to watch it again with my step son who wouldve loved to been with us except for the age rating hes 11 but really its not as bad violence language etc as i thought it would be so were not concerned cant wait till the sequel and hopefully a third 
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are giving this movie such bad ratings it makes no sense this movie was about aliens coming to our world if these critics can remember all the other alien movies its all the same they show the alien traveling andor killing body to body then they go back to normal life and show you how this alien starts ripping apart a normal average joes life i love the movie because it had some action some comedy love scenes girl venom is awesome looking hope to see her in the next film and then some crazy gore scences honestly it sorta was like deadpool just not so many one liners i hope these critics dont  ruin the chances of a venom ii coming out
Oct 8 2018,positive,solid fun movie pulling canon from both 90s cartoon and the lethal protector comic series   really looking forward to seeing how they grow the characters   hopefully the sequel isnt another mush of cgi symbioteswhich may be difficult with carnage on horizon
Oct 8 2018,positive,excellent movie will really want to see it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,much better than the critics say  go watch it
Oct 8 2018,positive,though the film couldve benefited from more time to explain the importance of eddie and venoms bond to one another and the reason for their developing trust between each party i overall thought the film was a fun darker comedy with just enough insinuated violence to sell the fact that venom isnt quite what you call a good guy but not as evil as your typical over the top villian my fiance friends and i all had a great time and i would certainly recommend it to both fans and newcomers alike
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie has flaws like any other movie however it was enjoyable and very entertaining as always tom hardy displays his limitless range as an actor and is supported by a well rounded cast venom is great fun for the family with some memorable lol moments bring on a sequel 
Oct 8 2018,positive,not sure what movie the critics were seeing the start was a little slow but then the theater was laughing almost the entire rest of the time it was a fun movie and very different from others great movie and tom hardy was awesome
Oct 8 2018,positive,the story was a little complicated along with a lot of the fighting especially towards the end but this movie was so good and hardy does a great job of keeping it somewhat humorous that it deserves a high percent it kept me entertained and laughing with some scary parts but overall it was very exciting and thrilling
Oct 8 2018,positive,great family fun movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics dont seem to understand that this isnt a superhero movie a spiderman movie these critics dont understand what they are talking about
Oct 8 2018,positive,me and my friends enjoyed the movie a lot 
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont listen to the rotten tomatoes reviews this movie is a 10 out of 10
Oct 8 2018,positive,good time if you like hero action movies
Oct 8 2018,positive,dont waste your time reading the critics reviews  this movie was entertaining from the opening credits  i just wish it was longer  it might have been choppy at times but who cares i wasnt there to watch a masterpiece of film creation go see this movie also my kids loved it
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was not a bad movie i saw it personally the only problem was the story it lacked key details example where is spiderman spiderman is a key part of the venom story and for them to not envole spidey really was difficult for me to understand besides that it was a good movie and to be honest i think critics are giving it such a bad rating because sony made the movie and its only in association with marvel  which might explain why spidey didnt make an appearance
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are just wrong on venom very strong action special effects and humor everyone ive talked to that has seen it feels the same way go youll love it
Oct 8 2018,negative,pretty sloppy stuff interested in a sequel but the spiderman universe already needs some help to get back on track
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie sony and tom hardy did a great job bringing this character to the big screen
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome funny and with lot of action must see in theaters
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom was awesome i love the story line and the graphics were amazing go see it 
Oct 8 2018,positive,love the film tom hardys acting was spot on film just needed a little bit more of venom   but the film turned out better than i thought
Oct 8 2018,positive,much better than expected starts off slow but then picks up on par with doctor strange look forward to the sequel watched it thinking spiderman would have his hands full with venom lol
Oct 8 2018,positive,i do not get the bad critique venom has received i personally thought venom was a very funny movie it balanced humor sarcasm and action the acting was decent and believable i did not mind tom hardy as the main character and michelle williams was very good and likable as eddies love interest my biggest issue with this motion picture is the cgi in many scenes it seemed fake and ridiculous all in all i enjoyed this movie it was funny sarcastic the action was good and it had a charm in it i give it 45 stars
Oct 8 2018,positive,i always liked spiderman but venom is my new favorite character 
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it tom hardy did a great job and venom looked awesome 
Oct 8 2018,positive,nice movie tom hardy born for this everybody going at movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,bad boring waste of money venom is a cool character tho 
Oct 8 2018,positive,should have been r rated but the movie experience was great whats with the critics actually
Oct 8 2018,positive,venom is a great movie the first 10 to 15 minutes seemed very slow the relationship between eddie brock and venom is spot on overall venom is a very enjoyable comic book film well done sony
Oct 8 2018,positive,phenomenal job action was obviously going to be great some characters were ok at best but they really developed the most important character that being not eddie but the venom symboite 
Oct 8 2018,negative,its fine theres a plot and the back and forth between eddie and venom is hilarious but the action is mediocre and the usual shaky cam along with this development for the characters dont seem to happen a change in their attitude just happens and all actors other than hardy seem either miscast or not giving their all 
Oct 8 2018,positive,hardy was great venom looked really cool they made it work entertaining  sometimes thats all you need 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i think that the critics of this website arw assholes my sister wasnt waiting for a venom movie because she didnt know that venom existed and now she is a fan i think that the movie is very good but im not a critic so fuck it
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was everything i wanted from a venom movie growing up with the 90s cartoon 
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie liked the back story 
Oct 8 2018,positive,had very low expectations but came out super impressed absolutely loved it 1010
Oct 8 2018,positive,entertaining and fun take in venom works well with an audience that may not have ever really read vernon comics im looking forward to the sewer
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is a must see movie it was a great movie to me 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie cant wait to see more come out of this universe
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was good because it took me back when i first saw spider man 2 venom was a very cool character and i thought tom hardy did a pretty good performance
Oct 8 2018,negative,not a good movie its so bad it could be fun we are talking about that kind of bad tom hardy is ok but everything else is not the worst part is probably the plot but the script isnt good either the best part is the relationship between the simbiont and eddie brock but its not something amazing serviceable thats all
Oct 8 2018,positive,funny fun movie better than expected
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie has a great story and i cant wait
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy did well not the movie itself if the story is bad even greatest actors cant make it good
Oct 8 2018,positive,i never submit reviews hut rotten tomatoes is broken on this one or maybe lady gaga fans submitted a lot of false reviews venom was awesomeand i was skeptical from the previews if you like any other marvel movies youre going to love venom the theater clapped at the end
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was different then the comics i enjoyed it not sure what the complaint is about i liked it for what it is i hope they make a sequel 
Oct 8 2018,positive,enjoyed it so much i could have taken more biggest note is that it felt so dang rushed and the villain fell short of greatness but that was to be expected overall it was a great time at the movies  my fingers are crossed for that sequel despite the out of touch critics 
Oct 8 2018,positive,while it lacked the backstory that you would think necessary it actually worked  im gonna joke and say that its the prototype  movie that weve all been waiting for but i know we havent    in any case its actually a decent film pretty well made and far from the piece of shit that was the last jedi
Oct 8 2018,positive,better than the sam raimi kind of but still not the best but it is an enjoyable and funny and scary too
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie cant wait for the sequel these professional reviewers must have not got a cut follow the audience reviews
Oct 8 2018,positive,watched trailer hope its gonna bang
Oct 8 2018,positive,lets be straight this movie is pretty messy but at the same time is it worth your time and money id say yes if you are a marvel  venom fan but thats a tentative yes tom hardys performance is so overthetop and surprisingly good and there are a lot of great moments between him and venom and thats easily the best thing about the movie to me its decently funny and the action scenes are decent too but theres something missing the villain isnt anything to write home about and the script is all over the place this movie overall feels like its struggling to stay within the confines of a pg13 rating which i think hurts it overall and was a huge missed opportunity i think they should have gone with the rrating but its still a good time just an overly childish good time for this type of main character logan it aint
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy sets the tone for the series great start i dont know what critics were looking for its a setup for a bigger picture
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie blew me away this movie was amazingly original the way it was able to make you laugh out loud and crap your pants at the same time was incredible tom hardy gave an awe inspiring performances and captured eddy brock in full i have no idea how this move got less than 70 from critics im going to bet none of them read comics nor understand the characters in the slightest because this movie was great
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie but only watchable once
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie was very good and the critics are being very harsh on it obviously someone isnt a very big spiderman fan but if you are its a must watch tom hardy played the role just how it should have been played  cant wait for the second one  audience score proves my whole point  way better then the spiderman 3 verison of sam ramis venom this new venom is killing it especially with it being its own solo movie  go watch it if u havent
Oct 8 2018,positive,movie was pretty darn good much better than the critics said 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great fun for all ages i understand why critics dont like it it has its flaws and starts out a bit slow but once venom shows up it is a fun ride with good action and humor
Oct 8 2018,positive,nice ride dont over think the movie its for entertainment not to answer all the questions about the universe 
Oct 8 2018,neutral,excellent film  bradley cooper definitely didnt disappoint with his directorial debut the cast was great and the story was really good lady gaga definitely shocked me the most out of everyone in this film i knew that she could act but i have a new found respect for her acting skills after watching her performance in this film if you enjoy dramas and musicals then look no further the only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because that means that this is a perfect film close but no cigar 
Oct 8 2018,positive,this movie awesome yes never was few things that worent somewhat greatbut still for me the movie was very nicehope to see more of venom movies 
Oct 8 2018,positive,a little sloppy in the end but man o man alot of action comedy and heart from tom hardy who brings this film together
Oct 8 2018,positive,personal favorite movie of 2018
Oct 8 2018,negative,way to cheesey and silly

Oct 8 2018,positive,lots of fun great special effects good acting
Oct 8 2018,positive,absolutely loved it kept the right amount of action throughout the film
Oct 8 2018,positive,its hard for me to put it this way especially since its what people say about bad movies but this movie is fun the plot does have its issues but just because the movie isnt following the current super hero formula people are hating on it its a awesome adaptation of venom and eddie brock is played very well by hardy im going to the sequel and you should definitely see this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,fantastic movie a virtually perfect rendition of venom this version of venom would be a great addition to the mcu
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed this a hell of a lot more than i expected yes it was daft yes bits of it made no sense whatsoever yes the motorbike car chase scene was absolutely awful but it was fairly decent overall better than black panther or doctor strange in my opinion
Oct 8 2018,neutral,i didnt hate it like i was expecting to
Oct 8 2018,negative,venom is a paintbynumbers studiomade heartless comic book movie but at least is not boring to watch tom hardy makes the best of whats given to him and its possibly the only highlight of the film
Oct 8 2018,positive,the movie is amazing i dont care what the others say people are being injust to this movie and criticizing a lot
Oct 8 2018,positive,idk why all the critics are slamming this movie it was actually one of the best marvel movies that ive seen in a while its not like the overbearing malt action heavy avengers saga its actually much more entertaining and interesting the story development was quite magnificent for a comic book movie and the mix between darkness and humor wasnt cringey like i was expecting go watch it and lets get a venom 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,wow awesome movie to see very different than the traditional superhero movie love the real world dark aspect of it funny how the critics give it a low rating but the people give it a high one trust the people 
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a pretty good movie enjoyable and a great connection between venom and eddie brock
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved it starts out creepy and turns completely hilarious totally unexpected and very fresh had no idea where the story was going and didnt want it to end hardy is perfect for venom will see it again my 13 yr old son my 15 yr old daughter and my 17 yr old boy all loved it right up there with thor ragnarok for us 
Oct 8 2018,positive,loved the way venom is portayed with the conversations between eddie and venom eager to see the next one
Oct 8 2018,positive,very much enjoyed the love story between eddie and venom plot and logic vise the movie was not strong but the main focus of the movie on those two made it up to me
Oct 8 2018,positive,i thought it was good overall we can only hope the second one will be better 
Oct 8 2018,positive,love it  not top notch but watchable  whats with the top critics  thats what happen when clowns review  get them outtta here 
Oct 8 2018,positive,i think the movie was really fun of course there was many absurd plot decisions just like in any  superhero movie but overall i really enjoyed the movie and the characters tom hardys humor and venoms hilarious moments as a pop culture fest this movie is quite good
Oct 8 2018,positive,awesome movie highly recommended critics are wrong again 
Oct 8 2018,positive,good venom movie fantastic acting by tom hardy 
Oct 8 2018,positive,it is a great movie tom hardys performance is brilliant and the way venom interacts is really unique 
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are critics because they are generally salty about anything and love to have a platform this is a comic book movie what are they expecting it was a pretty enjoyable movie for what it was dont expect it to be a masterpiece of a film and storyline that will be worthy of multiple oscars its a comic book movie 
Oct 8 2018,positive,critics are fake news i really recommend this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,great time it got dumber as it went along but its good unpretentious and likable fun tom hardy was incredible to watch 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie loved it dont argue
Oct 8 2018,positive,the critics are dumb venom was such a good movie it was funny and the character is meant to be chaotic in his fight scenes he is ruthless which i loved
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics if youre into marvel you will like this movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,its good movie i loved itjust dissappointed on final battle with riot too short and not intenseand also i prefer it than tlj pretty much

Oct 8 2018,positive,this was a very good movie and thats from a 76 year old lady i hope there will be a second one and soon
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie the score and timing of soundtrack amazing tom hardy changed sony
Oct 8 2018,positive,i am flabbergasted by the low critic score on here  the movie was very entertaining and full of action and laughs  it is no surprise the audience score is so high on here the critics are very out of touch in this one
Oct 8 2018,positive,slight problems with the plot and pacing but overall it was enjoyable the relationship between eddie and venom was the absolute gem of this film
Oct 8 2018,positive,its definitely not perfect but very entertaining
Oct 8 2018,positive,for 1st install and building the story it was great a must see in 3d a marvel new series cant wait for venom 2
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing lit af awesomesuperb lit lit
Oct 8 2018,positive,came in with zero expectations was blown away not perfect but incredibly fun and thrilling
Oct 8 2018,negative,looking at this movie as a whole and not just at the parts that appeal to just entertain venom falls short of its potential at being a solid origin story and solo entry for the comic book character its lack of substance to the characters and the storyline is replaced with shallow action sequences and poor writing and character development the use of amazing actors like michelle williams and riz ahmed as nothing more then wooden pawn pieces is such a missed opportunity even with tom hardy giving such a strong performance as venoms counterpart eddie brock wasnt enough to steady this sinking ship to say that this movie is enjoyable is up to ones own discretion which is totally acceptable yet viewing this movie as a fellow audience goer the honest truth is that venom is nothing but spectacle if thats all that it takes to satisfy then by all means for those who are searching for something of real substance unfortunately this is not the movie for us
Oct 8 2018,positive,much better than what the critics give it credit for  definitely worth the watch  cant wait for a sequel 
Oct 8 2018,positive,great movie i cant wait for the second one
Oct 8 2018,positive,not a bad movie at all  venom  riot and eddie are the best parts but the movie has all around good characters as a fan of the comics i think they did a good job
Oct 8 2018,negative,it makes me sad that disney keeps destroying marvel movies the writing was amateur the lines were cheesy the movie was predictable a few good action scenes i walked out feeling like i wasted my money to see this in the theater
Oct 8 2018,positive,really liked it i think it could have been better with a r rating 
Oct 8 2018,positive,tom hardy combined with venom is the best possible team up youd ever find insanely good acting on tom hardys part and the craziest ruthless character venom fit make the movie exciting to watch venoms cgi is on point but the rest of the movie seems a little dark with other cgi characters missing out on their vfx a good amount of laughs and superb action sequences carry the movie forward michelle williams and riz ahmed are too be credited too all in all the movie is does fall short in script writing and definite plot since it took sony less than a year to make the film it is a great watch a really likeable tom hardy and venom
Oct 8 2018,positive,not bad not good entertainment to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie dont listen to the critics go see it and form your own opinion i think you will have a good time watching it tom hardy as eddievenom is fantastic seeing venom in full on fight scenes is so fun to watch
Oct 8 2018,positive,a good film with a few negatives but i would definitely watch it again
Oct 8 2018,positive,never understand the critic the movie just awesome
Oct 8 2018,positive,amazing fun great action symbiote cracked me up with several laugh out loud one liners took the whole family and we had a blast what is wrong with prof critics they have no clue anymore what is good and what isnt listen to the peoplethis movie is great 
Oct 8 2018,positive,spoilers you have been warned    what i didnt like   it didnt follow the source material i understand that there are liberties and all that but they deffinately could have done a better job as far as following the source material goes if you know the comics then you will understand what im talking about here  the way venom looked  for the most part he looked ok im talking mostly about his face it just seemed rushed and a bit flat for me i prefer how he looked in spiderman 3   how likeable venom is right off the bat again source material eddie brock fought with the symbiote at first then succumbed to the power and revenge blaming spiderman for his troubles  how the movie didnt even hint at where in the timeline it related to spiderman again again source material like does this movie take place before spiderman or during the time spiderman dissapeared due to thanos or in the comics spiderman is the very first to have venom  woody fucking harrelson as cletus kasadycarnage not a fan of the choice but they got the hair right so really its just a personal preference hes not psycho feeling enough hes just weird  the boss battle was anticlimactic with all the hype they gave riot being in this film the final fight was shortlived and underwhelming when venom says hes got shit youve never seen i got excited but it was anticlimactic and i deff wanted more    what i did like  the story as a standalone if i ignore the source material for a min which is very difficult for me they did a great job telling their own version of the story it flowed it wasnt just trying to be dark and brooding and shit it felt like a marvel movie it had its dark parts such as dismemberment actiony parts such as car chases things catching on fire and fight scenes and it had its funny parts such as the dialog between venom and eddie brock  stan lee cameo it was cute and always makes me smile in this one hes just walking a tiny dog and venom asks whos that guy after stan lee tells brock that one day he will get his ex back or something  eminems song he did a really good job with it the video is really good too except one guy staring directly into the camera the whole bit he had the symbiote  the casting i feel they did a great job casting the roles to the right people the actors did a great job  the banterdialog between characters it felt natural and not forced most of the time it was between eddie brock and venom it was mostly funny and eddie brock trying to understand the symbiote trying to rationalize everything with a tiny bit of fear mixed in but not enough  how they made the symbiotes look and how everything revolved around liquids i know its difficult to make liquids look natural in cgi and they did a great job and they made the symbiotes look awsome in the containment units and when they were bonding to people  the colors and atmospheres used to add to wtf was going on it helped to put me in the moment  the scene between carlton drake and lil girl character when entertaining a school field trip a little girl raised her hand and every other kid told her to cut that shit out he told her not to let anyone silence her or her questions because the ones who ask questions and want to learn will be the ones who change the world it was cute and somewhat inspiring   they didnt mind throwing dismemberment and swears into the mix with the pg13 rating i was worried that this movie wouldnt have venom eating people or swears or anything good a few people get their heads bitten off and some get threatened with dismemberment and they throw a few fbombs in there i liked it      overall again as a standalone movie i really liked it i gave it a 4 star rating   but if i were to throw in the source material i would give it a 25 or 3 star rating     i recommend you see it for yourself though
Oct 8 2018,positive,i loved it most the people giving it bad ratings are old tom hardy did an excellent job as venom a huge upgrade from the spiderman 3 venom lol
Oct 8 2018,positive,if you put the obviously weak script poor dialogs and casting choices for a couple of key roles aside the movie is quite a fun ride the lord and savior here is the uber talented tom hardy if and when theres a venom 2 im hoping theyll make it an r rated movie i mean what fun is it making a pg13 with carnage in it
Oct 8 2018,positive,good movie overall the villian is meh and the love story is a little unnecessary at times but venom is very well done not perfect but definitely not as bad as these critics give it crap for keep in mind these are the same hollywood asshats that gave the last jedi 910 if you were gonna go see before dont let their review scare you away please id highly recommend
Oct 8 2018,positive,despite what critics say about it its an amazing movie with lots of great acting and some parts of comedy dont listen to critics go watch the movie
Oct 8 2018,positive,it was a slow start but it was funny  had great fights
Oct 8 2018,positive,from beginning to end this movie was fun interesting easy to follow comedic and yet wasnt for kids the film had no plot holes or unanswered questions it had a nice wrap up but also clear set up for sequels the relationship between eddie and venom was developed without being overly complex it was fun to see them interact and grow throughout the movie never once did the audience feel awkward after a joke or tense after a romantic scene the film followed suit to the comics with characters and quotes and fit perfectly into the new age mcu with humor and stan lee camios all of the characters were fantastic and the actor chosen fit perfectly for the roles over all i would see this movie again and eventually own it great job sony for once
Oct 8 2018,positive,once again critics wrong
Oct 8 2018,positive,surprisingly humorous skits with exceptional leaps  bound movessimilar to spiderman yet interesting costume mask with large sized tongue separated the two characters costumes although decent cast of acting fortunately both tom hardy and michelle williams performed wonderfully in vulnerable scenes and equally attractive in romantic momentswith a charming end of movie separation appreciated the creative story of life foundation theme fantastic architectural building design and stages of chaos flashes in the streets another marvel miracle
Oct 8 2018,positive,good action storyline plot character and humor
Oct 8 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie quite a bit do i think it was on par with other marvel films no but i will stick it in the deadpool universe as a fun standalone
Oct 8 2018,positive,im so glad i didnt listen to the critics and went to see this movie i loved it tom hardy is so sexy so id probably love it even if it sucked just because hes in it but it didnt it was funny action packed and fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,was hesitant to go watch this after the percentage it was receiving and the reviews however i wanted to watch this movie as venom was one of my favorite villains in the spiderman universe i definitely agree that the plot and certain elements in the movie didnt work but i have to admit i did enjoy hardys portrayal as well as venoms the humor was fun and did make me laugh several times with that said though that first half of the movie felt prolonged boring and overall unnecessary something else could have easily replaced it and i still would have known what was going on in the film
Oct 7 2018,positive,i made a rotten tomatos account just to give a good rating for venom very fun movie and kept me entertained yeah the script was a little wonky and id love to see it rated r but overall i think it has been unfairly bashed by the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,top notch acting good pacing and will watch again in 3d
Oct 7 2018,positive,wasnt as bad as people made it out to be very entertaining and i would 1010 see it again cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,its actually good sure its not a great movie but not as bad as the critics says either
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved the mix of comedy and action tom hardy was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,wanted to go to the premiere hesitated because of critics  went after 3 days regret that i hesitated waiting for extended version
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really liked venom while tom hardy was amazing as always riz ahmeds weak portrayal of carlton drake and michelle williams poor acting took a toll on the film and dragged the film down a bit the film overall was thoroughly enjoyable
Oct 7 2018,positive,first of allit has its flaws here and there and some disappointment  but its overall a great movie that i would see again
Oct 7 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie and venom is both fun and entertaining go watch it for yourself if youre curious ignore the critics this time
Oct 7 2018,negative,such a slow movie  not worth the money at all  terrible acting very little action  dont waste your time
Oct 7 2018,positive,seriously dont understand why critics are hating on this movie so much   it is a fun popcorn flick yeah its hardly deep and thought provokingbut not every movie has to be akin to citizen kane
Oct 7 2018,positive,delta so bad its good type of movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,when i go see a superhero movie im not expecting a future award nominated film im expecting a fun experience andor guilty pleasure and venom absolutely delivered im not seeing any reason to hate or bash it not giving it 5 stars because it wasnt exactly epic however i throughly enjoyed the movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,seriously dont listen to the b s criticism the movie is effing fantastic the movie feels like it goes by fast because its crazy fun great mix of venoms comic humor and action and tom hardy kills it at eddie brock lots of sweet refrences venom always been one of my favorite characters and even those they didnt go with canon story arc its still great they even explain away new york in one sentence and it works amazing movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,good intro story much better movie than the critics say
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom so many snacks so little time    tom hardy as eddie brock has done an excellent job of portraying a man taken by a parasite  a parasite that has a mind of its own the movie begins with an introduction to eddie brock and the nature of his work as a reporter and you know he is all in where his work is concerned he will go any lengths to get his scoop even sneak into his loved ones emails  of course he gets his scoop but along with that he also loses his job apartment and girlfriend  yet there he is right outside a store paying 20 for a newspaper that is free  parallely symbiotes have made their way to our planet via the life foundation space craft the craft crash lands in malaysia and an emergency team reaches the spot to ensure that there arent too many causalities the team finds the symbiotes that are captured and an astronaut who is barely alive but not really one of the symbiotes escapes and manages to wreak a riot while riot ensues scream agony and venom make it to the life foundation lab in san francisco as the name suggests symbiotes need a host and lfl begins experiments with animals the moment there is a spark of success drake wants to begin working with human specimens  carlton drake played by riz ahmed is the ceo of the life foundation he is a young man who isnt just possessed by the need to succeed but clearly suffers from a severe case of hypermetropia induced by megalomaniacal tendencies this though has been evident all along his scientists continue their pursuit of greater good until the experiments begin on humans and it results in a moral dilemma for one of his scientists  reporter eddie brock finds himself in the lfl at the behest of the whistle blower only to find himself hosting venom  what happens next is a ton of action a thrilling chase sequence hot flushes and cold sweat that makes one sit in an aquarium in the middle of a restaurant and eat a live lobster it could have been a cray fish correct me if im wrong now for those with a weak stomach  be warned there are more such barf inducing scenes from the very beginning of the movie my friend and i had no problems as we sat eating popcorn and sipping coke while heads vanished and faces were being licked slurp   the movie progresses beautifully and it is a movie i thoroughly enjoyed the movie is fast paced the story is rushed but if you are attentive youll know and understand whats happening if you have read the comics good for you and like me if you havent read them go along with someone who has like i did  after watching this movie one thing is clear antiheroes are here to stay tom hardy michelle williams riz ahmed jenny slate scott haze and reid scott have all managed to makes us love admire hate like hate and amuse throughout the movie  the movie does have a buddy cop feel to it with several laughs along the way some terrible jokes dont quite make the mark but for the most part the jokes are actually funny i especially loved venomeddie interaction  i am now looking forward to the eddie  venom  anne love triangle in the sequel yes there is definitely going to be a sequel for those making plans to watch the movie stay back for the scene before the credits roll and for the sneakpeak post credits  my recommendation dont go by what the critics have to say if you really want to sit back and unwind go for this movie  rating 395
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was very entertaining and it had the right amount of action
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was a fantastic movie it stuck to an original style and wasnt too jokey or to serious it was just right and absolutely amazing especially the kiss exceptwhy didnt they make the girl version beefed as well like come on still loved it though
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed this rendition of venom  i am not sure why the critics think its chaotic noisy or in need of a stronger attachment to spiderman  i felt it did a great job giving fans references while staying a stand alone film  i love the dynamic between eddie and venom  i felt they did a great job feeding off each other
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun fast paced rompand love  funny sarcastic symbiot
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was by far one of the best marvel in resent years it was more comicly accurate than the mcu beautifully filmed and cjied and had plot for dayyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzz the fighting was well done god everything was well done and anyone who says it needs more spiderman is stupid and a fake fan spider man wishes he was venom this rating is dumb the critics are dumb the movie however was genius those concluding my rant fight me
Oct 7 2018,positive,the animation off the symbiotes was incredibly well done and venoms voice was so good 
Oct 7 2018,positive,violent and dark enough to be a dc film but also funny and entertaining like a marvel film yet somehow neither  if you are a fan of the antihero very deadpool esque genre this is a must see and an interesting take on one of spidermans best villains
Oct 7 2018,positive,love it so much fun critics are idiots lol
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy played a nice work on it
Oct 7 2018,negative,its hilariously bad very cheezy bad story and serviceable cgi truly another movie to add to the daredevilelektracatwoman level superhero movies the only entrainment youll get out of this if by logging at the movie not with it
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy was great in this movie and its a good time overall the writing brings this down a little bit but its still worth seeing 
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics disgruntled and audience in a applause my feelings are with the latter camp
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is a lot fun ignore the critics bozos
Oct 7 2018,negative,loud noises and indecipherable cgi effects do not a movie make
Oct 7 2018,positive,i feel somewhat conflicted about venom which i suppose is rather apt one the one hand the script was sloppy the plot predictable and the film took a long time explaining itself poorly a few of the performances felt somewhat phoned in and the films tone was all over the place it did make me laugh though and some of the conflict between brock and his alien parasite was brilliant  hardy did a great job of acting the dual role there were genuine moments of brilliance in the film but then there were also many ameteur moments too the final battle could have been better  as it is its a bit of a confusing cgi mess of tentacles and slime where its hard to see whats happening overall i wouldnt say the film is bad as such  if you leave your brain at the door it is fairly entertaining hopefully they employ some better scriptwriters for the inevitable sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,really enjoyable i would suggest this to anybody that likes comic book movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,even though it may not have been as great as if marvel had all rights   this movie does very well in its own and the critic score is far too harsh
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved every minute of it great family fun all three my kids want to see it again including me
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie had its issues but overall works very entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,im really starting to wonder about whether i can ever trust the critics reviews first they were way off on the last jedi and now they were way off on this one this was a really fun movie and kept me entertained all the way through it starts off slow but that was appreciated as it helped the audience to understand the character better cmon critics step your game up
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie if your a true marvel fan you will enjoy this movie it may not have the best writing however it does have a good mix of comedy action and even a little bit of love 
Oct 7 2018,positive,so it was okay but it felt like a bro comedy  not gritty enough
Oct 7 2018,positive,all around fun to watch hardy did great as usual  venom and his voice were awesome left the movie wanting to see more of their shenanigans
Oct 7 2018,positive,i have seen bad superhero movies and venom is definitely not bad although sadly it is not good either it is riddled with plot holes and nonsensical choices made by their characters who have close to no development watching the movie you get the feeling they should have completely cut off its first 15 minutes and used that time to add some more time for eddie to interact with venom and form s legitimate bond between them one strong enough to justify the symbiote betraying its entire race and deciding to stay on earth at least
Oct 7 2018,positive,actually a really fun movie the relationship between eddie and venom is so entertaining the plot is kinda basic but its an enjoyable ride i honestly would highly recommend this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved venom tom hardy was great a fresh take on super hero movies and reminded me of deadpool mixed with a typical marvel movie the critics reviews dont do this movie justice 
Oct 7 2018,positive,fok all the critics is an awesome movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,its fun not really venom but still not bad
Oct 7 2018,positive,its an enjoyable film with way more humor than i was expecting and not compromising on the dark and evil side of this beloved character venom it is a basic script that is easy to follow just like deadpool 1 was too but it lets you follow along easy without having to over think
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont care the movie was pretty good in my opinion the acting tom hardy did was great he really played it will and i am excited and hope to see a sequel out of this movie im not sure about other people but seems like they might have a symbiote up their ass
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont believe the critics on this one   venom is no masterpiece but it sure is a well made well acted exciting superhero movie with great stunts effects and cast   a spiderman cameo would have made it 810 some other ties to the greater marvel universe like a deadpoolvulturej jonah jamesonblack cat cameo might have made it 9 or even 10
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie dont understand why the critics gave it such bad reviews i recommend seeing it dont listen to these losers
Oct 7 2018,positive,had a good pace the duo between venom and eddie brock was unique and made character development humorous the antagonist seemed truly evil action was great and i want more
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun movie interesting take on venom definitely doesnt deserve that critic score 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont get why so many people dislike this movie it was great and easily one of my favorite movies venom also looks awesome in this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,solid movie great in 3d  imax
Oct 7 2018,positive,fantastic loved the banter between eddie and venom glad to see stan back in his cameo 
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movies waiting to see 2nd part
Oct 7 2018,positive,why was this movie so poorly reviewed i enjoyed it as did my wife it was funny had a unique vibe and was a lot of fun do yourself a favor and go see it
Oct 7 2018,positive,so much fun to watch kind of a slow start but ive it got moving it got exciting surprisingly funny tom hardy did a great job looking forward to venom2 
Oct 7 2018,positive,after seeing all the reviews i was skeptical but overall it was great it didnt exactly follow the comic to screen directly but its hard to do with these characters action and humor with that little bit of romance had really aspired to be a true marvel movie i would recommend watching it to get your own view because it is worth watching
Oct 7 2018,positive,they lyin this movie was beyond tough 
Oct 7 2018,positive,everything you want from a comic book movie so greattwo thumbs way up
Oct 7 2018,positive,room for improvement but was a pretty badass movie overall the main antagonist wasnt a good fit and sorta broke the immersion which was my biggest gripe great job on the venom cgi and tone of his character though not too corny wish it was r rated especially if they include carnage in the next movie itll need it  great popcorn flick if youre not a symbiote fan like me my girl liked it too all in all it is up there in my top favorite marvel movies but im a fan of the venom and carnage comics so theres a bit of bias there
Oct 7 2018,negative,very disappointed did not deserve the venom name it could have been called space parasite man and made more sense even then it was uninspired and bland it seemed like all of their budget went to hiring tom hardy
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie ignore critic reviews
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it i only hope sony lets mcu use venom and even better carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a good movie  but not great
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is why i dont trust critics far from a masterpiece but still a pretty good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,seems that critics dont know that venom is exactly what theyre complaining about chaotic noisy brutal and incoherent venom is not a super hero he is antihero so i think is really dumb to think that the movie was going to be like spiderman or the avengers instead of thinking of him as some kind of unique combination between deadpool and the predator
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy filled the role of eddie brock very well the movie proves that venom really can be a standalone character in his own right do not listen to critics and the reviews they post while sipping on their favorite wine in an expensive villa somewhere for the everyday comic lovingaction movie appreciating person the movie is a fun and satisfying adventure
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing cgi and lovely movie sony tried
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie worth the watch if youre a fan
Oct 7 2018,positive,better meowvie than the critics are saying go meow this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was fabulous   well done   and worth watching
Oct 7 2018,positive,pretty good action movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,its not as dark as i thought it was going to be but has to be light so it can be mix with spiderman but enjoy the movie fun time can be had if you take the comic book out of it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,a funky love comedy with venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved the action and the duality between eddie and venom i thought the antagonist was meh but the visuals were really well done the laughs were there as to keep the movie from taking itself too seriously it could have bumped itself to an r rating with an antihero like venom but either way i enjoyed it and ill get the bluray when it comes out or digital purchase dont know why the critics dont like it but whenever there is a difference between critics and audiences chances are its a great movie great start sony its an origin story so now you just have to improve on the next one
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics have got this one wrong tom hardy is in great form as eddie brock the down on his luck investigative reporter in whom venom finds the perfect host im grateful that spiderman was nowhere near this film as some critics have pined for the spiderman movies have been disastrous in my opinion and none more so than the latest reboot with tom holland  venom and hardy do just fine in this movie which is more enjoyable than any spiderman flick that has gone before it  in fact this is the most enjoyable comic adaptation ive seen in years  ignore the critics and go have a blast at the theater
Oct 7 2018,positive,ive been a fan of the character venom since i saw him on the spiderman 90s animated series let me be honest it is a good popcorn sifi action film this film goes towards those fans that identify themselves with venom and eddie brock as a characer who is disappointed with the unfairness of society scientific control and selfishness to become a better character     full of action the dialogue is ok excellent special effects it was not a good a idea that takes place at san francisco but new york is mentioned i think the low rating  has been receiving  is because it goes towards that line in my world i am a loser i hear audience disappointed reaction and we all agree no sir  you are not you are the most amazing character in the spiderman universe filmmakers should fix that line is stabbing the film best anti hero film so far ive seen not recommended for spiderman fans
Oct 7 2018,positive,my whole family loved the movie my son and i would go watch it again now if he did not have school and i did not have work tomorrow
Oct 7 2018,positive,better than what i was expecting but wasnt expecting much 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was not bad at all the critics here are right out to lunch
Oct 7 2018,positive,normally i side with critics but i actually liked this movie granted it had its problems but overall i really enjoyed the it i couldnt disagree more with the critic rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you go in knowing that this is a venomverse aka no spiderman and do not listen to any critic reviews before hand you will actually enjoy the movie for what it is its an action film with some comedic scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of marvels finest 
Oct 7 2018,positive,not bad but the bond between eddie and the symbiote was quite comic accurate
Oct 7 2018,positive,i liked itit was a good stand alone movie the comic fan boys and girls wont like it but considering the sony track recordits a winner
Oct 7 2018,positive,i rarely write a review but critics were so harsh with this movie that i feel i need to write    summary fun to watch packed with action and love venomcgi story wise is very straight forward and could have spent more time to build up the characters    1 script this is a new ip it doesnt have the build mcu super hero movies have eg 10 years of mcu it is unfair to compare it with any mcu movie this reminds me of the first iron man or capitan america fun packed with action and a straight forward story that will keep you entertained hope that for the sequel they pick an approach similar to deadpool r and more packed with unconventional decisions on behalf of the simbiote  2 acting actors all amazing especially eddie only really bad ones are eddies girlfriend her expressions contradict her feelings and the lab assistant of life just bad acting  3 length although is great 140 maybe they could have spent 20 more minutes to build up the characters eg  the relationship between the bad guy and venom  4 effects only one problem with the cgi sometimes it looks too shiny and doesnt blend well with the enviroment
Oct 7 2018,positive,cool movie with bad ending so bad
Oct 7 2018,positive,although it was pretty loud and some parts lacked in plot the movie in general was pretty good the acting was good and the cgi was pretty nice although some parts looked lousy especially the fight from venom vs riot were the cgi was a bit off and on and the fight felt way too fast to be seen in general the movie was good and i would recommend anyone to watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is a delightful
Oct 7 2018,positive,no matter what these critics  say negatively about this movie it was enjoyable to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,by far the best venom movie tom hardy did a phenomenal job no one could have done it better cant wait for the sequal with woodie harrelson finally marvel made a great origin movie that isnt super cliche it was witty the dialogue between venom and eddie was executed perfectly had unique car chase scenes that fit the characteristics of the persons involved and great casting negatives choppy start subtitles for when they were in malaysia annes hair biblical referances are so overdone and a deeper why as to venom changing his mind about saving the human race because of eddie there was not a strong hero and a strong villian but at the same time this is an origin filmthe sequal with carnage will be add more back story as well as provide that strong herovillian plot that we all desire
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy and venom together are a perfect match clever comedy and awesome cgi make the movie a must see
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film it started off really slow i enjoyed the action scenes was it the best written film hell no it wasnt that being said i do love that they made this a completely different universe and not connected to the mcu there were some really funny moments in this film as well if they do a sequel i hope they are able to include some spidermanwoman in it would love to see venom vs spidey in a film one day i dont think the mcu is going to be using him any time soon the critics were too hard on this film i would probably give it a 758 out of 10 i think they are grading it at around a 32 or something like that
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was great seeing the character venom brought to the big screen after seeing the movie it was much better that the critics reviews i read please see this movie for your self i must say i was pleasantly surprised at well it was presented
Oct 7 2018,positive,wow the critics were so wrong this movie was so much fun just a good movie with great actors doing an awesome job they kept it simple and delivered on a good time i will be going back to see it at least two more times with family and friends side note why did rt make it so we can only type reviews in caps
Oct 7 2018,positive,such a great dark thrill ride for the superhero universe
Oct 7 2018,positive,as a lifelong venom fan and after reading a handful of reviews i went into this film already heartbroken before a single frame hit the screenalso my recliner was broken in my assigned seatseemed to be a theme of disappointment after the credits began to roll my son and i looked at each other in disbeliefnot because of the movie we just watched but how the reviews and backlash were so wrong lets get the agreements the cgi was not great in places there were a few character development beats that were left on the cutting room floor or cut for a pg13 fit and the marketing for this film sold it as something it wasnt this is not a horror movie it is not a scifi movie its not a buddy movie its not a dark comedy its all of them there were no unintentional laughs each moment that made me laugh or chuckle was written for that purpose not some edgy bit that played wrong as usual the last bit of baddie vs goodie was a sloppy fist fight in the darkand it is evident that budget wise that most of the creature moments were going to be in the dark so as not to worry about perfection i enjoyed this movie and was not let down in the slightest the pacing was fine the cgi and the action were entertaining and brock and venom were perfect playing off each other the only shortcoming this film had for me was that same part there were some character motivations for eddie and venom that i cant help but feel felt more full with the 3040 minutes worth of film that hardy said was trimmed outsome of his favorite parts go see this movie it is a dark comedy with scifi and horror elements its also a comic book origin movie which while different than the comic origins works just fine remember the ultimate spiderman comic book line that everyone was in love with that was a completely different origin too that people were pleased with
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a great and fun movie kept my attention the whole time would watch again
Oct 7 2018,positive,i absolutely enjoyed this movie and feel like the critics are setting a way too high level of expectation in regards to movies yeah there is some things that are bit different but i felt like tom hardy captured molded into eddie brockvenom perfectly and by far this is the best venom we have since the animated version of venom from spiderman if people do not like this movie based on their own personal experience then thats fine but looking at critics scores is giving me that feeling like there is a lot of bias towards this movie anyways i enjoyed every minute and i gotta give a lot of praise and respect to tom hardy and the cast for making an awesome movie regardless of pg13 or r rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,a great movie that was both action and comedy and leave you on the edge of your chair
Oct 7 2018,positive,a lot of fun funny when it needed to be and like the originality of the story yeah spiderman is missing and its set in san francisco but its really good i would definitely watch it again and to be honest i think i might nice surprise for the 1st stinger by the way sony
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie really suffered free m the lack of an r rating im inter stew in watching the cut 40 min of the film not sure how they are planning to do do carnage played by woody harrelson in movie 2 as pg13 over all worth the theatre trip not sure what the critics were expecting but they clearly didnt get the movie
Oct 7 2018,negative,total paint by numbers plot and story i added the half star for the hand full of decent laughs 
Oct 7 2018,positive,oh man was i ever sad that this thing wasnt rated r nevertheless i dismissed my initial apprehensions about this tamed beast as well as the unflattering reviews it received and entered the theater calmly and with an open mind two hours later i departed the theater relatively surprised  it actually wasnt bad for a pg13 venom its not a bad movie and its not a total mess as some critics claim it to be the movie does have some unanswered questions but it is not incoherent the voice personality and visuals given to venom are fantastic tom hardy is phenomenally natural and relaxed in his performance and michelle williams lends a strong supporting presence the portrayal of the lead villain however is a bit lacking in strength and intimidation personally though my primary problem with the film as can be expected is simply that it couldve been better  it shouldve been rated r almost every fight scene seemed like it was cut short the film has many sequences of violence that clearly felt censored and toned down in the theater it was like i was watching a tv version of an rrated movie with scenes cut out to make it passable to air on cable while the movie is actually pretty good overall for what it is it also stands as strong evidence to support that venom is truly an rrated characterlike deadpool and the punisher
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant let me make it simple for you guys just like rober downy jr owns iron man persona and tobey maguire owns spiderman persona in a very familiar way tom hardy too owns venom persona he is a great actor by the way if you have seen his performance in batman dark knight rises great script writing with funny to very funny instances at the right places really am looking forward to introduction of next character carnage in the upcoming sequel all the best guys great work here would have been interesting to see if venom were a part of avengers team
Oct 7 2018,positive,pretty good its all right 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was definitely better than any scores ive seen the main cons are in the supporting characters anne drake with very little motivation they just felt flat it was also very obviously supposed to be rated something different  something was missing and it didnt feel whole but it was a fun movie and tom hardy was great the relationship between him and venom was very good
Oct 7 2018,positive,im surprised to see this judged so harshly by the critics it was enjoyable i would watch it again better than the dc movies recently and almost as good as the marvel movies 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a hell yeah good introduction love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,although the majority of the critics rated this movie as subpar i would advocate if you are a marvel fan it is worth taking the time to watch it there are a few intro scenes that could have been left out but the dialogue between tom hardy and venom make the movie i went into the movie expecting an action filled story with alot of character development and that is exactly what i got the first hour is similar to captain america the first avenger but the action sequences are entertaining overall it quenched my thirst for superhero fantasy until the next blockbuster arrives i recommend watching it but dont feel like you will regret not seeing it theaters my only recommendation worth noting is that venom should be rated r and allow for more foreviolence
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was very entertaining it made me laugh of course there were some storyline problems but thats expected when spiderman isnt included it was way better than spiderman 3 go for entertainment and to get away from reality
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun and action packed really enjoyable film
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a fun movie and everty time eddievenom was on the screen it was enjoyably exciting and hilarious
Oct 7 2018,negative,awful flickjust awfula waste of tom hardy who is normally without peer
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom movie is great paid critics are idiots
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie with a nice mix of comedy action and interesting story line highly recommend fun for everyone rotten tomatoes scores are idiotic on most movies idiots
Oct 7 2018,negative,worst movie since justice league no good plotpoorly written 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is its own unique movie it sets itself apart from what we are used to seeing i for one loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,besides a few really corny lines and a really slow start this movie is what you expect out of venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,great acting  interesting story and prett entertaining  tom hardy brought a great deal of realism to his character if youre on the fence check it out its a fun movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was really good actually i loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,these reviews are ridiculous i thought it was awesome
Oct 7 2018,negative,in an interview with comics explained the films star tom hardy revealed that some 30 to 40 minutes of weird venom stuff got removed from the finished film in response to the question what was your favorite scene to film hardy replied tom hardy    most of the content of this movie was cut and it was obvious  the cgi was bad and the story didnt flow too well stay away              theyre scenes that arent in this movie there are like 30 to 40 minutes worth of scenes that arent in this movie all of them mad puppeteering scenes dark comedy scenes you know what i mean they just never made it in
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know what to say except we are venom  venom was so entertaining i wish the movie was longer to incorporate more venomeddie conversations i hope the movie does really well so we can get another one     spoiler warning    the carnage tease at the end was pretty cool but the spideyverse tease was out of place
Oct 7 2018,positive,disputes all the bad reviews from critics and the fact spiderman isnt in this movie i went to watch venom and i love it it was a great movie idk what ppl are talking about lol i am really lost i think critics sometimes go into movies but picking everything instead of watching and enjoying the movie could it have been an r rated movie yup would that have made it better yup but no need to cry about it i hope this movie gets a second chance with tom hardy because he really is the perfect venom and i would love to see him fight spider man  but this should have been r rated like spawn should always be r rated great movie though 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a good movie treat ya self and go watch it
Oct 7 2018,negative,terrible story  terrible dialogue  terrible acting  terrible soundtrack    as far as im concerned they can just start passing out these comic book movies as dvds in the comic book stores and skip the theater    what a stain on humanity
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was really entertaining wish it was longer but still good  the turd in the wind
Oct 7 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the film hardy was made to play venom my only challenge was the many unanswered questions at the end which i am hoping will be resolved in the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,not sure why all the hate i loved this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,nice movie this vemon reminds me the one from spiderman for psxn64
Oct 7 2018,positive,love it i went with my 7yr old who i always end up regreting taking he was initially not too amused but about 20min in he loved it too
Oct 7 2018,positive,best movie and funny movie of all time
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is great wonder black comedy sci fi drama horror mix dont listen to the critics smart funny clever and a little bit wacky and scary great campy good time go see it
Oct 7 2018,positive,im not expect anything before i watch it cz the critics but this is a good movie and not that bad and this movie also funny they put the joke well
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom isnt what you expect from the comics but the movie definantly delivers it was a little slow getting started but man once it got started there was no stopping venom managed to have my eyes glued to the screen the moment the action started i dont understand why rt gave it such a low rating when obviously the audience liked it if you scrolled through reviews to see what other people gave it all i can say is dont listen to the media critics i throughly enjoyed the movie and so did many other venom fans this movie is worth your money even if you only watch it once  while there is no connection to spider yet venom did a pretty good job for his first standalone movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,great film i believe the critics were being to harsh just because its not a film made by disney i say you should go watch it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics they want to know better than marvel
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie wish their was a bit more venom action but the critics didnt have an open mind
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie started off action packed  would see it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,solid marvel movie great time at the cinema 
Oct 7 2018,positive,far better than what the critics have been saying has its low points but tom hardy and venom make the movie worth the ticket price 
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun movie dont listen to the critics you are your best critic they dont see the movie for what it is
Oct 7 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this film i had such a great time as well as everybody else in the audience in a full theater with very few seats that were not occupied everybody in the theater love this film just as much as i did and couldnt wait nobody left the theater before the end postcredits to see what was coming venom is the new antihero that now is more popular than spiderman critics can hate it all they want we love it i laughed so many times through the film that i couldnt believe the character blend between venom and tom hardys character absolutely fantastic you got to see this film you will love it we all did at least in that theater dont miss out dont believe what critics say they stink
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics this is a great movie that is a lot of fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,lets see  80m on opening weekend audience score  89 your critics score  32 maybe your critics should start looking for jobs more suited to their talents such as flipping burgers at mickey ds seriously if your critics cant do a better job of rating scifi movies it might be best for everyone if they just avoided the genre entirely maybe you should get a group of critics who specialize in   scifi so they can do a better job of rating movies like venom clearly there is much room for improvement at rottentomatoescom
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved this film much more entertaining than spiderman homecoming
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a good movie even though it feels rushed on the character development tom hardy as well as the other characters did superb overall i give the movie a solid 7410
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was amzing the acting was above and beyond tom hardy as made a home run i will be seeing venom again
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a good solid movie this movie is kinda ment for kids but you can still enjoy it as a teen or an adult
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was funny and thrilling at the same time
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was good overall but slow at first it could have developed the characters more so that you could understand the change in eddie and venoms relationship more fully
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to some of the reviews i only made this account because the movie is good compared to other horrible movies out right now im excited to see some new takes on some marvel classic good job stan lee and marvel
Oct 7 2018,positive,i felt it was a good iteration of venom himself a different villain should have been involved the name riot is used but this is not riot also venom starts as a villain and later becomes an anti hero as far as movies go if you dont compare the film to the history of the characters or the comics this is a fine movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a lot of fun and very entertaining tom hardy is great in the role  and i would see it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,such an amazing movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know whats wrong with critics i think they have lost the taste of pg13 movies in particular its one of the best movie i have seen this year thumbs up
Oct 7 2018,negative,let me start by saying that as the trailers advertised venom is the antihero par excellence anyone with a glimpse of what venom is would agree that this movie was off target and heres why  warning spoilers ahead    the movie starts out with an interesting though unrealistic twist of spacecraft crash on earth the design and functionality of the aircraft are a bit futuristic but its ok no major harm done forward fascinating creatures on board on escape ok fast forward back to the lab  we spend half of the movie trying to understand why the symbiosis is not working and this was actually interesting especially when the idea of compatibility is provided similar to organ transplant pretty cool all along however we would assume to understand why would eddie brock be a compatible host and we look forward to see the reasoning nevertheless no reasoning is provided similarly we are not provided any rationale of how the riot and carlton drake were compatible or how venom and anne also were also able to achieve symbiosis after spending half the movie experimenting on compatibility then comes another chaotic sequence eddie brock sick    to depict an illness with the hostparasite interaction is frankly a smart approach but was excessively depicted the longer this sequence the less impressive venoms personality became    the sudden shift in venoms agenda from wanting to bring his people to not because he was a loser was such a bad move very immature and unbelievable  fast forward venom vs riot very useless and quick the story seemed out of control and not convincing just like venom suddenly had a change in heart    also allowing the symbiotes to already have a name venom and riot was a mess like seriously english names really of the million others would one be called shakespeare too the name venom was special between eddie brock and the symbiote     actingwise it was a shame to see tom hardy seemingly appearing like an alcoholic 80 of the time i could not believe that this person played bane to perfection yet here hes constantly drunkappearing with awful accent    overall i believe they could have done a better job scriptwriting this movie also as might have noted by other reviews venom might have afterall needed spiderman to be well establish perhaps it is the symbiotes hate for spiderman and eddie brocks hate for peter parker that made venom venomenous
Oct 7 2018,positive,doesnt match the hate
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really liked this movie nice intro to venom i look forward to seeing him again in future movies the only thing i would change is the perspective on some of the action scenes i feel like at times it was too close and it would have been nice to have a wider view but dont listen to the critics i think all marvel fans will enjoy this movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,hilarious and welldone movie i adored it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i may not be a pro movie critic but venom was good and of you think different youre entitled to your opinion but youre wrong and i hate you
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed watching venom on friday night  i know that there are some diehard fans who may have a problem with the lack of spiderman connection  however the story works well and venom is a fastpaced entertaining movie  my 13 yearold son has just replaced his uptonow favorite dr strange with venom  enough said  go see this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,f you want to see a fun trill ride of a movie definitely check this one out forget what the critics say this is a great movie and no spiderman is not requiredlol
Oct 7 2018,positive,true to the comic i was pleased with tom hardy the special effects and what should be a solid trilogy again the critics are out of touch with the majority of the fans
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved this movie do not believe the critics review 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was fun and intense  loved this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was good very good little slow at first but come on its a movie of antihero origin they need to explain the origin i do not understand why some people say it is bad movie i love the references to the venom of the comic the relationship between eddy and venom my personal opinion i want a second movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is awesome loved it and am going to see it again great effects full of action
Oct 7 2018,positive,solid b movie decent action funny moments a few points seemed rushed needed more gore and morally gray scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,how did an amazing movie like this get a bad critic score while garbage like the last jedi scored high with critics guess critics really cant be trusted
Oct 7 2018,positive,slow at the beginning but it develop in something thats enjoyable by a general audience and awesome visual effects  lenta al inicio pero se desarrolla en algo disfrutable por todo público y asombrosos efectos visuales
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved this movie i wanna go see it a couple more times the critics obviously cannot be venom fans
Oct 7 2018,positive,weirdly entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was super fun loved the humor but did have some small plot holes that said hardys performance was so good that it did not matter loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was very entertaining i really cant understand what all the negative reviews are about it was fun i know its not the most popular thing to say but the truth is that its a fun movie it looks cool and is pretty entertaining definitely enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,reminds me of deadpool with a dark sense of humour also sets it self apart since their really isnt any movie out like it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really dont know or understand why critics gave this movie such a bad rating it was a great movie with superb cgi i would definitely watch this movie again and i would definitely recommend it the only reason why im giving it a 4 star is because it could have been way better if the movie was r rated instead of pg13
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was great the story might not have stuck to the comics for obvious reasons but they did a great job of introducing my favorite comic character to the world great acting great story great effects perhaps a little too short
Oct 7 2018,positive,a surprisingly good movie that has a great antihero in venom the plot is simple but the acting by tom hardy and michelle williams is exceptional the last half hour is nothing but action and the two additional clips in the credits are entertaining especially the last one that gives you a glimpse into a spiderman reboot the critics are wrong because this is a good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i saw the reviews this movie got and it doesnt deserve the hate its getting it not the dark night but its a good enjoyable movie just go see it and have fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was such a fun movie to see reminiscent of deadpool and the humor of antman  i really loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,the 1st act kinda drags a bit but it speeds up in the last 2 it was definitely a fun movie to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,had heard it was bad but honestly it was pretty good a little like deadpool good lines
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is good if you love venom theres plenty of scenes with venom the comedy works between venom and brock the beginning is a little slow but when it takes off it doesnt stop till the end
Oct 7 2018,positive,solid film for capturing venom substantially better job than spider man 3 and would recommend to any venom fans
Oct 7 2018,positive,almost did not see this movie because of rotten tomatoes glad that i did it was a good as well as hilarious movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,in my opinion it was a very good movie  i am not a die hard marvel fan but i do enjoy a lot of  movies  and such in the marvel universe it has a very low rating due to the fact people wanted to see spider man which is expected 
Oct 7 2018,neutral,sort of hollow story action scenes camera work was very hard to follow and jarring 
Oct 7 2018,positive,clearly some people dont know the true origin of the symbiote venom venom was attached to peter parker or spiderman when the violent personality of venom attempted to over take spideys personality the fantatstic four had to extract the symbiote from parker and had it encased in a glass container fast forward eddie brock and peter parker were at each other as journalists after brock lost everything he was about to commit suicide in a church venom had managed to escape from captivity and the hatred venom had for spidey and brocks hatred for parker made the perfect pairingthat my friends is how venom is associated with spiderman aka peter parker
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was a fun and silly movie tom hardy was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont believe the critics a fun thrilling and darkly comical adventure that is surely the best eddie brock the big screen has seen thanks to the brilliant tom hardy seriously if youre on the fence about this one give it a shot because it is truly the best superhero film since the dark knight and sam raimi spiderman trilogy
Oct 7 2018,positive,not the best movie but i enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,despite what others said the movie is true to venoms character hes selfish and self serving the twisted humor is also a part of the character as well in the comics deadpool was the first person to bind with the venom symbiote as such his psychotic and violent behavior was picked up by the symbiote while not directly referenced in the film it still held true the personality of the character    as for needing spiderman its simply untrue as it was a great stand alone movie and by not focusing on spiderman makes the whole character more organic and his powers more variable
Oct 7 2018,positive,better than topher grace
Oct 7 2018,positive,i personally love venom and the venom in this theatre is kinda different maybe because spiderman is not in this universe so the personality of venom is kinda different i watched the movie to enjoy all the screen showing off i love it action comedy terror in just one movie with my pal venom and tom hardy for me its worth of watching cant explain all my thoughts in just texting
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome a must see amazing graphics really funny good actors amazing plot loved it best movie ive ever seen
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was great been waiting for a venom movie for over a decade they did a great job would recommend this movie to everyone l know cant wait for carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics are out to lunch and on a hate train this movie was great even though hardy had to carry the majority of it on his back
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was great it was funny entertaining thrilling and an unexpected great film imo tom hardy plays eddie very well had me convinced also its surprisingly funny maybe not like a firstperson deadpool kind of way but pretty witty throughout
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a good movie beginning was a little slow but once eddie and venom fuse it picks up the humor was good and wasnt too campy but the movie definitely would have benefitted from keeping its original r rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,i personally enjoyed the movie although the crew tics say otherwise i thought that it had a good mix of comedy yes there were some jokes that flopped but most of the time the jokes were pretty good the character venom isnt supposed to be completely serious in the comics he makes jokes all the time so i dont know why the critics are going on about how venom shouldnt be making that many jokes but they are a part of venom so i just dont agree with that
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics got it all wrong go see it
Oct 7 2018,negative,the movie is undoubtedly a train wreck but not in the way youd think its competently made and even has some genuinely good moments the problem is that it doesnt seem to know what it is its violent but not too violent its dark but not too dark its goofy but not too goofy its just kind of a mess there isnt any narrative or coherent structure theres no compelling characters and theres nothing really special wouldnt recommend it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,is very emotional movie just is not like the comic
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont believe the anti hype  go see it for your self and always look at the audience scorenever the critic score
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie rotten tomatoes needs some new critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,took the wife and two of our kids today to venom  we all came out entertained and talking about getting it on itunes when available  we thought the humor was good action was intense and the plot spooky enough to enjoy
Oct 7 2018,positive,ridiculous creativity
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie critics not every hero movie needs to be the dark knight  some times we want a good movie with good cgi action scenes and a little bit of magic to watch and enjoy tom hardy player an excellent role
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie way better that expected funny tons of action and exciting i have no clue what the critics were watching
Oct 7 2018,positive,best movie in my opinion if theres no second one im going to be disappointed
Oct 7 2018,positive,i love the humour the chemistry between venom and the main character one of my favourite marvel movies
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly i dont know why this movie is getting such negative reviews i understand that it isnt perfect but it certainly has good aspects too personally i thought the cgi was amazing and the movie had a good atmosphere  overall its a good movie for a movie night with a couple of friends
Oct 7 2018,positive,starts out slow to set up characters but once venom shows up the movie lives up to the comics it came from plus  spoiler alert shevenom gets used and carnage aka cletus kasady woody harrelson is the post credits scene i personally hope tom hollands spiderman and tom hardys venom team up to take down carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,not as bad as the critics say it was fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont let the professional critics throw you off on this one this isnt your classic hero movie and thats a great thing totally worth munching some popcorn to 
Oct 7 2018,positive,great as a standalone movie but if this were supposed to be part of the mcu id give it 15 stars they didnt stay true to the source with a lot of the plot elements which is fine if youre just looking for an entertaining movie it had some humorous moments good action scenes character development is not oscar material not that i was expecting that but decent enough so while it was an enjoyable movie i wish they had done the original storyline where peter parker discovers the symbiote bonds with it then discovers its dark nature and rejects it only for it to then find eddie brock who has a grudge against parker and then could have been part of the spiderman universe at least for now until sony decides to let these characters go to marvel studios other than that the only real gripe i have is that they didnt go r rated
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved the movie lots of action and comedy mixed in im a big fan of venom now
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie right here real good love the action
Oct 7 2018,negative,walked in fully expecting this movie to be terrible the result meh it wasnt completely terrible but at the same time it was nowhere near good the movie has some major flaws with only a few moments that work the chemistry between annie and eddie is nonexistent it has an incredibly slow start and things just kind of happen theres no true progression things just happen because the plot needs it to i walked out thinking that sony just needs to give all the rights back to marvel so they can do the properties justice
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing and funny will see again
Oct 7 2018,positive,we absolutely loved it from beginning to end 
Oct 7 2018,positive,only way to have made this perfect was to at least have a few minutes of spiderman well done sony
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was nothing short of awesome im talking on par with deadpool level of awesome this is will leaving you begging for a sequel tom hardy did an excellent job venoms character will leave you saying hilarious one liners the rest of the day get up and go see it now if you havent
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics dont even know what their reviewing the movie is a fun ride and you should not expect a traditional generic superhero movie like what marvel did
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie lot of action 
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie is really good and fun  is much better then spiderman 2 or includes black panther
Oct 7 2018,positive,a prime example why marvel is better when disney doesnt make it suck  this movie was a huge surprise and tons of awesome
Oct 7 2018,positive,really liked it i hope they make an unrated version when released for home but i definitely will watch it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,i personally loved the movie from start to finish i hope they do make a second one
Oct 7 2018,negative,it was very boring didnt live up to the expectations at all although tom played a pretty great eddie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie the critics were way off and they had no idea what type of film this was supposed to be it was supposed to be an antihero film it started off serious because it was trying to do this super serious exposition to venom until eddie and the symbiote met then it drifted off into a more actioncomedy with a splash of horror and romance here and there the script was not a travesty and i see nothing wrong with the cgi the script did use annieanneanna couldnt hear her name correctly in the film as a bit of a shepard to guide the plot where its supposed to go but it never affected my immersion with the movie the only really stupid scene i thought was weird was the motorcycle scene which was by the way really far fetched and unrealistic but then i remembered this is a scene in a movie where alien goo samples with a thought process and the ability to speak bond to humans and give them superpowers then the feeling subsided its not the best antihero film granted it has flaws but its not as the critics say it is a complete train wreck of a movie that needed spiderman and stained all of the actors careers i give it a 710
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was amazing one of the best superhero spin off movie i have ever seen it doesnt have a single plot hole its funny and has a great sense of humor the acting is great and stan lee himself is in thisduh im so happy i went to see this this movie is worth every single penny
Oct 7 2018,negative,this felt like somebody made this in 2004 and it was finally released tom hardy is one of the most exciting actors of our time and im surprised he chose to do this just bad all around 
Oct 7 2018,positive,forget the critics movie is good fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,didnt think i would like film as much as i did  was looking for a light escapist picture for the weekend  despite the reviews  the plotline was comic book formula  but it was straghtforward and tight  no loose scenes  the dialogue was well written and quickly moved the plot forward and with good actors like tom hardy and michelle williams was fun and humorous  good shots of san francisco  good effects  stay till the very end of film  better than usual  overall  it was fun  worth the the price of admission
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome funny action packed
Oct 7 2018,positive,okay now i know critics are trashing this movie but its a good movie i seriously enjoyed it and as soon as it was finished i wanted to watch it again i can see where some people had issues but the issues would not and do not make this movie how the critics are making it out to be the comedic aspect was great the fight scenes venom himself tom hardys acting as usual was on point and simply perfect in my eyes i definitely recommend this movie my only complaint is that they removed the r rating but it didnt ruin the movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i liked its not a big movie its a good little movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,every marvel movie isnt supposed to be an avengers movie enjoy the campiness and tom hardys acting this is exactly what a venom movie should be great movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics are a fickle crowd this movie is well done tom hardy does a fantastic job its obviously very straight forward in terms of plot but to be honest thats not always a bad thing the simplicity of the plot allows the gold of hardys acting to shine through people complain that the movie needs to pick a tone but the reality is that venom as a character is super all over the place its a well done film and certainly not worth the terrible reviews its been given by critics just because its not avengers does not mean it is a bad movie perhaps we have gotten spoiled expecting every superhero movie to look and feel a certain way but it takes a certain amount of bravery to defy the expectation
Oct 7 2018,positive,really good movie enjoyed watching it with my girlfriend cant wait for sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont let any critic fool you this film was great only like 2 flaws for me i think they captured venom and eddies relationship perfectly and the story was great the humor and action was amazing as well the beginning seemed to drag on just a little but after that its all fun for the rest of the movie totally recommend especially for comic book fans youll love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,the first act is very slow and carried by tom hardyhowever the last two acts are very enjoyable with venom and tom hardys chemistryvenom is a comedic and creepy at momentsthe movie would be much better if they cut out more of carlton drake and add more venomthe sequel will definitely learn from this movie on more chemistry and less explanationmore emotion with the characters and carnage being introduced
Oct 7 2018,positive,i went in kind of skeptical about this movie because the previews looked a little cheesy to me  although i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was  there are quite a few pieces of info and storyline bits that were blown right over and left unexplained but still overall it was a fun flick  just enough humor just enough explanation to sit back and enjoy  i am 5050 on whether or not they should have explained more or shown more stuff  i mean the way it went down leaves a lot of wiggle room for a sequel which im hoping they make
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was great i just wish this is in the mcu first antihero movie in tom holland spiderman universe
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely loved this movie we want a sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie critics are wrong
Oct 7 2018,positive,what a great movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had low expectations due to all the scathing reviews then i had raised expectations because of the better reviews rolling in this movie blew away those higher expectations hands down a enjoyably insane and weird movie i cannot wait for the next one
Oct 7 2018,negative,sad to see good actors in such horrible roles tom hardy apparently thought he was playing rocky michelle williams was just lousy horrible editing story jumped all over how are people liking this
Oct 7 2018,positive,im not much for cgi monsters but tom hardy saves this film
Oct 7 2018,positive,im glad i didnt listen to the critics i thought this was a fun movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,better than i thought it would be cant wait til part 2
Oct 7 2018,positive,pleasantly surprised after reading critic reviews it was a little slow at the beginning i didnt care much for the main character i get that he is a scruffy internet reporter but he seemed more bummish than scruffy the bad guy didnt really pull off the evil genius character he seemed like he should be in a cell phone commercial but venom was great movie took off from the moment he first spoke made up for the crappy acting choices i rarely say this but it could have been a little bit longerneeded more of an ending
Oct 7 2018,positive,movie critics are overrated
Oct 7 2018,positive,i went to see this with my sister she loved it and she was laughing all through the movie i found it interesting and funny but cant rate it higher because it had some cheesy elements to it overall it was worth going to see
Oct 7 2018,positive,went into this movie expecting the worst but came away very pleasantly surprised the trailers truly do a disservice to this film the humor and tone were much more even than i expected and i actually enjoyed the humor in this movie more than deadpools comedy the cgi was very acceptable and they finally made venom a badass in a movie like he deserves to be portrayed the plot wasnt amazing or overly deepprofound in any fashion but this is ultimately an origin film and the best stuff is still to come love the eddievenom dynamic and am really hoping they make a couple sequels to this and venom gets leased out to the mcu would love to see venom poking fun at spideys overly good nature trading barbs with stark and having pissing contests with thorhulk please make a sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,definitely worth a sequel the movie hit everything that makes venom well venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,a fun movie that will keep you entertained from start to finish  tom hardy is great as eddie and venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,definitely worth seeing critic reviews are not accurate in my opinion
Oct 7 2018,neutral,it was okignoring that spiderman has nothing to do with this movie i felt eddie was a bit of a wimp and there is way to much separation between eddie and the venom symbiote each being way to independent of the other
Oct 7 2018,negative,this is not venom riot is a leader and the logic in this film is crazy flawed it is a mess the only good parts is hardy and williams way to slapstick for me and instead of breaking new ground everything is played safe terrible film
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie it has funny scenes i dont care what the critics say about it but i really enjoyed it lots of action 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was loud dumb and stupid in all the right ways
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was much better than expected we really like it
Oct 7 2018,negative,not even fun in an ironic way
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was actually pretty awesome even better than i expected if youre a marvel fan andor a tom hardy fan youd be doing yourself a disservice if you did not go see this film
Oct 7 2018,positive,highly underrated dont listen to rt  still go see it if u love comics
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the cridicks if you like marvel movies in general you will have a fun time watching venom not as good as the other marvel movies but the relationship between venom and eddie was fun to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was worth going to see  tom hardy was great as always   it was action packed and funny  dont listen to the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie cant wait for the second one
Oct 7 2018,positive,the dynamic between eddie and venom makes this movie worth every penny the story might be sloppy and rushed in some instances but overall its a real treat tom hardy is such an amazing eddie and venom that it really shows his range as an actor once again the audiences have shown that they dont care what the critics think and that some films are criticproof
Oct 7 2018,positive,not a great superhero film but certainly not the awful mess many critics have unfairly made it out to be with ample wit akin to a lite version of the deadpool franchise this premiere offering in this nowquestionable franchise entertains in a fun escapist way even if its writing is not up to snuff and the plot has a plethora of inconsistencies dont take it too seriously and you just might find yourself having an enjoyable time at the show
Oct 7 2018,positive,i hate critics this movie was awesomeim not a bot
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie great story and characters
Oct 7 2018,positive,went so see twice at theatres
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy is probably the only actor that could have done something with this and without him it would be rated lower but with more story and character development and not being so off the pace and tom hardy this could have been great i did enjoy it despite its flaws 
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it our whole group of eight did my only knock is another orgin story doesnt match up with the other spiderman movie but such action and outstanding acting by tom hardy got me over that issue quickly
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought this was a really good flic its breaking the statusquo of your typical actioncomic movie those pegging it to a superhero movie missed the whole purpose i dont think it would be farfetched to call this a breakout franchise
Oct 7 2018,positive,was a great movie only thing i would have enjoyed was a rated r version being a little more intense on the darker side of things venom is loveable and i enjoy that side
Oct 7 2018,positive,a hilarious and action packed superhero movie that was able to hold its own without a connection to the mcu and spiderman
Oct 7 2018,negative,im not sure how this movie is  getting an 87 it has a horrible plot filled with holes and nonsense  poor dialog  and a really bad villain its just funny what people think is good nowadays
Oct 7 2018,positive,a little slow on the start but it kept you fairly entertained  definitely not on par with some of the best marvel movies but i enjoyed it more than iron man 2
Oct 7 2018,positive,hopefully well see spiderman and venom in the same movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was awesome in every way
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont understand why this movie is getting such terrible reviews from critics i thinks its one of the better super heroish movies the final fight was a little hard to follow and was over the top choice but the rest of the movie had fantastic action and comedy and tom hardy was great as eddy brock
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie better than i was expecting tom hardy is fantastic
Oct 7 2018,positive,best part was the comedy some actions scenes were good though there was also a cat and that helps the movie a lot
Oct 7 2018,neutral,silly all over the place and dully crafted ruben fleischer stand alone spin off of the marvel comics iconic villain doesnt seem to live up to its potential blaming it maybe to a hyperactivebroken action corny and mediocre script or the fact that not even tom hardy was able to deliver a decentbut visually faithful take on the character demonstrating again the lack of quality and creativity showed by sony at the moment of producing comic book flicks
Oct 7 2018,positive,although it was as good as expected it wasnt completely trash but i think some people need some comic knowledge about venom but really the only best parts of the whole movie is with venom and eddie
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie must watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was tons of fun and i had a blast all the way through
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun good movie definitely worth seeing
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom though it has its flaws manages to work around the problem of not having spiderman included in the film though not having his iconic symbol on his chest venom still stands out with his enlarged  grotesque form the story was slow at first but managed to slowly run up to revealing the venom symbiote at its finest character development was flawed but the action in this film played off for that area of the film the relationship between eddie brock tom hardy and venom is unexpected where wed usually expect a jekyll and hyde were instead given a somewhat buddy film where the two joke and sometimes argue with each other     i felt overwhelmed by how good this film was but i feel it could do so much more hopefully the sequel will engage with more on the characters and still the same amount of action we were given in this one thats why ive given this a 45 stars hoping the best for this film
Oct 7 2018,positive,was pretty fun overall took alittle wh
Oct 7 2018,positive,tough crowd here on rotten tomatoes  i thought it was excellent
Oct 7 2018,negative,so i chose to see venom instead of a star is born this weekend because i like the superhero genre and i was curious to see if they could make a successful movie about a classic spiderman villain without spiderman well just as michelle williams says in the film im sorry about venom if you have any expectations for this film they likely wont be met because venom is a hot mess of clashing ideas and studio interference i think the only actors on the same page here were tom hardy and tom hardy as venom all the other characters were flat and uninteresting with terribly corny lines i want to say that riz ahmed was miscast as the antagonist but i suspect that the awful script was the true source of his outoftouch performance most of the time i just wanted him to stop talking so that we could get back to the good stuff venom and eddie brock the only redeemable quality of this film was the interaction between venom and eddie it was hilarious you can absolutely tell that tom hardy gave this movie 100 and just went nuts with these two characters the humor worked about 50 of the time but i couldnt quite tell if these moments were meant to be funny or if they were so bad that they were funny either way i actually enjoyed those moments the cgi seemed off at times especially with venoms tongue i mean what is up with that i dont think the effects were up to todays superhero movie standards the voiceover was fine definitely better than the voiceover in the host as for the action sequences i think im at a time in my life where im getting tired of car chases that being said the car chases in this movie were nothing special but they werent bad in addition the action sequences were decent and sometimes even creative another big problem that stuck out to me was the continuity errors you can definitely tell that some scenes were split up and placed at different times in the movie because of the lack of costume change and thats just sloppy i got the sense that a lot was edited out of this movie and even more thrown in there are traces of what might have been a subplot involving protecting the homeless population i suspect some of this came from studio interference on a positive side note i appreciated the set decoration with the variety of houseplants scattered throughout the film only something i would notice of course thank you sony for the xerographica on the porch and eddies interaction with his houseplant overall i think the problems originated in the script and it had the same vibe as the early 2000s superhero movies daredevil spawn catwoman etc if youre going to see venom just remember that it is not an mcu movie the audience in my theater was expecting tom holland to show up or the avengers i did enjoy venom because of tom hardys performance but outside of that venom is just a mediocre movie with weird humor
Oct 7 2018,positive,im not even sure i followed everything that was going on especially with the rocket  i was a bit tipsy but plot aside it was decently fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved it i smiled the whole time
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie funny the fight scenes were great a fun yet still evil take on the symbiote finally bringing another to the big screen
Oct 7 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie and venom is interesting thrilling experience
Oct 7 2018,positive,so i went into this film thinking i would hate the film besides  the venom parts cause venom has been my favorite comic book character since i was 4 ive been religiously reading the comics for 20 years now and loved sm tas and spectacular spiderman and i knew the character from the trailers wasnt gonna be done worse than that eric foreman sm3 version ecchh but honestly i thought the film was just alright i loved the snarky venom bits cause thats true to the character in the comics hell if you play spiderman 1 for ps1 you can see many similarities certain scenes cracked me up and i was never really angry cause i was watching like an elseworld story  knew it wasnt connected to anything the voice i liked but i will admit there were quite a few bits i was meh on and did go well they kinda rushed to get here but with all that said id honestly give it between a high rental and low matinee for myself it wasnt a film i was getting overly triggered and gritting my teeth over and i wouldnt honestly suggest it to most folks but i got enjoyment out of it for what it was and idgaf i know its not getting a sequel or doing anything spectacular so thats all i took it as a one off elseworld film movie xd the ending with that wig tho 
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics  go see this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i soooo loved this  tom hardy was great  it had some corny lines but it was my kind of corny  critics need to get the stick out of their heinies and get a since of humor  i liked it all
Oct 7 2018,positive,a funny great and violent film its one of the best in my opinion had a great sum of relation to the comcs which people deemed comic inaccurate
Oct 7 2018,positive,was pleasantly surprised at how funny the movie was didnt have an anti hero vibe like venom from the comics but it was an enjoyable film if you just drop the whole venom needs spider man to be good or venom needs to be rated r youll enjoy the film its not perfect not by a long shot but it was enjoyable feel like way too many people are hating on the film because it isnt the venom they wanted
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it we are venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is the best movie i have seen all year
Oct 7 2018,positive,great go see it critics are wrong
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was not as horrible as the critics have spoken it was entertaining i still do not enjoy the quips and jokes marvel likes to add to its superhero movies but will take this one cuz its tom hardy as eddie brock enjoyable and a great flick to go watch with the fam wouldve enjoyed this as a rated r film
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics got it wrong again as venom was surprisingly good and entertaining i was a little skeptical at first since it was rated pg13 but it was different than your usual marvel cinematic universe garbage i would gladly watch this movie again the theater was also packed sorry critics for your screw up
Oct 7 2018,positive,yes it is not the venom from comics but it is so damn good i loved the movie id like sony to continue this separately from the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie not a deep story but alot of good action and set up for venom 2
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the movie is a mix of funny and serious there were quite a few moments that had me laughing out loud in the theatre tom hardy did an excellent job as lead this is a movie i would definitely want to have on hand and watch again 
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly i dont know why critics had such dumb reviews venom is one of the few superhero movies where its strength lies solely in the fantastic characterization instead of relying on the franchise name sort of like deadpool although i really wish they hadnt made it pg13 venom needs r its one of those characters that i could watch just going on a walk to the park and it would be entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,the beginning is kind of slow but other than that it is a great movie and very interesting and easy to enjoy
Oct 7 2018,positive,funny and decent marvel movie  cant wait for 2nd one
Oct 7 2018,positive,its well done i want him in new york mcu when the climax begin i love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,very awesome movie the best one with comedy and action
Oct 7 2018,positive,going to watch it again had a great time
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a great movie eddie brock is fabolous and i love venom in action secuences
Oct 7 2018,positive,while the critics are right in that the movie feels like its from a different era of comicbook film it feels like it early 2000 film what they get wrong is for this movie it seems to work     the movie is a bit slow in the first act but once venom and eddy meet the movie really picks up and it carrys that pace all the way to the end of film the one issue i do have is the marketing for this film was way off once eddyvenom are one the movie is sort of like a buddy cop darkcomedy action film this movie has deadpoolthe mask meets twins48 hours sort of tone tom hardy nails both his performances as eddy and venom     while there are some bad green screen and some continuity issues the one thing that is perfect is the cgi of venom the way the character looks moves talks is leaps and bounds better then the spiderman 3 design and tom plays the character way better then topher grace did    is this the best comic book movie of the year hell no but i think if you go into this movie thinking of it more as an action comedy i really think you will enjoy it i give it a 675 out of 10
Oct 7 2018,negative,doesnt hold up as a marvel movie with decade old special effects and weak storylines not linked to anything marvel related at any point
Oct 7 2018,positive,really good movie the critics dont know what theyre talking about go see this movie you will not be disappointed
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought the film was really good people just have to realize that there is a universe that spiderman might not exist in  venom takes the possibility of spiderman related villains existing outside of the universe the film had some low points due to awkward chemistry at the beginning between eddie brock and annie  from all of the major jump cuts in the first act but the second and third acte seem to work fairly well with each other  the humor was interesting and also very well done in places in the appearance of the couple venom easter eggs were very welcome especially to some people who were burned pretty bad by topher graces  version of venom i believe this movie can definitely be enjoyed with an open mind and an expectancy that this is not an mcu movie but a standalone action superherosuper villainantihero story that sets up  a spiderman universe without spiderman i recommend going and seeing the movie completely open minded and then basing your opinion is on it tom hardy worked so hard on that film as well as everybody else so we at least give them the benefit of the doubt and go in there with an open mind it to try to enjoy this movie as i did
Oct 7 2018,positive,did something marvel should do more often gave the villain his their own story so when he finally meets spiderman you arent sure who to root for because you care about both 
Oct 7 2018,positive,while obviously not perfect fans of the character or spiderman lore should definitely check out venom the comedy is on point as is the relationship between eddie brock portrayed perfectly by tom hardy and venom most of the other characters arent as mentionable but they do all have their parts to play in moving the story and the plot foreword in the end venom is a film comic book and superhero movie fans alike should check out the best way to experience this film is to go in with an open mind and to just have fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,way better than critics are saying it is my only complaint is that it was obviously edited quite a bit whether that was to avoid an r rating or just to trim the time down who knows i would love to see an unrated directors cut on blu ray 
Oct 7 2018,positive,was awesome to just watch a fun comic book movie  just seeing a normal dude get massive powers and the responsibility that comes with it its more street level stakes which reminds me of old superhero movies before the stakes got higher and higher and more serious this was just good ol fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was very fast paced tom hardy did carry the movie especially with his relationship with venom and michelle willams the car and motorcycle chase scene a la bullit i found interesting i was never bored and the end scene with woody harrison has my interest for a sequel is woody going to be in every movie ever
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics can kiss my ass this movie was awesome
Oct 7 2018,neutral,okay movie full of corny lines
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun funny and fresh
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie is really good it has very good funny moments and the action on the movie its okay the only bad things that it has is that is to short the other thing is the cgi but it still one of the best
Oct 7 2018,positive,slow to startfound to be boring in the beginning then as 30min when by then it was better i paid for the 3d movie and if i had read ratings first i would of paid only for the standard movie if you go to watch dont rush to get there if your late you wont miss anything for the first 25min 
Oct 7 2018,negative,movie is so awful you will cringe a lot theres a part when theres a chase across town and not one cop was around until the very last second because plot convenience  spiderman 3 venom is way better sadly
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie i enjoyed every minute of it
Oct 7 2018,negative,its a sony super hero movie and after all the bad movies of amazing spider man 2 fantastic 4 movie and now this venoms best part is that tom hardy is a great actor but the rest of the cast is poorly casted the pacing is all over the place there is no character development and movie plot choices are awful
Oct 7 2018,positive,when tom hardy becomes venom the movie just kicks off
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie that kept me engaged with the story action and comedy didnt need spiderman to pull it off
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics must be smoking crack i was thoroughly entertained
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie but i expected a little more 
Oct 7 2018,positive,why all the bad reviews it was a fun ride of a film great to see sf as a set
Oct 7 2018,positive,people are saying its bad but i really like it good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know why people dint like it it has comedy and action
Oct 7 2018,positive,its what you would expect from a super hero action movie lots of fun and lots of action it was on the darker side but my 11 year old son loved it  i r3c9mend this to anyone that likes super hero movies
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was entertaining for the kids writing could have been bettermore dialogue between venom and host would have been nice but overall not as bad as they say it was
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie im glad they made it as a stand alone from spiderman because its actually a more intriguing character the symbiotic relationship between eddie and venom adds intensity they are both quite vulnerable without each other when working together are next to unstoppable tom hardy is excellent in this role as is the main villain the female lead could have been better but is passable in her role the way i see it we can do whatever we want but i suggest you see this movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont believe the critics this is an exciting thrilling film with great pacing does the characters justice and amazing special effects it injects humour into a quite serious origin story of the comic book variety with a dark theme a lot of the reasoning behind motives becomes clear and understandable and im looking forward to what comes next
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics have no idea what theyre saying seeing this movie helped me realize how out of touch the critics are dont sleep on this movie my only critique is that they shouldve gone for the r rating fun action and familiar characters with a relatable story see this for fun i think youll be pleasantly surprised
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a great movie very entertaining and funny as well
Oct 7 2018,positive,your friendly neighbourhood venom   tom hardy has done justice to the role would have been an amazing movie had the script and casting been stronger a one time watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,if there was more movie it would have gotten 5 stars
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is the star the movie is generic and boring but the parts with venom make up for all of it
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was incrediblerotten tomatoes doesnt know what they are talking abiut
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly the critics dont do venom justice the movie is funny but not marvellike funny dont expect them to crack a joke every five minutes  not gonna happen and as a diehard marvel fan i say it as a compliment venom is refreshing exactly because it doesnt try to force what other superhero movies have been feeding us it doesnt try to be what is not it lies between serious and funny but it doesnt exaggerate either it does feel like it came straight out of the early 2000s and again its not a bad thing   people comparing this movie with marvel and dc current movies forgot they had years and years to prepare themselves to get where they are now marvel alone took 10 years so being hard on venom for it its just plain silly   tom hardy gives an amazing performance as both eddie and venom and seeing the main characters chemestry develop on screen is utterly amusing   of course not everything is great i think michelle williams should have been given more screen time being the talented actress she is also the plot was way too simple and at some point we didnt have a clue where the film was going some events felt rushed while others felt slow   still i must say i had a really nice time watching it ive watched it twice already and its funny because the first time i saw it i gave it an 8 but now that i watched a second time its a solid 9 for me   venom doesnt deserve the bad treatment and low scores its receiving its a fun ride and you need to appreciate the movie for what it is
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to what richard roeper said this movie was packed with fun and had a good storyline i would see it over and over again one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Oct 7 2018,neutral,the script was a little sloppy but with a little fine tuning they could totally make this a big superhero franchise
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun movie made for the fans and not the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a beautiful disaster from start to finish from his days of murderous sulks about being rejected by spiderman to now help cause he wants to be the big fish in a small pond absolutely fun to watch once the i assume insanely sticky looking symbiote starts to ooze
Oct 7 2018,positive,seen it and loved it the critics who say this is trash are absolutely wrong due to the fact they favor birth of a star over this when there completely two separate genres of movies
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was a great film
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics and see it for yourself personally i really dug it though a hard r version wouldve been truly amazing
Oct 7 2018,negative,i have to agree with the critics no plot and storyline is all over the place and the fact that sony decided to make it pg13 make it were this movie is not going to make its mark you should have left it r rated and leave it alone its not for teenagers period i didnt enjoy one bit and the fact that it was a mess didnt even came close to a good story line eddie brock running around with his head cutt off with no purpose  might as well made the movie back in ny with the biugle and had spider man in the movie maybe just maybe it could have done well but having 2 of the same spiecies fight each other and trying to kill each other please boring venom vs venom it was lame and venom killing just 2 people one that eddie ate his head but you dont get to see it and his ex girlfriend wearing the suit and she eats the head but you dont get to see it lame sony should have left it alone r rated and all this people giving it a 4 or 5 stars wow 
Oct 7 2018,positive,planning on seeing it twice at the very least with friends who havent much better than a lot of other super hero movies refreshing definitely worth watching tom hardy is the factor the idiotic critics forgot to include in their rating extremely entertaining to watch him very funny very indulgent movie only part i didnt like included tater tots
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was a fun movie and tom hardy was great i was pleasantly surprised theyre was comedy and some drama and overall was a good time
Oct 7 2018,positive,just amazing love the dialogues very much
Oct 7 2018,neutral,the film is barely held together by tom hardy who gives a bizarre yet magnetic performance as eddie brockvenom the rest of the film is sloppy dull and generic overall this is a bad start for sonys pointless spidermanless cinematic universe
Oct 7 2018,positive,movie was watchabe and fun bit of a boring start but not as bad as the critics say
Oct 7 2018,positive,an excellent movie funny and very exciting i could watch it over and over again definitely a must see 
Oct 7 2018,positive,a great change of pace in the time of over saturation comic movies great humor  it some very good action sequences and a end credit scene to top it all off the only negative i could take away from this was the movie had a slow start overall throughly enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,decent stand alone marvel film  nothing wrong with it  good fight scenes and cgi
Oct 7 2018,positive,really good movie funny action packed and a must watch  ps ignore the fake comments they are bots1010
Oct 7 2018,positive,as a huge venom fan i was somewhat let down by the story and the portrayal of eddie brock but all in all it was a good movie solid action even if the story feels a tad bipolar
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun movie went in with no expectations and came out very satisfied tom hardy was great cant wait for the sequel 
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics need to sit down this was an awesome movies
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was pretty good had the badass venom v riot scene i wanted to see although i wish theyd explain a few things such as a better explanation to why venom likes earth or how he survived
Oct 7 2018,positive,im a huge venom fan and this movie was awesome ignore the critic reviews
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was clever entertaining fun and honestly different from the other superhero movies weve seen highly recommend it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont care what anyone says this film was sick
Oct 7 2018,positive,watching the movie as its own thing made it enjoyable throw in all the contridictions and some comic book fans will hate it i enjoyed it it was a good break from the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive, venom is a great film it has everything a of comedy action friendship and just a great all around film
Oct 7 2018,positive,best movie of the year
Oct 7 2018,positive,waaay better than i expected
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you ever watched the cartoonread the comics the film had a dialoguehumour reminiscent of them slightly dark but with some humour similar to the spiderman cartoon as mentioned so i thoroughly enjoyed it the storyline could have been better but as so often happens with first films of a sequel they can be a bit thin still an enjoyable watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was fun i dont understand why critics did not like it
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie did keep the adaptation of the character to the comics loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie a little slow at first but the film picks up and is really enjoyable  i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,this film has been slammed by the critics i have no idea why i was worried when i saw the trailer tom hardy plays another great character and felt there was enough humour to keep me entertained whilst portraying venom in a very good way
Oct 7 2018,positive,possibly one of the best marvel movie to date well done
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved the movie it took a hot second for the action to start but when it did i was left wanting more tom hardy does an excellent job of capturing the character and the relationship the two have if you love the comics then look at this as the start up the first issue that builds the world there isnt any mention of spiderman and honestly i appreciate that venom is his own character he may have started as the black suit but he has evolved far past that     i am super excited for this to continue sony i want more
Oct 7 2018,negative,while it isnt as bad as catwoman venom speaks to the larger issues with sony pictures and their attempts at making their own franchises  the terrible plot some bad dialogue rushed cg at points and an overabundance of sequel baiting that felt like an advert for the next film  it kinda works as a standalone film but what ruins the film is the pacing changing of tones and lack of characterization  some jokes work and venoms design was great but the final fight needed some work to differentiate between monsters  its overly cg in the end that felt way too much like a video game cutscene or the climax of black panther    the film also shoots sony in the foot in terms of what  they show  if they really want carnage it needs to earn the r rating  by far the weakest comic book film of the year
Oct 7 2018,positive,enjoyed it thoroughly not sure what the deal is with the critics guess thats why theyre called critics 
Oct 7 2018,negative,sloppy its the type of movie that you end up when you rush things and the final work is a badly timed awful edited carless to attention screenplay a wonderful movie regardless being fiction at the end they all are or fantasy  its gives you a magical making because you live it in a way that you forget that you are watching a movie a poorly made movie is the one that you are aware that you are at the  theater watching another movie and your mind is preoccupied about the things you have to do later sometime wishing it to end to move along well for me this is this type of movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,really fun movie that does justice to venoms character in the comics absolutely loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critic reviews for this movie are simply laughable  venom was a fantastic movie going experience  i feel i suspended just the right amount of belief necessary to see this movie for what it was  this is something that needs to be done with all movies and finding the right balance between belief fantasy and fun isnt always as easy as simlply viewing the movie  the critics of rotten tomatoes seem to never once strike this balance and have lost all credibility in my eyes  i very nearly didnt see this movie because of the scores i saw before heading to the theatre how glad i am to have ignored them in the end
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a lot of fun i loved seeing venom actualized and he looked great tom hardys performance was amazing and the duality with the symbiote was hilarious 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was awesome critics are wrong and tom hardys performance was great the movie kept me entertained throughout
Oct 7 2018,positive,do not believe the critics this movie was awesome a very enjoyable marvel movie and the mid credit scene sets up the sequel beautifully  if you havent seen this movie yet and youre a fan of venom i highly recommend it
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie deserves a 95 from critics they say it needs a stronger connection to spiderman but that was the whole point of the movie was trying to not be connected to him and it did that very well
Oct 7 2018,positive,very great movie reminds me much of the comics and doesnt really need spiderman and can hold on its own if you havent already i recommend watching it cant wait for the second one and i disagree with the critics of the movie they want more then what they are given such a great movie couldnt have asked for a better venom or riot
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont know why it has gotten bad reviews it is what it is a comic book movie good action and humor go lead acting looking forward to the sequel 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  wasnt quite sure about seeing it and was pleasantly surprised   it was really funny and great special effect
Oct 7 2018,positive,not sure if the critics were expecting an art film or what but i think they missed the point venom hit my expectations despite a pretty obvious plot hole why was riot able to pass from host to host with no issue i will say that despite tom hardys performance the acting was a bit lacking but i enjoyed the film overall
Oct 7 2018,positive,i personally believe this movie was good probably would watch a couple more times but not my favorite
Oct 7 2018,positive,good but seems like the background for the next movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,yes its a tonal mess but its still a really good time
Oct 7 2018,positive,not perfect but still its a good movie dont really understand why critics are giving it those bad reviews im glad i didnt trust the bad reviews and watched this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is way under rated by the critics its a comic book movie yes there are some corney parts but had an original take 
Oct 7 2018,positive,a very good film  for the start of the franchise the most 
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy yet again gives audiences another unique character  something very different from previous roles this movie is one for fans of comic books  particularly venom while the origin is a little different the concept  premise work well add michelle williams in a bit of a feisty role while also serving as a strong willed female character it adds another dynamic for some really good lines  scenes go watch enjoy remember this is a film thats supposed to be fun its very much aware of its genre  plays to that genres strengths go have 2 hours of fun  stay for the credits they dont disappoint either 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i personally really enjoyed it both venom and eddy are relatable in my eyes yes it is far from perfect but i certainly do not regret watching it id recommend it despite the bad reviews but hey just my opinion 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i was thoroughly entertained by venom tom hardy and the symbiote interactions are the best parts of the movie especially when they fully suit up even though i really enjoyed the film i must take a star off because this film definitely could have benefited from being ratedr along with a longer run time i read a report that nearly 40 mind of the film were cut and there are parts where the cut scenes most likely would have provided more context and characterization to events and characters decisions but despite these faults i definitely recommend venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie i was pleasantly surprised by sony what i enjoyed was the humor and the graphics for this movie they did a fantastic job of utilizing a different story line to show how eddie brock becomes venom  while it may not have followed the comics verbatim on origin story it was a fun movie and the way venom speaks to eddie is reminiscent of the comics of the 90s great movie sony did justice this time  and redeemed itself from spiderman 3
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun funny and tom hardy goes all out my girlfriend and i both loved it and thought it was a blast
Oct 7 2018,positive,much better the spider man 3 imo was a good action movie non stop action most of the through they didnt need spiderman i dont understand the hate for this movie at all
Oct 7 2018,positive,way better than the critics made you believe
Oct 7 2018,positive,not the best script cgi was a bit all over the place but i can think of thousands of movies with terrible scripts horrid cgi effects and tried too hard to be funny it was terrible venom had humour hardys performance was in depth and great and the character was redeemed from topher graces performance in spiderman 3 thats the main thing i wanted and this movie was really enjoyable
Oct 7 2018,positive,spiderman fans will love this
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was way better than the critics made it sound
Oct 7 2018,positive,i  enjoyed it with my friend it had a nice touch when the symbiot took over a certain someone and a great call humor was fine i didnt mind it even though i didnt laugh as hard i hope they release an uncut release didnt like some of the fighting scenes where you couldnt follow it to fast loved the way he leaped and use his powers reminded me of uiltimate spiderman game overall im satisfied with the movie and visuals the people that worked hard on it i want to give it a 3 but i added a 12 because its the closest venom weve got not as good as we wanted and not as bad as we think
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is a good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was a fun watch nothing new i admit it did feel a bit like some the prenolan batman era films but it was generally just fun to watch cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,two thumbs up but i wish it was rated r
Oct 7 2018,positive,may be biased due to my tom hardy obsession but i really enjoyed this certainly agree an r rating and more gore would have served venom much better
Oct 7 2018,positive,all the critics are wrong venom acts the way he did when he was first introduced and that plus all the nods at venom easter eggs was also great to see
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was a fun light hearted movie that showcased tom hardys acting chops and introduced us to venom it was a good origin story that sets the stage for more movies later while it did start slow i think that the critics are being a tad harsh this is definitely a movie worth seeing
Oct 7 2018,positive,was very cautious going into this movie for sure but man was i worrying for no reason listening to critics for general consensus is good occasionally but geez the critics are ripping into venom like crazy i thought this movie invoked a lot of the nuances that make venom great like his awkward humor and his brutality and his strange relationship with eddie movie is not perfect some of the characters are cut dry and lack depth but overall i believe this movie can fit well with the mcu with tony stark and gang cant wait for more venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,although the venomeddie realtionship could be more stablished i didnt felt like it was as bad as critics say it was so yeah this is my revie
Oct 7 2018,negative,the pg13 rating holds back its potential and it was very noticeable venom was fine and so was tom hardy everything else was either forgettable or bland including the kills post credits scene sets up for the sequel if it ever comes
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved this movie stoked to see how many directions they can take this in
Oct 7 2018,positive,came into this movie with the critics reviews in mind i kept waiting for the terrible acting bad writing or cheesy cgi but it never came to pass yes this isnt a perfect movie but to call it a bad movie is just plain incorrect great acting by tom hardy and supporting cast amazing action scenes and some well timed humor make this a solid choice to see at the theater
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was great the look the voice they tried to make movie too funny and venom needs to be rated r not pg13 its was ok but nothing great 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was a interesting movie with very clear goals and bad execution its a fun movie with good effects and acting but lacks a good script and story
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly in the minor of opinions here but i thought this movie was fantastic going in knowing venom is not a villain so much as an antihero will make the movie much better knowing that it will be more like a deadpool movie than a supervillain movie youll love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,while the plot was basic and the film couldnt decide what it trying to be  it should have been a lot darker to match the character more  that said i was still entertained  and i would like to see a sequel if it was done correctly definitely better than the portrayal in spiderman 3
Oct 7 2018,positive,the first act of the movie is confused and a bit boring when venom shows up the movie is very humorous and enjoyable id say its worth seeing for sure
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics and the antifans its a really decent film and deserves the success it had this weekend
Oct 7 2018,positive,for what its worth venom is not as bad as i would have previously thought the team did its best in trying to make a venom movie without any spiderman relations and for that i praise it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its campy and funny at times its not a canon marvel flick but definitely worth watching just dont expect a dark horror movie and you will be fine 
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie do t listen to this review or others go see for yourself and make the call if you liked it or not i personally am gonna go see if again
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics are blatantly wrong sure the story line isnt the most complex but since when do you expect dramatic twists and turns in a marvel film its only downfall in my opinion is not going far enough into who venom is a dark antihero its pg13 rating has limited its potential to hit deadpool heights that being said this movie is fun venom is genuinely funny and the characters likeable and diverse enough to make me want to watch it again i am not a huge fan of superhero movies and usually find them cliché and predictable but i really enjoyed venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had a good time i was not bored with this movie has a good start and might have some flaws but overall awesome flick i cant wait for part 2  great work guys
Oct 7 2018,positive,see it for yourself tom hardy was great and it had great special effects and action sequences it started off a little slow and ended a little rushed but it was still a fun movie and the critics should lighten up a little bit 
Oct 7 2018,positive,so much better then i thought it would be not a 1010 but it was a great movie that i had a lot of fun the only part that was rely bad was the end fight
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was fun unexpectedly entertaining great job of how venom becomes venom cant wait for the next one went to see it with my 18 and 21 yo sons we came out talkinglike we were venom lol great addition to the marvel family
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was extremely fun to watch with interesting connection between eddie and venom but this movie was too short to develop other characters
Oct 7 2018,negative,what do you get when you have an a actor tom hardy and a d the script somehow a d movie im just not impressed i couldnt help thinking man would i like to hear a little about spidy or man i want to see my good old spiderbro or dang it theres no spider symbol on venom and why is venom a good guy ok so this is a buddy cop film  and venom is now a good guy i cant it was a bit too much and a tad shy away from being an ok film this is what happens when someone looks at some concept art for a venom and says lets make a move then proceeds to read the wiki article just to find out that venom is a villain to a charioteer they cant use and decides screw it we are making it anyway
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy is excellent in this movie for any fans of the venom character andor the symbiote storyline its a must see for others looking for a fun comic book movie with great character development humor and great special effectsaction scenes  its definitely worth checking out
Oct 7 2018,positive,thought it was a great movie dark fun perfect for those who dont know too much about the character
Oct 7 2018,negative,about venom 310  overall the movie relys too much on the standard comic book movie scripts pre mcu much like the comic movies of the 90s and 00s at this point i just think the bar has been raised and venom is saddly mots as a standard and script following  movie without giving the audience anything new reminded me a lot of ghost rider in the 00s save money   however if you do see it stay for the after credit scene of into the spider verse as that looks like a hilarious movie    this movie would have been better if it had two essential venom elements 1 address the fact that eddie brock has a brain tumor that the symbiont was sustaining itself on like in the comics 2 did not have the symbiont talk until maybe the next movie or the very end    the movie could have opened with eddies fall and realization that he had cancer which it does not even come close to addressing then introduce the symbiont
Oct 7 2018,positive,i knew i had to make my own decision so i went to watch it and im glad i did tom hits the character so well and the bond between him and venom is exactly the same as the comics definitely a must watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,fast paced action humor wasnt forced it was a good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a really entertaining movie note perfect but a really great beginning for a movie of origins 
Oct 7 2018,positive,idk i really did have fun watching the movie and for me the critics were too harsh 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really liked it hardy was spot on for that role much better than critics say  looking forward to see carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,was very funny and always interestingnever was bored
Oct 7 2018,positive,seriously awesome movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved this movie i love venom and i did not mind the cgi at least it was better than spiderman 3
Oct 7 2018,positive,aproached the movie with no expectations had some issues but it was a fun movie pulling on some emotional strings im happy that i went and saw it the rest it does not matter
Oct 7 2018,positive,really enjoyable go in with an open mind forget this is in anyway related to spiderman and youll come out smiling
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy delivers a good performance as eddie brock while the rest of the cast fails to seem believable the movie couldve done better if it was aimed at a more mature audience
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was awesome  i smiled laughed and was on the edge of my seat
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie dont believe the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,liked the humour tom hardy is awesome
Oct 7 2018,negative,aside from the visual effects there was nothing really captivating or memorable about this film tom hardy plays eddie brock supposedly a well known investigative journalist with the highest standard of professionalism and integrity but he comes off as a buffoon who has never interviewed anyone at all and who reacts blindly to his worst impulses the dialogue was weak the writing even weaker motivations were unclear pacing was all over the place and overall the film felt somewhat dated like a film that could have come out alongside the very first fantastic four movie 
Oct 7 2018,negative,this movie is just straight garbage nothing makes sense
Oct 7 2018,positive,whats with the critics rating it was a good movie was it the best no but overall it was good venoms character was funny and you feel sympathetic towards the antihero i would definitely see the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,a lot of people are slamming this movie for having a bad plot or no identity but if any of these reviewers were true marvel fans and specifically fans of venom then they would realize that what seems like silly lines portrays eddie brocks relationship with venom perfectly  venom is an antihero and eddie brock isnt the brightest crayon in the shed  paired up together they make for amusing good fun with a spritz of raw horror thrown in
Oct 7 2018,positive,really entertaining and tom hardy and michelle williams gave a solid performance 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved this movie fam amazing i dont even know how to explain it but i thought this was gonna be okay but it was way better than that i loved this movie so much imma buy it when on bluray
Oct 7 2018,positive,despite me always trying to go into movies without hearing any opinions beforehand i was told that this movie was bad however upon seeing the movie myself i was pleasantly surprised    honestly as with many similar movies recently i feel that many viewers tried their hardest to jump on the bandwagon of hate with some opinions barely saying anything more than the movie just being bad    anyway if youre going into this just because youre expecting spiderman or marvel cinematic universe connections youll be disappointed    but if youre going into this thinking of venoms portayal by topher grace in spiderman 3 and hoping they did a better job of the character then i have no doubt youll be happy about venoms portrayal in this one    seeing venom being a condescending witty and creepy character who communicates with eddie constantly was amazing exactly what i wanted    the setup for potential future characters in a shared universe made me really happy as well stay for the mid credits scene    otherwise i really hope they continue on with this franchise and improve what viewers complained about so that they do even better next time    with the recent changes and additions to the marvel cinematic universe i really hope that this venom franchise gets connected somehow
Oct 7 2018,positive,really gud film massive venom fan an they pulled it of with out spiderman
Oct 7 2018,positive,go watch the critic rating is so off
Oct 7 2018,positive,very fun film the cast was generally good especially eddie brocks actor venom looked amazing and the other special effects were nice too the villain was very interesting and the overall story proved to be very well thought out this averages out to be one of the best superhero movies this decade i recommend it
Oct 7 2018,positive,not a movie fanatic but this movie was pretty good went with a group and we all loved the fight scene between riot and venom for its cinematic effects the humor was well enjoyed as well
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome funny and definitely underrated
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was so much fun  true comedic moments not dependent on raunchiness for laughs loved the tom hardyvenom character only 4 stars because of a few slow scenes
Oct 7 2018,negative,i hurt myself by going in with higher expectations i fell for the trap the adverts mislead us all it had its moments but in the end it was just a poor adaptation of a story that had so much more potential
Oct 7 2018,positive,had a great original feel to it without feeling like your standard comic book movie action scenes and fight scenes were very good totally worth watching
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie with great cgi
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was one of the greatest venoms ever who ever said this was weak is dumb
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really liked the humor in this movie and the constant talk between venom and eddie it was fun with good special effects  an amusing film i enjoyed watching
Oct 7 2018,positive,graphics were awesome  loved the story line and characters
Oct 7 2018,neutral,small parts in the movie were but overall it was a crap movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie for people who want to enjoy pg13 isnt bad but it isnt good
Oct 7 2018,positive,exactly what i expected it to be and set up nicely for films to come
Oct 7 2018,neutral,i think it was sloppy throughout the movie but i feel if it had an rrating it wouldnt change how the movie was only that it would have more graphic cgi kills and more inappropriate jokes but it would  be a sloppy script but i didnt hate it and i dont think it needed spiderman but it couldve been better
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was an excellent movie as this is a stand alone venom movie as the critics do not understand as we all know what happens with an attachment to spidermanspiderman 3 this movie was by far worth it and i hope people realise that it is a standalone venom film which is a refresher and a palate cleanser
Oct 7 2018,positive,although not the most accurate comic comparison i enjoyed their own take on the role and tom hardy was a great actor overall with his sickness
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is such a great movie its something related to thor but so much better when coming into the theaters to watch it watch with an open mind and not have high expectations its a great and amazing movie it had great effects and actors i would definitely watch it over and over again it comes with lots of goosebumps and great after credit scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie tom hardy plays the part perfectly the cgi is extremely well done and the humor isnt forced but fits the characters well very excited for a sequel ignore the critics on this one well worth the watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,no idea why people are hating on this film venom is so good it was dark and funny with plenty of action and head biting the film doesnt slow down at all every scene has something in it that keeps the story pushing forward the riot big bad was short lived but even that fight was cool and had great pacing the interaction between eddie and venom is brilliant at one point he basically becomes a relationship counsellor for eddie and anne which is just hilarious to imagine a big terrifying alien from a far away planet that originally intended on wiping out the planet giving couples counselling the fight scenes with venom were amazing you get a feel for how powerful he is but also that hes not immortal as he takes damage the end credit scene was exactly what i was hoping for i wont go into it for people that havent seen it but its a nice setup for the future of the venom universe all in all i loved it and im excited to see tom hardy stick the role and go forward
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie dont believe the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was a good movie seen on 1072018 the only issue is how movies now take it to fast they could of broke this movie up into two movies with more detail you cant always believe the reviews and i give the rotten tomatos rater a f and u cant wait for a part two
Oct 7 2018,positive,a flawed but fun watch tom hardy gives a good duel performance as both eddie brock and the titular venom but is let down by shoty writing and terrible chemistry with his colead michelle williams
Oct 7 2018,positive,starts off slow but after that it is balls to the walls amazing and funny drake is a really good villain and hardy is an amazing venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,great marvel movie no idea why all the bad ratings the comedy isnt overbearing and its a well thought out story
Oct 7 2018,positive,i am starting to really ignore the critics reviews and just always going with the audience score
Oct 7 2018,positive,all i could ask for more of would be for the sequel to be in rated r  to really give it full justice and maybe avoid car chases overall great movie though
Oct 7 2018,positive,my whole family loved it even the misses i cant understand how the critics could give it such a low review its not oscar worthy but anything under 70 is just ridiculous
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie it was funny action packed and interesting
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics couldnt be more wrong this film was a blast i loved it and cant wait for carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a fun albeit incomplete movie tom hardy is awesome as eddie brock and venom as is expected but it feels like too much of the story was missing as if all of the scenes that explain important plot points changes of heart or bonds were cut out were left with eyecandy a villain we cant get behind and tom hardy carrying the cast and story into the anticlimactic climax of the film there are laughs to be had and every scene with brock and venom playing off of each other is practically gold but you cant leave so much important content on the cutting room floor and call it coherent    heres hoping it does well enough at the box office for a sequel to be made that can possibly help explain everything that was missing in this first installment
Oct 7 2018,positive,everything i wanted it to be dont listen to critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought this was actually pretty good would have loved to see more venomeddie interactions also why is their even a critics score 32 when the audience score is 89 obviously people like it like sorry its no shakespeare in the park or what ever critics give highs scores to the point is it may not be the venom move we deserve buts its the one we have and its pretty good plus tom hardy
Oct 7 2018,negative,very bad movie bad villain bad visual effects bad plot bad comedy
Oct 7 2018,positive,the villain is better than other superhero movies great movie i think that the critic is very hypocrite to say bad things of this film when they love the marvel movies in fact venom has the same problems of movies like dr strange and the same good things go to the theaters watched it and and make your own opinion because this movie worths the critic is wrong and hypocrite this time
Oct 7 2018,neutral,not what i expected for an antihero movie and the lense choice from the dp is troubling the boca on the lens are too soft for the fstop causing a serious softness for everything other then the center of the shot how do have a venom movie without blood
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie managed to be very entertaining and allowed venom a proper backstory and didnt need spiderman to come save the day as far as the movie is concerned
Oct 7 2018,positive,class film tho a bit disappointed with the casting for carnage should have been younger cant wait for the seaquel if there is one
Oct 7 2018,positive,a good movie to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,great flick best part is dynamic between eddie and venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,i liked this its is not the greatest comic book film or blockbuster film but it is enjoyable and damn near oscar worthy compared to other blockbuster films that came out in the last year  last jedi  jurassic world  predator  justice league to name a few btw not a russian bot and every time i try to leave review for jed or panther they dont post corrupt rotten tomatoes for you
Oct 7 2018,positive,was really fun and thought ur was great interpretation of venom without spiderman looking forward to sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie lots of fun
Oct 7 2018,neutral,i expected to hate venom as a life long spiderman fanboy growing up on black suitsecret warslethal protector comics i expect a lot from the character i expect a lot from his relationship to peter parker hell i expect a lot from tom hardy  and i knew i wasnt really going to get any of that what i got instead was a bloated 95 minute film that managed to pack in plot beats about every 15 seconds no exaggeration and shoots absolutely everything with cheap looking cgi but ya know what it is just so freaking weird that i couldnt help but enjoy myself tom hardy is this manic idiot reporter who grabs two beers at a time every time sweats through many hoodies touches infected people and jumps into lobster tanks this is dead this is dead  so screw it because we are absolutely getting a sequel bet you literally no one involved thought that would happen you might as well see venom bring some wine and a joint you might just have a fun hour and a half
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to other peoples reviews this movie was fun exciting and we laughed a lot   way better than any recent dc movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it    was expecting something absolutely subpar but better than spiderman 3 but i was met with a very good origin story for venom in a contained section of the marvel universe nice job cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,the ultimate guilty pleasure action superhero flick in my honest opinion have seen it 3 times now and like it more each time editing is a bit too much but venom and tom hardy save the movie and easily have the most entertaining dynamic also surprisingly faithful to the comicbook material minus spiderman unfortunately hope to see venom and spiderman together one day
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome film great blend of action and humor really enjoyed the relationship between tom hardys eddie brock and the symbiote venom well structured film with plenty of nods to the comics source material without them ever becoming necessary to enjoy the experience  it did have the same final garbage fire villain fight almost all superhero  films exhibit but it worked for the film despite its pg13 rating it was not suitable for kids and pushed the boundaries for slightly older kids risking sounding like an old fogey the action sequences bordered on being loud enough to lose definition and at time was visually overwhelming definitely stay through the end credits in true marvel fashion the postcredits scenes were worth the wait    thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Oct 7 2018,neutral,now i am not an official critic but i enjoyed venom now thats not saying its a good movie but if you just want some mindless fun i would recommend if you like plot character development and and overall structure then i would not recommend venom tries to hard to be a origin story and a sequel the first half setting up eddie as a loser who lost everything does a good job but once venom and eddie bond it quickly steps in to mindless action and humor and i am not saying the humor is bad it made me laugh a lot but it skips over the relation ship between them and expects you to already be familiar  with venom already also theres tons of plot holes but thats another can of beans
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics are actually insane theyre reviewing this movie as if it were a failed attempt at a cinematic masterpiece with a thoughtprovoking story its not it is a fun sometimes horroresque and sometimes comedic comic book movie with a maneating alien who is a goofball this is exactly what the fans wanted from venom and they got it the critics are welcome to sit there with their no fun allowed signs hohumming about the film all they want the target audience the fans of venom will definitely have a good time
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom had great action and even better characters and with tom hardy the whole relationship was believable and competitive there is humor between eddie brock and venom but that doesnt take away from the action scenes and struggle the only downside is the lack of a plot which is understandably difficult to make logical when your good guy has been eating off heads for the past hour i do believe that this movie is the setup for other real antagonists such as carnage overall fun experience with a good balance of everything
Oct 7 2018,positive,the perfect superhero origin story movie the perfect amount of humour and its not forced there was plenty of action and venoms utilization of the environment during fights was impeccable
Oct 7 2018,positive,ive always had an open opinion to all movies i had low expectations for this movie i left that theater in a i loved it im a huge venom fan probably the biggest you will meet spiderman 3 upset me with their interpretation of venom just awful this wasnt tom hardy did it right tom hardy was amazing and the story kept me glued go see it and be the judgedont listen to others
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good movie the effects were great and the storyline couple of laugh out loud moments if you are a fan of comics or the marvel movies definitely worth seeing dont listen to the critics read the user reviews since those are the real fans of marvel and will give an unbiased non nostalgic point of view personally i like the idea of an original movie like venom more than a movie that is on its 3rd remake with lady gaga and bradley cooper but what do i know anyways definitely check this is out
Oct 7 2018,positive,an amazing adaptation of venom on the big screen tom hardy developed eddie brock and venoms relationship in a well mannered execution
Oct 7 2018,positive,the chemistry between venom and eddie is awesome tom hardy did very well with this character
Oct 7 2018,positive,sure it had its flaws but its a entertaining well acted movie love the venom look made me feel i was watching it straight from the comics
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really hate rotten tomatoes its so fucking stupid but i just need to add my support to this movie people dont listen to rotten tomatoes screw all these trash critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,in the interest of full disclosure i have a huge crush on tom hardy but i dont know what movie the critics were watching and clearly the audience disagrees with them i loved this movie and i thought tom hardys vulnerability and humility played well against the scary symbiote great special effects some really great oneliners as is becoming the norm with  the marvel universe my husband says true marvel comic fans might be disappointed in how far this ranges from the comic book but for those who of us like myself who could care less about the comic books this is a must see
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie i like this new form of venom which was taken from the recent comics and ultimate spiderman cartoon series
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore what everyone is saying about this movie this movie is full of excitement one of the best movies this year
Oct 7 2018,positive,it is a good movie that shows another way of the origin of venom without spierman   but there are somethings that doesnt have sense
Oct 7 2018,positive,not your typical marvels movie but still worth seeing
Oct 7 2018,positive,best marvel movie ive ever watched well done hardy
Oct 7 2018,positive,it is a very amazing movie i recommend for every one to watch it right now
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is why i dont listen to the critics  as a fan of spiderman and venom comics this movie was great  some changes to the story which i believe were due to copyright  as a movie to establish venom as a character and set it up for more and hopefully enter the mcu it did a fantastic job  tom hardy was an excellent choice for venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont let the critics stop you from viewing this film this film was great overall i absolutely loved it it has an incredible storyline that was east to follow with a lot of action and comedic moments that couldnt have been more perfectly timed it was a change seeing tom hardy in this kind of role and it absolutely paid off so check out the film for yourself and see what you think
Oct 7 2018,neutral,not as bad people are saying it is i think it was alright this is was really a stream it but if you decide to watch it go in with a open mind but the actors were fine i think tom hardy wouldve been better if he had a more interesting character but since the movie was set up for a squeal so the character development for squeal wouldve been better if we had the 45 minutes that were removed because the movie felt incomplete probably was going to be a lot better if we did happen but was probably remove for the pg 13 rating so more people would watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a simple but amazing movie with some blackholes in the story but y very funny and interesting
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had a great time watching this film you will laugh a lot and go on a fun ride with venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was a blast to watch the action was spectacular and the cgi was incredibly created dont listen to other people you owe it to yourself to see this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,we loved the movie  cant wait for the next one
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had a blast with this moviethis movie just lack of villain character development and the pacing too
Oct 7 2018,positive,i havent been to the movie theater since 2007 but this movie caught my attention i went to see it and i was floored venom was badass i may actually go to the theater again and watch it a second time ill definitely buy this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is exactly what i expected venom to be a funny conflict betweeen eddie brock and venom that how it is when he first gets the suit also this is not a super hero movie it is a ant hero movie
Oct 7 2018,negative,man tom hardy was great im not gonna lie but who the f are these other guys theyre  terrible actors i would have gave it 3 stars if it were in the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good enjoyed the banter of eddie and venom the reason for the fight scene at the end could have been clearer or the envolvement of the villian could have been better
Oct 7 2018,positive,it wasnt terrible but they could have done better with the story not having spiderman in it gave it a lot of holes it has that late 90s spawnblade feel to it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie doesnt deserve the hate thoroughly fun was pretty good but the last 10 mins made it really great
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom superceded my expectations i loved the humor between venom and brock it didnt seem forced or out of place the cgi was seamless and at no point was i taken out of the movie due to poor effects great story arc and character development of brock throughout the story 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was fun and funny
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy playd the role fantastically the comdey wasnt forced but subtle and unexpected the action couldve been better but im not complaining on what was shown i believe the movie shouldve been rated r it wouldve done wayyy better if it didnt have to restrict itself to pg13
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont expect anything great and you wont be disappointed  tom hardy is great again even with a below average script
Oct 7 2018,positive,very funny nice special effects great tom hardy and loved violents scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,was pretty shocked by how badly the critics scored this i was really surprised it was fun and i wanted to see more when eddie gets a hold of venom the movie gets so good
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was perfect it captured venom in all the right ways he has never been your typical marvel character and his sadistic charmingly weird personality was just fabulously portrayed by hardy and well written definitely going to see it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie isnt winning awards by any means but it was sure fun to watch i dont see what all the hate was about shrugs its in between 5560 for me
Oct 7 2018,positive,very fun cheesy entertainment the sequel should be insane 
Oct 7 2018,positive,who cares about critics ratings it was an awesome move
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics definitely worth a watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics and roll with the audience as sony gave the people exactly what they wanted to see an enjoyable and fresh take on one of marvels favourite antiheroes tom hardy was great as eddie brock and while i didnt enjoy michelle williams i didnt hate her either i could have used more action but it was the right balance between action and comedy and make no mistake the conversations between eddie and venom were hilarious i especially liked how they kept the venom origin separate from the spiderman mythos go see this movie and you wont be disappointed
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy did n amazing job in venom its blend of dark tones with high comic punches that reallly make you say damn navel you did it again critics didnt like it but the audience knows best and voted with our wallets looking forward to the next venom movie great job
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed venom a lot actually i thought that it was a good movie for being a standalone movie by itself but it still could be better a bit closer to the comics cant wait for the sequel with carnage tbh when they bring in spiderman it might revive the whole thing
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was amazing i loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a character i personally loved in the comics bringing him to the big screen without spiderman is a massive challenge and whilst the movie does have a few flaws i believe they did a great job in giving the symbiote as well as eddie their first proper outing we are definitely forward to seeing how they develop this franchise
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont let anyone tell you about how good or bad is a movie go see it for yourself venom for me  my family was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,great film cant wait for the next one lived hardys brock interacting with venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,not a great movie but its certainly not a bad one either it shouldve been rated r but making it pg13 leaves an oportunity to eventually being conected to the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,poorly developed story formulaic with somewhat good action sequences
Oct 7 2018,positive,the film is not bad but if you expected  a masterpiece oh well it is not
Oct 7 2018,positive,a good movie no doubt much better than spiderman 3 no doubt and tom hardys performance is very good all the actorsactresses performances were good for the script they had  the human antagonist is very bland but the symbiote villain had a decent enough motive that he still is better than thor 2s dark elves
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie has to be one of the best from marvel i have seen almost every marvel movie and have to say that tom hardy delivers a side of venom that is unique in his own way hardy delievers a performance that will leave you praising venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,didnt think this movie was going to be anything serious based on the trailers but as i kept watching i found myself more and more engrossed in the film i would go on more but ill be brief i personally enjoyed this more than deadpool and i loved deadpool i enjoyed this movie so much it motivated me to write review something ive never done before
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was great it had a great amount of action it was funny and all around was a great movie i would watch it again i dont see why the movie has such a low rating i mean the effects and the whole movie is amazing it it really worth a watch at the movie theaters or even when it comes out on dvd
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was amazing had a lot of twists and was a great watch all around definitely one of my favorites
Oct 7 2018,positive,no need for spiderboy here venom does the title character plenty of justice and has everything required to make an entertaining film without the burden of being tied to the increasingly tedious mcu the pg13 rating had me worried but venom pushes it to its limits and manages to be gruesome even without exaggerated gore after seeing the post credits scene i have high hopes for the inevitable sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,while the beginning was slow paced some jokes sloppy and some plot lines not given enough time i thought the actors were great the story was easy to follow there was entertained action passable cgi and the character of venom was faithful enough to the comics even without spider man
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is by far the best movie this year i absolutely loved every second of it tom hardy did outstandingly well every aspect of it was spot on of what i wanted 5 stars
Oct 7 2018,negative,yea no not very good cash grab tbh
Oct 7 2018,positive,1010 movie critics are wrong amazing acting and a great story line
Oct 7 2018,positive,brilliant film my new favourite cant wait for the next one
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont understand the badterrible  critic reviews for venom it wasnt a perfect movie but it was damn enjoyable  a good introduction to the character im ready for a sequel    then again these critics also gave the last jedi raving reviews
Oct 7 2018,positive,thought it was fantasticonce again rotten tomatoes is wrong about a comic based film
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is amazing  it showes why the charater has had several mini series in comics and long running monthly titles over the years without spiderman to hold his handthe movie sets up venom perfectly and leaves the charater open for more stories later 
Oct 7 2018,positive,does it have the best script who cares its venom it is a fun time and i would definitely watch it again cant wait for a sequel 
Oct 7 2018,positive,seems that im from the minority who liked the movie venom as a character is little without spiderman this movie managed to bring him out on his own have a story and be quite pleasing as a whole it aint the dark knight and it doesnt strive to be so i wouldnt compare apples and oranges also venoms appearance is a total fanservice loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,man i dont know if this was a 100 like the comics but hell it was an awesome ride
Oct 7 2018,positive,it might not  have been comicly accurate but it was an outstanding film dont believe everything the critics say on this site it was definitely worth the watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,only complaints would  be the pg13 rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought venom was a very good movie it was entertaining funny and full of actionjust like every other marvel movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is the best blockbuster movie of all time has comedy and good performances but your tastes are not mine if you do not like it or if you have fun then i passed it with that girlfriend that brother or that family enjoy
Oct 7 2018,positive,pretty great movie i thought they did venom justice as a character no idea why critics gave it such a bad rating im considering seeing it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,i went o the theater with the expectation to have some fun i knew i would not be seeing a master piece  of cinematography or a very logic driven scriptstory as many of the so called critics were apparently expecting in the end i had my fun and i was entertained so my score is based on that
Oct 7 2018,positive,even if the first half of the movie moves a little slow it makes up for it with fantastic action sequences and character relationships    8710
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant must watch and surprisingly adorable at some points the acton scenes were well placed and perfectly done amazing film
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics are not giving this a fair review the main character is alittle over the top how ever by the end of the movie he grows in to that role nicely he does well interacting with the symbiote   the supporting cast did well and the story was in point it is what one would expect he is not a hero never was they are venom it is new territory and the people put on charge of this did well when it came to the pull from both the social good and evil   i personally and looking forward to the second film because i love the choice of the actor fleet carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good fun and worth seeing it a second time
Oct 7 2018,positive,eddie brock is a wannabe of bane
Oct 7 2018,positive,these critics should find a new job finally a good fun action movie with a trailer that didnt give away the plot looking forward to the next
Oct 7 2018,positive,me and my daughter caught it friday night we both absolutely loved it granted i usually judge a movie based on how fun it is and how much i just enjoy it i dont overanalyze things but it was definitely a top 3 for 2018 for me
Oct 7 2018,positive,top notch action humor and suspense although most reviews are on the negative side  the midcredit scene debuting woody harrelson as kletus kassidy aka carnage was portrayed excellently and left many audiences including myself hyped for venom 2 eddie brock was also portryed well by tom hardy but like all marvel movies the villain was too generic and i feel that amir riz could have done a better job at carlton drake
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed venom  tom hardy is such a great actor  my wife also enjoyed it  i read a few reviews from critics and they seem to overthink this movie its just a good time eat some popcorn and enjoy  i didnt read the venom comic books so i cant say how close they are to the movie but i really like how they laid out the relationship of venom to eddie and how you really feel that venom really likes eddie and possibly the human race  maybe some critics wanted a more evil venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and i dont really understand what people expected this to be tom hardy was great it was funny and it left potential for multiple opportunites in the future sure it had its flaws there was a lack of character development and it would be confusing to someone who doesnt really understand what venom is but a world without spiderman maybe but that isnt really made clear at all that this is truly the case in the sequels to come i look forward to seeing a follow up on thi they have a chance to make sometbing better in the long run
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly had a good time watching this and i cant wait for the next movie
Oct 7 2018,negative,2018s venom as i perceive it represents the deterioration of the superhero film as we know it after years of wear and tear it has now been worn down to an empty halfassed and confused mess
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a superhero movie it got car chase bad guys smashing bromance relatable jokes aliens fightingetc what do you expect its definitely not a masterpiece but its certainly not as bad as all those critics are saying  go grab your popcorn and enjoy a 2hour entertainment
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know what some people  are complaining about esp most dimeadozen internet film critics venom was fun and entertaining it adapted the comic source material very well without the spiderman hating elementnand made eddie brock into a more  likeable anti hero type   the most unbelievable part of the movie was us having a health care system that actually allowed easy access to an mri
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome action sequences tom hardy was an awesome eddie brock movie felt like it belongs in the comic spiderverse in my opinion marvel has finally given  their best antihero his due
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was gonna be really bad based on the previous reviews but i was mistaken it was a really funny and action packed movie that everyone should go see
Oct 7 2018,positive,idk why some people are giving stupid reviews is it like a trend the movie was great the graphics were good the acting was good and it honestly makes you hold a soft spot for venom i totally recomend the fact that this movie is getting mixed reviews makes me not trust rotten tomatoes as much anymore i may not be a professional critic but i enjoyed the movie alot
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was awesome it was a good origins movie and i usually dont do reviews but feel this   movie has been underrated if you like venom in comics there is no reason for you to not like this movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is the best superhero movie ive seen in a long time partly because it turns the superhero formula on its head while good i find the dark knight movies usually too intense and serious while most marvel movies are too tongueincheek for my liking its interesting then that this film about a character who looks like a demon from hell manages to strike that perfect balance between being dark intense and light humour i walked out of the cinema smiling i havent had this good a time at the movies in a while     part of that is because venom as a character is so much fun he is a real monster he eats the brains of his foes and his voice could make the predator wet himself but its not all dark and intense venom is likeable he doesnt make quips hes earnest if venom isnt telling the hero to eat the brains of villains he is egging the hero on to get back with his exgirlfriend that is genius and this interest that venom has in people leads to some fantastic moments in the movie theres a scene where venom convinces the hero to apologize to the ex and the hero does so ending resentment between the two when this happens venom says completely unironically aw thats nice    i love venom the character and watching him interact with the people around him is just as entertaining as the insane fight scenes where he is decimating whole teams of armoured armed men which are beautifully spectacular by the way venom is charismatic and fascinating id love to see more of him interacting with eddie brock the films protagonist character and seeing the conversations theyd have i have to commend the filmmakers on venoms design he is huge and brutal and he animates beautifully from the saliva dripping from his lizard tongue to his creepy bulbous eyes venom should always have that insane rictus grin on his face i never like seeing venom in the comics without it having venom wearing the grin throughout the movie was definitely the right way to go even the way venom prowls and hurls himself through the city bleeds with character venom is originally a dark mirror to spiderman but while spiderman swings gracefully venom proves he has his own brutal style just by the way he gets around    tom hardy is a great actor and his talent delivers the human element of the movie hes played bane in batman and max in mad max here demonstrates further range by playing humorous scenes and the fish out of water character of eddie brock who is utterly bewildered by becoming the host to venom michelle williams is great as brocks ex she is spunky and tough and hardy and williams work well together but venom steals the show the chemistry between venom and brock is more interesting than the chemistry between brock and the love interest    the opening of the film is somewhat slow but they have a lot to set up the postcredits scene features brock meeting cletus cassidy and woody harrelson is the most perfect choice to play the role but the wig they gave harrelson was ridiculous but apart from that i loved venom and i cant wait to see more hopefully it wont be too long before we get a sequel
Oct 7 2018,negative,this is definitely boarding on an r rating i really didnt like it and some silly parent had their 3 year old in the theater
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont care what the critics say this movie delivered on all fronts looking forward to the next two
Oct 7 2018,negative,despite tom hardys performance stan lees cameo and some sequences are the highlights venom never seem to settle on what it wants to be on one hand it wants to scream out as an r film that is unfortunately neutered by sony the films distributor just to cater to the younger audience the other is an unintentional romantic comedy disguised as a bad superhero film the rating the inconsistant tone and editing the performances of the supporting cast and the odd inclusion of the extended preview of spiderman into the universe really hurt this movie by a lot i dont care if this still piques your interest but dont bother seeing it if you do youre helping sony nabbing back spiderman away from marvel studios once their current deal ends after the marvelproduced spiderman far from home is out next year do yourself a favor let it fail
Oct 7 2018,neutral,although the entire movie is a pile of confusion there are moments that are actually worth the ticket price even though this movie is not as bad as people say it is it is surely not great it was also painfully obvious that the movie was cut down which is sad in my opinion the only reason why this movie failed was that sony was too greedy to let venom be its own thing and not try to connect it with spiderman by giving it an r rating an r rating wouldve definitely made this movie better
Oct 7 2018,negative,before this movie came out i said to myself this better be either a masterpiece or just the worst movie ever it was neither im sick and tired of these mediocre films making the third act a cgi battle of smoke and fire the only part that was remotely interesting was the beginning of the second act when venom had not taken full control
Oct 7 2018,positive,venon is not a perfect movie but i had a great time the first act of the movie was kind of dragging but the rest is full of action and a great interaction between venom and tom hardy give it a shoot you will have a good tieme
Oct 7 2018,positive,what were the critics expecting this to be interstellar titanic this movie was great in every way and i would go watch it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,1010 would see again
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie not very acurate based on the comics but still really enjoyable
Oct 7 2018,positive,all in all it was a fun filled venom movie that we deserve
Oct 7 2018,positive,favorite movie of the year which is saying something because i usually dont like superhero movies i really felt like the movie isnt meant to be taken too seriously which is a really good thing this movie is just fun to watch but the critics probably wanted something more serious after seeing the previous superhero movies from this year thats just my theory though so take it with a grain of salt anyway this is a must watch for this year saying how there havent been that many good releases of stuff unfriended 2 smallfoot the nun and many more i left out
Oct 7 2018,positive,was funny had action tom hardy was great had story was a great venom and a great movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is the best sony movie i will definitely watch this again
Oct 7 2018,positive,went and saw this opening day great movie tom hardy is a great choice for eddie brock the accent could use some work but over all a great movie definitely recommend to anyone wanting to see it whether a new fan or an old fan looking for a new face
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie however i dont think its one to watch every single week but maybe every 2 months or so if it wasnt for the lousy script id fall in love with the movie however its just that cgi is pretty good and the actors do phenomanal
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is just the beginning and its off to a good start it isnt the best movie i have ever seen but all the boxes are ticked and well i dont know why the movie critics have such a hate on for this movie i am in total disagreement with them i wonder if any of them actually saw this movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,in my opinion very good movie definitely worth to see
Oct 7 2018,positive,wow i love this so much
Oct 7 2018,negative,not going to lie i did have a blast watching but for the wrong reasons
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie despite tiny instability issues
Oct 7 2018,positive,i saw this last night and had a very good time watching it with my friends and a bunch of other people this is coming from someone who is not a fan of marvel or dc or whatever it was hilarious and had good action scenes i recommend it
Oct 7 2018,positive,dark funny and action  packed
Oct 7 2018,positive,i liked the movie very much but we didnt see any web shooting or i missed it but i loved the voice of venom and reletionship with eddie
Oct 7 2018,positive,the connection between eddie and venom and the way it happened was something i didnt expect but really loved its the relationship bruce wishes he had with the hulk im very much looking forward to seeing this duo more the action sequences were perfect and left me wanting more at the end i wished i could hit replay just to experience it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was done perfect i was exactly what i was hoping for just wish the movie was longer
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved it it was funny and amazing boo to the haters tom hardy was incredible
Oct 7 2018,positive,spoiler alert  the bad it was obvious either the editing crew or the producer focused too much on the high tech look of the life foundation and their mercenaries the pyrotechnics with the drones was excessive and the private security training was minimal they needed to focus on bumping up venoms scenes because that what we want oh and its only rated pg13  the good tom hardy as eddie brock is amazing he definitely brought venom out as a stand alone character i cant wait for a rated  r sequel the few fight scenes with venom were amazing may favorite was him ripping through a whole swat team the fight with another symbiote was mediocre alot of this movie really rides on the cool to hilarious relationship that is occurring in eddies head with his new buddy
Oct 7 2018,positive,best movie of october ignore the reviews go take your friends girlfriend your pet whatever you want and watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,grate movie loved every minute
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved venom idk why people hate it  it had everything i want to see from venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,this a good movie but the interacción whit venom and eddi is aften bad and o dont nos no is a 40 i think this movie is a 70 no more
Oct 7 2018,positive,was not expecting much but i really liked it not to dark had its humor cool action scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is a movie that i think that all casual viewers such as comic book readers and those who have not heard of venom will enjoy this film the change of origin of venom is not bad nor is the story the movie presents its a action pack film with comedy moments that every one can enjoy im a huge fan of the alien spiderman hating monster and when i got word of a movie about my favorite symbiote i was hyped the absence of spiderman does not in anyway affect the characters both eddie and venomneither does the missing spider symbol on venom make them less of who they are i enjoy the love and hate relationship between peter parker and both eddie and the symbiote but i did always wonder what kind of personality and duo would vemon be if it never came across spiderman and get rejected by him this movie gives a reasonable way on how eddie and venom would be come as one with the change of how the symbiote works in terms of how they attach themselves with a human host it gives out a believable way on how eddie would have gotten the black oozetheir relationship is  for the most part well paced it did felt a bit fast and the lack of other symbiotes was kinda disappointing not to mention the villan does not have much of a personality other to be ride for riot also eddies ex girlfriend and her new boyfriend werent given much time to develop other then that this movie captures and executes well on the character venom i hope to see a squeal of this film because i can see it become something great its a good first step for sony lets see whats their next step gonna be like
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy michelle williams riz ahmed was cast appropriately for this projectand id go see ot again in fact id buy the dvd
Oct 7 2018,positive,certainly im in a minority when it comes to my fellow critics but i liked venom hell if it wasnt for the sloppy and formulaic script i might have even loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i always wanted spidermans powers until i saw this movie tom really made me want to be venom and i love the character dynamic between venom and eddie
Oct 7 2018,positive,not bad at all its a fun movie definitely worth going to theatres  for it
Oct 7 2018,positive,faithful adaptation of an awesome character the lack of spidey feels organic and enough was left open to allow his inclusion in later installments the  relationship between eddie and venom developed at a reasonable pace and made sense for both of them
Oct 7 2018,positive,make another one and add even more violence
Oct 7 2018,positive,a different take on eddy and venom but it fun and amusing i really liked not what i expected from the movie but fun and entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was far from perfect for sure but that doesnt mean that there was no fun to be had fun with a capital fu to all the dramatic and highbrow affairs that has become of comic book movies off late as much as i love my black panthers and infinity wars it was hard for me to not walk out with a grin having witnessed tom hardy acting like ive never seen him before that alone makes the slow drag during the beginning and the ridiculous execution worth it in my books
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie have argumentals errorsbut the most important of the movia was perfect and it has venom and eddie brockthe cgi is questionable and the most probably it was a bad moviebut not to compare with 4 fantastics o catwomanthats a movia with bad narrative
Oct 7 2018,negative,this movie had a lot of potentialand because it squanders it with poor direction editing and occasionally bad actingit somehow makes it worse than it actually is im not mad at venom just disappointed 
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome freaking movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i actually enjoyed venom despite the reviews tom hardys performance truly was a throwback to jim carreys roles in liar liar and me myself and irene with the schizo moments and it was believable and i enjoyed the comical spin with the venom character especially when he said something along the lines of youre a loser in your world just like im a loser in mine but together were awesome ha ha
Oct 7 2018,negative,every piece of me feels like i have wasted 2 hours  such potential wasted just like that    one of the best marvel villains got annihilated just like that director and all the writers had one job this is a fanmade idea fan made and accepted by other fans all you had to do is to put a comic book and animated series into a regular movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was good perhaps redbox good it was entertaining i dont follow comics much but that was totally out of character for venom must be a alternate universe cause spiderman 3 was the closest to the venom origin story 
Oct 7 2018,positive,the film was a good addition to venom character it became more of a dark comedy than the action horror it was made out to be although this isnt a bad thing as it was hilariously funny and its action pieces flowed perfectly its offcharacter eddie brick was tom hardys take on the character making it his own furthermore not following the comics and altering it in ways lessened the films comic accuracy and nerd points in my opinion but it still remains a solid superheroesque movie and was entertaining all the same
Oct 7 2018,positive,great adaptation tom hardy is amazing cant wait to see it again next weekend
Oct 7 2018,positive,for me and for what i see was a really good movie really enjoyable maybe is not as the comics but that dosnt matter  just go to your movie and enjoy it i dont care what the critics says
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved it if i want great art in the cinema i know where to look this is not that this was an enjoyable fun ride that left me feeling good ill go see it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved this movie dont listen to what critics have a mind of your own and go see it i honestly saw it in 4dx and it was fucking amazing im seriously thinking about going again to watch it today
Oct 7 2018,negative,this was really bad i dont usually post reviews but seeing 89 im in awe how can people like this brocks wife was so poorly written she shouldnt have been there in the first place then she finds out brock went into her laptop and immediately breaks up with him brock did the right thing and then when she finds out brock is venom youre telling me shes not afraid the dude is a fucking monster and you like him again    also the movie was too damn boring in the beginning the fights were a cgi clusterfuck and super blurry no development was brought between eddie and venom venom kept saying he was a loser like him yet the other venom like beings want to go after him why is he important    and when venom went into the wife why didnf she die but everyone else did    also drake sucks as a character what was his motivation just some evil scientist god this movie sucks ive never been this mad at a movie in a while ya are bugging to think this movie is good
Oct 7 2018,positive,sure it takes a little while to get to the point but overall its a fun hilarious movie that i found to be really entertaining the lack of spiderman has no real negative affect and its cartoonishness is part of what makes it so enjoyable
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont pay attention to the critics this movie wasnt perfect but it was a lot of fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,funny creative and kept me on the edge of my seat for the the whole movie v is supposed to be the bad guy but i was rooting for him the only thing missing was spiderman
Oct 7 2018,positive,idk why it gets bad review i think the movie is better than what critics said at least for me
Oct 7 2018,negative,venom is a complete disappointment there is not one moment during the movie that i laughed or that i heard someone else in the theater laugh the action sequences were incredibly bland and venom himself was made very poorly the 112 minutes of gags and eye rolling you will find yourself hoping that here isnt a second installment in this dying sony franchise marvel movies are usually very entertaining and action packed but venom will leave you wondering if tom hardy even has a shred of dignity as to not participate in such a noisy and boring film
Oct 7 2018,positive,not as bad as critics make it out to be overall an ok movie and a solid marvel film tom hardy does a great job 
Oct 7 2018,positive,though it may have deviated from the comics i liked the way they had portrayed venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it i need to see the second one cant wait
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know what the critics watched but the movie i saw was badass
Oct 7 2018,positive,maybe i have a low standard for movies but its not as bad as the critics made it seem i thought it did pretty good without incorporating spiderman into the origin although some parts of the movie seemed rushed i actually enjoyed the humor in the movie too
Oct 7 2018,positive,haters gonna hate stop judging and just go see a movie for fun and remember that it is entertainment
Oct 7 2018,positive,as a fan of the venom comics i enjoyed the movie  the humor is a throwback to the comics  random throw away lines that are simple twisted jokes  the action sequences were spot on as well  people just need to remember this isnt an mcu movie  it isnt going to be an iron man film or captain america  venom is an anti hero who is not above killing his enemies  he is more in line with blade or the punisher
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved the film perfectly captures the characters psychotic and unpredictable nature venom is neither a hero nor a villain and was never meant to be defined all time favorite marvel character
Oct 7 2018,positive,very enjoyable and clever movie there are aspects of it that could have been better but the critics are just wrong about this one
Oct 7 2018,positive,had a very slow beginning but good
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun and entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,really not as bad as the critics are saying actually not really bad at all could it have been better yeah sure but for what it is i actually enjoyed it it was a fun time
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a funny movie to watch if you dont have anything to do ive enjoyed the whole movie but yeah some peter parkers references should be in this movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie was skeptical after reading critics review but so glad i didnt listen to them
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was very good a little fast pace and i felt there could have been more to the story but overall very good
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont give a sht about spiderman and the connections i wanted a badass funny creepy but loveable character and i got it i loved venom i loved tom hardy his ability to channel every emotion and switch back and forth between them is crazy perfect casting was it a perfect movie hell no its obvious a lot of scenes were cut why just stop cutting up awesome movies the pg13 rating means no blood and gore but it was still badass great action nice cgi average background story venoms character development was the only thing where i felt it was chaotic probably thanks to all the cuts whoever choreographed and designed the scenes with venom needs a medal it was so creative
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you wanted to see a movie were there is a funn bond beteween eddie brock and venom you got itif you wanted a good movie you didnt got itit is a mediocre movie and the main antagonist is just dullalthough i would recomend it only if you want a good venom movie  not an action one with good script
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought it was fun movie but its plot sloppy being more of beginning then end and that was it had it improved on the plot more maybe it would have been better
Oct 7 2018,positive,movie was amazing  dont get the 32on ratings movie was 810
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie loved it
Oct 7 2018,neutral,the movie great for visual effects and action scenes i think the story couldnt have been better and some scenes from the film shouldve been removed due to making the filming go fast overall everyone did a good job 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i firmly believe that those who did not like this movie never would have liked it had a couple slow parts but it was very entertaining and a great depiction of venom
Oct 7 2018,negative,terrible film overall all of the best parts were shown in the trailer film was an overall tonal mess with horror mixed with comedy not enough venom shown in the film there was no reason to care for the stacks of the film in terms of the characters honestly would not pay to watch a sequel of this as sony has proved time and time again they cant get the spider verse correct hope they dont green light any other future projects as they will ruin kraven the hunter and morbius give the rights back to marvel and move on would not recommend this film whatsoever
Oct 7 2018,positive,a very good moviewhy do not you all like itbecausepg13horror and not reviewsvery upset by criticsand the film is top
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing film very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat even after the credits are finished
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie despite a lacking script very exciting and funny all the way through a great set up for more venom movies to follow
Oct 7 2018,positive,in my opinion i suppose many critics were disappointed by the subplots for venom because they werent handled by writers in points that we all expected eddie going to be writers werent sure with the writing style that occurred in the story it only goes deeper in eddie and drakes perception though most movies do well with just both venom failed so     most of scenes projected were just there to show that this event happening now is whats happening now what troubled me so much it missed some events to be explained dont want to say which one but early scenes werent so needed i figured some with my own mind it was meant to fire up our expectations it failed but i was tricked    characters such as eddie brock was supposed to act like the comics do but if so it would be very in anyway some people describe i dont usually pay attention to what is happening in the backgrounds i pay attention to the pictures so as most fans      i appreciated that sony had done well to the characters but failed to deliver detailed plots
Oct 7 2018,positive,while not a perfect movie it brought to life a fantastic rendition of an iconic character from my childhood im so glad this was finally done and i do hope they release an r rated version like fox did with the wolverine i wasnt a big fan of the wolverine but its just a comparison as i believe the reception of an r rated version would be far more likely to draw audiences upon its home release
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was a great movie lots of fun tom hardy was perfect i loved the action and thought it was a great first film for the introduction of this character
Oct 7 2018,neutral,if this movie had come out in 2004 it would have been amazing since its 2018 its just a merely okay comic book movie with a fun and charismatic lead performance from tom hardy the story was all over the place but it does have some cool action scenes and good interplay with eddie brock and venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,i recommend everyone to watch this film
Oct 7 2018,positive,it could have been better but still not bad
Oct 7 2018,positive,obviously critic reviews are way off they are as important as professional yelpers at this point
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is a classic popcorn action which amazingly found a balance between gritty seriousness and comedy that actually worked for the majority of the film never thought i would be satisfied with a venom movie sans spiderman but this was a good one definitely worth a watch in theatres
Oct 7 2018,positive,maybe its not the dark and ultra violent movie we were expecting to see but  i had a good time seeing it its funny in its own way the visuals are ok and surely not boring in general
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it  kids loved it  despite critiics bad reviews i thought it was funny good cgi and tom hardy was great as always
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont over think it its a good popcorn flick 
Oct 7 2018,negative,weird boring silly venom was no that was awful how dare you call yourself marvel i was so disappointed 
Oct 7 2018,positive,an entertaining superhero movie with a satisfying fanservice
Oct 7 2018,positive,not your typical marvel movie actually enjoyed it after reading some of the reviews  i am guess that they were expecting avengers 35 but instead received ang lees hulk the audience loved it ignore the critics and go see it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i thought the movie was really fun and entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie its really funny which is not something that i expected but it works most of my friends agree with me on this it truly is an awesome movie
Oct 7 2018,negative,one of the weaker films based on marvel comics characters michelle williams is wasted in a rather poorly written character and the bad guy is weak tom hardy does his best with a rather unlikable lead character as well however the film is still entertaining and has some fun action sequences particularly a chase through san francisco and some amusing moments wish they had done this as a film more connected to the greater mcu instead of having it stand aside but it is what it is
Oct 7 2018,positive,my 10 year son and i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was great i couldnt find anything wrong with the film except for its age restriction in my country being 16lv but the movie it self was truly amazing venom shouldnt be getting all these bad reviews if i could i would give a rotten tomatoes score of 100venom is a must watch movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont get why it wasnt rated r it had a lot of cursing and people diying and they bite peoples heads off so that baffled me  however the movie was really good once he gets venom the first 30 minutes has weird passing but i think its because they cut 40 minutes out i pretty sure the critics got paid off because it didnt have spiderman
Oct 7 2018,positive,the story is lacking true rizs character was weak in all honesty i dont know what people are complaining about the movie is watchable and the action was great eddy brock and the symbiote works well i would and want to see it againthe beginning before venom drags too long buckle your belts one venom enters the movie i will say to go check out the movie for yourself and not listen to other bad mouthing the movie just bad mouthing it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was dope and funny liked it a lot actually way better then i thought the previews dont do it justice
Oct 7 2018,positive,start off a little slow but it had to be that way to explain the story but once he becomes venom movie is a hit
Oct 7 2018,positive,first i see the score that rotten tomatoes gave 30 its make me hesitate  but i really love marvel and characters of venom before  for me i want to tell who hesitate and think i should watch it or not  please go to cinema and watch its  its will not make you disappoint  after i watch this movie i really love tom hardy  he is very good with his role  so watch its
Oct 7 2018,positive,so greatits so coolspecial effectsplotsthemeatmosphereall those are goodthe performance of performers are goodtootom hardys performance is really brilliantlike the theme music of eminem so much
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was so good wow and sets a great time for the next 3 movies ignore the critic review they straight up have no idea what to think great change of pace for marvel
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved the movie the cgi could have been better loved the eddievenom interactions 
Oct 7 2018,positive,best action move i ever seen going to rewatch it and cant wait to buy on blue ray fire
Oct 7 2018,positive,incredible chemistry between the main characters that drive the entire movie to a lot of fun and a fuller take of the character never seen before in a movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,rrated  is not rrated
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had a lot of fun watching this one it had its flaws but the critics were wrong on this one i totally recommend it
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen this year and is in my top 10 favourites
Oct 7 2018,positive,the critics were too harsh for this movie no way this is a 31 film beautiful action sequences and fun dialogue loosen up critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,great action great fxs great acting  from tom hardy tho sometimes the scenes didnt fill organic and more rushed for time and plot contraint but you still enjoyed falling into the world of venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,im a huge fan of any symbiote  this movie was much better than i was expecting  all of the reviews that say the first have is horrible were very wrong  everything worked  it was a lowbudget hero movie that needed a lot of cgi and they made it work
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was good it almost makes you forget that spiderman wasnt involved almost 
Oct 7 2018,positive,first and foremost id like to adress the following    ignore these critic reviews  the majority of these selfproclaimed movieexperts gave star wars the last jedi an excellent rating whether you liked that movie or not it was full of plot holes misplaced jokes and did not follow the dame vibe that the previous sw movies did yet these critica glorify tlj and blame venom for these exact same points take that in mind    venom  storyline 710  venom does and does not following the comicbooks and in my opinion it actually works pretty well the writers did an excellent job in avoiding some issues that could be had if ever an adaption would follow in the mcu we all know venom becomes venom after he first takes over spidey but that has been adressed in a reasonable satisfying way there are some little flaws within the story especially at the end which could result with a whylook on your face but all in all id day that this is a pretty good origin story    acting 810  tom hardy tom freaking hardy any movie is watchable with this man in it but the way he delivers venom is excellent if this was a one man show which sometimes feels like it id give this a 1010 no doubt the interaction between brock and venom is hilarious and played out very well on hardys part his costars do a pretty good job as wellbut lets be honest here once hardy shows up in a scene 80 if not more its a hardy scene maybe some bigger stars wouldve had its benifit but then again michelle williams and riz ahmed did a pretty good job  venom couldve been written a little dariker they wanted to push the antihero envelope here but i wouldve liked to see a bit more villain side or antivillain    visual  sound 710  some scenes are beautifully filmed dont expect dunkirk visuals here but the little scenes like the walking off into the bright city or towerroundabout is what makes you appreciate the little breaks into the   cgiviolence speaking of which  the cgi is pretty good as well i like how venom looks and acts throughout the movie is it a perfect adaptation for venom no but i hope and feel that we get to see that as venom evolves the sound is on point again nothing breathtaking but does the job soundtrack by eminem cant go wrong    superhero genre 710  i think i need to adress this since a lot of critics are conplaing about the fact that venom missed the superhero boat no but there are some problems venom tries to be darker in a similar fashion that nolans batman trilogy once did and it partly succeeds the reason for that is in my opinion that they dialed the grittyness a bit down this has to do with the pgratings and to appeal to younger fans obiously which is fine by me in the comicbooks venom is a villain  antivillain but sony for possibly the mcu is looking at venom from the antihero perspective which works reasonably well    general 75  10  i enjoyed the movie im a big comicbook nerd but instead of being bitter i was suprissed by the changes accepted them and as the movie went one even welcomed them venom isnt perfect but it sure as hell isnt as bad as these critics make you believe it is and to end it all  thats the reason i even began this review in the first place
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont understand why critics are being so hard on this movie this movie did a great job in setting up the character and having a more to venom as a chaotic neutral things were not so black and white there is more to the characters than just good vs evil not cookie cutter so what if spiderman isnt in it this movie is important to the franchise and they are doing it right you have to build up to things cant just rush and give it all away at once then its half baked
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was great cant wait for the directors cut go see it
Oct 7 2018,positive,fuck the critics this movie does well on what it wants to do but it also hasnt its flaws like for instance an r rating because some scenes need it and also the gillian of the sort was weak at the movie and  performance but its  still an enjoyable film
Oct 7 2018,positive,it is faithful to the comic were talking about two identities sharing one being  you should expect chaos not to mention the alien race is a violent hostile one this is not like every other superhero movie dont  judge it against the rest or expect the same type of characters and good vs bad arch venom is a true antihero and a damn funny one
Oct 7 2018,negative,audiences will find mild entertainment in its action scenes the title characters few full appearances and in the two protagonists symbiotic relationship otherwise venom is a disastrous exercise on storytelling filled with narrative clichés tonal inconsistencies and disregard for the title character and on editing with pacing issues at all times and obvious raccord mistakes
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie dont pay attention to these critics love it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is cool and funny and i recommend it  this how much i care about the critics  0
Oct 7 2018,positive,given the critic reviews and very low expectations i ended up really liking this movies they actually didnt have me missing spiderman which was the hardest thing to pull overall fun movie and it would be great to see this version of venom somehow added to the mcu in the future
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was absolutely fantastic do not let the critics dim your view of this movie and they do realize that just about every marvel movie never went exactly the way of the comics this was his introduction and personally i think this movie was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a fun movie i loved tom hardy and venom relation was pretty dopedyeah its not a perfect movie but i want to see more of it
Oct 7 2018,neutral,blaise a lot of bangs but nothing more but still enjoyed
Oct 7 2018,positive,a lot of fun i loved the relationship between eddie and venom and definitely got into the story i would actually consider watching this movie again in theatres pretty pumped for the sequel teaser bring on carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was great very entertaining tom hardy did a great job as usual i have no idea why would it get a 32 some critics are just idiots people dont pat attention to the ratings just go watch it you wont be disappointed
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good critics are dumb
Oct 7 2018,positive,a perfect combination of humour and action me and my friends really loved it i can understand the critics and i do think the script is a bit messy too but nevertheless it was fun to watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,a fun and very funny well paced movie these critics cant be trusted i 100 recommend this is funny like the first deadpool in a lot of ways awesome
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good i like it hope its in the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good movie very underrated to say the least this movie should at least be a 70 on the tomato scale my advise is go watch it you will like it
Oct 7 2018,positive,not on the deadpool or guardians level but i loved it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was very good  loved it  tom hardy is amazing  great pick for venom  never listen to the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely loved it it was funny and exciting
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was an interestingly entertaining movie tom hardy as eddie brock and venom greatly aided the movie the dynamic between venom and brock definitely drove the movie forward my only complaints are the scenes between brock and venom tom hardy claimed were his favorite were not in the movie as they most likely wouldve enhanced the bonding between venom and brock the antagonist was decent he honestly wasnt that memorable the only thing i really remember about him is that the writers litterally made him elon musk the end credits scenes there are two were both interesting in their starkly different ways but have me pumped for whatever hopefully comes next overall go see venom if you want to be entertained for an hour and thirty minutes to two hours you wont be disappointed
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was not evil enough otherwise it was a good movie i like it more then any of sonys spiderman movies
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved the movie very funny with lots of action critics are wrong as usual definitely worth price of ticket
Oct 7 2018,positive,it isnt as bad as they are saying its not perfect but is good
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a great movie really fun to watch and i have no clue whats wrong with the critics who are saying its bad
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie starts slow as you learn the background of the characters but the meddle and ending are great lots of great action and humor a very fun flick
Oct 7 2018,positive,theres enough interesting performances effects and design to make up for a few shortcomings really enjoyable and more memorable than a lot of recent superhero flicks
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was pretty comic book accurate although i was left at the end of the movie unsatisfied with the amount of pure venom i think as soon as spiderman makes his way into the mix everything will fall into place and will turn out to be a great movie 
Oct 7 2018,positive,better than expected 
Oct 7 2018,positive,5 out of 5 stars i have been a venom fan as long as i have been big enough to pick up a comic book this movie captures everything about venom and eddie brock that i love thank you for making this movie dont drop the ball with the next one
Oct 7 2018,positive,i just want to state my overall opinion of the film as a whole to contrast the negative vocal aspect of movies nowadays i also want to state this isnt a good review made to spite said negative side i wholeheartedly liked venom it certainly could have went on longer but its understandable that you can only fit so much into a time frame venom aims to fix the problem with many movies centered around comic books the powers themselves rather than treating the symbiote venom as a suit a power or a plot devise venom is his own character inhabiting the body of eddie brock some might nitpick the plotline as being nonsensical given that venom derives his power and style from spiderman but we have to be realistic and admit that licensing isnt as simple as saying please i enjoyed the action and eddies struggle to understand his situation and knowing the character of venom i loved the slight nuances and anterior motives venom did not explicitly state outright
Oct 7 2018,positive,went in with poor expectation and came out really pleased and waiting for more yes an r rated film would have been much better hopefully we will get a br version with all the gore
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is one of the best movies ive seen in years they nailed it now i want to be venim casting cinematography and cgi are on point of course there is a slight resemblance between venom and spiderman but its obvious that they are savages on their own thank you columbia and marvel for this amazing work of art
Oct 7 2018,positive,really great movie loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely fantastic i really loved it very entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed it very much  definitely dont go by the rt score and watch it for yourself
Oct 7 2018,positive,not perfect but very good great visual effects and action dont listen to the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,once again thank you rotten tomatoes for lowering my expectations although as i was reading some of the reviews i came across things that me scratch my and go hmmm i read one of the reasons a critic didnt like it and my thought was whats wrong with that or even huh thats a reason for to like this movie so me and 68 of the rt critics are on opposite sides i really dug this flick it was lots of fun tom hardy and michelle williams are superb ruben fleischer really understands the relationship between eddie and venom the movie does take a bit long to get to the main attraction and it seems to spend a lot of time on character development that doesnt do the best job of making anyone outside of eddie seem more than 2 dimensional and finally the design of venom is on point i can not wait to see more of this version i all all in on sonys venomverse
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie best of 2018 1010
Oct 7 2018,positive,doing venom justice a must see film for all comic lovers
Oct 7 2018,positive,once again the critics missed the mark i actually saw the movie because the critics score and liked it go figure there are definitely some slow parts but it was a fun movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont understand the logic of being so cruel this film was enough to start the story  if we count the points to be criticized it was too fast and the villain could be further elaborated but this does not prevent you from taking the note because tom hardy
Oct 7 2018,positive,had a blast loved venom and eddie brock just think it would benefit from an r rating and just tone down the comedian side of venom just a little bit
Oct 7 2018,positive,i can truly say i got my moneys worth wasnt bad or perfect but it kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for more tom hardy job well done
Oct 7 2018,positive,funny and packed with actions
Oct 7 2018,positive,a great movie which reflects the work of tom hardy has epic scenes of action justified comic scenes and a plot that never leaves it i do not know what movie they saw the critics but it was not venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is every bit of fun i hoped it would be pure 90s movies hokey with endearing venom and eddie seriously such a pleasure to watch and finally a break from typical superhero films
Oct 7 2018,positive,okay so i loved the movie and take this how ever way you would like to i didnt hate spiderman 3 even though it was the most cringe movie i had ever seen this movie was amazing i loved the action the acting the character and the phenomenal performance of tom hardy as eddie brock now i do agree this movie could have been better for example the cgi honestly wasnt that bad but wasnt that good either the cgi looked like it belongs in 2010 so what about the future of this movie well it got a b from cinima scores so thats not bad i happen to think thats pretty good we just gotta wait to see what it scores in the box office this movie is the kind of movie i would sit down to watch again 3 times everything about this movie had me on edge and the post credit scene has me anxious to find out weather we get a sequel or we dont get nothing at all this movie had everything you want the mood of the movie was kinda all over the place i didnt know if it was a comedy or a horror movie but i still very much liked it and i personally think that if you havent seen it yet you should go watch it the movie is worth your time now this is just my opinion on the movie and its okay if you have a different opinion but if you havent seen go watch then leave all your opinion but just because someone says dont watch it or i didnt like it that doesnt mean you shouldnt watch go check it out and find your own opinion on the movie personally i think you should check it out and enjoy a nice tub of popcorn
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to fake reviews this movie is brilliant yeah it may need an attachment to spiderman somehow but that will come in time i loved the lethal protector comic and this movie is based on it
Oct 7 2018,positive,great fun movie look forward to seeing it again
Oct 7 2018,positive,good action movie and actor hope marvel studio take venom in mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a must watch if you want to see funny horror and fight sciences watch it
Oct 7 2018,positive,brilliant screw the critics they need new hobbies go see the movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i usually rely on rotten tomatoes to  steer me clear of bad movies but the reviewers got this movie so wrong it was entertaining and as usual tom hardy was amazeballs go watch this with an open mind  our theater was packed and everyone coming out as the movie let out said it was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was the definition of pefect
Oct 7 2018,positive,it took a long time for the movie to start but once it did it was truly funny with great action scenes tom hardy and michelle williams are amazing in their roles
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics dont do this movie justice the humor and action sequences are dark but enjoyable definitely worth a watch
Oct 7 2018,neutral,its a messy film to say the least the title character isnt even in the film that much and doesnt appear until more than halfway through the plot is muddled and very slow to get started when venom does finally show up its fun for a bit but the the finale changes the character with little to no buildup on how or why the finale feels rushed and like a lot was left on the cutting room floor which says a lot because by the 60 minute mark i was already checking my watch and losing interest i had high hopes for this one and it fell very short of my expectations the kiddo loved it though she agrees that the good stuff doesnt start until venom finally shows up
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom shouldve been rated r but its still really good
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie a must see
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom was a sensational movie it was unpredictable lots of fun the action story  acting was brilliant critics are always hard on superhero films which arent  a product of mcu films
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont base your decisions on what the critics are saying i very much liked this movie dont let them tell you what you should or shouldnt like
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie overall not sure why critics rated so low
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen dont listen to the bad reviews the film is amazing
Oct 7 2018,positive,i was so hyped going into this movie and came out of it absolutely soaring we see the bennining of what is undoubtably going to grow into everyones favorite lethal protector fun as all hell to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie wait till the end credits 
Oct 7 2018,negative,funny packed with action but not at all what we wanted to see from tom hardy venom movie its missing the gritty edge we wanted from a villain headlining movie
Oct 7 2018,negative,90s movie with 90s graphics watch spawn again if you want an idea of what to expect and save money
Oct 7 2018,positive,those who are saying that venom is complete disaster  those are real piece of sht  venom you rock 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is being overlooked i feel this is a messy film yes but as a pg13 rated film i feel this does the character of venom very well yes there is a lot of potential but this is a surprisingly impressive film venom is a good film not amazing but not bad there will be a sequel and i hope there is i liked it just give it a chance it is fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun movie keeps your attention its no infinity war or winter soldier but its also better than what the critics give it theres an awesome mid credits scene for the fans of the comics and also an end credit scene
Oct 7 2018,neutral,sonyjust let go of the spiderman movies let marvel do it right cuz you just dilute the brand make the video games where hackneyed dialogue and wooden acting is the norm tom hardy you just used your one time spiderman save everybody gets one
Oct 7 2018,negative,just dont see it save yourself time and money unlike me
Oct 7 2018,positive,actually a good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,very good movie very good dark humor and dialogue between the two main characters slow starter but a good pointer to a nice duology or perhaps triology in here i cant wait for the next one the best thing is that its low on unnecessary violence that makes this a suitable movie for 12 year olds and up
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie doesnt fall into the pitfalls that plague most superhero movies nowadays love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,story was amazing action was best i like sense of humour made laugh in end deserve a higher rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,really enjoyed it good humour excellent effects good casting and generally really fun best marvel movie in a while
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics because this movie was awesome tom hardy is the perfect fit in this role and the chemistry between eddie and venom is the highlight of the movie riz ahmed is a good fit for the antagonist his character was menacing and you could understand his motives michelle williams felt underused and tacked on at times but it didnt take away from the film much at all the effects were amazing and its was a fanboys dream come true to see venom done right in live action very fun movie had lots of laughs and did the character justice great film 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its not perfect but its definitely not bad i really enjoyed this movie for what it was and i look forward to see what the sequel has in store
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie had me on edge of my seat the whole time
Oct 7 2018,positive,could have been so much better go in with low expectations and you might not be disappointed 
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie was it perfect of course not few movies are but this is a wonderful  comic book movie and i really think that rotten tomatoes is being ridiculously unfair to the film go see it yourself trust me you wont regret it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i will let the critics be critics on this one  still theyre wrong i had a ball the film was awesome
Oct 7 2018,positive,movie was amazing  i like the way sony introduce the character
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont understand all of the negative press surrounding the film it definitely isnt a masterpiece but i feel its one or two scenes away from being great still very good and entertaining venom is a hilarious badass
Oct 7 2018,positive,not a bad movie felt like the end was rushed which is disappointing but it is definitely above 80 thumbs up in my book
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the most entertaining movie ive watched lately it has obvious flaws in the plot but who cares as long as the movie is fun to watch in the end you go to a movie to have fun and not to make sense of every damn thing or win an oscar tom hardy was just amazing 
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie has obvious flaws and the generic storyline and main villain are definitely parts of them however the interactions between eddie brock and venom are fantastic the humor does not feel out of place or forced and actually works quite well the sound design is absolutely beautiful and i do believe that it deserves an oscar nomination overall its a really good time dont listen to the critics its a fun movie not more but definitely not less
Oct 7 2018,positive,dunno why critics hate this movie i enjoyed it yes there are gaps in the storyline but as the first in probably a long new franchise it gets the job done
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is just fun its going to have plot holes its going to have bad jokes but overall its just a fun movie if you go into this thinking you are seeing a masterpiece you will be disappointed but if you go in with an open mind looking for something enjoyable you will come out happy
Oct 7 2018,positive,doss not deserve the critic reviews its received tom hardy and riz ahmed were both brilliant the cgi was fantastic and the action was very well constructed the only part that stopped it from being amazing was that the beginning was rushed and the characters connected to eddie brock eg his girlfriend and his boss were not explored enough to support the key emotional moments between them apart from that it was really enjoyable and lays the groundwork for the future of the character
Oct 7 2018,positive,a fun time with some great use of dark humor a little weak at the end and the villain was its weakest point but the journey to get there was what mattered
Oct 7 2018,positive,do not listen to the critics this movie is good eddievenom is great
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is so bad battle scene was amazing eddie and venom did not disappoint
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was good me and the kids enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,highly recommend that if you are a fan of the comicstofilm genre thats been emerging you watch this movie no its not the best but as far as a new entry into a sony cinematic universe goes this was fantastic hell you wont even be bored the plot may be a little predictable and some jokes did miss but a lot hit for me   im sure i speak for a lot of people when i say that comic fans want their adaptations to feel familiar venom surprisingly accomplishes this well and feels familiar and has earned a place at the table in the marvel mythos
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know why people are so butt hurt because spiderman wasnt in this movie  if this in the same universe as the new spiderman then he shouldnt be in it since thanos snappeninged his ass out of existence  im a fan of the comics and i loved this movie  i took someone who did not know anything about venom  she followed it and knows the basics about both venom and brock  the fight scenes were awesome and i loved how it hinted at carnage in the end with woody harrelson  as a closing thought id like to say i loved this movie will look forward to the next installment of it and based on the 80 million dollar opening weekend im not the only one who enjoyed venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,not sure why critics gave it the rating they did but regardless venom is a must see movie its an action packed thriller that keeps you laughing and on your toes throughout the movie there are 2 post ending credit scenes 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its amazing dont listen to critics on this one at all
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this is a great superhero movie with actual  original elements love how the dynamic of the eddie and brock relationship
Oct 7 2018,positive,definitely the best version of venom on screen in my opinion this film was quite enjoyable but not perfect tom hardy did a fantastic job playing both eddie brock and the voice of venom i guess this first venom movie was intended towards a family audience and i hope we get to see more blood and gore in the sequel so that it can further capture venoms ferocity and power
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was amazing i waited 15 years for venom to have a standalone film and here it is i cannot wait until the sequel 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom 4 out of 5 stars venom is an awesome antihero character that got his own movie after having a cheesy appearance in spiderman 3 venom does make up for it sony trying to create their own universe with their own superhero films the movie is awesome with tom hardy taking the role and the action sequences are top notch exciting it does suffer from a boring villain and a thin plot but it could have been a whole lot worse the plot follows a space probe crashing down on earth with a corporation life foundations trying to reclaim four symbiotic lifeforms carlton drake riz ahmed is leading life foundations and only discovered three symbiotic contained while one is missing meanwhile eddie brock tom hardy is a journalist reporter talking about current issues about our todays problems his fiancée anne michelle williams is an employee of life foundations and he decides to use her intel to interview drake about people being test subjects for his experiments when the interview goes bad with brock losing his job relationship and his lifes work an insider decides to help brock get inside life foundation to gather evidence of drakes evil experiments with people brock gets infected from a symbiotic known as venom with drake and his paramilitary after brock brock soon learns to cooperate with his alter ego of venom to fight the bad guys the films plot was pretty thin the first act is a bit slow with brock living poorly after he lost everything and drake becoming a mad scientist with experimenting using symbiotes on people trying to find a perfect host for the symbiotes until brock becomes venom than the rest of the movie is drake having his men chase him down and the villains plan on sending another space probe into space riz ahmed was not as intriguing as the villain carlton drake he plays like a mad scientist that is obsessed with trying to find the perfect human being that can host a symbiote venom does face off against another symbiote known as riot which was cool especially during the chaotic fight in the climax tom hardy is great as eddie brockvenom and he also voices venom it is pretty cool to see eddie battling with himself as venoms voice bickers at him that is were the fun begins in the movie when eddie notices his appetite has increased and he thinks he is going insane with the voice in his head he is running around the street and restaurant with his maniac behavior when the bad guys show up and venom takes over to fight them off it is pretty cool there is also thrilling motorcycle chase and venom battling through a swat team and the climax battle with riot michelle williams was good as anne brocks exs love interest the visual effects were great with venom the motorcycle chase scene may have some cheesy effects but its almost unnoticeable overall venom is a good superhero film the action sequences are awesome it is nice to see venom fighting bad guys even some gritty scene were he bites their heads off seeing eddie and venom talk their differences is fun tom hardy is great as the character the plot may be thin and have a boring villain like carlton drake still makes an entertaining superhero movie there is also a mid credit scene that foreshadows for a sequel villain and a post credit scene which sony is marketing their other animated superhero film which i do not think it is important to the venom universe
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best movies that i have seen
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics are stupid this movie was so fun it was hilarious and the venom eddie bromance was the best loved it
Oct 7 2018,positive,just the right amount of edginess to make this movie as a whole a home run
Oct 7 2018,positive,excellent movie dont trust the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie dont listen to the critics 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved it i thought it had just the right amount of humor
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really liked it true to the comics 
Oct 7 2018,positive,for the next movie they should go rated r but apart from it not being as brutalviolent and disgusting as i expected well it was a pretty good movie the visual effects werent super realistic but for they were still eye candy venom himself was funny and the acting was great
Oct 7 2018,positive,slow beginning but gets good in the middle to wnd
Oct 7 2018,positive,i knew going in that spiderman wasnt in the film i know vemons story however i went in with an open mind i thought it was an amazing story and film 
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom well is a good film but let me explain why its a good film and why critics are wrong about that comic adaptation many reviews are saying that venom have crisis between being bgrade horror and something like thorragnarok and its true but thats not defect of that film true defect is how radically film changed its tone that happend in just one scene this is that defect but its not ruining entire venom film people cant focus only on bad side just look at the good side but with bad side too and you will see venom is actually a great film experience even that change of tone would be a quite good and original thing if it would be done less radically
Oct 7 2018,positive,its great if you just like action and nothing else really matters but you can definitely tell where they had to cut some stuff out to make this a pg13 movie it left a lot of questions being asked however venom itself looked amazing 
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie is really good  its far better than what the critics tell you i went to see the movie  expecting it to be good and was not disappointed  tom hardys performance and the scenes with venom involved are the highlights
Oct 7 2018,positive,came into the movie just having read the critical comments i thought they were wrong this movie is entertaining there are far worse superhero movies tom hardy was solid
Oct 7 2018,positive,look frickin anwsome
Oct 7 2018,positive,interesting and exciting 
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie on contrary to critics action good tom hardy great a really fun and enjoyable movie do recommend
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you like action movies with no blood no chemistry and cringe then this movie is for you tom hardy is flatter than a piece of paper and just as dry the quickest and most uninspired turn around of any character i have ever seen only go if you can save money on the seat
Oct 7 2018,positive,it really is not a bad movie i think its paced oddly in the beginning however once venom is introduced the fun begins go watch venom its worth it
Oct 7 2018,positive,so bad its good honestly a fun movie with good jokes decent action but a bad script dont pay more than 7 to see it but see it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,while the story in the movie of venom has its flaws the lack of spiderman for example tom hardys portrayal of eddie brockvenom was quite enjoyable venom fans will definitely have a fun time seeing this as it does some things well character wise more time developing a story with morebetter tie ins to the spiderman universe would have done it justice
Oct 7 2018,positive,action packed and entertaining there are some parts that dont make sense or are unrealistic however i enjoyed the movie and loved tom hardy in this role 
Oct 7 2018,positive,sure its uneven and is flawed but i had a fun time watching it hardy seems to understand how to handle the script and does a great job with the material despite the tropes and incomplete plot it is still fun to watch because it doesnt take itself too seriously even though it doesnt exactly know what it is trying to be originally i ranked it a bit higher but after much thought i can only give it a passable grade theres too much that could have been better and im not even a huge spiderman fan id be interested in the parts that hardy said got cut 
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie is not a masterpiece but also doesnt pretend to be instead its an extremely entertaining piece of work which highly respects the comics and with a spectacular tom hardy
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignore the critics its a lot of fun go see it
Oct 7 2018,positive,extremely awesome and tom hardys performance was extremely great and his venom was even better i was venomized after leaving the theater
Oct 7 2018,positive,a really good movie not great could have been better but really good 
Oct 7 2018,positive,easily one of my best five superhero movies a perfect mixture of horror and humor my wife who normally doesnt laugh at the jokes in the mcu found the humor in this not force and genuinely laughed and had an amazing time
Oct 7 2018,positive,i really enjoy watching this and would definitely watch it again there were some cheesy parts for the most part it was really good i also liked both of te post credit scenes
Oct 7 2018,positive,with the amount of violent decapitations and impailments there should have been at least some reasonable amount of pg13 blood and gore to support the killings this movie should have been made with an r rating with the added blood and gore to support the violence aside from that overall i found the movie generally enjoyable to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,good moviewatchable
Oct 7 2018,positive,genuinely do not know why the ratings are so low  it wasnt a perfect movie by any means but it was an entertaining movie certainly much better than any dc movie and would definitely see again worth a watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,you can tell the movie cut out some story in the beginning so they could give brock the symbiote sooner for someone who has almost every venom comic and a wardrobe of venom attire i believe they did justice to the character its not your typical superhero movie and it tries very hard to stay faithful to the characters origins so in that regard this movie is definitely not for everyone but neither was deadpool go in with an open mind and you might be surprised
Oct 7 2018,positive,could have been better but i had fun
Oct 7 2018,positive,a very enjoyable movie there is no need to know anything about comics the movie takes you through the character development and story effortlessly venoms backstory could have been fleshed out a little more to understand his motivations besides that they have nailed it with the budget they had
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie full of action with some humor thrown in
Oct 7 2018,positive,going in expectations were low based on critics reviews i enjoyed this movie though eddie is a funny likable appealing character
Oct 7 2018,positive,not the typical superhero vs normal human soldier movie loved how they introduce the different characters cant wait for venom 2 3
Oct 7 2018,positive,it might have done better with the r  rating but still it is enjoyable and i dont understand the hate for it any superhero movie outside of the mcu has to be degraded just for the sake of thrashing it for no reason
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie is one of the best comic book movies ever
Oct 7 2018,positive,if youre tired of the same superhero formula and was relived when you saw deadpool you will greatly enjoy this movie and most important towards the end of the movie you will actually get to like venon itself as a separate carácter from its human host i cant wait to see a sequel 
Oct 7 2018,positive,big venom fan and loved him in the movie it was entertaining but the cgi in the fighting scenes was not the greatest 
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics are wrong it was so much fun enjoyed everything about it
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics are stupid yeah it want a greatgreat film but heck i enjoyed the ride  and thats the whole point right its a good popcorn flick worthy of my suspension of disbelief and a 10 dollar ticket yeah it wasnt perfect filmmaking but it still it delivered an entertaining story with a comic character i only wished it had gone darkerrated r instead of the pg13 the 31 score is stupid even the last jedi flick wasnt that entertaining
Oct 7 2018,positive,probably best movie ive seen all year
Oct 7 2018,positive,i liked it hade more fun than on antman and the wasp tom hardy did a good job the story was not bad it was better then i expected 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i very much enjoyed this movie dont listen to the critics

Oct 7 2018,negative,it is truly concerning that people think something like this is entertaining and funny
Oct 7 2018,positive,ignoring any type of current herogenre storytelling venom somehow offers an entertaining experience thanks to tom hardy and venom unique relationship and outshines its bombastic yet selfaware plot and script that seems like a 2 hour detour to a early2000s hero flick
Oct 7 2018,positive,i never review movies or anything for that matter but the critic reviews has caused me to defend this movie awesome action and good story that kept you interested and excited from start to finish hardy and the symbiote have hilarious dialogue back and forth that he pulled off very well one of my favorite movies this year dont let the critic reviews steer you away see this
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome a great character development for eddie brock great execution by tom hardy perfect balance of badassness and humorous puns excited for this franchise
Oct 7 2018,positive,a bit slow in the beginning and venom only eat 2 people the same amount as shown in the teaser as a movie as a hole though it was a good movie and have a way of getting you to like venom 
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont know what the critics are talking about this was a fun movie that i would happily watch again it has some issues but i walked out with a smile on my face good work mr hardy

Oct 7 2018,positive,it was true to the comics and critics dont get it sad

Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best movies ive seen
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is actually good with lot of good cgi fights i had total fun every movie has its own flaws so its not a big issue to me the only thing i care about is that it should not take me out of the movie i had a great time waiting for the sequel wearevenom
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie dont listen to the fake critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,wtf is wrong with these damn critics they almost fooled me on death wish with bruce willis which was a bad ass movie and now with venom you guys need fired fired i say fired
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it brilliant film funny and a great representation of venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,good movie i liked the interaction between venom and eddie and the comedy that was sprinkled in the first 3040 minutes were a little slow
Oct 7 2018,positive,they did a good job without being able to use spiderman still enjoyed myself 
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing i truly liked it well done humorous balanced action and really good casting without the hype all of other superhero movies its on the top of the decade
Oct 7 2018,positive,an exciting movie that the whole family can enjoy and laugh with a suspenseful outcome different and original than any other movie out there family cant wait for the sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,super amazing movie watched it 2 times and still hyped finally venom got to be the beast that he is on the big screen and to all the critics we beat you the movie already made 205mil worldwide and 80 mil domestic so how do you like dem apples
Oct 7 2018,positive,idk why people said it was bad i went to see it with my squad and it was a really great movie

Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a great movie 1010
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie like it a lot 
Oct 7 2018,positive,amazing movie with loads of fun what else a movie needs top critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you are going to this movie to see a dark scary origin story of a super villain you will hate it however if u are like most people and just want to be entertained with some action and comedy you will love it absolutely hilarious movie and makes me excited to see how eddie will develops as a character 1110
Oct 7 2018,positive,comical and action packed 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a fun movie if you dont go thinking its another marvel movie tom hardy does a great job playing venom perfect cast overall its a good and entertaining movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,good fun the back and forth between venom and eddie brock is truly funny the action set pieces were hit and miss when venom was dominating people and biting heads it was great when two symbiotes were mashing together it was boring i hope this franchise gets a chance to develop generally comic book movies are as good as their villains its tough to jam a quality villain into an origin story venom is no exception in that regard with the origin out of the way though hopefully we will get some more fleshed out antagonists going forward although ill happily take a one dimensional over the top insane antagonist its a comic book movie fun and dumb is totally acceptable 
Oct 7 2018,positive,its actually good dont listen anyone and watch the film
Oct 7 2018,positive,i enjoyed it not the best marvel movie lots of plot gaps but hardy does a good job masking venom endearing
Oct 7 2018,positive,i love tom hardy as eddie brock and venom was a fun movie  lots of action michelle williams is a great actress but she was rather wasted in what was a throwaway role as annie giving 4 12 out of five stars simply because it was just a great enjoyable film and i hope theres a sequel
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is a really funny movie with good action scenes and tom hardy
Oct 7 2018,positive,entertaining and funny venom design looked awesome tom hardy was good as usual plot was a little meh sony should have just turned over venom to marveldisney and let them not change venoms back story and keep him attached to spiderman 
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it cant wait for the next one
Oct 7 2018,neutral,venom has a slow strat and i think it would benifit from the r rating for the fight scenes but overall its good fun to just sit and watch and dont have really think about anything
Oct 7 2018,negative,venom pros  fine pacing cons  bad acting  terrible directing  flat script  bland cinematography  sloppy editing  abysmal visual effects  inconsistent tone  cringeworthy humor  weak plot overall grade d 110
Oct 7 2018,positive,its really annoying to see a critic and audience divide like this venom is not as bad as they are saying it is you cant walk into movies like this comparing it to shawshank and citizen kane when you watch a comic booksuperhero movie after it ask yourself if you were entertained and enjoyed it 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was awesome movie i liked it and i had a blast lots of action and alot of the sayings where funny as hell it blew my mind that shevenom made apperance in the film and seeing clates kasey i like the song venom by eminem but its a awesome movie and my best rating is a 100 kids and families are going to love it
Oct 7 2018,positive,very nice movie to watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,there is a lot of fun in this movie venom is a bad ass 3d imax is worth the price highly recommend 
Oct 7 2018,positive,not as bad as critics say not mcu funny but not dceu flat nice middle ground no stand out performances tom hardy was unlikable before he got venom but he got more interested when he was possessed the doctor was more interesting than the girlfriend and the villain was standard
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was actually good bloody good
Oct 7 2018,negative,not a complete disaster but a bad movie nonetheless a cast is wasted and misused action scenes are mediocre and the plot has no interest whatsoever the biggest problem is not that the movie is bad which it is but rather that its boring and pointless
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this move was a non stop thrill ride that didnt disappoint i recommend it if your looking for some good entertainment
Oct 7 2018,positive,hilariously entertaining i have to admit i loved it tom hardy did an excellent job as venom 
Oct 7 2018,positive,exceeded expectations hope they continue it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i honestly enjoyed the film i love every bit of comedy and action that was poured into it  in my opinion those who do not like the film simply dont have a sense of humor lol teamvenom
Oct 7 2018,positive,well the audience says it all 89 the movie is just pure entertainment and fuckinf rocks anyone reading this and being in doubt wether or not to watch it in cinemas take this by heart and go you wont be disappointed just awesome to watch if you expect a dense and complex story damn its fucking venom thats like a 14yo girl saying i expected so much more story out of twilight haha go fucking watch it its great
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was good worth a see in theaters
Oct 7 2018,positive,this is obviously not perfect but it was honestly better than i was expecting it to be
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was incredible dont listen to the critics
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to critics it was funny and entertaining and kept me at the edge of my seat and i really hope this gets put into the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,its a good movie tom hardy is fantastic but the villan is the classic psicopatic villan
Oct 7 2018,positive,love it very entertaining i did not fall asleep at all 
Oct 7 2018,positive,fun mess great time to be had if you go prepared for a rollercoaster ride of fun but weird movie eddie and venom are a oneman buddy cop comedy and it is great
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy can do no wrong 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this film does not deserve the 32 it is a fun coherent film from beginning to end with lots of comic book nods to old school venom fans that being said its characters are under developed eddie could be a little more evil its climax is a bit cgi heavy and the musical score could have had more 90s edge to it i think the film should have capitalized on the decade in which venom thrived instead of trying to make a modern corporate film   venom is a fun and coherent ride but its lacking that heart that a villainous antihero cult favorite like venom needs to satisfy diehard fans   its honestly a 7 or 8 out of 10 these rotten scores are not fair
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics were completely wrong
Oct 7 2018,positive,good performance by tom hardy great seeing venom come to life on screen looked just like the comic books good story line lots of action 
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was in no way a good movie the acting is horrible but i had a lot of fun watching it
Oct 7 2018,negative,venom was much like solo an albeit disappointing movie with a great lead tom hardy at its center however unlike solo the bad aspects of this film just overshadow the small amounts of good it feels tedious awkward and stupid but some parts are fun in the end even though i would see a sequel this felt like the amazing spiderman 2
Oct 7 2018,positive,exciting movie great performances and fun action just missing a little bit of character fleshing out
Oct 7 2018,positive,great movie on an enjoyment level but had some flaws 
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it tom hardy nailed the eddie  venom relationship and also the symbiotes oddball humour
Oct 7 2018,negative,very funny needed more battles drake 
Oct 7 2018,positive,great film and an interesting take on the characters definitely worth the watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,really good fun and well worth the money   brilliant cgi and plot
Oct 7 2018,positive,a fun comedy action movie for all comic fans
Oct 7 2018,positive,seriously it maybe was cliched but i fucking loved it really good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was a good movie i really liked it although there were some plot holes there was a good soundtrack and the cgi for the symbiotes was awesome i may not be a professional but this movie was good overall but this movie doest deserve such a bad rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,awesome movie and funny
Oct 7 2018,positive,funny movie the chemistry between brock and venom is easily the best part of the movie had a good time watching it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont feel this movie deserves the harsh reviews the critics have given it its really fun its not deep like most marvel movies but its still sony trying it was clearly made to be r and it should have stayed r rated but i enjoyed it a lot
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was throughout enjoyable
Oct 7 2018,positive,cannot understand why this movie is being criticised really entertaining tom hardy was fantastic as venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,critics have no taste whatsoever this movie was amazing and all the audience knows it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i had so much fun watching venom i laughed screamed and held onto my seat very well paced i dont want to give any spoilers so ill just say that my negative critiques are superficial good movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,the film was really good i honestly loved it i dont know why the crutics want to hate on this film when its clearly good
Oct 7 2018,positive,actually i liked it it was a good movie for me and i am excited for next carnage
Oct 7 2018,positive,cant wait to see the sequel  venom was funny and had some interesting action  i believe it could have been longer to express the story a little more but i understand they have to make reasonable financial decisions  hopefully they get more than enough money to push a thorough sequel with carnage  i think some people go into comic based movies with expectations of it being perfect to the comics but thats not how these things work      i give it 45 stars shows so much potential but obviously if the budget was there it could have been better      ps  dont wait til the very end after credits scene  its a waste of time and not in any way related to the movie and its future  the initial precredits scene is what youll want to see
Oct 7 2018,positive,yeahhh the story line wasnt incredible but tom hardy absolutely smashed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,aside from a slow first half our this is a great adaption of venom loved every minute as soon as eddie picked up the symbiote losts of grest sction and humour too
Oct 7 2018,positive,movie mostly holds up until the last half an hour where youll find yourself rolling your eyes more than once
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was intresting something new and with the know marvels sense of humor i really enjoyed it
Oct 7 2018,positive,i loved it was evrethings i wanted cant wait part 2
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy is phenominal definitely would have been better if there was an r rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,slow start strong finish
Oct 7 2018,positive,what a surprise the dialogues are intelligent the tension is real loved the initial setup until eddie gets infected in the age of mcu kitsch it is refreshing that such an entertaining superantihero movies are being made wishing this franchise all the best looking forward to more of them
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was hilarious really enjoyed the humor
Oct 7 2018,positive,a great antihero film the story works in my opinion and tom hardy delivers 
Oct 7 2018,negative,very very poor acting which is disappointing since i like tom hardy michelle williams should of stopped after dawsons creek story line was badly written very very slow paced movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,best marvel movie better than any mcu movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i dont see why this movie gets so much hate yes it has its flaws but overall it was a great movie when comparing it to other superhero movies from this year id say that i enjoyed it as much as black panther
Oct 7 2018,positive,absolutely loved it the eddie brock arch was very well done even mentioned his time at the daily globe carnage is at end credit scene not sure why critics didnt like it the storyline and plot were awesome 
Oct 7 2018,positive,it really annoys me how crap the critic ratings are because people are actually listening to them and not going to see the movie because of them   i loved the movie there wasnt a single part i didnt enjoy which is fairly uncommon usually there is some lame sappy moment or the ending just ruins the movie but there wasnt any of that in this movie     i actually thought it ended too quickly i wanted more
Oct 7 2018,positive,liked it fun and different from the other marvel based content from this year
Oct 7 2018,positive,it was so great i really enjoyed it the critics got it all wrong
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie was a lot of fun please dont pay attention to the critcs on this one  i am soooo glad that i went to see this movie despite what the critics had to say full stop
Oct 7 2018,positive,dont believe the critics this movie was incredible from start to finish action and laughs were nonstop
Oct 7 2018,positive,this was a fun corny movie i think it could have been better if it went even more dark like deadpool the dialog between the symbiote eddie was hilarious at times i am kind of a loser like you eddie was memorable seeing riot have all the moves from the video game and kicking venoms arse was cool to see i would have enjoyed it best if attached to the mcu and a secret wars costume for spider man like venom is supposed to be that whole story arc could have played out like the hulks over multiple movies but honestly this story change works and gives us fans access to one of the best antiheroes invested
Oct 7 2018,positive,its funny action is great cgi is good unless symbiote is alone on screen acting is good great story good intro to a rebooted character
Oct 7 2018,positive,honestly so good might not be technically a great movie but was incredibly entertaining might be my favourite movie of 2018
Oct 7 2018,positive,this movie is good  i have no idea what the critics were expecting
Oct 7 2018,positive,film got many problems but i doesnt make it unwatchable for sure it still provide good fun to watch hardy was great and his interactions with venom
Oct 7 2018,positive,funniest movie sonys put out in years and tom hardys performance was so bloody good
Oct 7 2018,positive,simple and quick just like its visual effects process clearly was
Oct 7 2018,positive,i expected to be disappointed in venom based on a few reviews but was pleasantly surprised its certainly not perfect by any stretch and starts a little slow but grows into a big messy campy dark humor which is what the comic book venom is all about tom hardy is a great eddievenom but maybe could have had a stronger costar in the lawyer girlfriend role big action and chase scenes alien goo street justicetypical superantihero fun low critic tomatometer but high audience rating its the kind of movie that smug film school nerds need to pan to feel better about the student loans they cant afford to pay venom comic book fans will dig it and the credits scene 
Oct 7 2018,positive,im a big venom fan and when the early reviews appeared i was quite worried however im glad to report that the movies was actually pretty good not perfect but good most people were put off by the film because of its pg13 rating which is annoying because the addition of gore would improve the film greatly but thats nor here or there     tom hardys performance was perfect you truly believed there was another being inside his head     the cgi symbiote were perfect there are naysayers that hate the design because of the lack of the spider symbol however its omitted because of obvious reasons but ultimate venom also lacked the spider so it isnt that far off     plot pretty much 90s venom goofy yes but accurate i just hope they darken his humor just a bit more     negatives the ommition of the 40  minutes was quite evident left out plot holes my only recommendation would be to tell the writers and director to quit focusing on someday adding spiderman and start prioritizing on the here and now and worry about making a great film     actors apart from hardy    they were all pretty good i would just ease a bit with the romance dialogue the acting portion was again really good the corny script at the beginning was the true challenge but they did the best with what they were given no obvious cash grab     cgi costumes effects  top notch 910      spoiler          the missing 1 was because of one character after then end credits bad hair day     end of maybe spoiler    final verdict   high 7 or low 8    it has potential they just need to stop focusing on future content and just focus on the here and now clean up the script and add darker humor while omitting the unnecessary light humor     also if possible add gore its a character that eats brains come on haha    well hope you guys liked my review its my first one cheers
Oct 7 2018,positive,my only complaint is that it wasnt long enough
Oct 7 2018,positive,i was sceptical going in but it turned out to be really entertaining and had a unique film style that was not cliche like some comic book movies can be the acting was good tom hardy nailed the character coming from a huge comic book venom fan i think they did everything right i do feel that there needed to be a hero like spiderman to ground the film more and reveal who venom truly is as an antihero however i really liked this film and am hoping they continue the sorry and make a sequel
Oct 7 2018,negative,although there was some comedic value in it overall it was a very disappointing film
Oct 7 2018,positive,venom is amazing movie with the touch of fun and its not bad as you gave rating
Oct 7 2018,positive,loved it dont listen to the negative reviews
Oct 7 2018,negative,this was eddie brock in a alternate universe or he was under medshypnosis 
Oct 7 2018,positive,solid tom hardy really maid this worth the watch
Oct 7 2018,positive,the movie was too dark for my taste but it was well made engaging funny freakyall in all it was very entertaining and well made 32 by professional reviewers only people dumb enough to give a positive review to last jedi could be this horrible at reviewing a movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,if you actually know anything about venom this is a great movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,tom hardy never fails me and im happy to see him bring his talents to a superhero movie
Oct 7 2018,positive,i love it critics are wrong
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun movie and very similar to one of my recent fave movies upgrade 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why people give a negative reviews on this movie i cant see anything bad about it its one of the best marvel movie ever a thousand thumbs up peoples 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great film the second half really picks up allowing for a great finally with a hint in the end credits for maximum carnage
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was an enjoyable movie and i can see why it got 89 from users and 32 from the jaded critics and whiny fandoms the only detractor for me was a pointless and long car chase scene where venom could have just gotten off the bike and run between a few buildings  where cars couldnt follow and have gotten away on foot other than that i dont see what everyone is complaining about we have become so jaded these days we have people who cant draw a circle with microsoft paint complaining about cgi its cg people     they keep comparing this to a 90s movie i only wish we had movies like this in the 90s
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly ive never been one to judge something based off reading the reviews prior to seeing the film with that in mind paying the money to go and see venom certainly wasnt my greatest nor least regret in life venom needed a solid reboot  tom hardy brought a solid performance to the table the beginning displayed class character development followed by the workup of events that would soon follow problem is right after venom runs from being captured and jumps from the water landing beside the bridge to finally speak to brock everything that happens felt almost rushed if not jumbled up you see riot get canned but the fight sequence was pretty short the special effects were pretty good and yes there was a mixture of horror and comedy but in a day  age where deadpool brings in  being rated r while venom at pg13 sony did it right theres no doubt that if a second venom is ever released itll do far better hopefully by that time the script will be a bit more drawn out and maybe just maybe the audience will get what it really wants spidy and tom hardys venom on the big screen would i see this movie in theaters again no will i pay for it to add to my collection via apple tv once its released absolutely
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie 05 because the main villain was a little twodimensional compared to the other main characters and the obligatory boss fight had the same problem as black panther it was a bit underlit
Oct 6 2018,negative,amazingly predictable with dialogue that sounds like it was written by a toddler just a really dumb movie 24100
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyed it i went into the movie with low expectations given the critical response and while the opening scene was cringeworthy and almost had me wishing i hadnt paid the entrance price tom hardys first appearance cracked me up he was terrific and without him this movie falls in a heap wooden supporting actors generic monster plot and predictable story hardy elevates what should have been a boring mundane almost direct to dvd or netflix release into a highly entertaining near laughaminute action romp  it didnt go for the rrating comedy with extreme violence combination that deadpool has made popular but stuck with a more fan friendly pg13 it didnt hold the movie back    big kudos to hardy who 100 carried the film mixed with great action sequences a ridiculous and hilarious fish tank scene and cohesive editing recommend the film for people who want to enjoy a cheesy action hero flick but not for the movie snobs
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than infinity war
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie especially if you were a fan of venom growing up the critics reviews are way off this is a must watch thanks to tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie has tremendous acting and effects the bonding between eddie and venom was both touching and funny ultimately go see this one for the awesome actions scenes where venom destroys stuff and eats people sony killed it with this one make sure you stay after the credits cant wait for sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was bad ass didnt think it would be this good clean af
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand why this movie is recieving so much hate venom was amazing and had everything a perfect antihero movie needed the plot was perfect and so were the action scenes tom hardys acting was brilliant the movie keeps up with its serious nature despite a lot of humourous scenes the only things which i could complain about was the slow start to the movie and the final fight scenewhich i feel could have been a bit longer and could have used a bit more of action the movie also sets up the plot brilliantly for future venom movies   i would advice everyone to go and watch this movie while it is still available in theatres trust me you dont wanna miss this
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing movie i couldnt find anything wrong with it
Oct 6 2018,positive,great fun movie do not listen to the out of touch critics 
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie is a disaster the pacing is all off and it feels like this movie was a joke
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite the low critics review i thought the movie was well done and in line with the comics it added the right amount of humor and was entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,solid movie definitely not as bad as the critics say 
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie was so awful it had no plot and was incredibly cheesy a waste of money and time

Oct 6 2018,positive,funny action packed and overall a very enjoyable movie to see
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best marvel movies i ever seen tom hardy has given a very good performance venom deserves a big 8510
Oct 6 2018,negative,to sum up venom its a worse version of the movie upgrade its also a generic superhero movie no suprises whatsoever honestly dont know the reason why the audience gave the movie an 89 at best its a 70
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved this movie tom hardy played venom perfectly im used to tom hardy being in more serious roles but this was great made him my top fav actor now hes always been 1 of my fav actors but now he is my 1 favorite im going to watch it again and as soon as it comes out on bluray im getting it
Oct 6 2018,neutral,something is missing it has good actions but a character who supposed to be more villainy than to be more a hero doesnt work overall a venom without spiderman is meh marvel need to make a deal again scrap this marvelsony universe
Oct 6 2018,positive,funny and good story
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good film from rus with love
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom plays out like an early marvel movie from the early 2000s
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was really fun and entertaining way better than critics are rating it makes me question their ratings now on other movies go see this movie and hang out to watch the preview during the credits cant wait for that one
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critics on this one because venom is incredible critics wont give a superhero movie a good rating unless it has captain america in it or is made by disneymarvel so what good are their opinions anyway im a true spiderman and venom fan and have been for decades and i can attest to this movies excellence go see it then see it again 
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie was an embarrassment to marvel the plot makes no sense the writing was cheesy the characters have a very long backstory which takes almost an hour and turns out to be completely irrelevant to the plot ugh im so disappointed i was looking forward to seeing this movie so much that was the worse marvel movie since spiderman 3 with toby mcguire save yourself the money and do not see this
Oct 6 2018,positive,if you collect toys and still enjoy watching cartoons you will like the movie if your just going to see a movie and dont know who venom is just go see a star is born
Oct 6 2018,positive,really great film all around
Oct 6 2018,positive,if you like the first ghost rider movie you will like this tom hardy did a great job mediocre movie but i would like them to take another swing at it with a sequel so5 stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,i love this movie i heard a lot of bad reviews from critics but believe me this is really cool movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,after seeing the critics reviews i was very skeptical going in but after walking out of the movie i didnt see what the hate was all about this is what we all wanted tom hardy bought into the role and executed it almost perfectly
Oct 6 2018,positive,really fun and entertaining cant wait to see woody and tom in a sequel tom hardy never disappoints
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are being way to harsh on this i loved it definitely not the terrible score they gave it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i  went into this expecting a baad movie but the bad movie never came i dont know what people who dont like it are talking about its just like the comics

Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is amazing go watch i recommend watching this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great movie im so tired of these lazy ol professional critics on rotten tomatoes who think that ready player one was a fantastic movie and then say that venom is a flop the only complaint my wife and i had about venom was that it was too short we wanted to see more of the eddyvenom dialogue hilarious btw  go watch it and have a great time
Oct 6 2018,positive,finally the 90s todd mcfarlane venom critics complained about what venom was originally about a antvillain with dark sense of humor a guilty pleasure to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,love it  the humor the action   one of the best movie ever
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was great tom hardy played it very well hope there will be a second one 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was great loved this venom storyline versus the mc spiderman venom  tom hardy is the best eddie brock yet and refreshing to see michelle wikliams partake in a comic based movie the critics missed the mark in this movie and made the wrong call
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not such a bad movie but it could improve he will not receive an oscar but at least there were things that i enjoyed and entertained me
Oct 6 2018,positive,im probably one of the few people who actually really enjoyed the movie i definitely liked it
Oct 6 2018,positive,is this the best marvel movie made no is it the worst no i seriously enjoyed sitting in the theater watching one of my favorite villains on screen again there are plenty of problems with this movie but also so many positive ones including the scenes between venom and eddie are very funny my whole theater was laughing i think this movie has something for everyone it doesnt deserve a 31 while writing this
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was quite funny and entertaining i enjoyed it and urge others to see it as well
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are wrong about this movie very funny great action and gets you attached to venom must see 
Oct 6 2018,positive,critiques have this movie wrong this movie is worth watching and will be looking forward the second part of the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i just got out the theater and this movie was a blast  cool action and interaction between eddie brock and venom a lot of fun and i would like to see it in theatres again as for the critics score for this movie been a bad and obvious joke over here on rt since the tlj people arent dumb
Oct 6 2018,positive,kept me interested and invested in the story great cast and amazing cgi
Oct 6 2018,positive,very great movie i absolutely love seeing my all time favorite marvel character on the big screen would really like to see more of this
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it so happy it breaks away from the same old marvel structure
Oct 6 2018,positive,laughs action and entertaining characters lead up to a nightmare of a cgi climax definite recommend 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i have no idea what is wrong with the critics the movies was awesome and definitely worth seeing at the movies 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,thankfully i wasnt expecting much because it didnt deliver much stuarts off slow which is okay gives time for us to know the characters but by the time the movie gets going i could care less about the characters its not a bad movie but its not really good either
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critic ratings this movie was awesome 
Oct 6 2018,positive,was part of the no spiderman no venom crowd but i was wrong lots of fungood job and thanks to the people who made it
Oct 6 2018,positive,horrible moviemakes no senseits so stupid dont waste your money
Oct 6 2018,positive,fantastic movie lots of actiongreat storyremarkable cgi
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy is an amazing eddie brock the critics missed the bail on this movie and is obvious by the love the audience has for the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie went above my expectations and had an very good soundtrack to enhance the tone of everything the only problem was the plot feels like its mission one scene to tie the final act together 
Oct 6 2018,positive,must watch hindi dubbing is very good but end movie fighting scenes are lessworth movie to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was funny and told a great venom story it was different from the comics but they did a good job keeping the venom feel
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom just based upon the trailers promised to be the adaptation of the character we have all been dreaming of since the monstrosity that took to cinema in 2007 while that film was pure trash this film was pure gold the story takes events spanning over several series of venom standalone comics and make themdare i saybetter than they were first written coming from what is actually an over rated character comic book storywise its not hard to make venom even better than he actually is when putting him to screen the film has absolutely superb  acting from tom hardy nearly making eddie brock more interesting to watch then venom nearly the other actors in the film hold their own in every aspect as well surprisingly giving anne weyings character way more screen time than ever expected  and it was worth it casting was perfect as a die hard spiderman fan who has read the original run front to back from amazing fantasy 15 to issue 700 and everything in between i am always looking for the most accurate portrayal of characters and events from the comics you know the one thing i never thought about one through the film wheres spiderman this movies story and character were always going to stand without him just fine and the wait pays off right off the bat you are given with the perfect origin combined with a simple one sentence line from tom hardy to set you strait on the lore allowing you to move past any hangups you may have had about them skipping the wall crawler and letting the story move forward exactly what i wanted and was expecting the plot kept me guessing from beginning to end starting with a perfectly comic accurate portrayal of eddie brocks downward spiral into internal chaos  and  beginning his relationship with his alien partner first act is gently paced stringing you along to give you reason to care for brock until the payoff and the payoff is not what you expect of course every action scene with venom going full force in all his black gooey glory is spectacular the effects alone are some of the most impressive i have ever seen but what truly shines is what i wanted to and that is every piece of dialog between eddie and venom every thing strait from the comic book which is what  always will make me most happy  the film also took a well deserved and extremely needed change to the villain also pulled from the comics riot while the character has no development in the comics at all this one gave me the perfect combination of story lines involving  carlton drake and the life foundation to make what was a previously mediocre story on the page become a breath taking  thrill on the screen while no film is perfect and i have a few minor nitpicks they are to small to be worth mentioning any sane venom fan and comic book fan will have every reason to love this film and if youre all smart leave you qualms about the wall crawler out of it and just goyou may get the maximum carnage film we have all been dreaming about for years dont let this film pass you by or it will be the biggest mistake you make this fall
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie worth more than people give it credit for cgi is good only a few times when it doesnt look real
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed venom gave me a couple good laughs and kept me interested from beginning to end no this isnt a big budget avengers movie but it was definitely enjoyable looking forward to this trilogy
Oct 6 2018,positive,not bad not great either
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a comic book fan of venom how venom was originally portrayed such as the lethal protector series i believe they really pulled off venoms character without spider man being involved i would much perfer spiderman be apart of the characters backstory but this was still great alot of people seem to forget that venom wasnt always this soul less edgy not very talkative monster that some newer comics and most notably spiderman 3 portrayed it as often in some comics like lethal protector and one of the best spiderman video games ever spiderman 2000 venom could really be a goofball it was a very fun watch with my friends and the action scenes were some of the best ive ever seen i want to see more of venom and i want to see this portrayal of venom brought over to the mcu
Oct 6 2018,positive,over all good movie way better than spiderman 3
Oct 6 2018,positive,a little messy editing wise with some weak dialogue but if you are a van of the character and just strap in for a good ride then you will enjoy the movie 35 stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,good middle and end but it can be slightly boring toward the start
Oct 6 2018,positive,its actually really good also effects i really liked tom hardy as eddie even though the plot seemed a little bit off not a great villain
Oct 6 2018,positive,elitists critics are so out of touch with the viewers that they miss the mark with this movie as well venom delivers as advertised fun dark action packed and refreshingly different than the other marvel films go see it and have a good time despite the critics throwing shade
Oct 6 2018,negative,okay movie not good too many boring parts and went downhill towards the end
Oct 6 2018,negative,this may be the worst movie i have seen this year it has the pacing of an adhd kid with amnesia its one of the worst movies of the year by far it has very little character development and the little development it has is done by other characters telling us about them
Oct 6 2018,positive,the script isnt perfect but this is the most fun ive had at the movies in a long time definitely go see this if youre a superhero movie fan but are looking for something a bit darker think logan meets deadpool 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the start of it was a little odd for my temporary taste at that moment after that the movie blew my mind loved it well done 
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not outright spoiling anything but heads up im gonna touch on some of the broader points of the plot i wont go into details im more interested in assessing the film overall so i can document what i thought of the film nothing here is what i would call a spoiler you can still watch the film without knowing any more than the barest outline of a fraction of the plot and understanding that maybe this performance heres a bit wooden and that performance is actually pretty good there but then some people get offended if i mention something that we all already see in a trailer or which is otherwise public knowledge going in so i dunno i guess maybe spoilers ahead if you like to go in completely blind but otherwise dont worry im gonna be spoilerconscious despite the subjectivity of what truly constitutes a spoiler rightio then    not bad was actually not as bad the critics have said not the worst marvel film beats two thirds of the thors was expecting it to be as bad as ghost rider but honestly i probably rate it an iron man 2 or iron man 3 which is to say forgettable vehicles made for precisely one occupant character they did a good job with eddie brock and with venom and everything else was either meh or it blew still major props for actually adapting a comic storyline here this in itself added a bit more authenticity whether or not you think they adapted it well to the modern setting or not thats at least kinda cool it makes an awkward origin story but it fits and ships even with a few dings to the corners of the box also they wrote it such that ifwhen they come back to it they can drop pretty much everything but the character itself which works well since thats all you want to take from this movie anyway its a way way better rendition of the character than spiderman 3 did the one weird thing is that since its a solo outing they skipped venom as a villain and we start with venom as an antihero which i mean without spidey to deal with you kinda have to but they dont really establish a great reason for venom to be like that unless mr brock has simply got far more influence over this version of venom even this early on compared to the comics to address one fan concern however even though they had to keep it pg13 for marvel studios instead of the r they originally wanted they didnt hold back venom likes to eat people here as in other renditions sloppy but expedient explains most of the film a sloppy but expedient way to get one good character a movie dont ask too much of it because its not gonna give it to you but expect fun and fun is what youll get i like that superhero films have evolved and started trying to have more depth but i see nothing wrong with something like this that doesnt want to make you think it just wants to show you a kickass goop monster look its evil slime from space what were people expecting the maltese falcon go watch aliens eating heads and have fun for what it is five stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know what movie the critics watched but this movie entertained me from beginning to end i thought the movie was awesome and so was tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,i personally liked the film funny suspensful action packed it was pretty good i just wish it was rated r but it was still good hope the next movie is rated r
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than average superhero movies and overpanned by critics yes did it fulfill promises of rrated horror no this film shifted too often between tones of horror and comedy that you didnt really get the vibe the film was trying to follow the psychological relationship between venom and brock is interesting truly showing that the plot survived without everyones favorite webslinger hardy does a great job just as much as the rest of the cast but a sequel would require much improvement on the executives part however the new page on an antihero revolving in this age of superhero blockbusters is for sure a welcome one overall just a 75 from my point of view
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont know why it has a low rating i genuinely loved the movie and the dynamic between venom and eddie
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is so good only reason ppl dont like it is cause it doesnt fit in there marvel box so good movie my boyfriend said it doesnt fit in with the comic but said the original venom was trash and this was an amazing spin love this movie go see
Oct 6 2018,positive,a great entertaining film that knows exactly what it is it never betrays itself probably the best buddy film dialogue ever not oscar worthy but there is plenty of fun to be had watching this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,10 different but very interesting and i became an even bigger fan than from the comic book version a must see for marvel fans 
Oct 6 2018,positive,was a little skeptical when i sas the critic review but they were 100 percent wrong its funny it has a nice pace overal good movie i think they got venom down pretty well if you read the comics and watch this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazeing movie great cast and amazeing start to a kickass series will buy as soon as it comes to dvd
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy was great eddie and venom are the new buddy duo very funny cant wait for number 2
Oct 6 2018,positive,twas amazing people say the tone was off but i truly believe it wouldnt have worked had it been way to serious especially without spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,the jarring pace and awkward dialogue would have sank this movie but the venom moments are enough fun to recommend it heres hoping sony execs back off on the sequel and allow the creative team to go all out 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was so good and funny i dont know why people rated it badly 
Oct 6 2018,positive,excellent funny loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,the reviewers are being unfair  i dont get why they gave this character a standalone movie but whatever  it is not that serious  it had a lot of humor and action  i liked it  it is just a comic book movie for fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie i cant wait to see the next one
Oct 6 2018,negative,one of the worst films ever sony really knows how to wreck films please avoid this mess at all cost
Oct 6 2018,positive,growing up not only a fan of the comics but also just a marvel fan in general i didnt know what to expect going into the movie personally i loved the movie it had the perfect combo of comedy and action along with the touch of darkness that should come along with venom would definitely go see again 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie nice comedy tom hardy gives such an amazing performance which makes things believable and this is a movie not for critics who dont know anything about the source material neither is this a movie that tries to be an oscar contender its just supposed to be entertaining and they succeeded tremendously seen it 3 times and the room was full every single time
Oct 6 2018,positive,great film to start off an amazing series to come grab
Oct 6 2018,positive,making a venom movie without the main reason that gives life to the charachter spiderman is quite a challenge disregarding this the script can be pretty messy but it still is a entertainingly movie to watch i think cricits were kind of exagerated with that 28 score given
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was amazing venom was spot on and his personality was the best  not strict adherence to comics but had a decent background story to make up for it a must see
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie is not bad although is not perfect either amazing performance by tom hardy very entertaining movie go ahead and give it a check
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had a good experience with the movie
Oct 6 2018,negative,steaming hot carnage i mean garbage
Oct 6 2018,negative,this was not the venom we all knew in the comics this was all remake to a different character  this was a sorry remake of a character that already had a story  history in marvel and it really needed an origen of spider man and to be true with the comics in some connection
Oct 6 2018,positive,this move was awesome 
Oct 6 2018,positive,a surprisingly entertaining and insane super hero movie i am genuinely so excited to see the next movie with hardys venom as he played the character perfectly
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a good movie it was funny and had a lot of cool moments dont agree with the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually this is very great solo venom movietom hardy really do great performance in this moviecant wait for next venom movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,loving the movie it was a really good movie but there could be more too it in story type and action but it was well done and would greatly show a friend the movie   nice job
Oct 6 2018,positive,great story great special effects loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,anyone watching this movie for it to be serious was doing it in bad faith this movie is energetic and funny with a side of cannibalism which is honestly the essence of comic book venom i desperately hope there is a 2     the critics obviously havent read the comics and dont have eyes
Oct 6 2018,positive,take the movie as it is with no expectations going in its a fun join ride that will have you wanting more by the end of the film
Oct 6 2018,positive,i have to admit this is better than i expected not great but also i dont think this deserves such a low rating tom hardy was fantastic in this role without him the movie would have been this low like a 30 or 35 but he was hands down the most entertaining of this show when he speaks to himself  aka venom
Oct 6 2018,neutral,this movie has a lot of good i going for it but its broken in all the wrong ways poor editing and its almost like you are watching 2 different movies at times  as a movie this is a trash pile but its got a lot of good parts in there     also did they just expect us not to notice that they went in and rerecorded the audio every time someone says symbiote just ignore that first trailer alright guys 
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one folks venom was way better than the 32 given by the critics here  dont go expecting a super hero movie go expecting a monster movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,so we will be watching the venom movie with the familywe will watch what we want    a few hours later could have gone better with some if the forced story redone but entertainingly fun we liked what venom had to say to the movie fans  we would like to see it continueso 35 stars alright this time  but next time lets get more experience and storyline and push that rating above a4 and give venom something to really sink his teeth into  nuff said
Oct 6 2018,positive,opening dragged a bit some scenes could have been cut but overall i loved it all the jokes hit for me i adored venom as a character the special effects were a spectacle and tom hardys performance carries the entire film its known that he is a great actor but his physical acting is something to behold its crazy to remember that he in fact is not infected with an alien parasite controlling his movements every action is completely his own its obviously more of a crowd pleaser than a critic pleaser but the score its got right now is just not deserved in the slightest
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie couldnt have casted better actors honestly couldnt have picked a better cast 
Oct 6 2018,positive,genuinely a fun watch  not every movie has to be the dark knight so a nice change to something thats just a lot of fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was everything i expected in a venom film but much more fun i dont see why all that h8 it was great with the critic ratings its getting youd think it was the last jedi levels of bad not so it was no infinity war but it was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,32 ahhh come on tomato did u even see it yet i watched it 2 times and its awesome 910
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie fun time
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was awesome  ignore the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,the effects and plot were all solid the acting by tom hardy was amazing but the movies pacing was a little too fast and the developments were made too quickly in some parts overall i cant wait for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this movie a lot great birthday film
Oct 6 2018,positive,very funny movie exactly what i wanted from this movie
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie was laughable with the poor comedy venom is not supposed to be funny 
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than the last few super hero movies ive seen was everything you want in an antihero
Oct 6 2018,positive,really fun better than reviews let on 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had fun watching this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,idk why rotten tomatoes rated 32 it doesnt make sense actually its reaaaaaly good  i freakin loved that movie  and im a huge spiderman fan
Oct 6 2018,negative,i went in with no expectations and was quite underwhelmed this venom without spiderman universe is kinda meh to me
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was not a technical masterpiece but it was so much fun from start to finish
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was good i mean its exactly what i expected it to be but at least it didnt have an agenda or ideology to push i thought tom hardy made this movie superb portrayal of the venom character i would see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,audience score is way more accurate if you love venom and have read the comics this is a must see lots of fun great action a story that fits and to top it all off tom hardy really excited for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,really a good movie  fun fun fun    masks copy
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is phenomenal but i see why the critics hate it  if you are going to see a movie about venom then you are in luck the issue is the critics are looking for mcu standard character development which that standard is held for eddie and venom however  the big name actors other than tom hardy are often overlooked the reason the fans love this movie is because they are here to see venom which if you go into it with a mind set of im here to see venom you will love this movie  its definitely on a higher level than the cringy movie that was suicide squadcatwoman
Oct 6 2018,positive,held up to the the hype plenty of action and comedy showing the wenom from the comics and the acting was amazing tom hardy did an amazing job same with the rest of the cast i cannot wait for the sequel if you havent seen the movie please do it is one of my favorite super hero moives of all time
Oct 6 2018,neutral,great action and suspense but no time for the characters to grow and the final fight feels like it has no weight also the villain is not fleshed out at all
Oct 6 2018,positive,a very fun and entertaining movie with a hint of evil
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is fun and i love it very much the critics hate with a weird reason but a little boring at the beginning when eddie and annie drama scene love the interaction between eddie and venom and i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was much better than the critics are saying it has a decent story great action scenes and unexpected humor tom hardy does a great job as a comic book reader i felt it did a nice job of capturing the look and feel of the comics 
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie ever story was perfect
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun its bananas some of the time but i loved it people that are knocking it must want a carbon copy of every other comic book movie this one is different which makes it a fun ride
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie i have seen all year  this venom is better then what i was hoping for would watch again
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was trying to write this like a movie critic but they suck venom was a badass movie loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not as bad as some reviews make it sound its a fun popcorn flick go watch have a good time and make up your own mind you will be thankful you did 
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure why this movie is being rated so low by critics just got out of it and enjoyed it thoroughly even my wife whos not all that big into super hero movies cant stop raving about how great it was my only complaint is that it was a little slow in the beginning other than that i enjoyed the story and how venoms character was portrayed through eddie brock tom hardy nailed it imo great movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,again like i said when pacific rim the first one hit the cinemas critics can suck it with their low score the movie is fun and accomplishes what it should be a good action comic based movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into the movie expecting a bad film because of the reviews but they were wrong the movie was very entertaining and had a good story i thought as it gave a new spin on venoms origins the relationship that grew on screen between venom and eddie was perfect and i look forward to possibly seeing tom hollands spiderman going against venom who looks like a very formidable villain this is two different universes as of now i know but one can hope to see this character grow and explore different universes that are already established
Oct 6 2018,positive,such a fun movie love it straight out of the comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom looked good plot was also good the one problem is the dialogue besides the dialogue between eddie and venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,when i first saw the rating and how much publicity it did not get on tv or the internet i knew venom was not going to be a big epic film that a side i had fun watching it its a good movie to go with friends and just have fun just dont take it to seriously and youll be fine
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was hilarious and it fit so much story in only 30 minutes sony truly outdid themselves and finally made a good movie in their entire career i am excited for what else venom has in store they even explained everything but why people say this movie is bad
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand the bad reviews at all venom was a lot of fun highly recommend ignoring the critics on this one and go see it tom hardy is perfect
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is a very fun movie with good action silly comedy and a bizarrely goofy yet dark tone hardys interactions with venom are priceless and are more than worth the price of admission there are some flaws and missed beats but you will probably be having too much fun to even notice
Oct 6 2018,positive,it knew going in spiderman wasnt in the film i know the venom story i went in with an open mind it was a great film i loved and i recommend it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a well put together movie it may not reperesent the comics very well but it has amazing character development aswell as a wellthought out plot the critics are never consistent when it comes to judging marvel and dc movies
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie lots of violence but good it just seemed a little slow but then it was great and great humor 
Oct 6 2018,negative,honestly venoms movie did not give me much confidence that it was good  and i was right that i was right since the story is loose and the design of venom i do not finish to please very much and of course the postcredit scene only tries to repair this hollow plot the only rescue of this movie is the performance of tom hardy and the magnificent persecution scene but of that nothing more
Oct 6 2018,positive,kind of cheesy but entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,hey is not that bad i went to the theater thinking i was going to be very disappointed but actually i enjoyed it didnt love it but its not a flop the first third of the movie was very rushed and the conditions and situation of the protagonist were very forced but after that is quite enjoyable i did find the script a mess some very unnatural dialogues and i wasnt convinced about the reason venom gave to stay on earth and suddenly become the antihero we know it wasnt a strong enough reason if logical at all funny thing i didnt care about any characters on the movie but venom hes actually very likeable i ship him with eddie also tom hardy did a great job overall i wasnt disappointed because i was expecting much worse and i dont feel i wasted my time and money didnt watch it in 3d tho so i dont know about that
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is great the script could have been better but i think it delivered a good venom experience funny and full of action cant wait for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie should have been a r rating but it was still good
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was awesome critics stink
Oct 6 2018,positive,even though its not like the original i still think it was good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i honestly think critics are mentally handicapped this wasnt a bad movie at all 
Oct 6 2018,positive,surprised this movie has low ratings this movie lacked in more depth but it seems due to the fact the movie was sped up to make up for the time that the studio wouldnt let them have
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a bad movie just too short  if they play their cards right they might have something here  arguably the best villain in the spiderman comics venom gets his chance to shine once more after the poor reception from fans of his treatment in spiderman 3 sam raimi admits he didnt want the character in the movie at all but it was mostly studio pressure that made him cave the rest is history  now sony attempts to create their own universe this time around   i didnt end up hating this movie they actually get a lot of stuff right for the most part firstly theres no tie to spiderman because of copyrights the focus is solely on brock  the origin of the symbiote organism is pretty accurate as its picked up from the far reaches of space and brought to earth more than 1 exists so you can imagine the many hosts it can consume  we do have tom hardy as eddie brock living as a reporter in san francisco and engaged to anne weyhing played by michelle williams he gets the dirt on people who dont wish to be followed yet his methods are unorthodox  his biggest story covers carlton drake of the life foundation who wants humanity to survive even if the test subjects wind up dead because of his digging he ends up getting fired and dumped  jenny slate as one of the scientists is fed up with his experiments she then decides to bring in eddie to expose him however one of the organisms attaches itself to eddie and thus begins the lovehate relationship venom wants to feed on humans to help eddie survive the bond eddie is scared out of his mind yet finds this things power remarkable  riz ahmed is fine as drake who really wants to better humankind no matter how cruel the science gets our planet may be on the verge of collapse one day soon  the movie has a very fast pace which is the only flaw i can find  but its full of good humor and the relationship between eddie brock and the symbiote is the true highlight next to the intense action scenes venom is more feral in this version having an appetite to bite off peoples heads  they got the persona down too with the character referring to we instead of i  the film borrows heavily from the lethal protector series and the planet of symbiotes  like i said too it moves so fast for an hour and 52 min  really hope we see more in this sony universe and given the post credit scene from a familiar face i pray we can see more of this mythology from the various comic book storylines
Oct 6 2018,positive,definitely an enjoyable film the subtle easter eggs throughout establish a very thin link to the spiderman universe you have to pay attention and follow along to catch them that being said not as bad as the critics make it out to be way better than tophers portrayal
Oct 6 2018,positive,really movie is good n tom hardy rocks once again
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was really good tom hardy was very good as venom there were some heartfelt moments and i wish the director would have stayed on them longer because they felt rushed other than that it was enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,positive,while there were some predictable plot lines the show was fun funny and far exceeded my expectations
Oct 6 2018,positive,so good endless action from beginning to end loved the characters even the villains cannot wait for part two
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie is full of clichés completely forced storylines that are extremely predictive and also make no sense at all they tried to cover for so much that nothing interesting happens  all characters feel fake specially michelle williams tom hardy tries to be funny but desperately fails because he didnt build up the character charisma
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it period way better than the reviews ive never given a movie review but because this had such bad reviews i felt it was my duty to give venom a 5 star review
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun and entertaining i will not pretend the pacing and contrast of the movie was not sticky although the  juxtaposition made coherent sense and worked for me i would typically rate this a 45 but because of the negative reviews i feel like rebelling a bit and offsetting the difference in my own small way overall worth the price of admission funny interesting and perfectly adequate
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the movie critics they dont know what theyre talking about honestly this movie was good as hell i just wished it was a little bit longer it definitely left me wanting more hopefully we get a part 2 great job to tom hardy on this role i love venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom an standalone movie spidermans iconic villain i hope this movie would be awesome but not so much awesome otherwise i also this movie because of tom hardys performance and also for eddie brock and venoms conversation and this movie has 2 credit scenes so that clarified that there would be sequel but this negative points that why symbiotes come here and what is their mission and no ones acting is good as tom hardy so after all negative points i will give this movie 35 stars almost enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it  tom hardy was magnificent the creaturesuit was awesome very cool movie  critics are idiots just look at the audience score that this movie has so far
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed this immensely i dont know what critics are complaining about tom hardy is an excellent venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie wasnt that bad it did definitely had some problems but in the end it was an interesting take on the character overall the movie was a mess but in a good way
Oct 6 2018,positive,if it werent for tom hardy and the rendition of venom this movie would be worthless the plot and writing are horribly sloppy with some lines causing the audience to physically cringe however the humor performance by tom hardy and beautiful set up for a sequel which i already like better than this movie by the way are enough to save this movie if you love venom as a character there is plenty for you in this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it  first movie my son asked to see again
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really liked venom eddie brock and the symbiote had amazing chemistry venom for the most part looks great the dialogue in this movie isnt great but the movie never drags on and its fun all the way heck i may see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,surprisingly funny not great but not bad either definitely entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it  my wife usually doesnt like this kind of movie but she even liked it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was feast for eyesdo not expect anythinggo to the moviethe movie will content
Oct 6 2018,negative,15 mins in and i was pissed the acting was trash the venom voice and his personality was terrible they tried to make another marvel moviefunny but it just turned into a piece of crap
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was a great standalone film if this had the mcu touch and been connected to spiderman this movie would of been even more amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was everything i wanted from the first time you hear venom talk in eddies head to the first time you see him rise up in his full form to the armless legless faceless thing like i was on board all the way our whole family loved it stay past the credits man is it worth it i could watch this franchise forever
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie brings out the carnage feel from comic books  if you are looking for that weak topher grace venom get out of here  the critics seem to down play the movie but went to an early show and people were excited and seem to enjoy it  i myself would watch it again venom is a hard sell but tom hardy and the relationship between venom and eddy really sells the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,lots of action moments of laughter and seriousness create a much different mcu film 
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a great movie i am not some old and nerdy movie professionals all i know is that great performance for hardy and right actions with thrilling cutting this is a great movie for me and my friends it was even better than black panther anyway audience can tell what is a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movies  beteer sipderman homecoming
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into this movie very hesitantly but when i got my ticket the kid at the counter told me it was waaaay better than it was being given credit for with the critics the kid was right it did have some gross stuff but it was in line with what you would expect given the subject matter i do not agree with the critics venom is a critter thats not very likeable until he is there were some laughs there were enough surprises by the end how could you not love venom  i didnt see how it was possible but marvel pulled it off  i look forward to the next venom i didnt need any stronger attachment to spiderman id heard a lot of violence had been cut out which is fine with me it had plenty of action  i really enjoyed this film  will likely go back  see it again in 3d
Oct 6 2018,positive,lots of action super cool graphics
Oct 6 2018,positive,i looooved it they always try to make the main guy soooooo coool like blade cool or punisher cool and it always turns out cheese ball this movie was great im the biggest venom fan ever and im super happy with this movie hope they make a game and a ton of sequelsi
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome  despite the bad reviews and critics this is an amazing movie
Oct 6 2018,negative,i created an account just to say how disturbingly bad this movie is doesnt even deserve 12 star if you think this movie is even remotely funny or good then the filmmakers are actually laughing at you for buying tickets to see this the fact that anyone in our population thinks anything in this movie which has a horrendous plot awful acting and is perhaps the most juvenile comedy ive ever seen is worthy of praise is utterly shocking the only audience members that maybe should think this was entertaining were born in the last ten years im not exaggerating when i say i left this movie concerned about how stupid humanity is and where this country is going avoid this movie like the plague
Oct 6 2018,positive,to those criticizing the multitonal and somewhat schizophrenic nature of this movie which is accurate i adjure you to read venoms comic book character venom is part homicidal symbiote part buddy comedy sidekick part byronic hero that i believe is venoms beauty he possesses both the verbosity of a journalist and the bloodlust of a merciless murderer he cannot be pinned into the proverbial box of what a superhero should be and distinguishes himself in an idiosyncratic way that makes spidermans presence not unwanted but unnecessary
Oct 6 2018,positive,its like watching a comic come straight to life i absolutely love it a lot of people say its bad because of its cheesyness but i see it as its greatest strength venom is a really fun and kinda silly character because his intimidating appearance and constant humor this is the perfect venom movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was good had some great action shots and a few funny scenes movie wouldve been better if so much wasnt cut and if it were rated r the final fight scene kind of just ended sort of just short but overall the movie was good
Oct 6 2018,positive,very underrated this movie is really good wish it wouldve been longer i was skeptical looking at how the critics are so judgmental but its actually a dope movie real insight on the venom character looking forward for the sequel 
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it it was everything i expected
Oct 6 2018,positive,my favourite part was when venom made out with eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,positive,though i am writing as an amateur in the field of spidermanvenom canon this movie manages to be as equally charming and noteworthy of consideration as it is honest in its portrayal of venom as an antihero venom as a character portrayed complete independence and left me in admiration of his development and emotional appeal as an evilturnedgood and yet still personable and unique creature i appreciated this movies characters in general and liked the action scenes one of the best superhero movies to come out in a while
Oct 6 2018,neutral,if you are a venom fan dont see this movie it was given the catwoman treatment where there is almost nothing from the source material its not like the trailers trying to show dark and scary trailer more of a dark action comedy 
Oct 6 2018,positive,was amazing loved the concept of action comedy and romance mixed into one movie would definitely recommend watching it weourvenom
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom feels like a comic book movie from the 90s but i had a good time watching it what really made the movie work for me is tom hardys performance and the eddievenom relationship the movie has a very generic plot and villain but it didnt necessarily bother me ive seen much worse before
Oct 6 2018,positive,critic reviews have let me down so many times glad i know not to pay attention to them
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure why its hit by critics but i enjoyed the movie so much i went with my brother who is not a regular superhero movie fan liked it too people are talking about venom is not fit as superhero action and comedy cannot come together etc well take a look at deadpool may be sarcasm in this movie is not for everyone especially those who feel they are ridiculed by the joke like i need to go to the vending machine take the newspaper and deliver it special to you have a nice life
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to critics its quite enjoyable im only knocking it a star because its going to be hard to tie it to spiderman the way they did it
Oct 6 2018,positive,in my opinion this movie was great regardless of how many people kept telling me it was wack i honestly believe it was great people just need to stop super dissecting a movie and learn to enjoy it for once
Oct 6 2018,positive,has it been proven that disney owns rotten tomatoes yet  the critic score is ridiculous for this movie  it wasnt an amazing movie but it was a damn good time  it was legit funny and the action sequences were cool too  dont expect mcu quality movie and youll have a good time
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie one of my favorites loved it
Oct 6 2018,negative,20 cheaper 30 funnier you got a solid marvel buddy comedy
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was pretty great and i look forward to the next chapter in this story i think the critics have this one all wrong i already preordered it
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie lottta action wouldve been better if it had spiderman in it overall had a good base story and covered many different facets of the character
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun not sure what the critics are hating about it great popcorn movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie from beginning to end the comedic moments between eddie and venom are funny and unique the story itself is original and great the pace of the movie is beginning is slow but over time it picks up with fast pace action to enjoy tom hardy is great as eddie brock ignore the critics this movie is great
Oct 6 2018,positive,in spite of the bad reviews from critics this movie was a great introduction to venom is it perfect no but its very good i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,well done anticomicbookhero  good action and surprising amount of laughs  very enjoyable  no spidey needed  great on its own  waaay better than kiddie homecoming anyway
Oct 6 2018,positive,i would definitely see it again
Oct 6 2018,negative,laughable in all the wrong ways give up sony 
Oct 6 2018,positive,story moves and gives you a very likable antihero critics who gave this a negative are like people who drink tea with their pinkie stuck out venom for them is beneath their selfimposed and exceptionally boring primal donna status 
Oct 6 2018,positive,part comedy romance and horror film i really enjoyed it the only thing i didnt like was the knowledge that im going to have to wait for a sequel the final battle was a little lack luster but other than that i really enjoyed it i dont know what the critics are looking for  please watch this movie because the seaqual needs to be made
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure what movie the critics watched but venom kicked ass
Oct 6 2018,positive,i watched it with my family and we really enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,me and my boyfriend loved this move
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont know why all the low scores from the critics loved this movie love tom hardy definitely worth watching in the theater
Oct 6 2018,positive,wow the trailer did not do this justice this movie is awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie was fun hilarious and i hope they make a sequel good job hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyable movie do not rely on critics to tell you if you should have fun go and have it
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not sure why there is so much hate surrounding this movie i genuinely loved it yeah it needed more funny moments im used to venom being like deadpool and saying whatever is on his mind but i enjoyed the movie and would happily watch it a second time i highly recommend it to anyone whos on the fence about seeing it
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie honestly
Oct 6 2018,positive,had all the tools to be great but it ended up feeling rushed and messy great performances though id love to see the directors cut
Oct 6 2018,positive,much actionaaaandits venom you really cant go wrong witty venom unless hes fighting his former host peter parker
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is getting a bad rep for no reason the comedy was good and not over the top like deadpool the action was good the side characters were set up good venoms motivation was good being a nobody back on his own planet and he is super powered on earth of course he would want to stay i thought it was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,thought the action was great the chemistry between venom and eddie is the main winner overall for me it was a 910 never trusted critics they like us are just viewers dont know why their reviews matters so much
Oct 6 2018,positive,there wasnt a moment in the movie where it feels boring theres constantly something going on that keeps you engaged even though its a simple movie throughout its entirety
Oct 6 2018,positive,watched it last night and i loved it dont let the bad reviews discourage you   give it a try and judge for yourself
Oct 6 2018,positive,maybe not a cinematic masterpiece but i really liked this movie i wish it had stayed with whatever scenes made it r but even without it was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,had a few slow spots but action scenes make up for it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is simply put great and fun to watch venom has been brought to life by tom hardy and very well i might add lack of depth maybe still a great movie absolutely i would recommend this to any comic fan i mean cmon its venom how can you complain when people did the best they could with what they were given to bring a character to life 1010
Oct 6 2018,positive,big thank you to tom hardy and the rest of the cast and crew for making a venom movie for the fans and not the critics great movie lots of fun many nods to the comics even some obscure ones if you are a fan of venom this movie adaptation is for you
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than the reviews indicate venom might have been great had it come out 15 years ago unfortunately it cant stand up to the current crowded super hero genre especially because it struggles to find footing in both horrorthriller and super hero thematics ultimately though it has enough going for it that its still enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,positive,once again the dumb critics fail to rate a great movie venom offers a different and innovative view on  this classic antihero full of action and well placed funny moments
Oct 6 2018,negative,venom is pretty bad the writing is awful and from there things fall apart     spoilers   tom hardy is great in other movies but totally unconvincing here as eddie brock an investigative journalist he behaves like a street thug and doesnt give off that freedom of the press vibe that hoffman and redford do in all the presidents men     the villain in the movie is kind of a joke because of the writing actor riz ahmeds character carlton whoever ceo of zzzzz    the action scenes are just ok to compare the motorcycle chase scene in venom just doesnt reach the height of excitement achieved by the motorcycle chase scene in mission impossible fallout tom hardy and tom cruise are both riding motorcycles  check wo helmets not a good idea but  check while weaving through traffic  check in cool cities san francisco and paris respectively  check yet the chase scene in venom seems less exhilaratingtense way to go fallout    noteworthy   kryptonite is mentioned 5th time superman is referenced in a spiderman feature twice in movies thrice on tv  reid scotts character is named dan like his other character dan egan from veep   j jonah jamesons son the astronaut has a short cameo   the hills of san francisco are a thrill to drive through   venom has no history w spiderman in this telling   there are two endcredits scenes     recommend   go see upgrade 2018 instead it is similar to and is the better version of this venom story it stars logan marshallgreen a tom hardy lookalike
Oct 6 2018,positive,movbie is really good tom killed it expected a bit more on the climax fight but early half covered for it
Oct 6 2018,positive,great joy watching venom from brasil
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom exceeded my expectations by far i expected a dull run of the mill hero flick venom  is far better than that and deserves a watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom rocked another case where critics hate what the general public love had a great time tom hardy is venom or rather venom is tom hardy lol some summer fun after the summer season has left us go enjoy
Oct 6 2018,positive,great film definitely could use improvements but the dynamic between venom and brock made this worthwhile it was clear at the end how the duo would identify hero antihero villain etc and left me eagerly awaiting a second installment
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved venom i have dont know what the critics are talking about funny must watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,it had its issues but it was still a fun ride i want to see the missing 40 minutes of footagetomhardycotof venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had a great time watching this way better than i expected hardy nailed it and venom stole my heart dont believe the critics the people have spoken
Oct 6 2018,positive,the audience ratings compared to the critic ratings are excise my wording comical was it an oscar presentation no was it fun yes i think they can improve on the sequel the can definitely work do some character development if my old memory serves me the critics did something similar to forest gump i thought it had humor and levity in the same script go see it if you want a fun ride with a character who is down and out and wants to get back to his old life
Oct 6 2018,positive,deserves a second part loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great adaptation of the comics venom and very entertaining and funny
Oct 6 2018,positive,i wasnt going in thinking it is going to be the movie of 2018 but this movie really smashed all expectations its a rollercoaster of a film in a good way its funny action packed and sometimes a little scary i had a blast watching venom cant wait to see it again and again im gonna be the first in line for the sequel whenever that may be
Oct 6 2018,positive,much much better than what critics say about this movie  funny dark and suprisingly game venom features an excellent and hilarious performance as eddie brock and boasts fantastic action scenes the motorcycle chase is exceptionally gripping and very well directed and cinematography is very nice to look at
Oct 6 2018,positive,yes you should go see it  we really enjoyed it we did 3d which i recommend everyone in the theater seemed to love it from their reactions during and comments after tom hardy is funny the inner monologue between venom and eb made everyone laugh more than once the romance is cheesy but it doesnt take up much screen time we love the venom theme song by eminem it plays during the credits while you wait for a scene from the next marvel film  another big character related to venom is coming im looking forward to that also
Oct 6 2018,positive,a film that stays to true to its origins venom will not disappoint
Oct 6 2018,positive,well done gets rid of that rotten taste of spiderman 3s venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,fantastic movie  a faithful adaptation of venom by the passionate artist tom hardy  all moments were executed wisely and effectively  the critics negative reviews of this movie are only a blatant example of how little critics understand about entertainment as venom is certainly a great film  definitive of the character venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was an amazing an amazing movie 1010 recomend it to everyone
Oct 6 2018,positive,i absolutely loved the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,pretty great movies they were some problemsnothing is perfect it felt like a venom movie and was a joy ride the while way through
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a fun an simplest film ive seen hope to see a sequel to it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i honestly dont know what these critics were talking about maybe they were expecting another masterpiece after infinity war well this isnt that and it should be expected that way     i personally loved the hell out of this movie eddie and venoms interactions were fantastic and i found myself laughing a lot i can see a trilogy being successful after this i highly recommend seeing it and proving the credits wrong
Oct 6 2018,positive,i honestly loved the entirety of this film though the interpretation was a bit different from the comics the movie was very appealing to me with both a violent and comical feeling this movie definitely did venom some justice after what we were shown in spiderman 3 starring toby maguire that venom didnt even bother showing off the symbiote as its own individual being but instead was treated like some new power that could be used as casually as a tshirt in this film starring tom hardy you get to see eddie broc and venom interact and have conversations with each other honestly if you can look past the minor differences this movie was worth the wait and im happy to see that sony made this film because venom has always been my favorite marvel character and when i saw topher graces interpretation of venom i was extremely disappointed this film makes me feel so much better about our favorite symbiote also despite the lack of spidey obsession sony did specifically state that they were making this a pg13 film in order to make it easier for venom to meet the webslinger in a later film this could mean the we might see venom in the mcu like a good amount of fans wanted since they went with the life foundation approach it makes sense why we dont have this spidey obsession but maybe well see it in a later film with our friendly neighborhood spiderman all in all i gotta say i loved this movie and i wish i could rate this higher but the meter only goes to five stars i definitely recommend this movie to those venom fans out there who have read the life foundation comics thank you sony for giving me what ive wanted for so long i cant wait for the next film
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed it as a fun dark comedy  action romp tom hardy performed excellently  good effects  and the banter between eddie brock and venom is superb
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics expected too much from this movie it terms of entertainment this was a great movie just a big campy and cheesey but thats not necessarily always a bad thing
Oct 6 2018,negative,where to begin storyline is basically non existent the execution is almost childlike and not dark like perceived in the trailers its inconsistent throughout and has little to no charecter development a complete misfire
Oct 6 2018,negative,crappy story crappy acting crappy special effects dont waste your money
Oct 6 2018,positive,was an awesome adaptation of this classic comic book character not sure why the tomatometer is so low
Oct 6 2018,positive,see it for yourself its funny and clever good story line and well put together not your traditional super hero movie but im up for a change now and again worth the watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,great fun movie cant wait for sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked it so did my wife
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this is a great movie tom hardy is perfect for eddie brockvenom and i thought the internal dialogue is hilarious this is a splendid 1st entry for what i hope continues with more entries screw the critics they need to lighten up
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually pretty good might need improvement but its a pretty solid movie
Oct 6 2018,negative,i wanted this movie to be good i remember the first trailer and i was so excited i just couldnt wait and to keep this short i was very disappointed tom hardys performance is good in the second half of the movie only but the major flaw is the script and screenplay a lot of inconsistencies and it just turned me off 
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the most enjoyable and entertaining marvel movies out there 
Oct 6 2018,positive,ill do a quick and easy break down  so so dialogue   small plot twistbut still caught a little off guard   venom looks and sounds amazing   tom hardy is funny   action is great   dialogue between venom and eddie is best part of dialogue   fun care free movie that overall i really enjoyed despite not a ton of story telling
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was very good but it was a little fast paced half of the trailer was in the first 30 minutes of the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics  could have used r rating but
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was pretty good was what i was expecting
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not a perfect movie but i definitely enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it another reason not to trust the critic ratings on rotten tomatoes and other websites and just try to see what i think i might enjoy and also make a decision and think for myself thanks for keeping audience scores rotten tomatoes
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked it had a blast watching it had a few issues here and there one being pacing but the fun that i had watching it over ruled alot of its issues dont trust the critics now a days had so much fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,i just saw the movie and really enjoyed it dont understand why theres so much hate and negative critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics suckedagain
Oct 6 2018,positive,dear rotten tomatoes reviews either you lost your credibility or your too damn old to watchreview this movie
Oct 6 2018,negative,venom seems to be trying to compete with suicide squad for worst script andor comic book adaptation of this generation  the dialogue is painful  the plot is an absolute mess  oh you think this movie is fun though  cool story  personally i think good movies are more fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought that since spiderman wasnt in it that it wouldnt be a proper venom origin but i got to admit they made it work
Oct 6 2018,positive,people might have expected the same depth as you would in a modern marvel film but i wanted a badass but fun comic book movie that makes venom look awesome and thats exactly what i got really enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,a great standalone movie for venom  eddie brock tom hardy did a great job in this movie highly recommend
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good movie tom hardy does an amazing job in the role the movie just lacked a good villain and not enough screen time for the villain 
Oct 6 2018,positive,though the film isnt very accurate to the comic i find the new take on venom to be refreshing and entertaining tom hardy plays eddie brock convincingly and the voice of venom was pretty cool however the interactions of venom and eddie were the highlight of the film i laughed every time venom commented on eddies relationship so if your looking for accuracy to the source material or a film that breaks the mold of super hero films this isnt that however if your looking for a film thats a lot of fun and has plenty of laughs throughout than venom is the film for you
Oct 6 2018,positive,went into this film with low expectations due to all the critics and trash talk but i left with a smile on my face its no black panther or spiderman homecoming but its still entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was really good i love it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was very good very fun and good for kids cant wait for sequels especially with spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,once again dont trust the word of a critic not amazing but much better than a 32
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie has a wild second half that kept my group on the edges of our seats took two 14 year olds and they loved it definitely looking forward to a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the movie critics  venom was awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,surprisingly good but not as good as first hoped
Oct 6 2018,positive,please go out and watch the movie yourselves the critics clearly have no actual perspective as to how a comic book movie works of course there are the usual marvel movie quirks that arent always necessary but overall a good film tom hardy did awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was really good but i wish venom was a little more sick and twisted
Oct 6 2018,positive,not badnot greatshould of went darkermaybe a r rating
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are completely unreliable this was nothing like what they described it was really good and i am looking forward to a sequel with carnage
Oct 6 2018,negative,hated it  worst marvel movie ive seen  and on my top 10 worst movies of all time list it is simply not okay to be biting heads off of people i dont care if they are the bad guy  this is too far im done if this character starts showing up in other marvel movies i may just quit the entire brand
Oct 6 2018,positive,we went into the show not hearing any reviews  i loved it beginning to end  tom hardy was amazing  wonderful story on venom
Oct 6 2018,negative,better than i expected which isnt saying much it had a few decent moments but most of this movie felt off balanced and forced
Oct 6 2018,positive,at worst this a standard runofthemill superhero origin story i went in with extremely low expectations because of the low 31 rating by movie critics but i was pleasantly surprised by it this is definitely not as awful as the predator or the last jedi in my opinion theres just nothing really groundbreaking or mindblowing in it just pretty standard stuff actually
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it 1010 would recommend
Oct 6 2018,positive,seemed to have a very intense fast and intriguing pace hardly any boring or repetitive scenes some of the acting was corny due to its lacking writing the story however captures the viewers attention and ends greatly fingers crossed for a followup with carnage
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom played a great eddy brock critics want to harp on the little bit of humour but it was understandable given brocks delema and lack of understanding what was happening to him action was awesome cgi looked great and as much as i wanted spiderman he wasnt needed a rating of r probably could have made a few scenes better but it still worked
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly just a great movie  enjoyed evey second and will go see it again soon  very true to the comics as well
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics sooo wrongthis was a fun not serious unique creative and enjoyable watch loved the dnyamic between venom and hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,genuinely a decent movie i dont understand why people are trolling with bad reviews theres room for improvement with character depth and story background but aside from that good film 657 out of 10
Oct 6 2018,positive,good humour and good action
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it aside from spiderman not being involved in story line it hit the mark for me on what venom should be with just a little extra sarcastic humor
Oct 6 2018,positive,if this movie taught me anything about your critics its to never listen to them again this was a good movie with only a few fixable flaws really hoping for a second one your critics need to realize this is a marvel non mcu movienot freaking mama mia ridiculous
Oct 6 2018,positive,id take this film over any of the sam raimi spiderman films any day
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was perfectly put together with its comedy and action complimenting each other
Oct 6 2018,positive,simply awesome i wish there were more actionfight scenes that buildup to a longer and brutal final battle i do not care that this movie didnt follow a proper hollywood format make the sequel ratedr its the only way to properly present the next villain 
Oct 6 2018,positive,more venom humor would have made the movie better  the venom and riot action was too fast to really appreciate  venom looked awesome and tom harding was great  suffers from poor plot writing for the bad guys
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom isnt your typical superhero movie nor is it trying to be its a fun action film that happens to be centered around a reluctant antihero with a healthy amount of humor surrounding the title character his interactions with his host and the world at large what audiences receive is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through and through tom hardy can do no wrong so when is the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was funny and fighting scenes were amazing 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought certain parts of the movie were a bit lackluster but it still succeeded with what it had i feel like the lack of spiderman due to venoms origin story having to do very much with spiderman was the movies main downfall but it still managed ok without him the movie did take a while to get on its feet however seeing that the beginning was a bit lackluster but once it got on its feet it stood strong  the only other big problems i had with it were the fact that his chest looked sort of bland without the spider but i can get past that and the fact that personally i thought the big fight scene was a bit lackluster with that said i think the movie was overall great and enjoyable to see i am extremely excited to see what comes next especially after that post credits scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,i saw this on the fourth so excited to see the movie i was completely satisfied with the movie for the first time im starting to think the criticism of rotten tomatoes is very very wrong venom and tom hardy were awesome
Oct 6 2018,neutral,watchable for those of us that love marvel venom etc but it couldnt marry its darkness and comedy smoothly and the plot came off as contrived and formulaic great acting also destroyed by a bad wig sorry sony not this time
Oct 6 2018,positive,the beginning kinda sucks but the rest of the movie seamlessly emulates the venom character critics dont know what theyre talking about once again
Oct 6 2018,positive,highly underrated dont fully get convinced by the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont believe the critics this was a dark action filled and funny all at the same time matt hardy played an awesome venom and i hope to see this movie ad tom hollands spiderman to it
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom suprised me it was a good fast paste welldirected fun chessy action movie as for flaws the tone is all over the place and the villan wasnt compelling i was never bored
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked the movie a lot it had action comedy what more could you ask for i know people are complaining about the pg13 rating but im glad it was because my 11 year old wanted to see it badly i also hear people complaining about spidermans absence but the movie was introducing us to venom i would suggest seeing it yourself and making your own judgement instead of listening to the critics on this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is by no means an amazing movie but where it falls in plot and sometimes character it makes up in the action cgi comedy and relationship between eddie and venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,these critics are way off the mark it seems that they dont understand venom the symbiot and clearly shows that they havent done their home work on the character and his weaknesses if i were you i would ignore the critics and watch this movie anything less than a 49 is bs
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a fresh take on a great character that stands on its own merit venom is a strong independant symbiote who dont need no spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,so amazing i was thoroughly enjoying the movie the entire time exactly what i wanted from this movie go see it soo good 
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it to the point where i want my own venom wish there was more humour tho i was dying of laughter either way
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely the best marvel movie out there the fight scenes werent tacky every joke that was said hit the villain was truly evil it followed the comics where it needed to and felt like a movie when it needed to and while it had slightly more violence than an average marvel movie it isnt anything that is gory or disturbing
Oct 6 2018,positive,in a world of over saturated campy mediocre marvel movies sony has provided a healthy dose of venom for audiences craving for a darker movie within the genre the acting is great the action is brutal the cgi is glorious and the character of venom portrayed beautifully proving venom is still potent without the spider
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why people say that its a bad movie its not i really like the product that i saw
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie the critics rating this 32 are insane up there with deadpool but much less beat you over the head with comedy    super disappointed that the 2nd after credits scene after a super long wait though credits was a really long clip for the new spiderman universe movie it had nothing to do with venom super lame
Oct 6 2018,positive,umm this movie is actually pretty good good action good humor very fun watch good job sony 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i love marvel movies in general i really enjoyed venom the plot could have moved a bit quicker and i wish there was more dark humour in it because i loved it but overall i just love this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why people have been bad mouthing this movie i have just watched it for the third time and love it
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore all reviews its fantastic
Oct 6 2018,positive,while slightly muddled by a first act that overstays its welcome venom still manages to deliver a fun and enjoyable dumb comic book superhero movie with strangely wellputtogether action scenes barring a somewhat confusing final confrontation between the symbiotes and an amazing performace from tom hardy playing both the host eddie brock and the parasitic symbiote venom the movie was able to grip my attention and never felt like it was wasting my time venom was fun and if youre even remotely interested in seeing it you definitely should its nowhere near perfect but it sure is a good time
Oct 6 2018,positive,wild fun and ride thats all we ordinary audience want no more preaching no more we pay for what we want a funny full of actions anti super hero mivie
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a good movie by any means but it was entertaining as hell and honestly thats all i could ask for
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun funny simple will go see again
Oct 6 2018,negative,im not sure what it was but the rhythm was really off for this film im a big tom hardy fan but venom didnt deliver hardy wasnt convincing and michelle williams lacks emotion in her portrayal   she seems unreal or just going through the motions i did not like this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont believe the crappy reviews from the socalled movie experts this movie is a pretty good movie it is not a 10 out of 10 but it is not horrible either would have been a better film if  it would have been rated r and had more of a darker tone it was a little bit too light hearted but overall was not a waste of time or money of the entire movie i think the third act was the weakest with the worst cgi
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are wrong once again a good movie that does justice to a loved marvel villain now antihero
Oct 6 2018,positive,so just got done watching venom and i actually really liked it not sure why people are giving it so much hate loved the tom hardy and michelle williams story was good action was awesome and the cgi was great 
Oct 6 2018,positive,had tons of fun while watching venom the film wouldve been better as a rated r movie but i think that could happen in a possible sequel the acting from tom hardy is the best in the film both as eddie and venom however the acting from michelle williams and riz ahmed could be better but i think hardy makes up for most of it
Oct 6 2018,positive,holy shit not only was venom not terrible it was awesome   its not as great of a film as something like infinity war or civil war with endless tangled stories and themes and stuff but its one hell of an entertaining solo flick very much like the first iron man   a total blast loads of laughs fun action go see this movie and have a great time maybe dont take your 2 year old  a sony you done good i sure as shit didnt see that one coming
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it great film
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it really enjoyed the jekyll and hyde approach for eddie and venom it is a good and highly entertaining film please ignore the bad reviews and give venom a chance 
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie pulled a lot from the venom comics and in my opinion did a better job than the original source material  they got the character right which is of great importance to me it was also entertaining and fun  from the look of it most might expect this to be a dark and serious scifi horror movie like alien or predator but its really a simple action flick  i really liked tom hardys performance and enjoyed the jokes the symbiote often made at eddies expense  my only issues are the simple dialog and straight forward plot you could guess everything that will happen a mile away  this film felt very fast paced from the get go too fast if you ask me with small time jumps made to keep the story constantly moving like they were trying to catch us up to the ending i would have preferred they took some time subtly revealing plot points rather than quickly explaining itself then moving on to the next  bottom line is im a comic book fan that grew up reading venom and i liked this movie and look forward to more
Oct 6 2018,positive,world renown crittic israel delgado says the new venom movie was better than anticipated giving a funny drastic spin off of the comic books venom has earned its place in the mcu movies franchise it gives unique charaters and plots that help the audience to envison a new venom movie guaranteed that this movie is worth the money you payed for that ticket
Oct 6 2018,positive,by far the best movie i have seen not sure what movie the critics watched but it definitely wasnt venom it was humorous and a smart movie will be watching again in fact i am going to see the movie again today even though i watched it just yesterday for the first time i definitely recommend watching this movie i loved it but this is just my opinion but sure there will be people who dont like this movie but i can assure everyone that there will be many more people loving then hating this movie go see venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome just awesome they definetly kept true to the comics on this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,compared to the the amazing spiderman series in the 90s i was very delighted with the use of facts from the venom lore as well as phrases directly out of the series i find the original rating of 30 to be highly inaccurate as the story and dialogue is great very delighted with the producation
Oct 6 2018,positive,pure popcorn fun its not going to win any awards but tom hardy is ruthlessly entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is a fun movie to watch  go and expect to laugh tom hardy actually looked like he was having  in this movie the chemistry between  eddie brock and the symbiote was great yes the writing could be better but its not as bad as catwoman was
Oct 6 2018,positive,lol fcuk those critic love venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom isnt a masterpiece but its a breath of fresh air and it does what it needs to do most importantly its fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,we really enjoyed this movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,good take on the venom character sfx well done off to a good start
Oct 6 2018,positive,first twenty minutes was iffy but after that it was the best movie ever
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a good flick if it was rated r i believe it would have been great my favorite part was seeing all the moms complaining about the language their 6 year olds endured during the film
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best movie of 2018 the audience is surely loving it rotten tomatoes and it dont need any proof
Oct 6 2018,negative,unsympathetic protagonist villain just a copy of protagonist evilmisguided genius has been done to death girlfriend is unrealistically understanding and supportive
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun great take on venom tom hardy kills it as usual
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a good movie to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie really enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,neutral,it was just missing something it was ok liked tom hardy as venom but the story or character development was lacking wished it was better
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think the movie overall was good i will agree that  some scenes were bad and poorly scripted but i like what they were going for in this movie its sony have you seen other movies they produced for example the other spiderman movies if you actually go back and watch them they are just as bad at some of the scripting its just my opinion though i personally cant wait for the next venom or what ever the next movie sequel will be called but i cant wait
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie hardy was a perfect choice
Oct 6 2018,positive,fantastic highly recommend the critics are wrong on this one tom hardy and michelle williams do a wonderful job cannot wait for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,an awesomely wonderful movie the critics have never been more wrong and apparently the entire crowd agreed as everyone in the theatre clapped when the final scene was over hilarious great characters awesome action scenes a must watch that im definitely getting on bluray
Oct 6 2018,negative,cgi terrible story was worse no plot harding couldnt save this movie save your money for matinee 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went in with no expectations about spiderman or the mcu and you know what  i loved it its funny im looking forward to watching it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,going by the critic score i wasnt expecting much but very much enjoyed the movie i cant wait until the venom  carnage movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,listen is it 100 canon no is it fun and interesting from start to end yes yes it is go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a fun popcorn flick so many laugh out loud moments im glad to have finally seen venom  eddie brock on screen for more than 4 minutes and not played by topher grace   bring on the sequel i wanna see carnage
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie its worth the trip to watch it
Oct 6 2018,positive,solid story not as messy as suicide squad i like it watch it just dont be too critical watching it its a movie for petes sake
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont know why the reviews are so bad was a really good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie maybe a little biased since im a huge venom fan venom looked great and i loved the interaction between eddie and venom  definitely ignore all the negative crybabies with the bad ratings you should definitely go watch this movie i am going to see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy riz ahmed and the other cast do a fine job of showing venom without a spiderman connection the film has humour and tension in a fun package that your children will love and the adults can get a kick out of it as well
Oct 6 2018,positive,very entertaining and some funny lines
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know what movie these critics were watching but i thought it was fairly good the dialougue between eddie and venom were great it was pretty hilarious the secondary actors were ok didnt really care for them the action scenes were good the final battle was a little messy theres alot of controversy for the she venom kissing eddie i thought it was discusting but in a good way  is it the best comic book movie no it isnt is it the worst far from it they based this movie on the lethal protector series which if you read it it stays pretty close to it  personally i wanted to see more venom just because they were so good and i think alot of critics miss this but in the begining of eddies life he is the parasite metaphorically and it really connects them too the only advise i have is if you liked the trailer youll like the movie and if you didnt well you wont like the movie like i said it really sticks to the lethal protector series and that includes the 90s cheesey lines overall i ll gladly see again
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie enjoyed it so much
Oct 6 2018,positive,apparently the majority of the critics dont understand good entertainment venom was exciting enough to make me jump a few times it was also pretty funny which i wasn t expecting the repartee between eddie and venom was highly amusing he was very much an antihero and the movie has you rooting for him i loved it i felt the movie was very well done it did venom justice
Oct 6 2018,positive,painfully slow and misplaced plot in the beginning but the special effects saved the day in the end its a good rental if you a large hd tv 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,i guess not all marvel movies can knock it out of the park  marvel has had an incredible year at the box office  i was expecting to be wowed but left the theater a bit underwhelmed  you can read my full movie review at venom is kind of a hot mess but still fun for comic book fans  see my full moviereview at 
Oct 6 2018,positive,again and again critics fail to deliver any reliable source of review great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,love it the only problem i had was that sometimes i couldnt really get what vemon and the other were sayin but overall a fun and entertaining movie after all is a super hero movie what else do you want
Oct 6 2018,negative,so the venom movie is not really a venom movie they perverted the story to make it into a movie all on its own it is a good movie full of action and a show of the symbiotes abilities  but this is not venom like comic book lovers want
Oct 6 2018,positive,came in with little to no information about venom mid expectation but it was a fun ride i dont know why does the critic give a bad rating but i enjoy every second of it because of the movie now venom is one of my favourite character
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was a fantastic entry to the venom classic  pay no attention to the critics  the movie went quick but let us wanting more  perfect balance of humor   carnage and action  tom hardy was a great fit and loved him in this role  for adults  it was the right balance but personally a rated r darker version would have put it over the top
Oct 6 2018,positive,never trust a critic before trying it for yourself i enjoyed the movie very much not perfect very forgettable villain but the pacing the humor and the connection between eddie and venom were spot on ill watch it again and i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,fanstastic movie despite harsh critics opinion
Oct 6 2018,negative,hot mess off a movie  cant tell if it was due to studio interference poor writing or directing
Oct 6 2018,positive,just look at the audience score its worth the fun night out at the movies
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely a blast a perfect end of summer flick tom hardy is a great mix of sh show and humor as venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was amazing in my opinion well if the script was a bit better it wouldve been an even better film
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was a surprise blast i havent laughed as much with a movie in a while its like a crazy violent buddy comedy action packed social commentary one of my favorites this year for sure
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure why its got so much hate from the professional critics but i loved this film the interaction between tom and venom are funny and amazing to the point where youre waiting for venom to chime in on any dialogue between tom and someone else just to see what he adds to the conversation i also think its amazing how they make you feel as if venom is his own person even tho you dont physically see him if youre on the fence to see this i say you should give it a chance and just to remember tom and venom are a antihero not a hero theres a big difference
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had heard so many bad reviews i almost didnt wanna go see it anymore i did go eventually and thank god i did the movie is amazing the criticism makes no sense it was the chaos noise and dark humor that made it amazing to watch dont listen to sad critics go see the movie for yourself youll love it tom did an amazing job at getting into character
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is a lot of fun i went in with sadly lower expectations because of some reviews i had seen but i was pleasently surprised lots of fun action plenty of funny moments and finally a live action adaptation of eddie that is fun to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are nuts i had so much fun at this movie yea its not the venom we know in comics but its not the comics its the big screen and tom hardy and the rest of the cast crush it
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics got it wrong again like the last jedi haha went and saw this and thought it was good just another example of critics being out of touch and just full of crap
Oct 6 2018,negative,not as exciting as i thought it was going to be for a marble movie nice touch archiving symbiosis but viewers expected more not worth the money boring plot hope the next one if they ever decide to come up with another redeems this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,a very enjoyable film dont listen to the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,sony really delivered on this one i absolutely loved this movie i hope this franchise really jump starts something amazing so much potential right now
Oct 6 2018,positive,classic super hero movie with good balance of action humor personality cant wait for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,refreshingly funny and unpredictable for a comicsbased movie what a wild ride
Oct 6 2018,positive,okay so  i went in to the movie with the idea of this is suck so i had very little expectations but as the movie progresses i was thoroughly surprised when i found myself genuinely laughing at the movie venom was written very well in fact tom hardys character is the only character that i really like and sympathize with the movie but where this movie fails is the characters around venom everyone else in the movie besides maybe one or two characters its pretty awful not just the acting but just general people im not sure why it was given such a bad rating on rotten tomatoes but this movie is definitely worth watching i personally prefer it over wonder woman also there are some scenes in the movie that really really made me wish this was rated r honestly this is probably a 77510
Oct 6 2018,positive,was a really a fun movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie i enjoyed wachting it really funny i love venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,kids enjoyed it personally cant wait to see the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,once again the critics dont review the movie for what it is  say what you want about roger ebert at least he wouldnt try to review a horror or action movie like its an academy award winning shakespearean drama  if you like venom comics this movie nails it  i was really worried how this would work without spiderman but it works  tom hardy is great  this is not just a great action movie but has a lot of humor as well  even if you dont like superhero movies believe me im getting sick of them too this is great movie  dont believe the critics on this one you can tell they just dont get it  compare their tomatometer against the audience score  check this out and stay for the 2 after credit scenes
Oct 6 2018,positive,look the crtics are on the wrong side because this film is awesome funny and a great performance from tom hardy problems are mostly minor but the biggest is the story its not a problem to me but it is still popcorn fun for marvel fans
Oct 6 2018,positive,its the best movie i saw its great i love it id see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom as a stand alone movie it was better than what i was expecting and may be the script wasnt on point but considering that spiderman was not in the movie it didnt really matter
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was great i did not read any reviews prior to going and i am glad i did not the critics are clearly out of touch with this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critic rating is bull go watch this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,75 out of 10 this should have been an r rated film but they did a great job with what they could do under a pg13 rating
Oct 6 2018,positive,even though there were some flaws it was still a good movie i dont care what anyone says it was a hell of a movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i could give 5 if they did rating r not enough details in bloody scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think the worst mistake was making a movie for kids pg13 oh please
Oct 6 2018,positive,no complaints  good fun action movie and true to the character  if youre a fan of the venom comics youll like this movie  if you have a stick up your ass and think every movie should be an oscar consideration get a life and have some fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite my issues with the structure and climax venom is still a fun movie with great acting cool special effects and decent cinematography
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite people criticism about the script the movie has shown how venom character could stand over spiderman tom hardy deserve his best after he bring venom creature become so alive and being part of eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was a fairly average superhero experience it follows the marvel formula to the letter you will get some entertainment out of it however its not the kind of movie you would see again
Oct 6 2018,positive,thanks tom hardy for delivering a venom we love
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie but a few scenes left me thinking  no humans would not eact that way to an flipping alien monster thing  overall it was a very watchable fun film the brockvenom interaction was great  was hoping to maybe see a wee bit of the lethal protector  but that is film 2  ronald mcdonald end credit was great but was missing something and may be to coincidental  overall though  i  really liked it  fun as hell
Oct 6 2018,positive,man oh man are the critics wrong about this one i just got back from watching this movie and it was honestly great tom hardy kills it as eddie brock and really makes you feel for the character the humor in it is very light and not over done the main cast are all likable and dont take anything away from a perfectly done story if i do say so myself doesnt matter if youre into spiderman or are just looking for another great action film to watch pick this one to see you wont regret it
Oct 6 2018,positive,slow start but after that it was great my son and i loved it cant wait to see where they take the story line nextdont listen to the critics go see venom
Oct 6 2018,negative,theres a couple of interesting moments but otherwise venom is a complete mess
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than i was expecting i spent the whole movie waiting to see what the critics hated about it and i never got there i understand the complaint about eddies mumbling but in context its a perfect choice with the other changes his body is enduring  my only real complaint  other than its too loud as some sound effects completely drown out some dialogue  is that it would have been served better as an r rating and really play with the character its just toosweet of a venom as long as you dont think about spiderman you will like it just fine    and this is from a 30  year comics fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,if youre fan its great adaptation of the comics if youre hypercritical looking for a deep story youre not going to enjoy this film tom hardy was great and action plus visual fix were amazing saw it 4dx and it was worth every last dollar
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie isnt your typical superhero movie it tries to be something else and it succeeds with the decapitation in the action scenes the disturbing life foundation tests and the weird menacing comments the symbiotes makes in my opinion this movie would be great if it wasnt a marvel movie and even better if it was rated r since the potential of adding gore dont let the critics brainwash you with their reviews
Oct 6 2018,positive,im a fan of marvel and dc  i wasnt expecting much due to the critics opinion  i just watch it  the movie has some minor flaws and do have an earlier super heroe movie vibe but i love it  tom hardy did a great job ill be waiting for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think its a good movie it isnt a masterpiece but i liked it
Oct 6 2018,positive,being completely honest i give it a 810 tom hardy was great story was pretty good every comment i see an people i talk to liked it venom and tom become 1 there one liners are great and some horror and action all involvedgreat movie the entire theater was on the edge of there seats clapped and laughed at the end everyone clapped i dont understand why people are bashing this movie it grossed 33million first night
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics way out of touch with what the audience likes  whats the point of critics then
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie is getting bombarded way too hard it was not amazing but it was not a terrible movie as people are painting it to be either
Oct 6 2018,positive,love the movieaction and funny all the way
Oct 6 2018,positive,as every superhero newcomer with ironman 1 exception the movie start slow never too intense but will keep you entertained venomhardy interaction later becomes the main comic relief not a bad movie after all the critic hate 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was awesome i loved it my kids loved i only joined this just to give this movie a good score because it was good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really liked this movie and i dont understand why the critics were so harsh on this movie i 1000 advise you to watch the movie and not to listen to the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a fan of venom being kinda heroish but everything was really freaking cool
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was true to the comics partially if you leave out the fact that spiderman origin but i mean look at batman v superman the whole martha thing this movie is better it is closer to the comics than that god awful casting of edward brock jr spiderman 3 this movie plays slowly losing the audience before the climax thats origin stories for you though once brock gets the symbiote you get the excitement returned there was too little venom on screen but this movie does tease the future and show the  bonding of the symbiote with its host the movie definitely had its moments but could have been better the end credit scene was great and definitely as a fan made you want more venom  more symbiotes i hope the mcu crossover happens but right now i just want the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,just went to see the movie and was absolutely stunned by the new characteristic work of both venom and eddie brock while watching i was comparing this and spiderman 3 sure a lot of people remember and saw that they were  completely different with sdman 3 the venom role was felt bland and uncared for and so was eddie brock but in the new film it felt has though venom has become real and with eddie he felt like someone that is not just a regular actor
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure where the negative reviewes came from  the rating of the moview is what it is  for a pg13 rating its good venom is the main character the first 30 minutes are slow due to the fact we are establishing the characters  once venom meets eddie brock things kick up  venom isnt a hero he is an alien getting the hang of our world through the mind of eddie  venom and eddies  interactions make the movie great the villain was a horrible person and the ending fight scene was not a man of steel type battle you felt for our protagonist they are for all purposes losers our underdogs hopefully the opening weekend goes great would like to see venom vs carnage and who knows maybe an actual hero and other villains
Oct 6 2018,positive,underrated for sure  put it this way i was far more entertained during this film than half o the mcu films fun watch
Oct 6 2018,neutral,far from perfect and not even generally good but hardy turns in a strange but fun performance venom himself is cool and well executed but the story is bland and characters paper thin
Oct 6 2018,positive,went in with low expectations since sony doesnt do superhero movies justice i enjoyed the movie but there were times throughout the movie that werelacking hope they have a chance to let marvel have more of a say as they expand the spiderverse
Oct 6 2018,positive,great antihero movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie is good its a totally different movie than the venom fans expected but its not bad it has its problems and mistakes more has proved very promising
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics words so far have been stupid nothing wrong with this movie enjoyed every minute
Oct 6 2018,positive,was incredible  outstanding best in class and most on top awesome 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i saw a load of reviews saying wow i cant believe how bad this movie was some of them gave decent reasoning behind it but cmon whyd you have to put a movie down like that let it go having said that when i saw the trailer at first i thought eesh this writing is terrible so naturally when i went into the movie my expectations were kinda low but the film totally flipped on me it went in another direction and i was pleasantly surprised im not gonna say this movie was a masterpiece if you go see it youll definitely find flaws especially if youre looking for them but i would say go see it its totally worth the ticket price and if youre looking for a movie about crazy comic characters from youre childhood youll enjoy this movie  also if you hear the title song youre going to bounce that tune around in your noggin for ages trust me
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was disappointed when the critics gave this movie a low review because i had already bought tickets went in to the movie with a bad expectation however this movie was actually good i do not agree with the critics i was entertained from beginning to end
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun movie  action packed and  had some great laughs
Oct 6 2018,positive,really hope they continue with tom hardy as venom really enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,my husband and i saw this we thought it was a nice balance of action and comedy it had a surprising and different plot than expected but it worked lots of action and plenty of laughs i would see this again as i missed some things in the movie the only is it started off slow until the main character decided to call back the lady
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think they missed the mark with not having the movie rated r but overall it was a solid movie and entertaining to watch tom hardy was amazing i would love to see an mcu crossover
Oct 6 2018,positive,pros great comedy great acting by tom hardy and thrilling action scenes  cons slow start not violent enough shouldve been rated r and very weak villian    movie is absolutely underrated doesnt deserve the hate   its getting had a blast at the theatre it starts slow but once it picks up its incredibly entertaining theres one fight scene involving smoke and a swat team  particulparticularly well done  tom hardy is fantastic as eddie brock and the banter between him and venom was great if you come in expecting a masterpiece you wont get it but if you come expecting a fun action movie you wont be disappointed at all
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not a great fan of all marvel films but this film was great and too my liking a dark but also at time minimal jokes made throughout film is a great way for how this film was made most marvel based films have too many jokes that are not needed im happy that venom had a reduced amount as it supposed to be more dark the story was engaging and is suitable for the targeted audience  casting is also relatable to the characters played
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than critics are saying not the best but certainly not the worst movie a fun take on the character interested where it can go from here tom hardy was great as usual 
Oct 6 2018,positive,had low expectations since spiderman 3 ruined the venom character this movie did the character justice 
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont know whats up with the poor reviews sure this wont move you to tears and some parts are a little bit cliche or expected but overall a very good movie action packed interesting villain great acting and special effects loved it when eddie tom hardy transforms and the fight scenes that follow are well choreographed would watch again
Oct 6 2018,positive,in my opinion very good movie definitely worth to see
Oct 6 2018,positive,i grew up with venom from the 90s spiderman animated series my comic book knowledge isnt the best with this character but ive read a few graphic novels i think this movie does a good job keeping what it can from the comics in tac but it had to take a few different turns leaving out a pretty important character to his origin i went in with low expectations and really enjoyed it more than quite a few mcu and dc films i will gladly buy this on blu ray watch it again hope to see a sequel the end credit scene has me hyped
Oct 6 2018,positive,i know why the critics hated it and you know why they hated it this isnt some dramatic and meaningful antihero film its a movie about a hot mess getting suck with a loser alien who fused eddie solely because hes also a loser newsflash sometimes people wanna see a dumb movie that owns its dumbness not every movies has to be art to be good
Oct 6 2018,neutral,beginning very slow but got good
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie venom fan for over 30 years i dont understand why the low rating by some to they must not know his story
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a good movie good spin off i am pretty sure kid spiderman stands nowhere in front of venom marvel can fuck off tom harday rockkkssss so all the haters can fuck off
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie i have this year
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing funny loved it its everything i wanted in a venom movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a beautiful hilarious mess and i enjoyed every second of it
Oct 6 2018,positive,solid film critics wrong
Oct 6 2018,positive,really good film great action  couldve had more fights and generally more chaos  but definitely still a 5 star
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is a really fun and enjoyable movie that does justice to the comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,first time creating a rt account just to rate this movie and ive been using rt for many many years venom was awesome if you loved the movie upgrade that came out earlier this year then youre definitely going to love this movie for whatever reason some dumbass reviewer made it seem like thats a bad thing its like upgrade except with a badass bass voice instead of a computer voice in his head the only downside is that the movie wasnt rated r like upgrade was which is the only reason i took off a 12 star major disappointment given the success that deadpool proved with ultraviolent comic book movies the movie was clearly designed to be violent as hes murdering and biting off heads throughout the movie it ruins the immersion when all the brutal action is happening offscreen 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great movie and a awesome start to a great franchise
Oct 6 2018,positive,all the dynamics worked out really well it foreshadowing at the end was amazing the way that they turned venom into an anti hero some people might have thought it didnt work out very well but i loved the concept of a pure villain turning to an anti hero and i like how venom an eddy or like cool you know like their friends now
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought this movie was gonna be really really bad based on the critical review bur it wasnt bad i actually had a good time with it it does take a while to develop but once it picks up its a fun ride 
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critics this is a entertaining film 
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome  i cannot wait to see the next one the graphics were crazy good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i know so many disliked the movie i personally didnt understand it but i personally enjoyed it a lot i thought tom did a fantastic job and i laughed many times i also thought that venom even tho he was funnier stayed dark overall i liked wouldnt say it was bad and would love to see it a second time
Oct 6 2018,positive,most of the people that went into the venom movie expected too much character development from the character of eddie brock when in reality theres not much to him without peter parker they did the best they could without spider man i think this movie was solid i thought id be much worse its really funny sometimes too funny everyone thinks theyre a movie critic nowadays it has a straight a to b plot and finish
Oct 6 2018,positive,i would wait for this movie to go on video to watch  this movie at home but ill give this movie a 4 star just to be nice
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie thought they nailed how the interaction between eddie and venom worked great graphics as well dont really understand why the critics were panning it so bad
Oct 6 2018,positive,had a great time watching the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,far from great or bad venom is a film that is enjoyable but nonetheless severely flawed some complaints are not worth mentioning as they apply to most mcu films yet are overlooked but other issues the film has such as unexplained logic of the symbiotes and little character development are hard to overcome
Oct 6 2018,positive,im a venom fan having my forearm permanently scarred with him will tell you that they did the best they could to get the venom they got without using spiderman tom hardy does well and does carry a lot on his back with this film him and venom form a great and sometimes funny bond which the comics also portrait venom as a little whitty so glad they had they some die hard venom in there for the fans with some of the other symbiotes but the story way very very flat for the ladies and guy fans of tom he looks hot as hell as always even though he doesnt get his gear off and does well to hold it above water and make it a bit enjoyable should of been darker and naughtier and i wish in the spiderman universe but disney spoiled that stay for the post credits
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it tom hardy gives the performance of a lifetime venoms doing what venom does it was funny but also dark and i really enjoyed it only thing that bugged me was it felt like an important scene was missing and the villain wasnt very interesting
Oct 6 2018,positive,it had a very good cgi but the only good actingcharacter was tom hardy aka venomeddie brock and woodys 5 minutes creep
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had a great time watching this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,not as bad as people say it is but not a great as i wanted it to be for me it was a good movie with many flaws holding it back but i still recommend it to audiences and comic book fans alike i give venom a 355 a good time at the theaters
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was an excellent fun buddy cop type comic adventure with venom playing the bad cop the only issue i see was that they should not of held back on the gore but to keep it possibly inline with the mcu it had to be done 
Oct 6 2018,positive,very well done the acting was phenomenal and the symbiotes looked great story flowed and i really enjoyed watching it
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy is great in this movie and it is extremely entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was great for comic fans and my dad whos never read a comic in his life gave it an a rating and ill do the same as a comic fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics great fun movie even though the origin has changed with no spidey it still stays true to the lethal protector storyline from the 90s its worth going to see to have fun harkens back to late 90s early 2000s horror movies
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are stupid this was a good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,certainly im in a minority when it comes to my fellow critics but i liked venom hell if it wasnt for the sloppy and formulaic script i might have even loved it tom hardy and venom very good scene in movie but character riz ahmed in williams very bad msking
Oct 6 2018,positive,almost let critics stop me from seeing venom glad i didnt thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through i understand some of the criticisms its not an oscar film but i was entertained throughout my only wish is that it wouldve fully embraced and dove even deeper into its weirdness and horror i really hope theres a sequel that picks up where the post credit scene left off so much potential
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was amazing  critics dont know shit these days
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie the theater enjoyed it so much that they clapped 3 times it was a sold out crowd i loved the relationship between eddie and the symbiote and the cgi and action was done well well worth your money
Oct 6 2018,negative,amazing enjoyed every part of the movie its funny and warm movie its different from other marvel movies and thats another reason why i like it
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely astonishing use of humor and action a must see 
Oct 6 2018,positive,really entertaining film  the film was really fun and kept you interested one main problem is tonal structure it has a few serious scenes where you feel the emotion which quickly gets destroyed by a cheesy jokes to be fair the jokes never failed to get a laugh but it made the films scenes feel cheap gets a bit to much buddy comedy at times but overall a really amazing film one of the best san fransisco chase scenes with eddie on his motorbike and when venom finally stands up its a really uplifting moment with a lot of gravity for the reveal last problem is the character of carlton drake and the life foundation did not feel good enough personally we have had some great comic book villains killmonger thanons recently where you understand and kinda get behind because you want to see what would happen if they won but carlton drake does not do the same i wasnt expecting a new thanos but something i can get behind and motives i agree with a little but overall one of the best films ive seen in a while really enjoyable experience definitely a must watch 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is good movie  dont listen to rotten tomatoes overall  lmao
Oct 6 2018,positive,the reviews are very wrong i absolutely loved this movie the dialogue and acting was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was good not great but good tom hardys performance was perfect and the relationship between eddie and venom is great
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is amazing dont let the critics ruin it for you takes awesome inspiration from the lethal protector comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,beginning was slow but good flick definitely is getting the short end of the stick w these ratings
Oct 6 2018,positive,sorry movie reviewers you are off on this one  as long as you like the genre youre good to go my family loved the movie 36f 35m 15m 11m  we have been speaking in venoms voice all day today even at our football game please go see the movie so we get more of what is is the credit scenes thank you to anybody that had anything to do with this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont know why there are so many bad reviews casting was perfect story was good had you laughing one second then on the edge of your seat the next
Oct 6 2018,positive,another movie made for the fans and you can clearly see that on the score critics have zero idea what they went to watch and expected a movie better than aliens when they shouldve expected a popcorn flick  thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the entire movie apart from the closeup symbiote fight scene a bit too blurry and the look the evil symbiote is in this person now eye closeups yes we know the symbiote is now in the little girl because it was very implied by your previous scene everything else very good cant wait for woody to surprise me as carnage lilke heath did the joker
Oct 6 2018,positive,thi sure movie was incredible tom hardy does a remarkable job as eddie brock and vemon  not sure what idiots are critiquing this movie and dating is with a low 30 but this movie was amazing from start to finish   would highly recommend it
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun entertaining popcorn movie  i liked venom more than tom hardy lol 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was great the critics clearly want to hate this for some weird reason
Oct 6 2018,positive,surprisingly good movie one aimed towards general viewers who know nothing about the comic book character venom    although there is no sign of a certain man in red and blue  this movie had great action sequences and a little bit of grey humour put in here and there
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it waiting for next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a greeat movie you need to see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,think critics saw a different movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,so i dunno what the critics are saying again    so venom im giving a solid 810   what can i say its no way perfect and could of done few things to up the score a little yet it was a great film  so the layout and story it has a long first part and was rather unneeded they could cut it by 1015 minutes yet it did do a great job of showing who eddie brock is what he had achieved and how he loses it all yet the second half is amazing once it gets going its a roller coaster of great action scene  fight scenes and a amazing relationship between venom and eddie brock     cons   slow to get going not enough riot    pro  venom looks great and he spersonality is 100 perfect great fight scenes good chase scene loyal to the origins even without spiderman made a film were i didnt care spiderman wasnt in it great humour and develops the main characters well     its well worth watching and a great laugh
Oct 6 2018,positive,the film has great story line and its effects is amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,dark but hillarous antihero movie very recommended
Oct 6 2018,positive,five stars as it was a movie i enjoyed in an ocean of boring movies i tune out midway through been a spiderman and venom fan my entire life it wasnt canon but still very entertaining and thats the main reason we watch movies at least thats why i do not to have a message cramped down my throat just for entertainment and a movie i can chat about with friends and venom hits that mark for me
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing movie hilarious dark comedy critic reviews totally wrong 1010 best movie of the year
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand the hatred this is getting  are folks just upset that spiderman doesnt make an appearance i enjoyed the movie and thought that hardys portrayal of the eddievenom relationship was a lot of fun  i saw it in 3d and frankly except for the final fight scene i didnt think if added much  probably going to see it again but in regular format
Oct 6 2018,positive,please ignore the crazy critics this is obviously a good movie as the 89 audience approval rating will tell you it was fun action packed you could barely go a minute without action except near the beginning  and overall it looked good a few plot holes but most movies have that the post credit scene was great even though it wasnt that good visually
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why people expect this to be tied in with spiderman when it clearly is not the movie was funny fun and didnt take it self super serious and dark just because the character is venom the movie is rates pg13 it worked well and everyone is having too high of expectations for this to be on marvels level cut it some slack and enjoy the movie for what it is i will say that i wished there was more action and that the script was better id watch this again for sure i mean the audience has this movie at 89 as of right now that says something movie critiques are being way too picky with this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,came in with high expectations and i was not let down  tom hardy really brought out who venom was  highly recommend watching this movie multiple times  makes me an even bigger venom fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was described successfully in this movie and it was cute and attractive
Oct 6 2018,positive,i hate critics very entertaining movie lots of action with a splash of comedy will be going again this week 
Oct 6 2018,positive,a little slow in the beginning once it takes off its funny and entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i knew this movie was going to do well the story is setup the venom character has been done so so well tom hardy did a great job and it was funny in some parts which fitted perfectly i left the cinema eager to see the next one nothing felt forced or uncomfortable to watch like for example the last jedi which left me in utter discust if theres any issue with the movie for me its that some of the fight scenes were done too fast my eyes could barely keep up with what was going on other than that loved it
Oct 6 2018,negative,started slow but finished better also marvel needs to cut back on the corny oneliners attempts at comic relief is getting worse  worse i expected a much better movie from marvel 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why people hated it but i liked the film it was annoyong some of the cuts but not something too awful but beacuse of that i am giving  355
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was one of this years comic book movies that i was most looking forward to but it all turned out very average  it had a very slow start which is fair enough we need time to set up a back story but i felt no connection to this incarnation of eddie brock and so i was already losing interest after half an hour  once venom appears i have to say the film did get better it was funny in places action packed and i was interested to see where the character was going to develop  even so as the film drew to a close i asked myself whether its one i would go back to and the answer is no  i also felt this was a strange role for michelle williams who is a very decent actress and was very much wasted here the biggest letdown however wasnt in the main body of the film it was the extra scene slotted in mid a credit sequence that was meant to appeal to the fan boys and tease a sequel  the appearance of this character would be awesome but the complete wrong choice of actor and what was with the last minute red curly wig they had obviously picked up for him from a charity shop 2 mins before shooting  he looked ridiculous  hand venom over to marvel before the red curly wig makes it into a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,youd be pleasantly surprised how good it can be definitely encourage everyone to watch it critics arent always right
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the film although it is the 1st film in the franchise which is normally slow as it is introducing the characters it was well paced and the story line was not over complex
Oct 6 2018,positive,i definitely enjoyed this film i am not sure why this film is getting such bad reviews it would be one of marvels best movies of all time if they went with an r rating to really let tom hardy fully embody this character that being said it was definitely still enjoyable with good action and comedy that didnt feel forced would reccomend to others
Oct 6 2018,positive,forget what the critics are saying this is a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i do not understand why critics underestimated  my opinion the film came out great
Oct 6 2018,positive,wow i will never take another paid critic seriouslyi already dont read reviews before i see a movie but they look absolutely ridiculous when you have a 31 percent tomatometer and an 89 percent audience score on a movie venom was very interesting my biggest concern before seeing the movie was that the cgi looked too cartoonish in the trailers that i had seen it wasnt an issue in the movie the acting was decent the action was good i liked it and i would see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly venom was a alright movie i think tom hardy did an excellent job at both eddie brock and venom when venom is on screen the film is entertaining and somewhat thrilling off screen tho the film has flaws of having a overall story at times the film can be slow but once the action kicks init leaves you breathless not to mentionthe comedy was also neat not too much or not too little no where near the mcu type comedy with one liners in every scene but more of a laid back type of dark humor i reccomend seeing it and i give it a 45 stars or a 710 stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,not nearly as bad as the tomatometer suggests this is a classic case of critics not understanding the source material it was campy cheesy funny and everything youd expect from a movie set in the spideyverse tom hardy is great and riz ahmed does an amazing job with some bad writing well worth going to see
Oct 6 2018,positive,great acting and entertaining character interactions are the good mediocre writing and a thin story are the bad the cgi was all the ugly its better than i expected but not as good as i hoped maybe the inevitable sequel will rise above
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is pretty flawed with a weak villain and some bland performances but tom hardy truly carries this movie and makes it a good just not incredible superhero flick
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a great movie for everyone to see movie of the year
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was awesome the critics dont know what their talking about movie is so different and doesnt follow the cookie cutter marvel movies tom hardy was excellent as venom great movie and very entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie of 2018 i love it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was super cool me and my teenager loved it should definitely check it out
Oct 6 2018,negative,sony thinks audiences are complete idiots i think the execs must view the dailys and think i dont understand this is supposed to be the villain he doesnt seem so bad make him as evil as possible and hmm i dont know its not predictable and cliche enough we dont want people to get too confused  at least the eddie and venom stuff was fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the action was amazing and i loved the comedy in it as well cant wait for dvd release to own it myself
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome film  i just would have liked more dark scenes so it should be for 16 yo and not 12 yo
Oct 6 2018,positive,is it some cinematic masterpiece no is it outright bad no is it a jolly good time absolutely    dont trust the critics on this one it was a lot of fun and knew exactly what it wanted
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this movie despite the critical reviews i really enjoyed myself and would highly recommend anyone to just go see it for themselves
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a good movie it was funny and had a lot of action in it
Oct 6 2018,positive,maybe not the best but i had a great time entertaining and had the whole cinema laughing
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was better than i expected i had no hopes for it but i really enjoyed it and so did everyone in the theater because venom had us all laughing
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is the perfect movie for any die heard venom fans although i can understand the criticism with the constant tone changes i dont think its a bad think in fact if anything i think it makes the movie better everything from the acting to the action to well basically everything is just fantastic i highly recommend it
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is one of the greatest marvel movies ever nonstop action from beginning to end great cgi effects great storyline i think rotten tomato has some of the worst movie critics i dont know how they gave venom 30 rotten im not surprised they also did that with suicide squad and that was a good movie whoever they have rating movies has a onetrack mind lol
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good movie great action and cgi it took a little before he became venom but the storyline was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie and eddie brocks interaction with venom was awesome would definitely recommend
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not sure why the critics are so critical ive never seen such a disparity between critic and audience ratings and im inclined to agree with the audience on this one tom hardy and michelle williams were great and i found the movie very entertaining id give it a good 75 percent or maybe even a bit more well worth seeing and ive had more than enough spider man so i actually found this a welcome and refreshing film
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie wasnt obviously a critic favourite it isnt meant to have deep meanings behind it but i loved it it was very entertaining and funny and the aliens were awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely awesome movie i wouldnt really pay attention to the professional movie critics they got it totally wrong this time audience reviews says it all    recommend anyone to watch it
Oct 6 2018,positive,woooooow this is the venom that everyone wants to see
Oct 6 2018,negative,started off pretty good nice easy development the 3rd act was super rushed and the cgi wasnt good tom hardy was very mumbly rental 
Oct 6 2018,positive,at the beginning the editing felt choppy and it just felt like the film wasnt taking its time to introduce the characters and make us fare but in the middle it really started to pick up and i found myself enjoying the movie very much and starting to care more about the characters particularly the relationship between eddie and venom was handled really well for the most part my biggest problem with the movie however was the climax because it just came out of nowhere and it really felt like there was a lot cut from the movie in between the middle and the climax so when certain characters say or do something in the climax you dont really buy it overall i enjoyed venom and it is far better than people are saying it is the beginning felt rushed and sloppy and the climax just didnt feel complete due to the transition in between the middle and the climax but there is a lot of fun to be had in this movie and there was a surprising amount of humor in it it didnt always click but when it did it really clicked i give venom a b
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was really good i think it was very good with no spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,the problem with most critics is that they thought the movie will be bad and now cant accept that they were wrong its a good movie the actors are amazing and i was entertaint the whole time    small tipp from me if you dont watch it in theaters you may regret it
Oct 6 2018,positive,come on this was fun the theater was full of laughter and clapping at the end
Oct 6 2018,negative,worse than spiderman 3
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best times seeing venom on the big screen  i had fun with this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i am a 71 year old lady and an avid fan of tom hardy  i saw it the first day it opened and loved it  tom hardy made the movie  he made the character  funny and loveable  i cant wait to see it again  the critics are just crazy
Oct 6 2018,positive,pretty good movie despite what all these reviews say
Oct 6 2018,negative,not much to see here tom hardy again mumbling through his dialogue some pretty unoriginal cgi fight scenes and literally zero storyline not once did any character ever state what they wanted or needed or what the main reason for the film was no theme no message no plot just a guy goes on the run after being taken over by some silly puddy and the guy who wants it back not even the few good one liners are enough to save this story no matter audiences will scoop it up cause most of us have been dumbed down to what makes a good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,if u dont go looking for a very serious movie but actually a fun and funny one i believe you will be very pleased also enjoy another amazing tom hardy performance
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked the previews for this and was surprised when i saw the first wave of critic reviews with some comparing it to daredevil and cat woman  basically the worst modern super hero movies and after seeing venom this afternoon i can say those reviews are serious hyperbole a 31 is insane maybe its because recent movies from marvel studios such as black panther and avengers infinity war have really raised the bar for these comicbook based hero movies but this movie is fun and fast paced the story is better than you would expect considering theyve written it devoid of spiderman or other heroes at all venom doesnt really have any boring moments there is good chemistry between the major actors if anything the movie could have been a little longer and built up some of the back story if you go into this just wanting to enjoy yourself and have fun with a slightly dark and comedic movie than you will like this one its not game changing but is fun and done well enough venom 2 with woody harrelson as carnage should be even better
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was great could have slowed down a bit and showed more riot but i thought it was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,nowhere near as bad as critics are saying i fully expected to hate a soidermanless venom movie but i really enjoyed it if youre at all interested then just go see it its got great action and humor really hope the sequel gets made too stay for the mid credits scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,slow at the beggining
Oct 6 2018,positive,fast paced great action the chemistry between eddie brock and venom is great worth seeing
Oct 6 2018,positive,tbh it was good and real talk chief idk why people said it was bad it made me laugh and it was entertaining and had a lot of action
Oct 6 2018,positive,lots of action great effects funny and an all around blastwhats not to love  the critics are full of themselvesif you like comicbased movies you will enjoy venom  if you are a film critic or are seeking to enrich your life through film stick to indie films that play in a total of four theaters and grosses a whopping 56 worldwide
Oct 6 2018,positive,very very entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,good storytelling but a bit to relainant on the action and special effects no complains though i thought that it was overall quite enjoyable both a thrilling and somewhat comical movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was amazing so far one of my favorite movie this year  the movie was funnythrillingactionpacked tom hardy was amazing as eddie brockvenom he made me and the entire cinema laugh and scaredhorrified the audience only bad was carlton drake  riot he was only in the last 10 minutes the movie was great and you should see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was suoer amzing i have always loved spidey and i wa super excited for this movie yes this movie kinda deviated from the original cause duh souderman wasnt in it  but idc i loved it it started a little slow but who cares  it picked up and bam   super cool  comic accurate minus the sf and white spider  but good job  hopefully later we see venom and all them
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it was way more enjoyable than the critics make it out to be
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it but im just to try and make a sequel maybe that movie will be great
Oct 6 2018,positive,really good movie dont trust the critics go see it and be the judge
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than anticipated 
Oct 6 2018,positive,not the best but a soild b the venomeddie brock relationship was sooooo good if that was the whole movie this would have been a a plus movie the villain was the worst partjust so one dimensional
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a spiderman fan growing up i loved venom as his nemesis i think it was a great idea to introduce venom in a stand alone movie i was skeptical as i saw rotton tomatos reviews but after watching the movie myself i was thoroughly impressd and this is the first time ever that im actually disagreeing with rotton tomatos score in my opinion tom hardy played this roll tremendously  i couldnt see anyone else playing it as well as he did great movie worth a watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are a bunch of haters this movie is sooo good definitely gonna watch venom again might even sneak in some chocolate and tater tots into the theater
Oct 6 2018,positive,who needs spiderman  i love the idea that not everything needs to be connected  can we all just let eddy brock live his life in san francisco with his personal battle with good and evil
Oct 6 2018,positive,i didnt know what to expect but after watching venom i am a fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,story was a bit muddled but tom hardy totally elevates this movie into something way better then it should be i hope this does well enough to keep him in the role bc i need to see his venom go up against spiderman 
Oct 6 2018,positive,funny and entertaining as always tom hardy is amazing 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i like the movie the movie went as the maximum pg13 i have ever seen
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was good  stan lee makes another appearance lol  tons of action and humorplusbe sure to stay after the credits
Oct 6 2018,positive,yes we didnt see the full darkness and evil of venom but i feel they can still add the darkness in the next filmif there will be one the film itself was outstanding i enjoyed every minute of it well done to the venom crew this was a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was amazing to me  this movie was perfect without spiderman i love tom hardy playing as eddy brock a really great job the music was amazing to me i liked the little jokes from venom as well tbh this movie didnt need an r rating it didnt feel very rated r to me i didnt like woody playing cletus i could definitely tell it was a wig lol despite all the hate this movie is getting i encourage you to go and watch the movie and figure out if its good or not for yourself
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good movie exactly what you would expect from venom the character
Oct 6 2018,positive,its script may have been all over the place but was a good movie overall
Oct 6 2018,positive,i cant believe spiderman 3 got a better rating whomever thinks its better then venom wouldnt know a good film if it slapped them upside the head
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critics  this movie was great  it had just the right amount of action drama etc  i was never bored
Oct 6 2018,positive,my daughter and i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was a blast dont let the critics ruin it for you genuinely a good time see it in theaters because the crowd reactions are fun with this one

Oct 6 2018,positive,pretty great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie has holes that are jarring but it is very very  awesome cgi is good tom hardy and venom are amazing together everyone else is serviceable not much to say but its fun and go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,enjoyable watch and worth seeing in the cinema
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than what i expected and what people are saying movie was simple but great and if you read the comics they did a great job capturing venom im sure the second movies script and storyline will be much better eddie brock and venoms interaction is great i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie deserves a lot better then a 28 rating the director and actors all did a fantastic job i can understand about the tone being off but otherwise i thought it was hilarious venom looked incredible music choice for scenes were great and all in all i found that i loved the mixture of comedy romance and fantasy genres i have been waiting over twenty years for someone to do a venom film and i was not displeased i look forward to the squeal
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand how critics did not enjoy this movie although i agree the character arc behind the villain wasnt one that was the most memorable it was definetly a movie i enjoyed watching from start to finish
Oct 6 2018,positive,started dark ended very well i thought it was worth the money
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun action packed film
Oct 6 2018,positive,kickass buddy flick
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun film with good action sequences nice character progression and genuinely funny moments
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it so worth watching
Oct 6 2018,positive,really fun ride even without spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,while not the best movie in the world its still overall just a fun watch and it left me wanting more hopefully they do make a sequel as this is a great basis for a sony universe in my opinion though we will see
Oct 6 2018,positive,after reading all the crap reviews i expected to be boredbut found this movie to be very entertainingmy nephews loved iti think critics are so focused on finding faults with moviesthat they have forgotten how to just relax and just be entertained
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it funny and different than your typical hero show
Oct 6 2018,positive,this version of venom the character is better than the one in spiderman 3 but i have been dreading this movie knowing they werent going to integrate spiderman in to the story in any way  i found it to be entertaining although there were a few lines that invoked a feeling of the cringiness you might feel while watching attack of the clones
Oct 6 2018,positive,please please if you loved reading the venom comics do not listen to the critics i went in expecting the movie to be a complete bomb thanks to the flock of withered critics who lambasted it reading the reviews after i had already bought the tickets it was a refreshing surprise to see tom hardy actually play a fun role and play the part well the movie had good pace pushing the viewer for more and not one scene made me curse marvels name although the closing credits music did make me cringe a little i wont openly point a speculative finger as to why the projects leaders didnt spend more time developing the hilarious relationship between eddie and venom nor release the film with an r rating these would have sweetened the destructive playfulness of the characters it twanged on the deadpool chord of playful villainy weaving a visual bubblegum song i enjoyed having stuck to my shoe pleading to science fictionfantasy fanatics please give the movie a chance
Oct 6 2018,positive,bunch of spider man corn flakes on here go see the movie dont listen to these idiots
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than expected critics are so off on this one 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed itit was a fun movie what else did people expect from this i dont get these idiotically jaded reviewers go watch a star is bornlol
Oct 6 2018,positive,people get really sensitive when i beloved charecter is changed or adapted in anyway from there original version this movie not only took spiderman out of the origin story but also tried to adapt the charecter to the taste of audiences who see marvle films not only did this movie possiblt benefit from being creativly free from spiderman but it adapted the charecter in a way that was perfect dont let the privileged critics judge your stance on seeing this movie the audience was correct on this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,get the dfx sound  incredible
Oct 6 2018,positive,fucking amazing take on an incredible villain
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont agree with the dumpster level critic scores a really enjoyable movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie with some slight flaws but if you honestly believe its not worthy of a minimum 4 star ratingthere really is something wrong with your brain
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was so much fun and i havent laughed that hard in a long time a thoroughly enjoyable film
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a comic book reader i understand about one shots and what ifs this is a clever and fun way to do this with venom and no spidey venom and eddie are a match made in heaven in this movie long lost bffs meeting for the first time would of love a r rating but this was not hindered without it i cannot wait to see more with this
Oct 6 2018,positive,witty intense strong build up and if you like deadpool you will love venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,i love marvel movies love the special effects kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than spiderman homecoming  great action sequences and hilarious inner dialogue between eddie and venom  my wife and i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,a good movie full of suspense and humor i espically liked it since it was true to the comics and is a original you wont miss chomping out of this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,very very very good  tom hardy is excellent in playing  venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics tom hardy was amazing 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie would of been better with spiderman or more symbiotics but overall very good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went to this movie with a few friends planning on seeing what people said was horrible but through my time watching this movie i enjoyed every second and feel that i have gotten my moneys worth overall in my opinion this movie was both interesting and entertaining with a good amount of detail in the overall design with a great relationship between eddie and venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,if was a good movie not spectacular but it was following the lore also since the multiverse is introduced with the animated spiderman i cannot understand the fuss for a nonvilan venom if you are going to the theater waiting for the dead poets society or the new more realistic batman you will be disappointed
Oct 6 2018,positive,everything critics say is a true it is outdated bad movie but it is also fun and i was really entertained honestly  it is bad and i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i saw this movie and just like any other marvel movie from the mcu its both action packed and funny after watching the post credit scene ill definitely be waiting for a second venom movie  910
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not one to be very audible during a film but this film join the select few who have made me go against this norm easy 7080
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics hate fun and dont know how to appreciate a comic book movie without a superhero  just go see it for yourselves
Oct 6 2018,positive,not disappointing great introduction to venom hoping to see a second one fans obviously agree critics reviews are like their lives seeming empty
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think venow was a good movie with goos actors but i slightly wobly script its nice to have a marvel movie thats not based on the xmen or the avengers or global domination with thanos i very much liked this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really liked it it made me laugh and maybe its not what i was expecting but it was a really cool movie ill be waiting for the 2nd movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually a good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the beginning was definitely a little shaky but god damn this movie was so much fun cant wait to see it again tom hardyvenoms relationship is perfect 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think the critics went in expecting a marvel movie marvel movie this is not entertaining it definitely is im totally on board for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,saw it wasnt expecting much because of course sony that being said i found the movie very entertaining and once again the critics and what the audience look for are completely different other than and occasional cgi issue nothing really pulled me away from edge of seat with a smile on my face th e 2 after credit scenes are 1 good 1 bad 1st one relates to the venom story and the other is for the spiderman animated movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,didnt know what to expect when critics reviews but it was really fun to watch wasnt trying to be too serious and kept me and my family entertained the entire time
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome hardy does a great job and the move is super well shot
Oct 6 2018,negative,the first half was as organic as rigamortis moved when forced unpleasant to look at though still recognisable for the beast it should be  the second half had some good action a nice chase a boss fight but there clearly werent any screen writers involved with this production
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is an interesting film as a movie it was enjoyable to watch and would watch it again but going deep into the film there are many flaws first the life foundation was not good the characters that work there are poorly written and a scene in the film has you wondering wait they dont have cameras second i can tell that they originally wanted this film to be rated r there are so many cuts in this movie where you would think there would be an r rated scene right after and it cuts to a scene that has little to nothing to do with the previous scene the main thing that i enjoyed about venom is the relationship between eddie and venom it adds some good laughs and i enjoyed it all the way through the movie overall venom was an enjoyable movie to watch but could have been even better with better writing and a set rating from the beginning
Oct 6 2018,positive,there are several reasons why i enjoyed this movie first off it was not over the top nor overdone with explosives after another i would say its a film that fits suits tom hardys personality or style of acting  he is a relatable character and is not afraid to do the right thing and when he does there are those who try to go against him venom sees that in eddie and feels they share a common trait which makes their relationship strong another aspect i liked about the film was the humor which is not forced tom brings it in a natural way that i think was suiting when talking to venom as eddie i am genuinely surprised by the critic reviews  for me this was a fine portrayal by hardy released by sony so i hope to see the sequel   we are venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,pls disney give me tom hardys venom with ryan reynolds deadpool movie i need it now
Oct 6 2018,negative,i went into venom with extremely low expectations and my expectations were met although they were not exceeded the first half of the movie is flawed by poor character introductions a rushed timeline and heavily edited scenes there are many times throughout the movie where you could tell they omitted what were intended to be rrated scenes the villain is extremely generic and altogether underwhelming the symbiosis between brock and the symbiote salvaged the movie a little bit towards the end overall i would not recommend this movie to my peers though it might be worth renting for 3 when it comes out in digital release
Oct 6 2018,positive,although it doesnt follow the comic origins i felt it was a fresh take on a new origin tom hardys proformence is once again incredible i cant wait for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,ive really enjoyed
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not to bad  villian is shit but everything other is good
Oct 6 2018,positive,very enjoyable funny and action packed
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun entertaining way to spend an evening it was exciting funny and introduced characters that i would love to see again i hope it gets a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a lifelong fan of venom and all things symbiote i thought this was an incredibly true to character screen adaptation which does so well to capture the full character depth and development between eddie and venom it so accurately portrayed how they joruney together to work in partnership as a we after taking time to adjust beforehand in the comics where venom gains strength from eddie by eddies massive muscle mass here in the film venom gains strength from tom hardy as brocks strong sense of moral justice which actually made for a more interesting source of venoms power in the battle against riot and a great example of how much thought went into the development of the character hardy played the role so so brilliantly the mix of agression and comedy that made venom such a brilliant character in the comics is fully brought to life and seems to be something that none of the critics have been able to understand perhaps for their lack of not fully understanding the character he was meant to be in the first place i am so thankful to hardy and fleischer for making a childhood fantasy come true and for being so true to fans in place of simply pleasing cold self important critics the introduction of cassidy at the end with the confirmation that carnage will be next just shows how much they cared and wanted to make this the film we all wanted
Oct 6 2018,positive,judge it for yourselves but the bottom line is that i had so much fun it might not be a good movie in the academy sense but its good for what it is and honestly its kind of refreshing to see a campy super film that doesnt take itself too seriously also tom hardy is weird af so thats always fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy does great effects were good awesome in 3d after watching the movie bronson i expected hardy to get a bit more crazy i really wish they had went all in for the r rating i wanted more gratuitous blood and guts but they do good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the film was pretty good i liked it when the chase scene happened with eddie and the life foundation security team and then when eddie turned into venom for the first time and when the final battle happened with riot and venom on the rocket pad
Oct 6 2018,negative,i cant believe anyone could honestly give this more than 3 stars  even accounting that this is a comic book flick it as vad i have to say that even the fantastic four movies were better in overall quality and fun  the plot was overly simplistic and there was never any real threat to the protagonist in the story  ive collected comics for 25 years and this was a poor showing for the characters 2nd time on film little li e better than the 1st
Oct 6 2018,positive, it was a good movie not amazing but definitely worth watching i give it 5 stars because  screw critics 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie you should definetly watch it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie is sooooo much better than the critics say after the last jedi getting rave reviews from critics and them bashing them i am officially caring what they have to say fans of the character from the comics are in for a real treat
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was pretty awesome enjoyed the duality between eddie and venom the humor was good too didnt take itself too seriously but was still dark enough would have love to seen them not hold back and go for the r rating
Oct 6 2018,positive,starts of a little slow but engaging picks up real nice after about 40 minutes excellent eddievenom relationship its almost how best friends would behave venom himself has some interesting character development that makes him feel real for being a flesh eating alien hardy and the rest of the cast fit in perfectly story overall isnt too deep but all conflicts and scenes are executed well not sure why it stands at 31 with the rt critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,yes it seems a lil bit unusual and cutting is not very smooth but they really make people to feel like eddie the combination of music with type of shooting really awesome it really deserves the recognition
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was great  tom hardy was amazing  it is absolutely another style of playing marvel character its ingenious and intelligent but its real fun  guess it is the best movie about marvel antihero dont forget about the secret scene in the captions   see you on the next movie of venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than the critics are saying go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best films ive seen in a long time people applauded when the credits rolled says it all
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was great i highly recommend it dont listen to the critics because they missed the mark on this one big time 
Oct 6 2018,positive,a really good interpretation of venom as an anti herothe story is better without spider man
Oct 6 2018,positive,super entertaining i wanna go see it a second time
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was very entertaining great action and lots of potential for sequels critics are panning it cuz they are out of touch knocking it down to pg13 was a mistake but still venom was very bad ass
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun movie critics almost always get it wrong this movie is a blast from start to finish 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it the only thing that i thought was wrong with it is how the dont explain how he got venom back after he went through the fire at the rocket
Oct 6 2018,positive,it could have much better i hate the way it is treated but above all its childishly entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,i would have loved to see this with its once upon a time planned r rating allowing us to see more of the gruesome side of venom maybe better fighting or actually a drop of blood somewhere from eating people limbs maybe see deadpool nonetheless loved the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,couple of cheesy parts but over all it was very entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a decent film nothing spectacular about it but its good time waster if youre a fan of the character or just like superhero films id recommend you see it if your bored and you just to see superhero film
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie you want to go see it it is worth it
Oct 6 2018,positive,710 had fun with movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,superb stand alone movie    honestly it was better than spiderman homecoming    definitely go see it if you havent
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was expecting tom hardys performance to be overtaken by horror scenes that wasnt the case hardy and venom combined to make it a phenomenal film and michelle williams performance made it even better im going to see it again with my wife and hope that this is just the beginning of a series
Oct 6 2018,positive,excellent film with buddy humour and a mixture of funny and creepy venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is really entertainingtom hardy performance  mind blowing  sony attempt new experience as taking anti hero genre
Oct 6 2018,positive,so it wasnt a terrible movie it definitely had its weak points but overall it was entertaining i laugh at how critics give tv shows like gotham high reviews and then give a movie like this low ratingsapples to oranges i know thats why it pays to make your own opinion lots of action and a storyline that strays from the original which is to be expected when it comes to movies the bad points i would say the ending being rushed and venoms motives changing three quarters through was sudden and pretty much not explained i thought it having a pg13 rating would really make this movie tame not at all  plenty of head eating just without the gore 35
Oct 6 2018,positive,am just saying fk the critics these movie is fantastic its just the first 15 mins that are kinda boring
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was good not great tom hardy was great there is room for this to be great
Oct 6 2018,positive,great action movie had a ton of fun with family
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing tom hardy has done it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy as venom connection on many different levels such a the similarities they have was super funny but luckily venom is more of a supporting character in this one that the main focus
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a good fun movie about one of my favorite characters of course like many films there are disadvantages in it but then why go to the movies to look for flaws no they go to the cinema to enjoy to see their favorite actors  actresses the characters they play and in my opinion venom copes with these tasks in a couple of places the plot brings it does not have a rating of r but thats all these are all the flaws that i noticed bottom line go to venom i recommend
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is really a fun film was it perfect no and the problems the critics have with it are valid but damn if i still didnt have a fun time once venom came on screen the start was off though
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not good but its funny so  i liked it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it yall haters who expect too much
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was  dont believe the critics lol they are so wrong awesome post credits scene too
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into this movie with no expectations i hadnt watched any of the promotional material and even though im an avid marvel comics fan venom and indeed spiderman are not really characters i take too much notice of i did anticipate the failure of this film without spiderman how could this possibly work my impression of eddie brock too was of a very angry and negative person and although tom hardy had played bane in the dcu he didnt look like tom hardy in that film here was tom being totally likeable as an overeager and heavy handed journalist perfectly believeable as more of a youtube journo than a regular news team guy eddies interaction with the symbiote was fun and as venom started to take control of eddie some of the dialogue was brilliantly funny my only disappointment was with the villain the other surviving symbiote not really sure who could have been in his place but just felt like it had been done before all in all though some great moments in this film and i cant wait for more i hope the professional critics and hardcore comic fans who are hating on this movie dont put people off and that the public make up their own minds i dont want all my superhero films to have the same tone or pace im glad this one is different in a wonderful retro way i hope the 40mins i hear that tom hardy has reportedly said were cut from the theatre release make it onto the dvdblu ray release
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was great a different side to typical movies one any movie fan should watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was a mess but it was too entertaining not to like 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie with great actorsactionslines
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy is absolutely excellent in this anti hero action comedy my wife enjoyed the movie almost as much as i did and has been quoting the lines on and off today
Oct 6 2018,positive,a good enjoyable film a little bit more of hardyvenom character development wouldnt have been an issue but if youre a comic book fan of venom youll get a kick out of it this will probably get a sequel and i cant wait
Oct 6 2018,positive,besides a slow act one and change in tone at time  venom is very fun action pack movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,very enjoyable and entertaining
Oct 6 2018,positive,once again proving critics are not worth as much as they think it does i always judge seeing a movie based on audience scores because they are a jury of my peers and are not out to make money on reviews i thought it was a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyed this movie dont believe the negative ratings
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was good
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was a great antihero movie it has a good balance of what you are looking for in a movie in my opinion venom was a good intro to what i hope can be a trilogy dont pay attention to what some critics are saying i recommend you guys to go watch it for yourselves you wont regret it venom sequelplease
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved the relationship between eddievenom had a couple minor issues with the plot but overall great has great potential for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome fun movie tom hardy pulls another awesome performance not sure what the critics where looking for
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont care what critics say as huge venom fan tom hardy nailed it the whole film was described in one word  fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,sure venom might be a parasitic alien creature that needs live food or hell start eating up tom hardy from the inside but hes also kind of a cool dude
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie  not sure what all the bad press is about  fresh take on venom cant wait for part 2
Oct 6 2018,positive,fantastic movie romance felt a little forced but not enough to deter me from watching it again 1010 would recommend if you are a fan of venom it is definitely a billion steps above the spiderman 3 venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,mind blowing movie dont miss out by hearing negative reviews
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie for what it is
Oct 6 2018,neutral,review for venom a very unique interesting comic book film compared to what weve seen in recent years with marvel certainly a much better portrayal of the character than sam raimis spider man 3 but definitely not on par with content the mcu has produced  pacing in the first half of the film was a major issue for me some incredibly odd directionless scenes as eddie brock bonded with the symbiotic the second half of the film flowed much more smoothly  tom hardy certainly steals the show with overall average acting around him from a talented supporting cast visually the special effects were very impressive really bringing to life this horrifying antihero ludwig göranssons score was exceptional unsurprisingly  all in all a mixed bag of a film that actually offers some laughs amidst its dark storyline hardy is signed on for three films so i guess well have to wait and see how this one goes financially  overall grade c
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved every single moment tom did a great job embracing his character strongly recommend
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are wrong venom is chaotic in all the right ways and while a more obvious tie to spiderman might be fun venom stands n its own just fine frankly i laughed like an idiot through half of it and giggled like venom fanboy through the rest
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critic reviews of this movie trashing it and comparing it to cat woman are ridiculous this movie was great sure it had little issues here but the film was amazinf tom hardy was amazing venom biting heads off was super cool and i cant wait for the sequel i understand if you have a legitimate reason for not liking it and im fine with that but the critic lies and misinformation out there that includes you collider videos is just wrong its great me and my wife had a great time and we cant wait to buy it and watch it at home
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was okay the actors played the characters well and the special effects looked how they were supposed to although i wish they wouldve atleast mentioned spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a film which only the real losers can understand
Oct 6 2018,positive,while the movie lacks on providing a captivate story and a motived villain i think venom did not fail on providing what you look for in this kind of movies to have some fun watching it an exceptional cast and the possibility of bringing a better story for their upcoming movies i personally didnt have high expectations for this movie based on the trailers but i ended up liking it enough to watch it more than once in the theaters
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great film
Oct 6 2018,positive,coming in with low expectations venom did not disappoint as the movie explored a super hero sub genre most fans were eager to see i enjoyed it since was a great end of summer flick where the anti hero had to discover himself within a pleather of opportunities to become a baddie
Oct 6 2018,positive,a perfect blend of action humor and comics  the critics are idiots  we loved it  better than antman  recommended ignore them
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are ridiculous movie was quite entertaining and funny the only down side was that it should have been rrated so they could have stepped up the violence to match venoms comic book persona it was definitely watered down to get the kids in the theater 
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time  did not expect the humour a
Oct 6 2018,positive,its has a very interesting movielines  the characters were amazing to watch and how they fight
Oct 6 2018,negative,not good too many plot holes unexplained character arcs visual effects are meh
Oct 6 2018,positive,an anti superherobuddy cop film highly recommended
Oct 6 2018,positive,love venom and tom hardy amazing as always
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a very enjoyable movie it is exactly what you would think it would be going in a great and fun movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was well beyond my expectations  i was surprised by the humor and interplay between the venom and tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,31 on rottentomatoes is definitely fake news so venom had a little darkness comedy and loads of action thats what makes it awesome tom hardy was perfectly cast and btw he doesnt make a bad movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,badass movie dont believe the critics go see it for yourself
Oct 6 2018,positive,who knew we all needed a movie about the villain to get ready for superheroes again great movie will see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it havent laughed that hard in a long time and will definitely be buying
Oct 6 2018,positive,until the movie have a lot of things without sense and some cliches its so entertaining and fun in some moments the cgi is bad at the beggining but then it becomes better the characters are the best thing of the movie as the actors that play them roles
Oct 6 2018,positive,as marvel comic fan i never liked venom i grew up on the idea that venom was a villian he was depicted as one through out the tv series spiderman which i watched as a child now that im in my 30s i see it all through a different light     this movie follows the premise that of the comics that eddie brock a good hearted yet asshole journalist becomes infected with a symbiote called vemon who needs a host to survive     the trailers gives you almost the whole story but once you go to see vemon in theaters it helps you in a way relate to the idea of being invaded by another species unlike the movie the invasion vemon doesnt take over brocks mind or control him instead they become like one  this isnt a super hero movie lets get that straight broke isnt going to save the world hes just looking out for himself and sometimes the little guy so dont compare this movie to marvels superhero movies like the advengers or spiderman because brock and vemon wont be risking their lifes if you do then youll be let down hes just a normal guy who has a selfish attitude and likes proofing people wrong  and perhaps saving the ones everybody over looks    its a entertaining and funny movie with moments youll be say yes not because hes saving people but because your inner bad self will be saying that jerk deserved to be decapitated so go enjoy and allow yourself to make the decision if this movie is good or not    also die hard fans of comics you need to open yourself to new ideas besides what you grew up on im a comic fan and i loved this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved the maybe it wasnt the best movie venom can get but it was very interesting
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is so good but the movie is very under rated
Oct 6 2018,positive,a great adaptation of  the most badass villain from marvel
Oct 6 2018,positive,this really wasnt that bad at all  tom hardy was actually easy to understand which was the biggest win for me personally  while the enemy was weak and the cgi wasnt that impressive it did make me laugh out loud a number of times and i like that they made venom the character more funny than serious  honestly i would enjoy a sequel to this with a better writerbetter effects  tom hardy is a good antisuperhero
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a fun movie it had a few issues but overall i had a good time watching it tom hardy carried the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great it had a lot of funny moments and a lot of action pact moments definitely a great one in my book
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely magnificent 
Oct 6 2018,positive,wow i did not think they could pull it off but wow stop on humor sure its not like the comic but is ant man  the wasp even a comic like give respect
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is definitly the best solo superhero movie of this year the venom is a real character you feel sympathy for him the same goes for eddie brock who is also very good character the special effects look awesome the funny stuff is actually laughable and the dramatic moments are very spectacular critics are way to criticalabout this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved the movie dont listen to critics go see it for yourself and make your own opinion
Oct 6 2018,positive,i actually thought it was good movie venom acts so much like the one in the comics and tom hardy nails eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved every moment of venom such an awesome and fun movie will definitely go see multiple times in imax
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie from start to finish good action and just enough comedy tom hardy was great the back and forth between him and venom are my favorite parts of the movie the only thing i wasnt pleased with is the final fight of venom and riot being a little hard to follow with bad lighting has an after credits scene that makes me more excited for a sequel than any other such a scene in any other movie as the 90 viewer rating agrees with me it shows how disconnected and closed minded the critics are i will be seeing it again for sure
Oct 6 2018,positive,without grief or glory
Oct 6 2018,positive,great mix of funny and normal venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing movie i enjoyed a lot i loved the part when he spoiler alert  venom told him to jump off a building then it cut to a scene where he was pressing the elevator button and venom called him a puy the whole theater laughed
Oct 6 2018,positive,i do not understand all hate and bad reviews coming from the critics for this movie i personally liked the movie and even had people who knew nothing about the characters leave with an understanding of what was happening the banter between eddie and venom was good and at times even funny this was a good origin movie for a character we have only seen poorly done in the horrible spiderman 3 movie the movie did flirt between being dark and funny at the same time which i believe is disneys fault due to sony renting spiderman to them other than that the fight scenes were good and im looking forward to carnage being in the next movie i would defiantly recommend others to see this movie also its starting to seem like you cant believe critics anymore about anything i personally feel like they are bias towards certain movies andor are being paid to give bad reviews to movies that deserve more
Oct 6 2018,positive,listen this movies isnt here to change cinema and it knows it what it does do is give me the dark romcom ive always wanted it is silly and campy and ridiculous and amazing i loved every minute of it dont go in expecting to go on some incredible journey go in expecting to have a damn good time and to see vemon and tom hardy makeout that was pretty great too
Oct 6 2018,positive,not the perfect superhero movie but it was definitely an entertaining movie great action sequences and tom hardy killed it id recommend it
Oct 6 2018,positive,just the antihero movie that we needed
Oct 6 2018,positive,a very good movie with first half developing the whole plot of the movie and second half filled with marvelous actions
Oct 6 2018,positive,wasnt horrible wasnt great either i had fun but felt like it was missing a little something tom hardy was amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,great action sequences and a brilliant performance by tom hardy to top it all off story is bland along with most of the supporting characters but it doesnt ruin the film and is very fun to watch regardless venom has finally been done justice on film
Oct 6 2018,positive,venomeddie brock relationship was fantastic it was a really entertaining movie loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed the whole movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,they should definitely fire the script writers first half is just boring nonsense  fortunately tom hardy saves the whole movie and end of the movie is amazing also venom hardy combo is amazing
Oct 6 2018,negative,if this movie was separate from the comic book character it would be good however poorly written dialogue and extreme deviation from the character makes the film a 510 at its best with some good looking effects and action
Oct 6 2018,positive,look the biggest mistake would be taking this movie too seriously go in with no expectations you will have a great time
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critics this is a highly entertaining and exciting movie not exactly what we wanted out of the new venom movie but still very good
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome the critics are pretentious robots that are so narrow minded that if they cant categorize it in a single box with something theyve seen before they hate it numbskulls yes there was action comedy drama scifi and tom hardy should win awards for his amazing performance there was no bad acting  riz ahmed is a great villain too i hated his guts that awesome way the venom character freaked everyone out in the comic book because as horrible and strong as he was he had a sense of humor is exactly how it is in this movie im going to watch it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best movie of 2018 as keep you on the edge of your seat 3 3 3
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best marvel anti hero movies that i have seen great acting and a good story none of the marvel predictability
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a great movie the action in the movie is very good and the jokes have a good timingi liked soo much tis movie but the fx isnt very good but in the movie you didnt pay close attention to the fx
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great kept with the dark comics and they finally got venom right  hardy was amazing and the edition of carnage at the end makes for a great franchise  its about time for a character to be dark and do the comics justice no more making marvel characters into bubbly figures like the new hulk and wolverine great job
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was a really fun time and i honestly thought it was shot in cool ways enjoyed the pacing humor great soundtrack great vfx dont understand how its bad to some ive seen bad cgi this is far from that and of course tom hardy killed it as eddie brock venom himself was great and the twos banter between one another was so entertaining i could watch 2 hours of just that simple plot that flowed well solid origin without spiderman but would like the web head to appear in future sequels please support this for a sequel while also voicing the want of him in the mcu thats my preferred idea stay for the end credits both of them
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had alot of fun watching with my friends tom hardy did an amazing job and performance i truly love this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,not your typical average superhero movie which makes this film really stand out from the rest the action sequences were a thrill to watch and the story was straight to the point overall i enjoyed venoms origin story and cannot wait to see more in the future
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a silly comic book movie that feels about 20 years out of date but tom hardys performance is fun enough to make it a ride worth taking but be warned the ride gets bumpy
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom and tom hardy work very well together
Oct 6 2018,positive,funnynot mind boggling not deep but amazing action most of all venom is cool as hell and hardy is hot
Oct 6 2018,positive,come on you guys this movie wasnt that bad  it deserve to have at least 80 on the tomatometer
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics got it wrong very fun movie well paced and good performancesfor a super hero filmaudience has it right 89 approval vs critics 31
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is dope 
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually really good movie complimented the comic character very well funny in traditional marvel cinematic movies  developed eddie brock and venom well only thing that held this movie back was cgi and how slow the beginning of the film was otherwise good job sony with association with marvel
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is great action packed with humor just enjoy the movie alan r johnson 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand why everyone is disliking the film venom i experienced it first hand and it is phenomenal with witty jokes here and there and action scenes that will make you want to jump out of your seat so dont listen to all the critics and go experience it for yourself and see what they hype is about 89 audience score lets go
Oct 6 2018,positive,my favorite movie this year embodied the character so well and i also like how in this one instead of eddie brock being a jerk hes actually a good guy the venom is spiderman 3 was bad but i love this one also in this movie venom becomes a likeable and funny character that you want to succeed like i guarantee there was nobody at the theatre saying i wish venom would just die
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie  great effects and the interaction between venom and eddie brock is funny  yes the movie is an action flick that should be rated r but instead we have a few funny moments  either way i think sony did a good job this time  hopefully its integrated in the mcu down the road
Oct 6 2018,positive,i have been an avid venom fan for over 15 years ive read just about every comic book and graphic novel that feature venom this movie really did venom justice it was funny action packed had a great story had amazing special effects and the dynamic between venom and eddie brock was fantastic do not listen to most of the biased critics go see this movie it is amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know what the critics are thinking this movie was totally entertaining action humor good lead character the essentials need to be entertained a lot of cgi but i expected that worth a watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,i think that the film war really good people expect too much from it not every film has to be mindblowing because if it was then wouldnt be special anymore or mindblowing
Oct 6 2018,positive,this film is a film made for the people not to satisfy the stuck up critics   toms performance is perfect and really makes eddie brock a loveable character i was disappointed to hear so many negative comments before id had a chance to see it but they were wrong it didnt feel dated at all to me if you want a fun bit of escapism that makes you chuckle and jump all in one go go see this toms humour is bang on and the storyline flows pretty well if you go see it at a 4dx screen its even more exciting
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was going to be bad but i ended up really enjoying it
Oct 6 2018,positive,if youre a fan of venom you will enjoy the ride  if youre not a fan you will love it  let me start off by saying that what this movie does so wrong is its   pg13 which really takes away from its potential and man it has so much potential another major con was how it felt like they were missing some eddie venom motivational development which upon some internet digging reportedly about 40 mins was cut which couldve been this missing puzzle piece    negatives aside this movie was hilarious at times especially between eddievenom great action scenes with some head eating which i was worried we wouldnt see due to the rating and honestly for me i didnt even notice the two hours fly by this is what i feel a movie should do something that wraps you up in a story keeps you wanting more and in this aspect venom delivered     let me wrap up this review before it becomes a ranttom hardy nailed his role i felt the chemistry between eddie anne and venom i hated drake riot in a good way do not listen to the critics i cannot understand why they rated it so poorly definitely worth the watch in theaters
Oct 6 2018,positive,this film was amazing dont know why it was rated so low
Oct 6 2018,negative,bad acting predictable plot very boring during the first hour poor cgi only good characters are the store clerk and the symbiote
Oct 6 2018,positive,truly a fun movie with a fantastic dynamic between eddie brock and venom the pair are easily the best part of the movie at the times the tone of the movie can shift a bit weirdly and the romance for the first half is pretty jank but does become believable especially at the end of the film not a great romance but is passable but the good thing is that this isnt the focus the focus is venom so many movies advertise a creature or character and they dont get much screen time but venom is around for basically the whole movie  tomy hardy did a fantastic job as eddie and venom and has convinced me of this iteration of venom thart i do hope can be seen in the mcu but even if not tha is 100 fine because this film stands on its own with some minor plot hole an okayish villain and strange tones venom as a mpvie does have its problem however after the slow start up when the movie gets started it is a fun a ride through and through i say that the good most definitely out wieghs the bad without a doubt so i would reccommend that you all go to watch this film it isnt the greatest butit is like ive said a fun ride the movie was enjoyed very much by the people in the audience as well there was laughter and even gasps the movie was recieved so well that at the end of the movie they all applauded and left the theater happy and talking about their favorite parts of the film and what the ending meant  in the end venom was pretty dope
Oct 6 2018,positive,maybe im blinded by my love for venom as a character but i liked this movie some parts i guess you could say dont make sense or whatever but if you remember that it is based on a comic that is based in a fictional world then you can just ignore those parts and enjoy the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,sonys venom is an awesome movie ruben fleischer and tom hardy deliver a truly original and appealing origin story for the character that makes the wait for a sequel unbearable the critics are really starting to look irrelevant at this point their bandwagon opinions are less and less useful and are quite frankly absurd specially since this movie would be sitting at an 85 had it been an mcu movie in summary avi arad finally got venom off the ground in a fantastic way and i cant wait for a sequel 910
Oct 6 2018,neutral,this movie is an absolute mess but the biggest saving grace of this film is tom hardy he just looks like hes in a totally different film than everybody else and the relationship between eddie brock and venom is just pure genius i could care less about everyone else in the film just give me more tom hardy as eddie brock and venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,the one of its kind movie tom hardy and the rest of the cast nailed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,for a fan of comic book movies this isnt necessarily a must i know some of the venom original backstory and while this takes away the spiderman part it is quite faithful  and can easily reintroduce the webhead in the future but enough about that as its not relevant having seen tom hardy play 2 characters i had no doubt that he could also do it here both as venom and eddie some action packed set pieces and it was obvious fun was had i cant say to much withoust spolinng but i felty that the casting was well made and a hint of dark hurmoer trhousin in was nicei so easily could have gone more gory but with the sincere threat  that venom gives i feel it succeeded ignore the critics ans by the name they are critical go with the audience you dont need to know the backstory
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was an enjoyable film to watch with some parts feeling a bit unnessary or off some parts had me feeling confused and unsure how that happened but overall i would give venom an 710
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a spiderman fan growing up i loved venom as his nemesis i think it was a great idea to introduce venom in a stand alone movie i was skeptical once i saw rotton tomatos score but after watching the movie myself i was thoroughly impressd tom hardy played this roll tremendous i couldnt see anyone else playing it as well as he i plan on watching it again soon great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was great as a fan of the comics this movie adaption worked perfect critics dont know what they are talking about
Oct 6 2018,positive,love the movie had a great time and laughed a lot at the cinema    went for a second viewing too 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie critics are bad at critiquing
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a great movie but the story is a little wonky i feel that the whole venom shouldnt be a comedy feeling from most critics are so wrong in my opinion it shows how insane a symbiote can be for instance most of the comedy in deadpool and deadpool 2 is there to show how fucking insane deadpool is so why is comedy a bad thing also venoms design is fucking amazing the movements are great the cgi is flawless and the size and beefiness of him is perfect
Oct 6 2018,negative,terrible it was just awful i cant get over how bad it was we were actually mad leaving the theater it was so bad there was one redeeming quality tom hardy was great eddievenom together was well done by him if theres a sequel please do better sony fans and tom hardy deserve better 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i have to say it was better than i expected hardy is great in the role of eddie brock and the visuals are pretty good def worth seeing especially if you are a marvel fan then its a no brainer
Oct 6 2018,positive,its enjoyable and very funjust a lack of character develoment ignore the critics
Oct 6 2018,negative,at first it tries to tell a good tale but fails it tries to be cute but fails it tries to be worth your tino no no stop right there it does not attempt to be worth your time and you should not convince yourself that it is  it is hilarious  and that is the selling point
Oct 6 2018,positive,i usually hate when the movies stray to far away from the comic source material this movie however does a good job taking some things from the comics and adding its own flavor the action scenes are great as well as the banter between eddie and venom definitely worth seeing
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why it had so many negative reviews being a long time marvel comic fan i thought it was well done it had action elements similar to black panther and comedy elements similar to deadpool when eddie brock would speak to his internal venom that also reminded me of when bruce banner was speaking to his internal hulk in infinity wars but that concept was done much better in venom i highly recommend for the marvel comic fans
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are wrong again great movie full of action  critics didnt like star wars either  if you love fun action packed movies ypu will love venom 
Oct 6 2018,positive,overall solid film a little rushed and occasional scrupt issues but a lot of fun
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than expected excellent comic book movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i do not understand why the critics hate this film it was good  scary in parts funny in others  a good origin story especially when compared to others that have gone before it deserves much better ratings  i hope people ignore the critics and go with the majority view on this 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom doesnt take itself seriously and apart from some very blurry action scenes keeps you engaged and wondering what is next
Oct 6 2018,positive,the film captured all of venoms characteristic what he is known for  recomend seeing
Oct 6 2018,positive,my expectations were low due to the poor critical reception but i had a lot of fun with it some of the characters are pretty weak or just poorly acted but not so much so as to drag the movie down with it tom hardy did a great job as eddie brockvenom he was clearly having fun while the theatrical cut was good im looking forward to an unrated extended version clearly there was a lot cut from the film that might flesh things out a bit more at any rate another 40 minutes of the eddievenom dynamic would be a good time
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved the movie perfectly sets up the opportunity for more venom movies  my only criticism would be the car chase dragged on too long  really hoping they do the second one
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had a good time laughing with and at the movie would see again
Oct 6 2018,positive,paceing is odd but every other thing is great
Oct 6 2018,positive,developed the story well from the start cgi was great plenty of action loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was exactly what it should have been not a deep serious story line be but great action and humor we thought it was bad ass and want to see it again ignore the critics  money talks and 33 million in the first 2 days is no joke
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually pretty good
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was pheneomanal
Oct 6 2018,positive,reviewers are idiots this is decent and really hoping it leads to a spidey battle
Oct 6 2018,positive,saw in imax so the effects looked pretty good other than the long car chase the action is easy to follow the fight choreography is interesting and has some great moments its funny its spooky not quite jump scare but i yelped twice tom hardy wasnt shirtless once pg13 after all  venom was very fun and did well for a villain movie sans superhero
Oct 6 2018,positive,with an amazing cast great special effects and a fun storyline venom is a great foundation for this young universe
Oct 6 2018,negative,this is a clear cash grab by sony  theres nothing new that they havent done a million times before and im tired of it  it was a fun movie but its not really rewatchable its just sad that they would make this movie when weve all been hoping to see this character in the mcu under their creative teams
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is surprisingly much better than the reviews its currently getting yes the movie is a bit messy however they portrayed the characters fairly well much better than how i thought they would be and its overall a fun movie i would definitely recommend watching it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was way better than i thought  im usually on par with reviewers but every so often it seems they miss the picture  this is surely one of those  it appears that the reviewers were looking for a deep story filled with character development and subtle mix of special effects  that is not what marvel fans look for  over the last decade reviewers have had to eat their pens with comic book stories becoming big screen adaptations and see spotty acting mixed with simple plotlines   oh well      this movie does a great job of making venom become a franchise  it explains it in more ways that it even needed to  unlike spiderman 3 where venom just crawls up on tobey mcguire about an hour into the movie and then all of a sudden end up on an angry eddie brock after the bell tolls this movie puts it all together differently  venoms character is complex and this movie shows that  eddies character is good and tormented and it shows that  the other characters never really needed explanation  the action was intense and fun   enjoy
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is very entertaining to watch and tom hardy is great as eddie brock and venom it is funny and quite entertaining movie and venom is look better than terrible spiderman 3 and i hope they can do a sequel i give this movie 710
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this movie it was darker the most marvel movies and i liked that
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are actually just wrong this time the movie was so good
Oct 6 2018,positive,while venom may not be the best super hero movie we could have gotten it is certainly not the worst fresh off the boat of watching tom hardy deliver an amazing performance in  both the dark knight rises and the revenant we see that he is what really shines in this movie his dynamic partnership with venom throughout the movie doesnt skip a beat although failing sometimes to give us that laugh we were hoping for i would recommend you see this movie just to get a laugh of the crazy intesity that goes down when the action starts
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is worth a view the critics on this movie are overly fixating on the fact that this isnt an rrating in reality it shows that a venom movie can still be good with a pg13 rating the movie was thoroughly entertaining the dynamic between the venom symbiote and eddie brock in this movie was both funny and true to the venom character there was a moment in the ending where they dont really explain how something happened and you are left kind of confused but overall it is what you would expect out of even an mcu movie as far as the potential for an r rating it would be interesting to see but it wouldnt change the movie and the general themes of the story that much
Oct 6 2018,positive,a must watch indeed the amount of hate this movie is getting from the critics is really beyond me  just watched it and believe me it was worth it maybe the beginning was slightly sluggish but gradually it keeps you wanting for more 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was exactly what it should have been not a deep serious story line be but great action and humor we thought it was bad ass and want to see it again ignore the critics  money talks and 33 million in the first 2 days is no joke
Oct 6 2018,positive,forget the critics this movie was fun and awesome the best marvel film ive seen in years i always dread taking my son to marvel movies but this one was different tom hardy was perfect for the role way better then spiderman expect to see more venom films for sure
Oct 6 2018,positive,the venom movie is a masterpiece seeing eddie brock and venom work together and venom listening to eddie as they stop riot is truly a beautiful scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,i know that for many venom it is a bad movie but we have to admit that although it is bad it tries to represent the character well the performance of tom hardy is very good
Oct 6 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie thought the ending was a little rushed not very familiar with the comics however the venom character is interesting
Oct 6 2018,positive,does this movie have its flaws sure every movie does but in my opinion this story is far more interesting than a majority of the mcu films its much more funny than i expected the action is great the special effects are on point and its just overall a lovable movie id say that this is a better movie than infinity war and about every other marvel movie out there its just a fun edgy and hilarious film
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was off the wall
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought venom was a great movie but the bike chase theres no point in them but actually make a movie related to the comic please it was rushed not venom liked id prefer pg13 max like at the brink of rated r but the rest was amazing but im kinda disappointed since i am a 1 venom fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,creepy suspenseful and dark with splashes of good humor while the third act was a tad predictable everything else was gold venom had the feel of a horror movie as opposed to a super hero movie and because of that i found it to be a welcome change of pace a great antihero addition to the marvel universe
Oct 6 2018,positive,love the movie it was great and had funny moments
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom had a good baseit was just missing a beeter storyline and we need more symbiote not just venomwe need more enemies i guess
Oct 6 2018,positive,its great once it gets going its an origin story yall they start a little slow
Oct 6 2018,positive,very entertaining movie
Oct 6 2018,neutral,the whole movie is not special the plot and visual effects is just mediocre for a movie produced by sony columbia pictures no jawdropping action sequences and spoiler unnecessary spiderman into the spiderverse postcredit commercial the only reason to watch this movie is tom hardy both as eddie brock and venom believe me this guy will never let you down and spoiler surprise appearance of woody harrelson as carnage at the midcredit sequence
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie and the critic is honestly just not a good critic
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy and his chemistry with himself is amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a good movie sometimes it was funny the action was really good we saw the building the cenecton vom edii and venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really loved this movie saw it last night and definitely thought that it wasnt a disappointment like everyone said it would be if you are looking for an action movie i highly recommend this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,go see venom  my 13yearold son and i went to see venom last night and we laughed and oohedawwed throughout the movie sony did a superb job of learning from marvel and mixing humor with action as well as a lot of serious points tom hardy is brilliant but the unsung hero is whoever is playing the voice of venom early on he is scary but then he provides the comic relief the elevator scene had the audience in stitches i saw too many early negative reviews from people who hate a superhero movie if its not produced by marvel no i did not like justice league but by the same token you cannot compare every superhero movie to avengers infinity war thats a oncein10years movie venom is a superb movie so how good was venom when the movie ended the packed theater applauded thats right  applauded and then my son said this was good they gotta have venom fight spiderman two bonus features 1 yes stan lee makes a cameo and he slays with a funny comment from venom 2 at the every end of movie after the credits end there is another 5minute movie no joke another movie at the end
Oct 6 2018,positive,nice presentation for venom the chemistry beetween hardy and venom is phenomenal and keep up the entire movie sadly the plot and other charcters were useless and flat action sequences awesome like in the comics except for the final fight that was like transformers style im pretty sure i can say we have another antihero star in the team now that venom passed the boxoffice test im very interest in what will come cross overs with deadpool and spiderman will coming soon i am sure
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the idiot reviewers you get linked to rt this is not at all bad its funny action packed and way better than awful superhero movies like wonder woman or guardians of the galaxy vol 2 that have got inexplicably huge review scores
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought it was good compared to some of the other superhero movies its not amazing but it is much better than the critics are making it out to be
Oct 6 2018,positive,that ending though
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie freakinng owsm surely ill go for the movie atleast 5 times and again marvel proved how a movie will be
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was worth waiting for it ane everyone i know that have warched it agrees
Oct 6 2018,positive,again the critics were horribly wrong  i have to remember these same people gave the last jedi a 90  its by no means on the level of winter soldier but its a solid movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,good rendition of the back story to make a strong independent character funny scenes were not out of place and the action was unique and easy to follow not 5 stars because the story was a little lacking and some plot points didnt make much sense some things happened just because overall enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardys portrayal of eddie brock is fantastic but the movie isnt perfect by all means but for a spinoff movie all about venom  not even have an appearance is fantastic
Oct 6 2018,positive,fuckng beast of a film tom hardy is perfect as eddie brock the venom character is awesome its everything you want him to be a classic antihero the only problem was i wanted more of eddie and venom iteracting because toms performance was really good the plot was ok but the whole point of an origin film is to promote the character the critics will say its this and that about the story but the selling point is the characters eddievenom  its not an avengers or black panther buts its better than thor 2 and both antmans its better than the spiderman 3 the amazing spiderman 12 i left wanting to see more i cannot wait to see the full uncut version
Oct 6 2018,positive,more than what i expected dont listen to the critics they must have watched a different not the best movie ever its far from that but its good entertaining and youll have fun
Oct 6 2018,negative,its very bad the movie would have been with marvels collaboration everything would have changed
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy plays a believable downonhisluck joe with a case of space tapeworms some genuinely funny moments and actually good chemistry breakneck pacing is the movies only flaw would have preferred some more scenes to establish venoms relationship with eddie
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a great movie and it is really funny i would totally recommend going to watch this
Oct 6 2018,positive,great visually too much jokes for the character but still funny i hope the 2nd one is rated r
Oct 6 2018,positive,funny and pretty exciting halfway through
Oct 6 2018,positive,lets appreciate that they made a venom movie is it a perfect movie no there was a few good elements that were good tom hardy did a great job as venom i loved every moment when venom pops out i wished this was more of a rated r movie definitely couldve been calmed the cheesy corny jokes overall the pace of the movie was jumpy
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom as a story flows pretty smoothly and does drag just a bit throughout certain sections but manages to compensate with highly enjoyable eddievenom scenes watching venom fling around enemies and scale buildings were a fanboys dream hardys venom is as close as you can get to perfection even without the spider logo stamped on his chest other aspects like the dialouge and dark humor of certain situations bring justice to the characters tone is lighthearted but still dark critics will rip this movie for being a tonal mess but to the average viewer it doesnt obsruct the movie from being extremely enjoyable as long as you arent highly analytical and nitpicking every detail itll be a fun movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,the people condemning this movie to crappy movie territory arent doing this movie or the audience any favors cinematically the movie could have been better and the back story section was uninteresting however the rest of the movie more than made up for it the movie was an overall fun exciting and enjoyable experience i would gladly see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,had a really fun time id youre a fan of evil dead and zombie land type movies youll enjoy venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was awesome critics are idiots
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was epic pretty sure it would be even better if they didnt remove some scenes but its still really good
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not profound its not ground breaking or even thought provoking however it doesnt need to be fun factor and entertainment are key here venom is funny action packed and well worth the just under 2 hour run time  grab your popcorn go see it on the big screen and enjoy the ride critics these days dont know how to enjoy themselves properly and venom is highly enjoyable cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,duck critics its just a awsome marvel movie   tom hardy love you man 
Oct 6 2018,positive,enjoyable film wouldve been better if was r rated though
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is a good movie slow to start but you will really enjoy the second half
Oct 6 2018,positive,if this was released before the mcu people would have liked it much better i enjoyed it but they really could have done better
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie as per tge special effects goes story is different from the story books which may anger few of comic books fans but deviation are nicely presented
Oct 6 2018,positive,i will protect this movie to my dying day funny and smart and aware of itself tom hardy continues to be wonderful in every role believable villain given we live in a world with elon musk i welcome our symbiote overlords frankly
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was great fun though the symbiote itself was easily the best character  everyone else was meh as a lifelong fan of spiderman and venom as my fav villian i thought it was great to see this version kicking butt if youre not really a fan of the character or familiar with the back story you probably wont get it but give it a chance and dont expect too much and its a riot
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore critics  this movie was absolutely incredible amazing acting from tom hardy he was perfect for the role so well written i loved every second of it go see this even if youre worried about what the critics say seriously you wont be disappointed
Oct 6 2018,positive,really fantastic romp lots of laughs from the audience  a very fun movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was amazing tom hardys performance was fantastic  scriptwriting was also excellent i see sony pictures stole some of the mcus comedic touch lmao
Oct 6 2018,positive,by far the best movie ive seen in a long time i love how they make venom funny like the comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,the script was terrible but hardy nailed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,delivers exactly as promised and left me wanting a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,as part of a different multverse this was an enjoyable movie with my family venom is the kind that has to be understood especially through his history in the comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is fucking cool dont think about critic just watch it
Oct 6 2018,neutral,they gave it a fresh twist to the venom origin so it could stand alone  hardy did a great job and the movie provide a good combination of action and humor  giving the character of eddie brick some depth without erasing his ny history versus the previous horrific attempt to introduce the character  i found it entertaining and look forward to a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie is not as bad as the critics seem to think it is  the beginning was a little rough but once it gets rolling it is entertaining  this isnt like the avengers movies and is much darker but with well placed bits of humor  i wouldnt take a young kid but if you enjoy comic book based movies you should enjoy this as well
Oct 6 2018,positive,it could have been better if it was rated r but the movie was still great there are some flaws though but it wasnt a disappointment to me it was fun and thrilling i loved it
Oct 6 2018,negative,ok this is my opinionreview on this movie    1 its not a total failure but just for the cgi and the special effects nor even a masterpiece for sure mostly its a generic comicbook movie with a lot of action bad and nonsense dialogues and jokes and cgi all over the movie it can easily stand alongside other movies like the more recent micheal bays transformers    2 the writing in this movie is so lame and the plot is highly predictable it develops pretty straightforward with a slow and quite boring first act that actually fails to deliver what is the right motivation behind the characters actions except for eddie brock and his symbiote and speaking of the motivations no real background on the symbiotes is provided and also the reason why eddie brock and venom symbiote decide to stay together and do some good has a more grounded reason in the comics spiderman is that reason but in this movie he is nowhere to be found in the comics it was the common hatred for spiderman and peter parker that forced eddie to bond with the symbiote and it was spiderman that pushed venom to become an antihero in this movie this motivation can be summarized with 1 word survive after the first act the movie becomes an endless stream of heavily cgied scenes that reach their climax of course in the expected since the first trailer final battle between the hero venom and the villain riot riot the classic 1dimensional villain you will remember only for the special effects used to create him but nothing more and i also have to say that speaking of the postcredit scenes well all the rumours about the other main venom villain were totally true no particular twist to mention    3 as many stated the tone of the movie is a real mess when it was announced this movie was supposed to be an horror like comicbook movie they also said they wanted venom to be their own deadpool well it is none of them the closest thing to an horror movie in venom are the symbiotes appearances and some violent actions that however in many scenes are simply teased and speaking of the comedic aspects jesus you can laugh at some jokes but most of them are not funny at all and really play no purpose in the context of the scene like the whedon forced jokes in justice league tom hardy inner dialogues with the symbiote have a comedic vibe but to me this is a problem cause they strip the character from a dramatic aura that a character like eddie brock the one that i knew from the comics at least should have and i agree that a much more serious tone and with the ratedr this movie would have been much more believable    4 speaking about the cast well its pretty obvious that tom hardy is the one and only star of this movie from the start to the final act and this was quite expected since the only thing they had to say to promote this movie was tom hardy is playing eddie brock he is a great actor however in my opinion this is not his best performance he gives his best in his inner dialogues with the symbiote but as i stated previously the comedic tone of those dialogues ruin the eddie brock character the supporting characters riz ahmed riot and michelle williams eddies girlfriend are potrayed by 2 good actors but honestly they do no add anything to the movie especially riot another generic villain would have served the purpose as well    5 if youre a comic book fan you can enjoy the action on this movie and the venom character dreaming that maybe one day you will see him facing spiderman if youre not i dont know so i am waiting to see what the box office will tell us    in the end even if i tried to stay positive about this movie i would say that sony missed once more a great opportunity my vote for this movie 25
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one this was an excellent movie very fun good twists and turns and the ending leads into so many possibilities for more the audience score is accurate the critics are dead wrong on this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,i almost didnt watch this movie because of the critic reviews however i went anyway because of the audience score  i was not disappointed  this movie captivated me from beginning to end  worth the price of admission  i think its getting dissed because spiderman wasnt in it  but its good  venom is the bad guy you get guilty pleasure rooting for
Oct 6 2018,negative,full review 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a fun entertaining movie the first act is kind of slow but it does pay off to giving us more reasons to care about the characters in the film the second act is the best act and tom hardy does a terrific job there is a very good action set piece with good comedy most of the comedy in this film hits it isnt exactly subtle but is perfect for the film the third act is definitely the weakest but it still has some fun over the top action sequences i went into this movie with low expectations because it had a 32 and a pg13 rating despite the rating however they got away with quite a lot the movie was exactly what it was trying to be venom is a ton of fun and is definitely worth checking out
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun movie with some pacing issues looking forward to the directors cut which will hopefully fix that problem
Oct 6 2018,positive,thoroughly entertaining yes the movies has flaws but it is funny and has a good drive no it doesnt follow any of the comic books but hey this must be another marvel parallel universe best part is the venom character very funny though out the film the audience was constantly laughing and so was i
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a really good movie and has potential to be in the mcu
Oct 6 2018,positive,a fantastic movie  action packed great stunts but poor writing couldve have been better a very desperate attempt an attempt to make a villain standalone movie as we are not accustomed to see a villain being sorta hero as a result the movie became childish and funny
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not sure how rotten tomatoes gave such a low score i normally trust rotten tomatoes over my own opinion but not with this movie my wife and decided to give it a try it was an awesome movie i knew full well it wasnt going to match the comics like logan but man im glad rotten tomatoes was wrong overall the movie was fun and funny great combo of action and dialogue we were never bored once i do understand some of the things rotten tomatoes is pointing out in negativity but seriously a 28 you guys need to take a step back and see if you enjoy the movie movie first then go watch it again to pick it apart im going to watch it again with my brother so that he gets a chance to enjoy it give it a try guys you wont wont be disappointed
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went to watch venom not expecting an oscar worthy movie but a one that will provide me with entertainment and venom was just that
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a great film  all the action scenes are intense the characters are fun and interesting and venom provides comic relief at many of times  its just dumb fun even though the story is a little lacking but everything else in the movie is incredible  definitely check this movie out it will please you and your family
Oct 6 2018,positive,every thing i could of wanted from a venom movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this film one of the best marvel films ive ever seen
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know if the critics watched the same movie i did but this was very enjoyable and i feel like it didnt need a stronger tie to spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy was great as venom i was entertained from beginning to end it had great action sequences the story was awesome i hope this turns into a successful franchise
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was excellent it was a perfect stand alonetom hardy was the perfect actor for eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,positive,i almost didnt watch this movie because of the critic reviews this movie is a clear example of why critics are idiots sometimes venom is an amazing movie i love tom hardys portrayal as eddie brock this is such a well executed movie and it proves that you dont necessarily need spiderman to make venom work eddie and venom had hilarious chemistry and i cant wait to see what direction they go in the sequels people complaining that there is no chemistry between eddie and anne have probably never been in a relationship and its obvious that they didnt really pay attention to the film they were probably too busy knitpicking at some of the cgi i think that this was a great introduction for venom and the symbiotes into a cinematic universe the tone the soundtrackscore the humor and the action scenes were all done very well i rarely leave the theater excited about a film venom is one of those films that has me quite eager to see the sequels there is a mid credit scene that will make you audibly cheer if you understand what it means for the sequels i give venom 1010
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went to see venom last night    i think i understand some of the points that various critics have made likely drawing comparisons to the more canonical mcu films    it feels slightly more like late 90searly 00s comic book films perhaps missing some of the finer storytelling points that marvel has integrated into their mcu films    did that ruin the movie for me absolutely not    i loved it    the dialogue between tom hardy and the symbiote was mostly hilarious i along with many of my fellow moviegoers laughed out loud at various points    the comedy aside tom hardy is always a joy to watch onscreen one of the great actors of my generation    the cgi was of course abundant and i wonder if it might not have been better if it had been helmed directly by marvel but i still very much enjoyed it    i would pay to go see it again and i will be purchasing it once its released    tldr      may have been better if helmed by marvel instead of sony   tom hardy was great   loved the movie despite some of the valid naysayer points   worth the movie ticket price
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is similar in humor to the deadpool franchise it was off to a slow start but soon as the voices start its a wild funny ride
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie ive seen in a year or so loved it better than i expected it to be 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed it thoroughly not sure why the low rating
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a very consistent story and a lot of things seemed to happen for no reason but damn it was fun and hilarious
Oct 6 2018,positive,to be honestits worth it to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went in with high expectations and i wasnt disappointed eddie and venoms relationship was the highlight and because this is the origin movie there wasnt enough of them going back and forth i fully expect a sequel to have that relationship full blast for the entire film the venom that they created with this film is more than capable of carrying his own triligy and where his story takes him next is extremely appealing mcu or spiderman or antisony influence will hurt this movie by default unfortunately but i give this movie a perfect rating i just hope that they take a chance and make a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed the movie from start to finish tom hardys portrayal of eddie brock and venom was great    the mix of violence with humor reminded me of the first spiderman movie which lead to the rise in popularity of this film genre  i will see it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,very excited to watch shame about all the negative reviews ive seen lets hope tom hardy can hold his own as the venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was amazing if you love comics and or have any knowledge of venom in the spiderman universe you will enjoy 
Oct 6 2018,negative,pacing was super weird no reference to spiderman during feature couple laughs decent effects but not really worth sitting through
Oct 6 2018,positive,while the story wasnt the best and had a few plot holes tom hardys fantastic performance  with tom hardy was mesmerizing i think they created a character that could slide right into the mcu
Oct 6 2018,positive,im a big spiderman and venom fan i really enjoyed this movie so if you are thinking about going to see this movie you should it is funny and entertaining to watch eddie be almost like a puppet for venom but they still do work together to take down riot if you are a big fan make sure you stay for the end credit scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was much better than what i was told about it and very funny
Oct 6 2018,neutral,venom is a fun yet forgettable popcorn flick led down by its imbalanced tone and poorlywritten script with hardys performance being a sole savior
Oct 6 2018,positive,i highly recommend venom no spoilers    tom hardy is awesome as eddie brock  venom even though they changed the origin story due to legal issues with the spiderman character in movies it was totally awesome and true to what he looks and is like in the cartoon i watched as a kid and in the comics i dont get the so called critics down grading this movie it is a very good movie and a must see also stay for the mid credit scene it teases the sequel that i hope we get as long as you dont mind the change in the origin story you wont be disappointed its a lot of fun im definitely going to see it again definitely way better than the spiderman 3 version im also not giving up hope that they will eventually put either venom in the mcu or bring spiderman back in the sony marvel universe i will be extremely happy either way wearevenom
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is amazing epic and fun i like the relationship between venom and eddie brock and the battle scenes are cool tom hardy did a goof job for venom and cant wait to see  spoiler alert carnage in action for the next venom movie hope it turns out to be an r rating for the next one 45
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure what the critics problem is i really like this movie it kept me entertained
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly its the best movie so  far ive check the reviews  but i dont understand peoples reviews they are useless  watch it and rate it i love it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics got this wrong good movie good marvel humor
Oct 6 2018,positive,found this origin story entertaining and enjoyable enough as i had little background knowledge going in  i wasnt expecting some humor but think they could have done much more overall with an r rating  this wont be the last we see of venom as the conclusion left the audience wanting more and set the future franchise up nicely   amc alist movie 21
Oct 6 2018,positive,once again critics reviews are trash and unreliable story is a little weak but overall it is a fun movie definitely worth seeing in theaters 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great film funny and interesting would definitely recomend
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to rotten tomatoes listen to the people it was intended for
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it the scenes when venom was interacting with eddie were the soul of the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a fun experience if your looking for an entertaining action flick with some silly humor youll enjoy this venom looked dope and tom hardy gave a solid performance recommend a watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was a awesome movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly i strongly disagree with the review from rotten tomatoes it takes alot for me to love a movie but this one i loved it was unpredictable and strayed away from the cheesy acting ive been seeing in recent marvel films usually when you try to put comedy and action and thriller together the comedy is forced and cheesy but in this movie it was so well done the romantic aspect of it wasnt overwhelming and didnt take away from the plot i was on the edge of my seat the whole time i would say this is the movie of the year
Oct 6 2018,positive,my expectations were really low for this since it wasnt going to include spiderman but i was shocked it was fun and the action was there i agree with the audience score the story started slow and it took awhile to get going but once it hit the movie took off and i was a lot happier with it and the ending and afterpre credit bit was fun too 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie tom hardy and venom is the strongest aspect of the film if more attention was given to the development of their friendship and overall more satisfying action then this film would be one of my favourites of the year we need less screen time with the sub par villain and uninteresting supporting cast and more of eddie and venom going back and forth and the great comedic relief that they provide overall i would recommend this film venom looked great on screen and was worth the price of admission alone tom hardy also provided his usual maximum effort performance into this as well give it a try
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was an enjoyable watch the best thing about the movie was the back and forth bickering between tom hardy and venom it was funny and great chemistry with himself weird     the action scenes were decent and get your blood pumping just seeing venom in action and on the big screen is just awesome     all the actors were great imo definitely tom hardy was the star riz ahmed muchelle williams jenny slate and the new boyfriend doctor were all great and committed in their  roles plus the few minutes with woody harrelson in the credits was great     unrelated but the five minute sneak peak of spiderverse at the second end credit of venom was a nice gift
Oct 6 2018,positive,this film truly delivered brilliant performance by tom hardy the interactions between eddie brock and venom were the highlights of the entire film they just feltreal
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing film love the cgi involved throughout and the character really did tell a convincing story couldnt me and my mate being in awe
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a gr8 movie but fun to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed the whole movie it was very good
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun should have more riot action scene
Oct 6 2018,positive,its no dark knight and some characters were somewhat generic and boring however it was still a very enjoyable movie and an amazing performance from tom hardy the plot was about above average but the eddie brock and venom characters were great which compensated enough there were also plenty of hilarious moments between eddie and venom it kind of followed the marvel formula of mixing intense action with comedy i will definitely watch the movie again
Oct 6 2018,positive,must see if you are a venom fan not a groundbreaking movie but a fun flick comparable to spider man 1 for the beginning act where the main characters dont develop into their alter egos yet but when the pace finally picks up  the movie gets good
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great even when you look at it from a comic book reader would watch buy the movie and get posters of it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was the jam very entertaining and i loved the way they put the movie together  idk why ppl are being picky it was actually very good 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was so awesome i loved it the comedic side to the film was hilarious to watch and i was laughing though out the film the action is great the dynamic duo of venom and eddie brocktom hardy was something special not caught on film before a must see film
Oct 6 2018,positive,the beginning is a bit slow while they introduce the characters and story once venom is paired with eddie its very entertaining and a lot of action i loved it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really liked the dynamic relationship between venom and eddie the movie was downright enjoyable and funny
Oct 6 2018,positive,is not a masterpiece but works
Oct 6 2018,positive,purely under rated movieawesome experience
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics get it wrong again  this is a movie venom fans have been waiting for for a long time loved it and would will watch it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie dont listen to the critics go see it for yourselves
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was almost as great as deadpool for me great humor dark content loved it worth the watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie dont analyze it through your view of the comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was pretty dam happy with this movie only complaints are 1 the motorcycle chase was a bit drawn out and the girl who plays the girlfriend just didnt seem to fit she wasnt a super good actress in this movie and her loom was really weird other than that i was very happy with most of the special effects and the plot we couldve seen a little more full blast venum the relationship between eddie and the symbiote was great and tom hardy killed it as always cant wait to see him and spiderman in a film together excited to see this character again 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed tom hardy in this movie he really went for it i enjoyed the relationship between eddie and venom the cinematography was great as well as the effects  i was entertained
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly the movie is not a good movie however as soon as venom is in the film it becomes way more entertaining i didnt go to the movie theater expecting something like logan or tdk i wanted to have fun and be entertained and this movie did just that
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is great yes it has some flaws like every movie but it still tells the story and does it well i believe people were expecting to much from it its not a dark action horror film its a funny buddy cop movie for a spiderman movie without spiderman it does a fantastic job the actors did great the humour was perfectly timed and the fan service was amazing if the review critic who gave this movie a 30 had just even a brief background on venom from the comics they would have enjoyed the movie a lot more ps there are two post credit scenes so sit
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy as venom was amazing he defining nailed it starting of the movie other cast besides tom hardy himself in regard to acting was bland michelle williams hair was awful and her acting was dull the villain without riot was not convincing that hes a bad guy fight scene was amazing easter eggs dont miss it critics will not understand comic book movies since most of them have not picked up a comic book before venom fans must see its worth it better than spiderman 3 venom  comic book movies dont try to win any oscars and comic book fans are just excited to see it in the big screen for as long as there will be a butt kicking fight scenes  not actor that can actually act
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was a fun and entertaining movie really surprised by how poorly the critic scored it the movie shouldve been a little longer and spent a little bit more time on character development not a perfect movie but definitely worth watching on the big screen 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a fun night out some good humour interesting twist to the end credits
Oct 6 2018,positive,lets just start off with the fact that there are some glaring issues in this movie and thats coming from an absolute hardcore venom fan with him being my favorite comic character do i think it deserves a watch oh hell yeah its very enjoyable but ill elaborate a bit on the issues so those that want can read    lets start off with the fact that yes the movie does feel dated and very early 90s is that a bad thing not necessarily but it does jump around a lot so certain scenes arent as flushed out as they could bewhich also lends itself to certain side characters receiving little development  the story is fine its basically a mishmash of what we knew they were basing it off of and it does work but its nothing overly special  and lastly the actioncgi again its fine and rather enjoyable actually but there are fights where it can be very hard to tell whats going on because of how fast it is and certain cuts i can definitely see what some people may say they didnt enjoy it and thats completely fine    all in all id give it an 885 out of ten would definitely recommend but know that its by no means a perfect movie for me it was heavily carried by tom hardy and the symbiotes relationship as well as the intense action
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie enjoyed it all the way through
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was nice and sometime funny venom is awesome the story line can be better but its still a good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie not as bad as critics say
Oct 6 2018,positive,hardy acted great visuals were awesome action packed pretty dang funny one of my top 5 marvel movies 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,not bad but not good
Oct 6 2018,positive,just amazing love the effects
Oct 6 2018,positive,okay clearly im in the minority but i really enjoyed this movie i thought it was funny with an appropriate amount of action scenes i dont know the comic book origin story but i enjoyed the plot line of this one i enjoyed the actors and the special effects i dont buy a lot of movies but i plan on buying this one when it becomes available
Oct 6 2018,positive,very fun and entertaining making it rated r would have been a better choice
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to critics they seem to be brain dead when it comes to reviewing movies lately it was definitely enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,positive,entertaining movie tom hardy proves once again he is a talented and versatile actor 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,it is fine if you go in with no expectation it said this movie is not part of the original mcu world therefore for those that know the history of venom you may not like this version however as stated if you go in with no explanation or dont know the history of venom than maybe you will enjoy it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie a breath of fresh air compared to the sameness of other comic book related movies whos cooler than venom good job sony
Oct 6 2018,positive,i enjoyed venom tom hardy is great and i loved the after credit scenes great start to the fall b
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics or bad reviews this movie is so fun if you liked deadpool this will hit a likeable note  go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie has great action sequences and a great cast of characters but the plot felt rushed and there are some continuity errors through out the movie all and all it is a great movies with minor mistakes
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont understand these horrible reviews lovely movie had a lot of action  a lot of venom and it really gave us a nice look at she venom and some other symbiotic carnage scene could of been better though overall 55 for me

Oct 6 2018,positive,a was awesome  so funny and existing   my opinion  good movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i do not understand the hate for this movie i thought it was a lot of fun to watch i think the shift back and forth between tones comedic and serious helped the movie more than hurt it the banner between eddie and venom was entertaining simply whenever venom was on screen  i was having a blast i really enjoyed tom hardys performance and again the dialogue between him and venom while the script and story wasnt the best or most original i think what they had to work with still managed to be enjoyable plus despite the fact that i would have preferred the movie to be rated r i think they managed to make this type of movie one with a character such as venom work even with the pg13 rating its not perfect but i think the pros greatly outweigh the cons this is a super enjoyable movie that i had a blast watching and simply left me wanting more
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics excellent movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie would see again and again and again
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie is great it has action great dialogue and the comedy is t forced like other super hero movies its a must see movie ignore critics rating and go by see it for yourself you wont be disappointed

Oct 6 2018,positive,movies great and hardy really gave us a great venom loved it and overall just a real good time 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it delivers to the characters fans
Oct 6 2018,positive,very entertaining movie with minor holes that you can work around cant wait for a sequel or to see him on the big screen with spiderman 
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it once again critics are dumb and have no taste
Oct 6 2018,positive,while i was disappointed they didnt go the deadpool route with the rating it is incredible stay to the end all venom fans
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was great you can easily pay full price for the ticket and be happy with what you got fun ride minus a few little things its still a solid movie cant wait for the sequel 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the story was rushed but tom hardys performance is great definitely should have been an r but it still was very enjoyable i can finally rinse my mind from that topher grace mess i will still be seeing this again
Oct 6 2018,negative,tom hardy is great as venom too bad he has to be in such a bad movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought venom was funny had a good connection and wasnt to gory this film is so underrated
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is the best adaptation of venom i have seen the film is not perfect but i found myself ignoring any flaws and just smiling and enjoying myself all the way through i have no idea why people are hating on it so much it left me wanting more
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics expected too much from this movie its solid with two great protagonist i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie tom hardy was great
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was amazing  tom hardy does not disappoint
Oct 6 2018,positive,i know it could have been better but for an introductory film to the series i wasnt dissapointed at all
Oct 6 2018,positive,there was a lot of unnecessary build up in the beginning and a lot of questions that went unanswered throughout the film there were a few lines that didnt match up with what actually happened  other than those few things it was a great movie that had my heart pounding every second
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie definitely recommend it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was afraid the movie was goingto suck big time because of the critics i loved the movie now lets just hope the bluray version will the cut scenes will beeven better
Oct 6 2018,positive,so much fun action and comedy packed film its a movie relax i love the relationship that tom hardy has with venom i want a little venom of my own 
Oct 6 2018,positive,good popcorn movie a lot of puns
Oct 6 2018,positive,my verdict for venom is that its a good movie i enjoyed it very much its not a perfect movie but i liked it and if you like venom you should go see it and there are 2 after credit scenes 
Oct 6 2018,positive,personally dont understand the hate really kinda enjoyed this one a lot
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought they did excellent the film had a good dive into eddies backstory without taking the whole movie to do it although i didnt see them mention his schizophrenia  personal abilitiescredit towards the humansymbiote symbiosis it had just enough action mixed with a great plot and some comedy fighting style  graphics was venom like and didnt disappoint the revision of some of the old comics  maximum carnage on snessega was perfect venom vs everyone watching until after the credits was a nice goose egg too for a future sequel over all i loved the film and want to own it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is a lot better than the critics are giving it credit for sure its not an mcu quality movie when it comes to story but the characters are actually pretty good and tom hardy gives a great performance as both brock and venom 
Oct 6 2018,positive,not the best movie has some issues but was a lot of fun and tom hardy does a great job i dont understand all the negative feedback this movie is getting
Oct 6 2018,positive,what a great movie i think this movie breaks grounds and it just doesnt fit into the format these reviewers expect the movie leaves you guess a little about some details and doesnt even bother to waste time to go into others just to make it more complete which i thought was great instead it just lets the main theme the character of venom unfold in a natural creative and very entertaining way that emerges towards the end and allows the viewers intuition to engage with this rather that have some characters as experts be questioned by some other character to spell story details out for viewers like were all dotards this movie just entertains simple little guestures like a venom beeing questioned about reasons for his is actions by his host to be answered that his host is the reason in one little line lets the viewer contemplate the nature of the merging and define the character themselves magnificent work very entertaining a lot of professional critics have lacked imagination or been so accustomed to norms and expectations they have failed to grasp this movie is beyond thier little box of thinking while us views have kicked back and really enjoyed this movie fantastic
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are a joke as usual movie was 
Oct 6 2018,negative,the story line fell flat 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i actually loved the movie yes there were some parts that didnt make sense and i can see why it got low ratings but we all enjoyed it and it was funny bonus love tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is different than other marvel movies and i liked it it has some flaws but it is a decent movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,youve got this one all wrong rotten tomatoes critics the people have spoken 89 to 31 please explain
Oct 6 2018,positive,saw the movie at premier and i have to be honest it was epic cant wait for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,every thing about this movie was hella good and u haters are gone hate over is movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,pretty good movie  not great  but it is worth seeing in theaters super excited to see hardy and holland soon we are venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,definitely would benefit from its original r rating and likely would benefit from having its full cut however despite these studio flaws it is an entertaining movie and tom hardy plays the role well the best part of the movie is venoms personality and how he it interacts with characters
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite the bad reception of the movie i actually really enjoyed venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,fuck the negative nancys this movie was a great watch   the character of eddie brock played by tom hardy was great and venom was surprisingly relatable and stealed the show
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was not bad  rotten tomatoes i appreciate your feedback on movies but i do not understand your logic on how you rate movies
Oct 6 2018,positive,excellent acting good effects as well as dynamic and amazing humor the poisonbrock interaction is the best part of the movie p s  one of the best superhero movies ever
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it
Oct 6 2018,negative,the good venom looks spot on the bad everything else the final fight scene between venom and riot is a big blur with lots of camera shaking the movie seemed short the story was ok the origin part was cool everything else was terrible tom hardy was decent the whole movie felt like a b movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie straight to the point and not over doing it eddie brock and venom are the best tag team
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics got it wrong its a good one
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom isnt the greatest movie of all time it has errors at the script or at the villian but tom hardy makes a great job as eddie brock and also for venom take this movie as the iron man 1 of sony  this is just the beggining give a second chanche to sony and may be they would give us something better
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was very entertaining great performances solid script with great pacing and it was quite funny another movie where the critics are out of touch with the general audience ever since the last jedi the critics have lost me im looking forward to seeing venom again and in his next movie we were in a packed imax and everyone else loved it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the worst part about this movie was how quickly the credits rolled in and when the cinema lights came on a mix of action comedy and talented story tellers you cant go wrong dont take the hate so seriously lighten up and give it a go one rotten tomato shouldnt spoil the bunch
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom by no means hits a home run a though it very well could have but make no mistake it most certainly does not strike out more like a single that eventually scores a run this showing deserves a sequel that could potentially be truly great 
Oct 6 2018,positive,not a true venom movie but tom hardys performance alone is a good enough reason to go see this he was fantastic and deserves to continue playing this character hopefully with a better script for the next one
Oct 6 2018,positive,very fun albeit flawed movie but would definately watch again makes you forget about the god awful topher grace venom finally
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a great movie my friends and i were making fun of the eddies gf who jumped to a new man saying shes nasty blah blah blah there were funny moments and even action packed moments with the balance of comedy between eddie and venom especially when eddie had no clue what was going on in one of the fight scenes   these bad reviews are petty attempts to make this movie flop just because it wasnt originally ment for spiderman oh and i hope they make a second movie carnage is gonna be boss  my only complaint is that the movie was too short
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was good i dont understand why people hated it so much it was really funny and entertaining i would definitely watch this movie over and over again
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is one of the best characters of the marvel comics
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics i can see why they called it disjointed and poorly written the storyline wasnt completely developed true but if you walk into this movie with the mindset of the world thats being built for the sony spidey universe venom is an awesome character to start this off   where critics see the lack of perfection in storyline tempo of screenplay and development of characters everyday people will see another badass unique marvel character to be a fan of i feel like the pros of this character finally getting a solo movie and having an amazing actor to portray it far outweigh the cons  venom is a beast and tom hardy carries this unhinged antihero like a pro
Oct 6 2018,positive,way better then the reviewers are saying i went with 5 other people and no one could believe how it got those low of ratings its funny it has action and is a great set up for more tomorrow hardy was great really recommend go seeing it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this movie in my opinion it did the characters of venomeddie justice there were a few small details i wasnt a huge fan of but overall its a solid film and good fun looking forward to more venom definitely go check it out
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of the best movies sony has made by far and is a must see for any fans of the character
Oct 6 2018,positive,the audience score tells the story customers are not gonna see venom for quality acting customers are gonna watch it for cool fighting scenes and fun commentary its a superhero movie its gonna be a little cheesy but honestly the acting isnt even that bad definitely would recommend if youre looking for entertainment
Oct 6 2018,positive,its apparent that the gap between the critical reception and audience reception continues to widen with this film  my girlfriend a friend and myself thoroughly enjoyed this movie  the pacing was just right never felt slow the effects turned out better than expected and the performances by the lead cast was on point with some genuine chemistry present especially between tom hardy and michelle williams  as a side note the midcredits scene has me excited for the sequel they set up  hopefully theyll get tom hollands spiderman in crossing over soon i think the two toms would have great chesmistry on screen
Oct 6 2018,positive,whole family loved it full of action comical parts and a dark scenes that had you on the edge of our seat cant wait to see the next one 
Oct 6 2018,positive,its an awesome movie and he give a more taste
Oct 6 2018,positive,slow start but the action and humour in the second half was brilliant   just wish that half didnt feel so rushed   tom hardy did an amazing job though  would definitely be keen to watch a second film  especially if sony take on the feedback of this first one
Oct 6 2018,positive,better then i expected 
Oct 6 2018,positive,really fun movie as to expect with most marvel movies dont listen to the critics would watch a again action packed funny and really likable cast however slow to start off with but thats about it
Oct 6 2018,positive,a really good and interesting movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,absolutely brilliant
Oct 6 2018,positive,one of 2018s best tom hardy displayed excellent range as the inquisitive and conflicted brock and managed to humanise and fully characterise the venom symbiote as an independent entity riz ahmeds carlton drake was chilling and charismatic with intelligent dialogue and a morally ambiguous but logically sound motive even if the script has him forget about riots disappearance 5 minutes after the ship crashlands fight scenes are well choreographed if a little lacking in graphic lethality that logan and deadpool benefited from and a sequel with carnage will demand and at times featuring slowmotion that verges on gratuitous in its use not quite as smooth as snyder does it so go lighter next time original score captures dark undertones and brocks love of his role as the lethal protector but makes the deafening and random use of mumblerap following the title reveal seem even more out of place essentially venom is a wellacted wellwritten and fastpaced comic book movie without the familyfriendly appeal of marvel and without the deeper thematic storytelling of snyders bvs or man of steel this would slot right in with the amazing spiderman and its a shame it  cant but venom with a cast as passionate as they are about the franchise deserves a sequel to really let hardy and harrelson play in
Oct 6 2018,positive,i expected this movie to be crap it looked cheesy and cheap i loved it it was fun i didnt care that spiderman was missing and tom hardy is on point cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are nuts go and see this film its such a great ride venom has always been one of my favorite villains and ill go to sleep tonight knowing it was done well hardy is fantastic the people bashing the movie either a dont know the comics or b had already decided they disliked the movie before they saw it 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,act 1 is just eddie brock walking around act 2 contain some fun act 3 is just a rush to get the film to end
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movies was not goat but it was very entertaining not sure where the critics are coming from but i personally enjoyed it very much i hope the next is at least rated r
Oct 6 2018,positive,i have no idea what version of the movie the critics saw it starts off slow and as far as comic following it does a decent job of grabbing and mentioning things from different sagas if your looking for the traditional spiderman venom transformation ill spare you some time dont see it if your a fan of the character like me and have read other comics of venom then this movie is for you hardy absolutely is perfect for this role sony nailed the venom fighting style his humor and his bickering with eddie to do as he pleases do not go by the critics score this movie is at 35 at the very least go judge for yourself you wont be disappointed
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome go watch it now
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was great they will make up on the next one in areas this one lacked
Oct 6 2018,positive,fuck the critics  this film is great fun and an absolute blast go watch it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this was actually good film i dont know what the critics were taken
Oct 6 2018,negative,messy bizarre but ultimately pretty bland venom doesnt bring anything special to an overcrowded genre strange acting choices and a bythenumbers story left me bored its not a legendary failure its just plain forgettable
Oct 6 2018,positive,i honestly really enjoyed it only issues are that i feel that it would have been better if it was r rated also the final fight was a bit short and chaotic and hard to follow but apart from that i thoroughly enjoyed
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had an absolute fun and amazing time watching this movie it was terrific
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it the audience around me clapped and laughed so fuck the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought this was a good movie and it needed to be rated r but still amazing movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,feel like i watched a different movie than some other reviews part comedy part horror part action venom has a confusing tone but ultimately works for me the scenes with venom were grungy dark and satisfying first hour was a long buildup but i felt connected to eddie brock cgi was excellent and effects were incredible overall i feel that while venom will be misunderstood if was more than worthwhile and put a smile on my face through the whole night
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun i didnt expect it to be that entertaining and easy to watch great acting
Oct 6 2018,positive,actually had no intention to watch venom the trailers made it look like another amazing spiderman kind of bad movie which wouldve been unimaginative and boring but then some reviews came out saying that the movie was catwoman bad or early 2000s superhero movie bad after that i got intrigued and i watched it    while theres certainly a lot of stuff to criticise about venom im actually going to praise it a bit to me the movie was certainly not catwoman bad it had some unintentional humor and the venom you see in this movie is not the venom or eddie brock you know from the comics but its a more faithful adaptation than catwoman    secondly this movie is not even amazing spiderman bad because this movie at least manages to be a venom movie the movie focuses on venom all the way and its not secretly a sinister six prologue or something like that but the story does go all over the place and its not structured well    we have an introduction of eddie brock and his life and at one point the movie just suddenly jumps to six months later which is a bad screenwriting thing because it immediately clarifies that the first 15 to 20 minutes we saw dont even really matter to the movie the only thing it does is show us a side of eddie brock that s different than the eddie brock we see in the rest of the movie the six months later bit also doesnt really make sense because the story kicks off with someone contacting eddie brock six months after he was a relevant guy why would anyone contact this bum he is now as their first big move he should at least be plan f at this point in his life    the bad guys plan also keeps shifting throughout the movie which is very confusing and michelle williams unfortunately wasnt needed in this movie at all   but whenever venoms on screen the movie becomes pretty entertaining or whenever eddie brock and the symbiote are interacting with each other it gets cool and interesting its everything around them that doesnt really work    its a run of the mill superhero movie thats decent and watchable but nothing truly great    also sony did it again they put the last scene of the movie in the trailer again  why do you keep doing this sony marketing people
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved this movie from start to finish very dark and it can only get darker
Oct 6 2018,positive,i want to give this movie 5 stars but it lacks the expectation of what viewers are going to expect i get this production is not part of the marvel mcu but the iconic venom comes with a high standard there is so much high potential it also seemed strikingly similar to watching the movie upgrade
Oct 6 2018,positive,we thought this was very funny and entertaining dont listen to the cranky critics get through the first bits and then the symbiotichuman antics are totally worth the price of admission
Oct 6 2018,positive,definitely not as bad as the critics make it out to be it was actually a very good film my parents and girlfriend and i were laughing a lot of the time
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont believe the critics its actually a really good movie its not 1010 but it will keep you entertained throughout
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was great  tomatometer reviews are wrong trust me it was great than black panther and i am superfan of marvel so i am telling true u must watch this
Oct 6 2018,positive,pleasantly surprised by this film after seeing the critics poor response to it i am a long time fan of venom as a character and as much as this movie could definitely better it is not nearly as bad as the critics would have you believe i hope this character gets another chance with tom hardy in a sequel or fingers crossed a crossover with tom hollands spiderman
Oct 6 2018,positive,very entertaining watch doesnt deserve that critic score
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom isnt sated of action scenes and watchs  in one breath recommended
Oct 6 2018,positive,wow this was a nonstop fast moving ride that entertained with stimulating visuals witty one liners and incredible lead acting from tom hardy for the writers to give such a distinctly alien yet strangely relatable personality to a gooey parasite must have been challenging but they pulled it off venom is one of my favorite characters and im so glad to see him given a proper cinematic presentation cant wait for the sequel where hardy will be able to go against an actor with the onscreen presence and prowess of harrelson and hopefully will give more room for michelle williams to stand out as well i absolutely loved this film and think you will too
Oct 6 2018,positive,worth it to go see   ignore the critics    this is a love story a story of annihilation of power of the loser of mental illness of poverty of corrupt streets of business tycoons of bachelorhood of true carnivores of friendship of dedication of boundaries of redemption of jealousy and of pride within oneself     a lot of work went into this movie it is not as vapid as the critics present it     also a lot of great work from both cgi guys and live effects people went into this    great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,engaging from start to finish loved how they developed the relationship between brock and venom could have stood for more character development on both brock and venom but overall loved the speed of the film and the instensity from minute one youre on the edge of your seat
Oct 6 2018,positive,just got out the cinema seeing this and honestly do not see the hate for it its great go in with expectations of fun and youll get it  hope they can do the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved this filmsurpassed expectations truly a fun filled journey tom hardy was perfection
Oct 6 2018,positive,it may not be the best marvel film ive ever seen but it was more than okay i liked it it was entertaining although it was badly written here and there all in all it has its flaws but still a good movie i dont feel like that it should be rotten by score would watch again
Oct 6 2018,positive,heckin great dont see what all the hates about who cares if spidey aint in it it was a great movie with spidey or not
Oct 6 2018,positive,i watched venom last night with my 9 year old son hes a huge spidey fan and venom is his favorite villain i thought the movie was good to really good my son absolutely loved it his favorite movie of the year i found the chemistry lacking a bit between hardy and williams slate and ahmed were really good however the humor worked for both me and my son throughout the action scenes were pretty awesome my son was riveted id give the movie a 4 my son a 5 or more if he can thus the 45 best version of venom on the big screen to date i really dont get the hate from the critics but for me if they dont hate on a scifi comic movie thats usually where theres an issue
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a very good movie loved it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,is is a good movie oh god no but is it a fun movie no doubt 
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good movie i really want to watch it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,great introduction movie tom hardy played eddie brock perfectly
Oct 6 2018,positive,nowhere near as bad as the critics are making out its a decent film with a few flaws the relationship between eddie and venom is a funny and interesting highlight that really saves the film i felt it suffered from a bit of dcitis before eddie gets infected where certain parts of the story werent explained enough after that it picks up the final fight scene is pretty dull and hard to follow and i felt this film would have been better suited to a higher age rating and a bit of blood and guts overall we enjoyed it easily worth a 6 or 7 out of 10
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing movie loved every second of it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,definitively an acquired taste with the brand of dark comedy the movie uses though for those who like dark comedies this is a damn entertaining buddy action comedy cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not a amazing movie but is funny and interesting
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is awesome tom hardy is again proved himself marvels best antihero film
Oct 6 2018,positive,i do t know what these critics talking about but it was really good 
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont let all the terrible reviews sway you from seeing this its a good start for sony after the first 15ish minutes of backstory it was great you can tell they had a hard time trying for the r rating at first and finding the balance between humor and dark its not perfect but the venomeddie dialogue combo is awesome hardys performance was great he went all in as a crazy infected dude critics need to chill and just let people enjoy it for what it is a good movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome action packed comic book movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,im gonna give this movie a 5 even though they cast michelle williams quite possibly her worst role ever i love tom hardy that much 
Oct 6 2018,positive,a bit ridiculous but fun interesting that they used the word kryptonite in a marvel movie campy awesomeness
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite reading too reviewers and top critics bad ratings i went to see this film the first minutes of mr hardys screentime felt off in a kind of way hardy felt kind of uninterested but as this film went on i started to like hardys character more and more after a few moments in he felt like the perfect character to play venom as the movie went on it had the reverse effect of suicide squad the film started off meh and the more i watched the more i loved hardys role as venom and the film itself the humour is dark the story got me hooked i loved the chemistry with venom and hardy the humour is dark i do respect peoples opinion but i am starting to distrust critics now they are lying so much i have missed many great movies the latest year because of the critics they are not doing their jobs at all it is not only me who thinks like this most people i have met says the same that the critics are untrustworthy glad i did not listen to them this time i loved the movie and i hope to see more venom with hardy he is perfect for this role
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont believe the reviews this was extremely entertaining the dialogue between eddie and venom stole the show maybe a scene or two this was sub par but over all absolutely worth seeing 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this wasnt the best movie ever made but i went in wanted to be entertained and thats just what this did i enjoyed every moment of it it has action horror elements and comedy it all mixed in so well in my opinion hoping this leads to a sequel or maybe even tom holland meeting this version of venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was great was missing a few elements but otherwise an enjoyable movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie best antihero yet 
Oct 6 2018,positive,good solid story funny and loaded with good cgi 
Oct 6 2018,positive,truly i do not see why anyone would rate this movie less than 3 contrary several reviews i read it does not take half of the mpvie before we see venom it takes about 45 minutes is that longer than wed like sure but that is the price we pay for a traditional origin story the acting was amusing  though some lines and emotes fell flat but i wouldnt say it hurt the movie significantly the fight scenes were great and only left you wanting more the relationship between venom and brock is reminiscent of deadpools inner voices in his game or comics which was heavily amusing as far as the attachment to spiderman or lack thereofthis movie stood well enough on its own that you can easily accept it for what it is my main hope is that there will be a directors cut released for gore and more scenes all of that said despite the pg 13 rating the violence was satisfying    i encourage anyone to see itjudge it for yourself and ignore the professional critics especially considering the disparity between their ratings and the audiences
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyed it not a perfect movie by any means but it does the character justice
Oct 6 2018,positive,it had some issues with pacing and the script could have been better but if you are a venom fan you will enjoy it great call backs from the comic fantastic cgi and tom hardy nails the role of eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,negative,terrible film  the director should be embarrassed  a waste of time and money  what was sony thinking   did they read the script
Oct 6 2018,positive,those lady gaga fans were wrong what helped me enjoy this film were my low expectations the beginning is quick to the point then the pace of the 1st actl slows down a lot however it picks up afterwards quite nicely what really stands out is how this movie was given the wolverine treatment venom like wolverine tears his enemies apart and bites heads off yet thanks to the pg13 rating it either obscures the gore or cuts away from it while some parts feel rushed obviously scenes were cut the dynamic between eddie and venom kept me entertained i as a comic book fan rejoiced at the fact that this didnt end up being a turd whether in the wind or not its not a turd
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie the reviewers are wrong here i like marvel going a bit darker for this atom hardly was absolutely excellent
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are way off on this one venom stuck tot he comic books in all the best ways and did great without needing another superhero to make venom look good action plot comedy and great acting came together amazingly tom hardy played his role perfectly sure there were cheesy moments or parts they could have changed but overall a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the critics actually very enjoyable if you dont take it too seriously we laughed a lot a bit predictive if you already watched 1 or 2 films of this genre it is fun to watch tom hardy in it and he did a good job although he is not very convincing as a looser pretty solid and entertaining movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,another way to look at the infamous villan new perspective new point of view to judge from and a lot of deadpoolesque comedy scenes the dynamic between hardy and venom is very cherming too a fun movie for comic book fans dont let bad reviews get in the way of seeing the film
Oct 6 2018,negative,absolutely awful a disjointed failed attempt to keep up with the mcu tom hardy is the worst actor on the planet
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is definitely worth a watch too many fake reviews out there to judge it its one of those movies that you go with your gut feeling see it for yourself
Oct 6 2018,positive,way better than critics are saying and defiantly a go see its way better the any of the new dc movies by no means is it a perfect movie or as good as any of the new marvel films still enjoyable and hardy brings a great performance 
Oct 6 2018,positive,everyone seems to be moaning i myself enjoyed the film this is just the begining
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved the movie the back and forth dialogue between eddie and venom was great tom hardy is amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing movietom hardy successfully makes a venomverse
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great in my mind they did a great job bring the true venom to life here
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was entertaining and funny i really enjoyed it
Oct 6 2018,positive,pretty good i think it was a bit slow because they need to tell you the beginning on how everything becomes what it is i would recommended it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is by no means a perfect or great movie the main issue is the lack of one certain direction and a weak first half    once venom and eddie really get there chance to connect the movie feels completely different i feel like if they would have focused more on the buddy cop connect between venom and eddie this would be the movie i wanted     to me it felt like i was reading a venom comic they are fast loose corny and just an over all blast the weak first act take you out of the experience but overall they do a great job of trying to bring you back in
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure why the critica hated it solid movie solid story and solid acting would have been great to connect to the the real spider man movies tobey ones 15 years late for sony i hope they can still do something about it
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was really good the voice of venom was spot on funny and creepy at the same time lots of action i cant wait for the second one and i hope many more will come after  
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked it  tom hardy and michelle williams did great i hope tom hardy gets a sequel where he gets more creative freedom 
Oct 6 2018,positive,good story funny action we need the second one postcredit scenes were awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,bad editing really bad and bad script i can see why critics are giving it 31 percent not a marvel quality movie but its a lot of fun towards the end 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought the movie was good and this adds to the reason why i dont care what critics think i look at the audience score 
Oct 6 2018,positive,theres some pacing issues and a somewhat lackluster script but i still really enjoyed venom and had alot of fun watching it i really hope he and tom holland spidey meet someday because that would be epic
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun movie to watch but u hated the villain
Oct 6 2018,positive,some of the pacing was weird it was a little slow in the beginning and some of the comedy fell flat but otherwise it was a pretty good time id definitely watch it again and it set up a lot of potential for sony to do more with the character im impressed and actually refreshed that they finally did something creative and it worked well ton hardy gave his best and it paid off
Oct 6 2018,positive,personally it was refreshing the ending couldve been a little more thought out r rating wouldve helped out too but it can redeem itself if they cooperate with marvel more and not rush a sequel 
Oct 6 2018,positive,had a blas at this movie action scenes were really good cant wait for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie and was a nice change up from the traditional super hero movie only request they make a rated r version 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a very good movie with only minor flaws but it is definitely worth watching
Oct 6 2018,positive,another marvel classic even though its mostly sonys movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it dont understand the bad reviews it was funny dark and just plain good action unsure what people were expecting carnage makes an introduction in the end cant wait for venom ll glad i ignored the critics and watched it anyway i like tom hardy as an actor loved watching the dialogue between the alien and brock it built the character made you like them as imperfect as they are
Oct 6 2018,positive,a fantastic movie hilarious and well executed in a world where every marvel film not in the mcu are panned its no surprise to see such a low critic rating even thought this film is superior to many of the mcu movies its a must see and a great performance by tom hardy cant wait for a sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,this isnt sophies choice or band of brothers  and it is not trying to be its a superhero movie about a couple losers who are much better together super even
Oct 6 2018,positive,its an awesome film  dont believe the tomato metre rating fine
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are full of shit  venom is an excellent blend of comedy and action just like the comics  tom hardy is an amazingdedicated actor and that is proven by his acting in this movie doing the voice of both eddie brock and venom as well as making sound clear and onpoint  only concern is the chemistry between tom hardy and michelle williams in the beginning its cute but half way through its weird and we just dont know whats going on   riz ahmed is a star in this movie as he is not your typical bad guy but instead puts a lot of effort and cares about the role hes playing as hes always changing his attitude instead of just staying the same and basic  overall this movie is a joy to watch and it teaches you to not believe in what every critic says but to have your own opinion and feeling about a movie  810
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont understand the critical reviews this was a great movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was good movie i dont understand why these professionals are so salty abt it
Oct 6 2018,positive,the story is a bit weak but the comedy was on point im hoping in the next installment we get to see the comedy pushed harder
Oct 6 2018,positive,is this movie perfect not be any means is this movie enjoyable of course it was i think people get way too over analytical when they look at movies and forget to have fun which is certainly achievable with this movie very funny very over the top very awesome go into the movie with an open mind and be ready to laugh
Oct 6 2018,positive,its not your everyday superheroe movie venom gives moviegoers a glimpse of what venom is all about even though spider man is not in it it tells a logical origin of how the movie handles venom without the webslinger sometimes the plot contradicts itself twice or more there are some scenes that dont make sense because 40 minutes were cut but it doesnt take away of how entertaining the movie is i recommend this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics bash to easy on a entertaining movie like this oneyoull get your moneys worth and enjoy a fun action anti hero movie that i hope we can support to get sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie  its hard to explain what makes this movie both bad and great  tom hardy gives a phenomenal performance and even though the chemistry between the lead couple was pretty weakmichelle williams gave a good performance as well  but the meat of the cake really comes from venom and tom hardy  alsoevil elon musk was as generic as a toast with pbj
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure why the critic rating is so low this was way better than spider man homecoming great movie and i loved the relationship between eddie and venom
Oct 6 2018,negative,some interesting action but mostly boring too predictable what a waste of good actors
Oct 6 2018,positive,much better than i expected
Oct 6 2018,positive,im not sure what critics were expecting but it was the exact kind of movie i was hoping for and i was actually impressed with the action sequencesminus the symbiote cgi mess at the endbut honestly that is the only negative i have about this film venom is brilliant just the right amount of campiness and the best sony adaptation since spiderman 2 if youre the least bit interested i highly recommend 
Oct 6 2018,neutral,all the people rating this very highly are being very generous with rating however most of the people rating it very low or bashing it are being very stingy id like to make it clear the movie was pretty mediocre if you are expecting a good film however if you go into this movie with low or little expectations you can actually end up enjoying this movie for what it is better than a lot of the really bad superhero movies but not necessarily a good one either   go in with low expectations and youll have an ok or even a fun time however if you expect something great to come out of this movie youll be disappointed   this is why i have to give it a 25 its not a good movie but i personally enjoyed the film as i came in expecting it to be the dumpster fire sony normally pumps out and was pleasantly surprised instead
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is a good entertainment movie he is not perfect but pretty good i was amused by the acting game of tom hardy eddie and venom dialogs are very fun venom is a film with a very strong interesting and even cheerful central antihero
Oct 6 2018,positive,the first 30 minutes is a bit slow but its a fun ride after that i really enjoyed venom and hope to see it again took my 9 year old and he loved it too an r rated director cut  blu ray release would be awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thaught it was awesome some really nice fight scenens and some really funny moments awesome movie i will buy it when it comes out
Oct 6 2018,negative,fantastic movie venoms cgi is some of the best cgi ive ever seen in film dont listen to the critics folks because they just seem to hate any comic book film that isnt done by disney just like the dc films it has a good story great action and a slightly darker atmosphere than typical mcu films seriously go and see venom guys particularly if you really hated tropher graces venom in spiderman 3 than definitely go see this because tom hardy without doubt does the character justice this time  my only drawback with this film is that venom doesnt get his powers through spiderman and i think this film would have benefited from doing a spiderman where benom is the antagonist prior to doing his standalone film where hes an antihero but other than that the film was awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,the first act sets up the film in a very ham fisted way with certain moments feeling jarring and rushed as the film progresses the movie starts to find a decent pacing for the most part with some genuinely great moments especially the mask copy action sequence as the film works towards wrapping up it again starts to feel quite rushed and the ending doesnt come off as satisfying as it could have been heres hoping an extended or directors cut becomes a reality in the future worth a watch overall
Oct 6 2018,positive,freaking amazing and so enjoyable dont believe what the critics say this movie was what it should be and you will definitely enjoy every moment
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is awesome i laughed at this more than deadpool easily my new favourite super hero and tom hardy was perfect
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know why the critics bash this movie is it just because its made by sony it is an amazing movie ill give it 7510
Oct 6 2018,positive,well i think the only problem is the story goes really slow other than that i really like it i like venom for making a scary movie with a little jokes on it
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie love the venom talking to brock 
Oct 6 2018,positive,we liked the movie and it delivered what wed expected highly enjoyed tom hardy and his dialogue with this alien that has overtaken him i dont understand why these critics beat up on some movies its not supposed to be high brow and isnt thank god for the regular folks reviewing cause theres so many funny and silly movies wed skip if we listened to the critics  we felt it stayed pretty true to the comic book version of venom yes venom bites off some heads as another reviewer said  but hes an anti hero so hes both good and bad at the same time make sure to stay to the end of the credits 
Oct 6 2018,positive,perfectly depicts the villain that is venom ton hardy played this role masterfully it had a beginning a satisfying climax and resolution does it miss spiderman only a little bit start slow like many origin stories but it does pick up in a big waayyy is it fun definitelythe dark tone works stay after the credits for 2 previews
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into the film yesterday with the lowest expectations possible i was blown away i watch almost all marvel films in theatres and most of them dont come close to being as entertaining as this film venom has stunning visuals and a great dynamic between venom and eddie brocktom hardy who also does a great job of portraying this movies adaptation of eddie brock i understand there are problems so i deducted half a star is it incredibly creative no however it is a fantistic superhero movie and i would definitely recommend watching it a side not if you go soon you can get a neat little venom comic which is a great touch
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie not what i expected at allin a good way 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie the fight sequences can be better but still are great   tom hardy shines as eddie brock and riz ahmed too   the first half is considerably better than the last half as it feel like a horror adventure movie the movies cgu could improve but still it is a great idea with not so great execution but i love it just because of tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie tom hardy is venom venom is the kind of best friend we all want haha
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie funny and entertaining the whole time 
Oct 6 2018,positive,watched it today with my boyfriend it was funny challenging traditional movies was full of action and had interesting characters character are respected regardless of their gender there were variety of people with different backgrounds included i appreciated the psychology of this movie bringing up ethical guidelines in experimentationthere is a character that shows psychopathy behavior we tend to associate those individuals as just murders and are obvious to spot but spoiler alert  this person actually fits what an actual psychopath is actually like charming successful and subtly manipulative shows no remorse and doesnt process it rather than knows what they are doing but doesnt care i recommend the main guy is an great character btw
Oct 6 2018,positive,just felt off actors and director couldnt decide what type of movie it would be
Oct 6 2018,positive,i wish it was a bit longer actually but all in all tom hardy once again did an amazing job ready for part 2 
Oct 6 2018,positive,an amazing movie idk about the critics but this movie is fun and it takes you to the action but its rush fast af but its good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really dont know what the critics where watching but this movie is awesome the action is amazing and tom hardy killed his performancethe dynamic between him and venom is funny as hell it definitely has issues and isnt as perfect and well written as a film like thor ragnarok like i feel that after the first 20 is when the movie starts picking up but its definitely very entertaining and i highly recommend it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,as a big venom comic book fan i was being a bit skeptical about this movie after the first trailers and sneak peaks still as a fan i decided to watch it in the premiere though it had some plot holes and some fast phasing here and there the origin story was still done pretty good with out spiderman tom hardy made an awesome portrayal of eddie brock and it kinda reminded me of the good old lethal protector comic book lines eddie also special effects team made a good job with the symbiote making it look real and actually made him appear more than 30 seconds krhm spiderman 3
Oct 6 2018,positive,this isnt the same vemon we grew up watching and reading this is a wonderful new take on the character great action great acting the only beef my wife and i has was the spaceship in the beginning a d michelle williams  voice other than that it was great i would highly recommend it  if your want to see a new take
Oct 6 2018,positive,a great movie lots of fun just ignore the bad reviews and go watch it in the theaters and see for yourself
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics made it seem like the movie was just complete trash the movie isnt amazing but i enjoyed it a lot
Oct 6 2018,positive,was good movie fck the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,freakin awesome movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was a lil slow but when picks its very intense worth the watch happy got to see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,lots of critics will say the movie had no direction wether its a comedy movie or something more serious but all in all it was ridiculously fun the movie had its own style of venom but stuck with the main stuff from previous movies sound affects the simbiote dies without a host could kill host etc the story line even goes as far to explain venom even more indepth and delivers good lines even when you dont see venom i wasnt the biggest fan of venom before seeing this but now i appreciate the character more not to mention the graphics and cgi were fenimonal venom looked scary good and tom hardiest acting was fenominal and the movie was hilarious
Oct 6 2018,positive,its actually better than what you expect it to bedont trust the critics because theyre stupid
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics definitely got this one wrong it was a blast from beginning to end tom hardy gives an excellent performance of course as eddie brockvenom i really enjoyed it dont skip this movie just because the critics are saying its bad go see it and form your own opinion
Oct 6 2018,positive,my only complaint is the cgi could look better otherwise i enjoyed the movie and had a good time
Oct 6 2018,positive,not sure what the critics deal is with such a low rating our family 12 and up thoroughly enjoyed watching venom and tom hardy is yummy its a winner for us 
Oct 6 2018,positive,thrilling and utterly amazing cgi plot was good and set up very nicely for sequels that are planned dont listen to the biased critic reviews
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was a great superhero flick which really captured the venom character the low reviews on here are absolutely crazy everyone i have spoken to about this movie has thoroughly enjoyed it id happily pay to go see it again and cant wait for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,its great i honestly thought they were going to fk it up but no venoms relationship with eddie is hilarious the comedy is intentional the pacing was great the film felt really short despite being 2 hours and thats a sign of good pacing it was a lot of fun i highly recommend seeing it
Oct 6 2018,positive,we are venom a must see
Oct 6 2018,positive,writing is bad michelle williams wears the absolute worst wig otherwise its not bad at all
Oct 6 2018,positive,great dont listen to the critics it was amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome character hardy was great williams is miscast film is a good watch romance be tween venom and brock was a missed opportunity venom 2 has huge potential skipping spiderman link was an excellent move that can and should come later
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom is funny special effects and action are breathtaking but the film could be better and could have fewer mistakes in the story but i recommend it to anyone who wants to watch because the film in general is not as bad as they say
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to those stupid critics movie is awesome and tom hardy nailed the role a must watch if youre a venom fan
Oct 6 2018,positive,the first act might be a bit of a bore but as soon as venom comes into the picture this movie becomes a thrill ride is it a messy ride with some poor editing and design flaws yes but i still found it damn better than other superhero movies such as thor 2 and hulk    venom is entertaining with some messy fight scenes that are hard to follow and some poor writing but it still got a few laughs out of me and kept me interested for the entire second act predictable as it was i would be totally on board should this version of the venom characters make its way into the mcu for some symbiotespidey action     tom hardy was great and i feel most critics are setting their standards too high a fun watch for any average movie goersuperhero enthusiast
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was funny and entertaining there was one plot thing that i had an issue with but not enough to ruin the movie if you just want something a little off kilter and different from regular marvel movies this is right up your alley 
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont believe the critics this film is great tom is fantastic it however is a little slow to start but soon picks up the pace very enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,positive,such a fun movie to watch exceeded my expectations after seeing the critics score but this ended up being one of the funnest comic book movies ive seen in awhile 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know which venom movie the critics watched the one i did was amazing the venomeddie relationship is hilarious tom hardy is not human
Oct 6 2018,positive,surprisingly funny and unique
Oct 6 2018,positive,do not listen to the critics this movie was fantastic well written and the humor was great tom hardy was awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,enjoyed every part of the movie for me it was a perfect blend over humor and action
Oct 6 2018,positive,i liked it a must see for everz venom fan the onlz point is that it was told a little bit hastz thez should take a little bit more time to tell the story seeing forward to see the second film
Oct 6 2018,positive,very fun and funny movie its pretty dope
Oct 6 2018,positive,just pure fun not the greatest or deepest movie ever but a fun time with tons of badass scenes 
Oct 6 2018,negative,tom hardy was really amazing but the rest of the movie was 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics are on something do not listen to the critics this movie was great it was funny scary and action packed and it was so fun go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,felt like i was reading a venom comic loved it hope for more movies 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it sits somewhere between a tonal mess and a complete fun ride like gotg or deadpooltom hardy does an excellent job as eddie brock and has lent an excellent voice to venom  michelle williams gives a good supporting role and riz ahmed is a little lackluster tho does portray a crazy mind perfectly sometimes
Oct 6 2018,positive,really good venom story
Oct 6 2018,neutral,venom may start slow hell the first act almost put me to sleep but it really picks up and becomes a very enjoyable experience i think while it may have wanted to come off as a serious movie it really comes off as just a pretty silly comically fun time and i cant hate it for that
Oct 6 2018,positive,i wonder if the critics were watching the same movie
Oct 6 2018,neutral,i went into this movie with incredibly low expectations for a multitude of reasons i wont get into here so maybe thats why i actually enjoyed this movie it wasnt some great film and it definitely had more than a few awful flaws but it was a very entertaining movie and unlike some other bad movies i didnt leave this one feeling angry that id wasted my time or energy watching it
Oct 6 2018,positive,i like the movies bcuz its marvel
Oct 6 2018,positive,way better than everyone says yes it feels like the movies before the mcu but it wasnt all that bad spoiler time so i think there shouldve been more venom it didnt show him enough in full light the whole time venom is in the scene its dark and hard to see venom himself was too shiny and the big fight at the end felt rushed and anticlimactic and overall uninteresting the reason for the 35 rating is that the dialogue between eddie and venom were actually pretty interesting except for venom thought of himself as a loser which isnt like venom at all he was way too easily persuaded to not hurt good people and honestly didnt feel like an anti hero at all felt more like a hero with no true villain the part where venom and eddie kiss didnt make me feel weird because it wasnt really venom kissing him people made it seem like venom straight up kisses eddie and when i saw it it was like oh thats all overall kids disappointed in the whole thing but it couldve been waayyyyy worse 
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was great in a different way than what i had expected i had expected a gritty mean horror type portrayal of venom though i was pleasantly surprised to see that they mixed venoms evil sense of humor in there tothis is probably the best movie all year
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is lit and it is a great movie to see
Oct 6 2018,positive,i had so much fun with venom and what the critics had to say about this film was way to harsh in my opinion go into this film with an open mind and find out for yourself tom hardy for me just killed it in this film
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy did his job   movie was amazing and just because it has bad reviews here by people who seek for perfection is not the reason to skip it  i loved it fast paced start chemistry between venom and eddie and ann   its a must see
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun movie with hilarious moments great chemistry between eddie brock and venom and just an overall fun time
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are wrong yet again i didnt think the movie was perfect but i did like the movie very much other than the big fight scenes between venom and riot where it was a little difficult to see what was happening and the motorcycle chase scene that ran a little bit too long i think its a solid 8 out of 10
Oct 6 2018,positive,great fun that tries to stay as true to the character as it can
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into this movie thinking it was going to be shit and honestly the first few minutes of the movie were really rough maybe it felt that way because i was waiting for venom to show up but it is a slow start that feels a bit out of place for a modern film however once the eddy and venom dynamic the movie really found its place it is fun and way better than i had expected it to be i really hope they put the r rated version out for a home releaseor do a reverse deadpool 2 and just send it back the theaters with a r cut because you can tell in places where things were cut     i hope this finally post i guess they are filtering all ratings for this due to people wrongfully rating it super high without seeing the movie dont do that go watch it its really a fun movie then rate it a real rating biased on watching it if the tomatometer score upsets you just remember that is a job for those peopleto watch loads of movies so they see this stuff all the time after a while they want something new this movie as much as i enjoyed it is formulaic good for general audiences bad for people who watch movies for a living cut them some slack we enjoy it and in the end thats what really matters
Oct 6 2018,positive,very enjoyable movie cant wait fo r the next one go see for yourself and be the judge dont let other peoples opinions ruin your experience
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great i love it but the only think is that the movie was short for meit need to be longer
Oct 6 2018,positive,the best  waiting for the sequel
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics definitely got this one wrong  nice to see that its on track for a big opening weekend  hoping to see more in a couple of years
Oct 6 2018,positive,not as bad as the critics say go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,the best storyline and action that could be made from the venoms character
Oct 6 2018,positive,marvel could have made it a better movie some parts where funny but the first half of the movie was like slow marvel has made better movies but dc is making aquaman now that shell be a better movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,way better than what critics are saying
Oct 6 2018,negative,big and black slime wanted to watch action movie however i saw black slime only and why venom changes his mind
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy made the movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was a awesome movie in fact the theater i was in everyone clapped at the end if you like movies with actual character development like the tobey maguire spiderman movies or the 1st iron man movie and not just mindless action youll love the movie if all you care about is mindless action youll hate it ingore all those but its not rated r comments you hear venom does eat peoples heads it doesnt need to be gory to be a good movie just like the pirates of the caribbeans movies were pg 13 and still good
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really really enjoyed and had fun watching this movie tom hardy is amazing in it he really brings this crazy and active performance and you really dont know what he is going to do next michelle williams also was not just and damsel in distress she has more to do than anticipated i just really loved this movie
Oct 6 2018,neutral,a unique experience for sure the best way to watch this movie is with a fair sized crowd and maybe a little bit drunk and before you know it the movies over the movie itself wasnt good but at least youll have some amount of fun in the theater
Oct 6 2018,positive,i like seeing the friendship between them
Oct 6 2018,positive,saw it on thursday  great action flick that somehow manages to make venom sympathetic
Oct 6 2018,positive,there have been worse superhero films i do have some quarrels with venom the plot doesnt pace very well the third act is predictable and it takes forever to get to venom but this movie is a good time and definitely worth the price of admission
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is one of the best marvel movies i have seen i dont understand why the hell people do not like it its fucking awesome
Oct 6 2018,positive,great great movie has perfect amount of action and comedy also tom hardy is a great eddie brock
Oct 6 2018,negative,a film one gets the distinct sense was edited into the grave it strikes consistent discord with uneven pacing certain plot holes very questionable decisionmaking and motivations and of all things very little action  tom is a great actor whose role here is difficult to make heads or tails of hes not convincing as an exceptionally popular reporter just as surely as the film cannot decide if hes a loser if hes as popular as he is that even his recentex fiancees boyfriend has respect for him he comes across as both very eccentric and deeply on the defensive against venoms powerful influence he lacks gravitas and clear convictions in this film something we do see in a protagonist in similar straights in a recent film who oddly enough reminds many of tom hardy upgrade     venom itself is apparently a source of comic humor who far too quickly decides it not only wants to spare eddie brock but also wants to save his planet     i cant recommend it the finale seems rushed to boot and woodys appearance at the end and the groaninducingly cheesy line he was writ to deliver with the whole film left such a bad taste in the audiences mouth that after the postcredits preview spiderman into the spiderverse i heard audibly two different members in the theater both proclaim that theyd have rather seen that film since that looks good to them
Oct 6 2018,negative,im a big tom hardy fan and was really looking forward to venom unfortunately the film never finds its voice hardy is still likeable but his goofy hero gets old some of these origin stories are getting too familiar and dull
Oct 6 2018,positive,this film is so good i dont know why people hate this movie but this movie is very good
Oct 6 2018,positive,enjoyable not the best movie but way better than the critics would suggest bit rushed but weird mix between scary and funny have a good time while watching dont think too much about it
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyable venom was awesome id see it again not sure what the critics were looking for that wasnt delivered
Oct 6 2018,positive,was an overall fun movie it was a good change of pace for marvel movie and not a rehash back story 
Oct 6 2018,positive,more fun than i was expecting
Oct 6 2018,positive,i love that its not the typical serious superhero movie that marvel loves to do and the relationship between eddie and venom really made the movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,wow fresh movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,despite the changes and tonal difference in the movie compared to the comic books the movie was fun not a perfect movie by any means but enjoyable the plot points seemed to be edited for time if an uneditedunrated version becomes available ill be sure to pick up a copy of it
Oct 6 2018,positive,very enjoyable would watch it again
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun my son and i enjoyed the show 
Oct 6 2018,positive,its far from an excellent movie but the eddy brockvenom relationship is true highlight of this movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,a lot of fun cant believe the reviews were so low could it have been better sure with an r rating more character development and perhaps 20 more mins of screen time it would have been having said that tony hardy was excellent the film was extremely funny and was a refreshing stand alone marvel film  liberated from the mcu
Oct 6 2018,neutral,solid action flick too many coincidences and plot holes to give this movie a higher rating still worth seeing for the venom faithful 
Oct 6 2018,positive,even the vigilante was fun good movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie i loved it the action comedy and cast
Oct 6 2018,positive,in my opinion venom was a great movie and deserves to have another movie i may not be a professional movie reviewer but i reckon the movie was amazing it had everything i wanted to see in a movie about venom great action scenes and acting and a amazing depiction of the herovillain venom 5 stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont see why people hated this movie it was amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,saw all the critics reviews and thought it was going to be terrible but that was not true i thought it was actually pretty impressive only 2 complaints would be cgi and the age restriction   but then again would the cgi animated im not sure how they could of made it any better   good job
Oct 6 2018,positive,entertaining to watch and overall just a fun comic book film
Oct 6 2018,positive,very entertaining and more humor than expected rotten tomatoes critics got this one wrong it is worth going to the theaters and watch this one slow at first and very predictable but highly entertaining 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i get the feeling like the critics went in wanting something a lot darker than this was got mad about its lighter tone then bashed it  it was smallerstakes than a lot of the other marvel movies have been lately which i think confused a lot of people looking for a more elaborate plot i honestly think a more overblown plot would just have been distracting from the best part of the movie tom hardy it was a solid movie that brought a lot of laughs and it caught brock and venoms relationship in a fun light i will be happy to add this one to my shortlist of favorite marvel movies and recommend it to friends
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the criticsthey dont know what they are talking about go see it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,other than some weird awkward scenes and cuts in the beginning of the film it gets back on track and turns into a enjoyable experience that made the struggle between eddie and venom precisely what i envisioned a big screen version of this character to be its everything we actually wanted spider man 3 venom to be
Oct 6 2018,positive,loved it tom hardy clearly had a lot of fun in this role you wont regret seeing it in imax
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie was trash no script bad acting from actors that are normally good which tells you how bad the script was no amount of special effects could save this pos
Oct 6 2018,neutral,venom  25 out of 5 venom is superhero film based on the marvel comics character of the same name it is intended to be the first film in sonys marvel universe adjunct to the marvel cinematic universe mcu the film is directed by ruben fleischer and stars tom hardy as eddie brock  venom alongside michelle williams riz ahmed scott haze and reid scott in venom journalist brock is bound to an alien symbiote that gives him superpowers  this film felt like it wanted to be one thing but was held back and compromised to be something else it felt like it was wanting to have similar humor and violence as in the deadpool films but then they were like but it has to be a pg13 version so a lot of the violence happen off the scene even though it was implied and talked about then they decided to through in a couple f bombs and crude jokes which didnt land the way they would of in a rated r film while i found this film entertaining for what it is a venom film i can see why casual viewers dont like it because it is a very sloppy film where just as the movie is coming to its climax it just falls flat and thats the end it left me desiring me more and somewhat disappointed which is why i gave it the rating that i did the cgi even felt off to me it felt like 2005   this movie is a rent for me and only if youre a fan of venom as that is what i feel the film was basically made for because others i feel will not be entertained i dont think it is worth paying to see it in theaters as it just doesnt have that theater feel it felt kind of like watching the spawn film again  for anyone who has seen this movie let me know your thoughts in the comments below but please remember no spoilers
Oct 6 2018,positive,screw the critics tom hardy as venom is nothing short of awesome the duality of the character is fascinating and humorous at times although not to much so although the villain i found it hard to take seriously at times marvel would do well to have tom hardys venom clash with tom hollands spiderman in the future
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are dumb please dont believe the critics that seem hellbent on ripping this movie apart its unlikely to win many academy awards but thats not the goal of this genre its fun and venom is big and ugly and exactly like any venom fan would hope him to be this is not the wimpy version like the spiderman 3 had this is the chaoticneutral character he is meant to be for anyone who read the marvel spiderman  secret wars or is going into this fresh it is fun     though not totally loyal to the comic book story its close enough that i could accept the decisions and shortcuts to move the plot ahead its the venom movie i wanted venom is exactly how he should be  though if i were to nitpick id add more waving tentacles off his shoulders and arms  just cause theyre cool      already looking forward to venom 2 and carnage
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing really enjoyable movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,good movie lots of funny dialogue good graphics 
Oct 6 2018,positive,very decent film with marvel setting the bar so high any superhero film they arent the main producer of is going to have some difficulty reaching that all in all fast paced good action decent one liners and soso cinematography help me rate this movie about a 70 where it misses the mark is it weak villain and that it suffers from introduction syndrome but most first edition superhero movies suffer from that either way definitely worth the watch and definitely not worth the hate that critics seem to be piling on it
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome movie enjoyed it a lot it was a little bit loud i dont know if that was the cinema or what so
Oct 6 2018,positive,great performance by tom hardy as usual  super fun movie like i suspected not everything needs to be mcbeth to be vastly enjoyable
Oct 6 2018,neutral,i dont know what to think of this movie it left me puzzled was it eddie brocks personal struggle with venom inside him was it him and venom trying to stop carlton drake from going back in space riot had no more than 25 minutes of screen time maybie i even said to much he didnt realy feel like a villain or any threat although he should be the thoughest the entire movie just happens far to quick it feels like youve been in a cinema for 10 minutes but all bad things aside i liked the interaction between venom and eddie by themselves they are just two ordinary guys with though times in their lifes and together they are great anti  hero post credit scene showed how cletus is truly disturbed as he writes welcome eddie on the wall with his own blood i cant wait for a sequel because there is surely gonna be more screen time of venom and the main villain we all deserve for now vrey well
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was great loads of action i just loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,nothing but good things to say about venom critics dont know what there talking about cant wait for the installment 
Oct 6 2018,negative, youre not missing anything if you skip it
Oct 6 2018,positive,sick film plenty of action and tom hardy relationship with funny symbiotic is the best part
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly after seeing the movie there are a couple of issues with eddie brock but while venom i feel like its on point i loved the movie and i hate that it is low on rotten tomato but honestly id see it i think i like venom a lot now maybe one of the best movies ive ever watched
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know what kind of people had seen this movie  i know it had his bad parts but at the end it was such a funny movie as epic
Oct 6 2018,positive,really well made and absolutely hilarious really hope marvel makes a venom 2 the action scenes were amazing and venom was feared but also funny loved the elevator scene and the fight afterwards absolutely amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was awesome tom hardy is amazing per usual the banter between venom  eddie brock makes the movie go see it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,ignore the bad rating this movie is phenomenal 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i dont know how they are only giving this movie a 31 it was great basically a more mellow version of deadpool same dark ill mannered anti super hero i was a little disappointed in the length of the battle scene at the end but the way they described the plot took you into the characters mind which was a big selling point on siding with venom as a good guy the audience in the theater was constantly laughing at the type of humor that venom brought to the table   i really hope they run with this character either the spiderman and carnage story or just at least a carnage battle im also a sucker for tom hardy he sells venom so well his whiny whimpy loser character he sold so well so when venom came in it made the character feel like a instant bad ass from the confidence he gained in my opinion deadpool and venom are hands down the best marvel break off movies better than any of the individual avenger character movies and way better than spiderman homecoming i would go back and pay to watch this movie again tomorrow
Oct 6 2018,positive,i was very discouraged when i saw rotten tomatoes reviews at a whopping 31 i had very low expectations when i was in the movie theater but watching the movie was extremely entertaining and surpassed any opinions the critics had it was very funny but not too much to make it a joke  and it had  and amazing introduction to venom and brocks relationship i recommend everyone to watch the movie and make their own opinion because the critics who rated this movie in my opinion were in the wrong this movie should be up there with avengers infinity wars great job tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,go watch the movie for yourself and dont pay attention to any of these intellectual dumb as 65
Oct 6 2018,negative,the action was ok in parts but overall the movie just did not live up to the hype surrounding it  not even tom hardy could save this movie   sadly i give it 2 stars
Oct 6 2018,positive,its a good film very funny and you can enjoy a lot at cinema
Oct 6 2018,positive,love it critics just dont seem to get it sometimes it was definitely a good first go go see it very cool do wish it was r rated needed the blood to be a home run
Oct 6 2018,positive,critics are nuts this movie was good would have been 5stars as a rated r
Oct 6 2018,positive,honestly this movie is nowhere close to bad some small flaws with cgi personal opinion but the story and dialogue were great
Oct 6 2018,positive,shouldnt of cut the 40min out but still better then spiderman 2 or 3
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was a good movie sure not in the same filed as disneymarvel story telling but thats what made it great a great film for an introduction to this great character
Oct 6 2018,positive,best movie about venom ever
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved itbut maybe shouldve been rated r so they could make it more gory i feel like venom is supposed to be extremely violent but they couldnt go all the way with the restrictions still it was a really fun movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was too fast need more of the action
Oct 6 2018,positive,the beginning is slow the rest is amazing
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom has the makings of the next great comic book movie franchise hardy is brilliant michelle williams anne has a ton of promise in this universe the good outweighs the bad by a wide margin i enjoyed this more than deadpool 2
Oct 6 2018,positive,obviously the people hating on the movie havent watched it yet great movie and take of the character so far makes you hope for another sooner than later 
Oct 6 2018,positive,really good time left with a smile on my face and wanting to talk about the film with others after we left would have liked to see a small 5 minute segment on michelle williams character and the papillon go on an adventure to find brock but it is what it is 
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is not a good movie but it is a fun movie 
Oct 6 2018,positive,awesome tom hardy is just fantastic if you like marvel then see this 
Oct 6 2018,positive,just finished the movie venom is my all time favorite character now an absolute mustsee
Oct 6 2018,positive,i would disagree with how harsh the critics have been my expectations werent very high but i went into the movie open minded it definitely wasnt scary which is why people may have been disappointed i found that i was laughing a lot and the relationship between eddie brock and venom was fun to watch play out they tried to do a lot in one movie but definitely set up the universe well there was elements i didnt like and needed more of an explanation but i dont want to give spoilers it wasnt the most amazing movie ever but thats not what i was expecting to see i would go and see a sequel based on that movie so it did its job
Oct 6 2018,positive,it was good but could have been better venom looks great sony needs to learn from this get the next one with an r rating to really show venomcarnage and bring in spiderman the fans want the venom logo
Oct 6 2018,positive,better then you think
Oct 6 2018,positive,the critics dont understand a good origin story i thought it was really good
Oct 6 2018,neutral,just for tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,exactly what venom should be a anti hero who is the weakest of the symbiotes loved the not forced humor def gonna watch a few more times while in theaters  great job tom hardy
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie cant wait for the sequel wasnt expecting it to be good with all the bad reviews but definitely worth it
Oct 6 2018,positive,people kinda liked to hop on the crap movie bandwagon but it was actually a decent movie  its not a mcu level movie but its definitely not spiderman finger gunning at women on the street level of bad  its just a decent movie nothing more nothing less
Oct 6 2018,positive,was much better than i thought 
Oct 6 2018,positive,very fun as any comic book movie should be
Oct 6 2018,positive,fun movie to watch tom hardy did pretty well critics are just getting worse by the day
Oct 6 2018,positive,really enjoyed the film although it could have benefited from an rrating while their were parts that could have been better it was not as disjointed as the critics would want you to believe tom hardy was fantastic as brockvenom and put a smile on my face any time the two bantered the action was typical of your modern day superhero movie dont think there was anything new and inventive but hey i dont think superhero movies have done anything new and inventive since donner and burton kicked off the genre regardless none of action sequences were boring and some were even suspenseful overall i would recommend seeing this flick in theaters has the right amount of comedy action horror and comic book in it im looking forward to the sequel normally id rate this movie as a solid 4 but due to the critic bashing im gonna give it a bump up to 5 dont understand what more they want from a enjoyable comic book movie
Oct 6 2018,positive,way better than critics gave it credit for
Oct 6 2018,positive,i understand the criticism but i still enjoyed it a ton not too long and with a fair amount of laughs and cool sequences the problem with professional critics is that they take things too seriously if everything isnt 12 years a slave its worthless to them i will admit i think the avengers movies are crap so theres that and every spiderman iteration is utterly boring you be the judge but i hope for more venom in upcoming movies
Oct 6 2018,positive,very good movie if youre a true comic book fan about venom you understand the whole plot i will gladly buy this movie in 4k hd thank you tom hardy for your hard work 
Oct 6 2018,positive,a great movie venom would be an awesome addition to the marvel universe dont listen to the critics go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,movie was really good great story plenty of comedy great special effects and cgi and enough action went with some friends and no disappointments very entertaining remember venom isnt supposed to be spiderman so dont go with intentions of seeing spidey  venom is the antihero with good intentions like deadpool this movie is definitely not what the critics are saying 
Oct 6 2018,positive,is so fresh i very enjoy this
Oct 6 2018,positive,i came not expecting much absolutely loved funny and fun 
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was so good despite the fact that it didnt stay true to the comics id say it was far from the disappointment most critics accused it of being venom is not portrayed as just a mindless monster but is actually shown to own some intellect the bonding process between venom and eddie brock was perfectly panned out the movie wasnt rushed and was moving smoothly and perfectly above all that tom hardys performance was nothing less than excellent im an all time marvel fan and to anyone whos hesitant about seeing the movie id highly recommend it 1010
Oct 6 2018,positive,some jokes felt a bit off but its still a fun time watching it
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie was a lot of fun and a lesson learned to stop taking an interest to what critics say 
Oct 6 2018,positive,an absolutely good old fashioned action movie  free from anything remotely political  which in this day and age is rare  the critics are wrong on this one
Oct 6 2018,positive,dying to check it out again tom hardy drove this character home
Oct 6 2018,positive,started off kind of boring pretty cliche opening it only started getting good once venom was in it
Oct 6 2018,positive,screw the bad reviews tom hardy nails this role his dialogue and interaction with with venom is hilarious i enjoyed the action and overall enjoyed watching venom bite peoples heads off hope sony recruits a capable director for the sequels and they go for the r rating maybe even involve marvel studios a bit more 
Oct 6 2018,negative,i was hoping to love this movie but unfortunately it was a total let down 
Oct 6 2018,positive,better than expected
Oct 6 2018,negative,if i could describe this movie with one word it would be dumb
Oct 6 2018,positive,venom was great   i really cant understand the critics   tom hardy is lifts the film all on his own   venom is like your crazy superattached  pet   worth it 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics
Oct 6 2018,positive,anyone who tells you this movie is bad knows nothing about marvel it was fantastic the perfect amount of humor and blood riz ahmed was so perfect and tom hardy as always was magnetic
Oct 6 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics this movie is action packed and funny definitely worth the price of admission
Oct 6 2018,positive,bro this mivie was bad asss
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy was great as venom ignore the critics go see it
Oct 6 2018,positive,the movie was really good and highly recommended
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie was a pretty decent comedy it was not the best overall movie i think the story was just okay i did like the music though the special effects were pretty good as well i just wish they would have brought everything together better 
Oct 6 2018,positive,nice origin story great effects just needed more full on venom suit scenes
Oct 6 2018,negative,passable because of venoms 7 minutes of screen time and woody harrelson at the end make the sequel sony go ahead but please make it right this time go hard rrated venom isnt supposed to be for kids anyways a creepy monster and there was no blood kills or anything weird he was fighting all the time with his fists like wtf seriously stop playing with the audience give us what we want and if the movie is called venom we want to see venom
Oct 6 2018,positive,as many have stated the interaction between eddie brock tom hardy and venom is the best part of this film a little campy at times with a few lack luster and cringy moments but even so the rest of the movie was enjoyable and filled with good action yes the villian was just another throwaway character and the romance between brock and anne waying michelle williams is lacking some chemistry but those werent the point of the movie the point was to create an origin story and i am quite satisfied with that and hope to see a sequel come forth from this
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went into this thinking the worst especially after reading the critics reviews its surprisingly very fun and funny ignore the critics and see this movie awesome visuals 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this movie and have loved venom since i was a little kid this is a must see for any spiderman  venom fan
Oct 6 2018,negative,an enjoyable catastrophe bad writing sloppy plot and no chemistry amongst the actors besides tom hardy and his own voice  its rough
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it i loved tom hardys jokes im confused because the reviews say things but people in the theater where clapping and cheering  i understood the jokes and i laughed quite a bit i think tom hardys version of american is hard for most to understand but o get it and i like the villain as well i just liked it a lot ill be seeing it again and buying it upon release
Oct 6 2018,positive,there are good things and bad things about this movie but it does not deserve 3040 rating this movie should be around 60
Oct 6 2018,positive,i just finished seeing this film i really liked it i think the critics may have come to the table with a bias cause it really was good
Oct 6 2018,positive,these bad reviews and rumors are junk this movie was great and i can honestly say that  i thoroughly enjoyed it and im looking forward to the sequel not sure where all these bad reviews  came from but i never take the movie critics seriously half the time the movies  they like are garbage it does start off a little slow but 15 mins in it begins to pick up once eddie and venom become attached the story line picks up and gets better every second i was actually surprised at how much i liked venoms character and by the end of the movie he was one of my favorites the relationship and interactions between eddie and venom are hilarious and so natural much better than a lot of the recent comic movies ive seen tom hardy is amazing  movie is funny and entertaining  take the time to watch it  and u wont be disappointed
Oct 6 2018,positive,an honestly really fun movie  it does drag quite a bit at the start and the tone of the movie is a bit strange at times but overall the film is fun to watch and tom hardys performance as both brock and venom were the best parts of the movie his love interest anne did a fine job i felt their chemistry more at the end of the film rather than any other part  the film does have its issues but i loved it and so did the audience in the theater i was in so much in fact that they laughed throughout the film and even clapped when it ended  so yea i think its great and you all should definitely give it a watch and if you hate thats fine too 
Oct 6 2018,positive,lacked strong story line but overall a great experience 
Oct 6 2018,positive,tom hardy executes the role of eddie brock excellently accompanied with a great venom however carlton drakes bad acting and the messy pacing of the first half hour of the movie make for a messy start
Oct 6 2018,positive,im a serious movie goer who is an absolute comic book nestore d and venom has always been in my top 5 favorite comic book characters     i watch movies for their demonstration of structure and for enjoyment and i can tell you right now i have no idea what the hell these critics are going on about     this movie was fucking awesome and in no way shape or form did i feel the tone of the movie was off with its tone     if spiderman never existed in venoms little universe you wouldnt be seeing needs a stronger attachment to spiderman bullshit    this movie was exactly what i was hoping for they not only made venoms personality adorable you actually become attached to the ride that he takes eddie brock on     well done sony i was hesitant at first but you have my thanks for giving us die hard fans one of the coolest comic book movies in a long time
Oct 6 2018,positive,phenomenal movie great building the character up and on point climax
Oct 6 2018,positive,not as bad as the critics say plot wasnt strong but super entertaining movie that far surpassed what i expected
Oct 6 2018,positive,this isnt the comic book film to change the game but it is highly enjoyable popcorn cinema with great lead performances with a lightweight script and pretty cool action scenes not sure whats up with critics these days maybe its expectations when they heard it should be more like a horror themed storyline but as a comic geek myself i liked what they did despite losing the r rated aspect which no doubt would of improved the film unlike the predator which was a real disappointment venom is a solid enough beginning for hardys eddie brock one i hope we get to see more of i mean how crap were the first two thors then look what happened id put this in the iron man 2 predator 2 areajust good films that dont set out to do much more than entertain weeee had a good time
Oct 6 2018,positive,it is a good movie  i love it more than the latest spiderman  dont know why the rating is so low
Oct 6 2018,negative,if you know anything about venom from the 90s cartoons or the comicsforget it eddie brook is completely different venom also so if you go imagine is another universe a boring one      the first 23 of the movie is boring and tedious  then there is some action an almost insulting pg13 cgi not well defined story doll i only see it because was invited
Oct 6 2018,positive,amazing action packed ride with close to no down time there was humour action love face eating amd venom packed madness everything a true fan of superhero movies will enjoy i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie and am hungering for more at the end i really hope they make another one with tom again
Oct 6 2018,negative,really bad song made it its so bad some of the worst writing my legs were broken now theyre not some scenes looked cool venoms character didnt make any sense 
Oct 6 2018,positive,great movie my lady and i loved it
Oct 6 2018,positive,its really osm movie with tom hardy acting  best action scenesand amazing  dont know why low ratting on rotten tomato  watch this movie now nd ignore critics review  sure  after watching this movie youll be so happy 
Oct 6 2018,positive,i went with my partner major dc nerd 8 year old son and 3 year old daughter and we all thought it was amazing even my dc fan partner which is saying a lot lol amazing job tom hardy i offical have a girl crush on you now lol
Oct 6 2018,positive,super fun movie dont listen to the critics and also dont go in trying to analyze all of the plot points just enjoy the fun of chaotic silly venom as he goofs with eddie brock and bites heads off
Oct 6 2018,positive,before i went to see the highly anticipated venom i took a moment to see how people thought tom hardy portrayed eddie brock and venom and how the story in general was it amazed me how quickly reviewers were willing to bite this movies head off and being human i did think about it and was disappointed thinking the movie was not going to live up to the hype it did i have been a fan of the marvel and dc universe for years and this movie deserves more than its getting tom hardy did an amazing job the duality and internal conflict between the two was far better than i was expecting the cgi was on point and the comedy at first was strange but blended nicely with the film i could tell the film was rushed in some areas as tom hardy said 40 minutes was cut and that those were some of his favourite scenes the cast did great jobs portraying their characters and overall i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end
Oct 6 2018,positive,do not  and i repeat  do not listen to these critics  this movie was great and such a fun time it was original yet quite similar and was overall very entertaining although the spiderman aspect would have been amazing this movie did so well on its own and do not get me started with those end credit scenes
Oct 6 2018,positive,i loved it f the haters
Oct 6 2018,positive,this movie is great any venommarvelcomic geek fan must watch cant wait for next one tom hardy killed this some cheesy parts but over all loved it would watch again
Oct 6 2018,positive,i really enjoyed it dont believe what critics say
Oct 6 2018,positive,i thought this movie was pretty decent tom hardy did a great job i was engaged the whole time  dont take it too seriously and youll have a great time  the dynamic between eddie and venom is fun to watch
Oct 6 2018,positive,they handled venom in a way that surprised me i didnt have high hopes but they easily made one of my favorite marvel movies to date the critics clearly arent comic book fans theyre wrong
Oct 5 2018,positive,all of these professional critic needs to reevaluate their criteria for reviewing a movie just saw this today despite the damning reviews and it was a very enjoyable film venoms voice and interactions were the perfict fit to tom hardys portrayal of eddy brock  would go see again and all you really have to do is look at the audience score now to determine the quality of a movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,nothing great but still very fun the movie knows what it is and plays it straight forward at worst its a cheesy 2004 superhero movie but at best its a fun action adventure bromance movie the villains are forgettable and bland the love interest might as well be a plot device to move the story forward but the stand out is by far tom hardy and venoms relationship it borders i love you man at times and rick and morty relationship levels if you like comic book movies id give it a watch but if your expecting mcu quality its a skip 
Oct 5 2018,positive,critics are idiots its not infinity war but its definitely good give it a chance tom hardy is great
Oct 5 2018,positive,i dont know why people are being so hard on this movie it was great tom hardy as the brilliant reporter eddie brock was believable and relatable as a guy who has gotten way over his head after getting a little too nosey venom was interesting and watching his development with eddie was bith weird and hilaruous riz ahmed as drake was creepy and psychotic  all in all it was a good movie lots of little easter eggs and references that marvel fans love to see in the movies it was surprisingly funny in an odd way  i found myself cringing at the pretty gory fight scenes and then eddie or venom would make a quip and the audience would be cracking up  check this movie out well worth the time to see
Oct 5 2018,positive,i personally dont see why the critics are so harsh hell they arent even bothering to give constructive criticism i personally really enjoyed venom the cgi was incredible the jokes were well done and very funny and despite being a bit too fast paced the action scenes were something out of this world overall a very fun movie that i will be glad to see again
Oct 5 2018,positive,i really liked it good story line and the action was consistent 
Oct 5 2018,positive,enjoyed it even tho the story was rushed in some areas 
Oct 5 2018,negative,in terms of cgi best on screen venom in terms of literally everything else this movie was a flaming turd please stay out of the theaters otherwise well be reinforcing sony to make more im excited for spiderverse but if sony wants me to come back for any sequels theyre going to need to do a major overhaul better script better directing better editing allow tom hardy to do some real acting and for godsake tell him to stop doing his awful woody allen voice hes from san francisco why does he talk like hes from brooklyn if they do all that then i might come back for a sequel this movie somehow defied my ground level expectations by being even more terrible
Oct 5 2018,positive,i dont agree with all these so called critics  i liked it
Oct 5 2018,positive,i was not familiar with the venom character before viewing but i thoroughly enjoyed the movie from storyline acting special effects and action highly recommended
Oct 5 2018,positive,everything a comic book movie should be
Oct 5 2018,positive,critics are wrong great movie with awesome venom moments
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie does a great job and being dark creepy and funny at the same time
Oct 5 2018,positive,much better movie than the critics would have you believe without the ability to include spiderman in what is essentially a venom origin story they did a great job movie starts out kind of slow but the same people complaining wouldve complained that there wasnt enough character build up ive been a huge fan of venom from childhood and as an adult seeing one of my favorite characters actually done well and respectfully looking at you topher grace venom lite was amazing also much better done than the last 5 spiderman movies but dont expect the nolan mcu version of greatness that many have become accustomed to hopefully this movie leads to more or an inclusion in the mcu go see it
Oct 5 2018,positive,i went in expecting a bad film came out wanting a sequel i enjoyed the film even if there are a few flaws the film does have a tonal disconnect with its dialog and visuals but it wasnt distracting or bad i was laughing with the movie and not at it as it appears they had fun making it it helps that this isnt part of the mcu but i see why sony considers it could be the trailer didnt help since it made it seem like it was going to be like a early 2000s comic book movie with the characters brooding and trying to be edgy the plot may be simple but it gets venom both whats good and whats bad about venom venom is not a edgelord he is a guy that makes bad decisions that have serious repercussions he is also a bit goofy there is a comic where he teams up with the hulk go on tv to issue a challenge to doctor bad vibesyes thats his name shut up and in unison with the hulk and says we are gonna they then pause clap and continue beat you up as a reference to snls pumping up with hans  franz i bring this up to illustrate that people should not take venom seriously all of the time especially if he is the main character cause that is when it gets the most goofy movie only got 4 stars because of a unexplained plothole and jameson possibly john jonah jameson iii aka jj the owner of the daily bugles son dying in the first few minutes
Oct 5 2018,negative,i dont know what to say this movie is a total mess im still reeling lets start with how the trailer is dishonest and is selling a totally different movie and end with the fact that the movie is inconsistent
Oct 5 2018,positive,better than expected
Oct 5 2018,positive,for a venom comic book fan they id what i asked for i got the action of venom i wanted but thats pretty much it the first 30 minutes are realy boring and i was really not interted in anything else other than eddie and the symbiote in addition the last stand is really hard to look at cause its dark and the camera movwes like crazy and u can bearly see what happens other than that i enjoyed myself anytime eddie and the symbiote were on screen
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is about a character that has a lengthy history tied to spiderman so honestly they had a large hurdle to overcome by having a story that doesnt at all connect to that mythos however judging this movie through that lens is a huge mistake one that nearly every professional critic seems to be doing    as a comic fan this story is an interesting take on the lethal protector comic storyline a difficult task considering theres no webhead but one they manage to pull off regardless    none of the secondary characters in this movie have much depth but once you realize theyre meant to be window dressing to the relationship between eddie and the symbiote its easy to see that in the greater scope of this story no one else really requires that attention eddies arc is purely tied to resolving the obstacles of act one the symbiotes arc is finding a place to belong in this new world they meet their goals in the climax of the film its a paper thin plot but its just enough to entertain    tom hardy carries this movie thanks to the editing of the trailers you dont expect humor from this film but there is plenty odd uncomfortable humor but the kind any real fan of the source material will enjoy    the biggest issue is the editing this movie was butchered to receive its pg13 rating you can tell with every odd camera angle or choppy quick cut from an ultraviolent scene there should have been blood everywhere but not a drop to be seen    final judgment not the best movie ever made not the critical failure most of these venomous critics keep rioting about this is a solid rated r popcorn movie living inside a boring pg13 host definitely worth a view if you go to the movies to have fun but cross your fingers for the rated r cut on bluray next year
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom was a very enjoyable film the relationship between venom and eddie brock is the best part of the movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,the critics are insane with their reviews this movie was amazingly entertaining a good mix of humor and action with enough character between venoms personality and eddie brock to keep you on the edge of your seat 
Oct 5 2018,negative,it was bad in so many ways there is no reason that venom shouldnt be rated r and why was eddie brock whos the worlds best investigative journalist mumbling so much and always sweating also venom was made into a fool but i gotta admit its better than the spiderman 3 version 
Oct 5 2018,positive,i dont really know why the rating is so low this was a great movie in my opinion
Oct 5 2018,positive,it was an awesome movie im going to watch it again
Oct 5 2018,positive,fantastic movie cant qait for a sequel especially id carnage is in it
Oct 5 2018,positive,not sure what these critics are talking about i actually really enjoyed the film
Oct 5 2018,positive,is it me or are the critics a bunch of older people who have no sense of taste in movies great movie btw i always base my movie off if critics if they hate it i am sure to live it
Oct 5 2018,negative,just another in a long line of terrible sony superhero movies you know its a bad film with the 15yo is complaining while watching it the special affects are a mess and they completely missed what makes this character so great not even a solid performance by tom hardy could save this turd in the wind pass on it plenty of better films to see in theaters right now
Oct 5 2018,positive,i loved this film the villain was boring and the story could have been better everything else is so good that i cant help myself from raving dont listen to these critics they are just humans like the rest of us clearly the numbers speak for themselves audiences loved it
Oct 5 2018,positive,what an incredibly fun ride i think it was a perfect balance of action special effects in dark corky humor i dont know if people realize it but this is a comic book movie and as far as the comics go they definitely stuck to the script to me it was right on the money tom hardys eddie brock was incredible i cannot wait for a sequel
Oct 5 2018,positive,it was a really good entertainment so make yourself some crazy movie night to watch this 
Oct 5 2018,negative,film would have benifited from an r rating
Oct 5 2018,negative,the movie was not a total waste of time my son liked it and i suppose that is the point the movie was poorly done almost in an amateur way as if they were rushed for time you cant even blame the acting it was good i would add almost heroic because to make that script work they really had to break a leg both of them
Oct 5 2018,positive,extraordinary the start not only simplifies what needs to be known but sums it up faster and clearer than movies in the past 10 plus years originality is an understatement in the beauty of the storyline to screen venom is phenomenal in its approach and delivery an alien life force to blend with a human is not far off course to what our government would experiment and attempt venom is amazing in only a way marvel can deliver realism is off the charts the first showing of venom onscreen was spectacular the good and bad were a perfect portrayal in this movie tom hardys portrayal of eddie brock was great and on point i am dumbfounded on the ignorance of critics because they can not allow themselves to see imagination come to fruition or allow the fun of a comic book character come to life it seems hollywood doesnt understand that at one point they gave great reviews to a complete fantasy of wizard of oz with flying monkeys but cant imagine an alien creature that could use us as a host yet parasites can use us as hosts in real life this is why critics are not respected anymore just because the character was not developed in the 40s 50s or 60s doesnt mean that it cant be enjoyed movies are entertainment and thats just what they are so enjoy them and stop the complaining here is the sad thing is that not one critic notices comic book movies are the best box office hits so maybe your taste is off on the majority of what the masses think being a critic is to give critique without prejudice so why not open your eyes to critique is also to give the audience an idea of what groups of people would enjoy the film and which would not enough with that because my point is this movie is creative and venom is adultishly lovable i did make up a word same as society made up selfie and all of our language so  until next time  only the bad shall fear me
Oct 5 2018,positive,people go in expecting some oscar worthy movie aboute the psychology of edward brock jr and his inner demons no just no all i wanted and all any other comic fan wanted was to watch a giant symbiotic killing machine struggle with sharing a body and put on badass fight scenes and thats exactly what venom gave us extremely enjoyable and my new most favorite film
Oct 5 2018,positive,very good funny and entertaining the other negative critics just want  to convince  themselves theyre too smart for this movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom may have not been the horror or thriller that it was set out to be but tom hardy delivers in providing an entertaining performance
Oct 5 2018,positive,i honestly thought that this is a very good movie the critics i see are all about spiderman this movie is based off lethal protector not spiderman its a standalone movie not your mainstream venom hence the eating of people and not spiderman critics are stupid
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie with good funny moments 
Oct 5 2018,positive,what an amazing movie i love it
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy rocks but venom only meets my expectations darkly funny exciting action fun visuals but im left wondering what ruben fleischer might have done with an rrating 
Oct 5 2018,positive,for a movie separate from the mcu identity i loved it i did not focus on the extraneous cast or the supporting cast as much but the interaction and delivery of venom it was funny the action was good and as for the comic accurate version of venom this is as close as we have ever come if this venom was in a movie with spiderman it would have been excellent
Oct 5 2018,positive,super fun movie tom hardy was solid loved the interaction and dialogue between the symbiote and eddy hope they make a trilogy at least for this  cant wait to see carnage in the next
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie action packed great way to start a franchise
Oct 5 2018,negative,i wanted this to be a good super villain movie it should have cared less about the pg13 rating for the screenwriting acting was great hey im sorry about venom at least they mimicked my thought process could have been great had to appeal to the masses
Oct 5 2018,positive,its no masterpiece in fact it isnt even a competent movie but i still had a good time and thats all that really matters
Oct 5 2018,positive,idk why the critics gave it a 31 but the fans gave it a 90  idk what the critics deal is hahaha i loved the move its just what i wanted for the first one the actors are great the car chase was action packed and funny all in all i loved it
Oct 5 2018,positive,i think this is one of those times when people love the movie that critics sht on the film is fun tom hardy is marvelous as usual and ive spent a really good time
Oct 5 2018,positive,very good similar to the comics 
Oct 5 2018,negative, had higher expectations

Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is funny and awesome venom without spiderman totally works

Oct 5 2018,positive,a bit wonky at the start but luckily picks up once were introduced to venom
Oct 5 2018,positive,short of a little lack in human character development venom was a very entertaining and solid movie excited for more
Oct 5 2018,positive,the movie made me laugh and i thought towards the middle of the movie it started getting better as it went on now that the story is in place part 2 will be better venom and eddie b are good together
Oct 5 2018,positive,simply amazing critics got it all wrong
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy plays a perfect eddie brockvenom
Oct 5 2018,positive,enjoyed alot but would love to see the stuff they cut out that hardy described
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is no world beater the interaction between brock and venom steal the show the potential for it is much high than it achieves but its a fun movie with an okay story and is carried well by the lead you wont be stunned however but you will enjoy yourself not every movie needs to be perfect and venom finds a way to make you realize that without making you regretting spending money
Oct 5 2018,positive,this being the initial venom solo movie it was amazing loved it
Oct 5 2018,positive,awesome movie that blends horror action and comedy
Oct 5 2018,positive,i loved the relationship between tome hardey and venom
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is amazing did i read someone say this movie is noisy hahaa cant fix stupid ladies and gentlemen love this movie suck it haters
Oct 5 2018,positive,i personally thought it was much better than the critics reviews cgi didnt feel overwhelming comedic parts fit and some unexpected surprises i would recommend seeing on the big screen made for a fun night out and lively discussion on the ride home afterwards exactly what movies should do
Oct 5 2018,positive,can say that this is the best sony marvel movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,again critics are wrong carnage is gonna be dope
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is one of the most greatest characteristics for venom he has his own personality wish makes him funny and hilarious to see because we never seen his personality and to see this in the movie makes my day at first its starts a bit boring no attention in the beginning but later boom attention in every conver i got to say this is one of my most farvoite movies in marvel and to mostly see venom a bad guy who kill some people be in this movie is great
Oct 5 2018,positive,i liked this more than black panther its more fun
Oct 5 2018,positive,the pacing was a little off and the villain was meh but man tom hardy as venom was perfect the action the jokes and relationship between eddy and venom worked for me i dont understand why critics are so down on this movie its an easy recommendation from me if you like the source material hope that we get a directors cut of the film
Oct 5 2018,negative,love the character but the movie was crap marvel needs to be the only studio making these movies
Oct 5 2018,positive,a lot better than i expected it to be  tom hardy as always was incredible
Oct 5 2018,positive,i feel like this movie was really well done in telling the story of eddie brock  venoms struggle realizing whats right  wrong together critics of the film seem to throw a lot shade at the fact that this movie didnt get to the fine details of what they would consider a typical classic to include however the main plot of the story is very simple to understand the power struggle of mankind they lay it out in a fun  am exciting way with tom hardy pulling it all of very well in the lead role cant wait for the sequel i definitely didnt want it to end  havent felt that way in a little while about a movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,awesome fun movie i want a symbiote 
Oct 5 2018,positive,awesome movie focused not on the typical big bad boss battle more more on developing the symbiote and eddie beock and creating an interesting relationship within an action filled movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,movie was great and enjoyable starts out slow as most origin stories do but when it picks up the fun never stops look forward to seeing again
Oct 5 2018,positive,awesome movie critics are clueless
Oct 5 2018,positive,fucking amazing go watch it
Oct 5 2018,positive,critics got this one wrong very enjoyable origin story
Oct 5 2018,positive,is venom hot garbage yes it is did i thoroughly enjoy it yes yes i did
Oct 5 2018,positive,this was an awesome fun movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,really funny movie it sticks loosely to the lethal protector story arc of 1994 which i liked i also like how spiderman is not a part of this movie thank goodness venom has his own stand alone and no he does not need spiderman appearances to survive tom hardy is pretty good but his girlfriend is pretty weak i really hope woody harrelson can pull off carnages role because it will be a disaster if he doesnt fun movie overall and satisfying to all loyal venom comic fans
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the haters this movie is pretty damn good in 
Oct 5 2018,positive,seriously dont buy into the reviews from critics i just watched this movie and l loved it while it isnt prefect it isnt nearly as bad a critics are trying to make it out to be
Oct 5 2018,positive,great film thought it was a bit slow up until venom joins in and absolutely loved it after that the whole audience laughing out loud together amazing how the critics got this so wrong and cant wait for a second and third viewing next week  a slow builder that ends on such a high bring on the next films 
Oct 5 2018,positive,the best nonmcu super herovillian movie ever made in my opinion ignore the critics on this one
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie is great and the critics are just unfair k go see this movie it is awesome dont believe these idiots aight
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was so good definitely a must see
Oct 5 2018,positive,from the start venom was going to be a hard movie to introduce a carnivorous symbiotic alien who turns antihero seemed to be destined for failure but was pulled off in an astonishing manner once again tom hardy brought his a game and the movie reflects this there was a very enjoyable depth to eddie while he went from being a broken man to a juggernaut of an antihero with an insatiable need to bite off heads this film also brought the appropriate balance of humor and darkness which was refreshing i honestly have no idea why the critics have dumped all over this film yet praise the ground of any avengers movie which have been subpar as of late this is definitely a must see
Oct 5 2018,positive,enjoyed the movie was a little lacking but tom hardy was great as venomeddie
Oct 5 2018,positive,its a fun ride if you get over just a tinysmallcomplete failure to give venom and eddie any time where they come to understand one another and become friendswhich is kind of importanttime which could have been gotten with a shorter chase    otherwise theres a few awkward lines a few scenes with some sketchy special effectsbut its a fun ride with interesting and fun abilities coming from venom a profoundly middleoftheroad hero flick
Oct 5 2018,positive,critics are way off on this one the movie is fun the whole way through one of my marvel favorites
Oct 5 2018,positive,certainly not a perfect movie but hell its fun the villain was quite rushed but you can still have a lot of fun watching it
Oct 5 2018,positive,better then expected
Oct 5 2018,positive,the movie was a lot of fun it really had that mcu feel to it tom hardy did a good job as eddie brock and his relationship with the venom symbiote was the best thing about the movie   the only thing that kinda disappointed me was the lack of blood despite the movie having some scenes that shouldve been really gory however i understand that they wanted to avoid making the movie rated r because of the potential crossover with other non rated r marvel movies   overall it was a fun movie nothing wow inducing  but it was certainly a movie that i enjoyed and would like to see more of   go watch it
Oct 5 2018,positive,once again highfalutin movie critics demonstrate a growing disconnect with what people actually like the movie did not attempt to over deliver and tom hardy makes a fantastic eddie brockvenom great if youre an average moviegoer and have loved other marvel movies
Oct 5 2018,positive,much better than the trailer made it out to be had a totally different feel lovedthe movie it was great all the way through went in not expecting to like the movie seeing it as just something to do on a friday night and left wanting more stay put for the after credits scene it is a great feel good movie with lots of action and likeable characters and a plot that feels in control while all the chaos happens around it
Oct 5 2018,positive,cant wait to see the next one  
Oct 5 2018,positive,venoms first standalone movie turns out to be like the comics character in all the wrong ways  chaotic noisy and in desperate need of a stronger attachment to spiderman  this is the dumbest critic consensus ive ever read indicating that the critics have no idea what a good movie is the polarising difference between critics and audiences further embrace that fact with the current success of the mcu and the disappointing movies from the dccu its irresponsible to compare all movies to how good unrelated movie are there have been outcries from the critics because it has a pg13 rating and yet for all the success of logan the r rating just gave us prof x saying the f word the r rating added nothing to the story telling element and was good for getting deadpool a movie but little else  venom successfully employed a dark tone body mutilation and moments in the film where people were thrown around like rag dolls causing the thought well he might not eat police men but there are definitely some casualties after that without an r rating horror and gore would not have made the movie better im sorry you cant see that
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy gave an incredible performance perfect mix of action with short bursts of comedy that had me entertained the entire time i do wish they had developed a bit more of the villain story though
Oct 5 2018,neutral,this was honestly a pretty disappointing outcome when i heard this movie was gonna be pg13 and apparently 40 minutes was cut it still didnt even worry me but as i went in and came out of this movie i just felt torn on what to think while i dont think its 20 bad its honestly not good either  this movie advertises venom that hes gonna be this menacing and creepy villain which changes eddie transitioning him into a villain but honestly both eddie and venom acted like heroes in the movie so the advertisements are misleading in the trailers venom is all menacing and serious but he was just more on comedy relief while it does get some laughs it gets to the point where theyre just pushing it as the film went on the villain is bland too its standard corporate and evil version of the protagonist like many villains in the mcu the cgi is pretty bad in some places especially in the last fight i could barely see which one was venom and which one was riot but all i saw was black and gray goop swishing everywhere theres a lot of things in this movie that make you questioning a lot while some stuff with venom being venom is cool and the performances were great as well it just feels underwhelming with or without spiderman    overall this movie gets a 510
Oct 5 2018,positive,movie was amazing rotten bs reviews honestly
Oct 5 2018,positive,i think the critics didnt see the same movie the rest of us did no its not perfect a slow startbut it had to build the character eddie brock for the audience so it was kind of expected after that definitely entertaining had the whole theater laughing especially during the conversations between eddie and venom  yes go see it
Oct 5 2018,positive,i am not sure why the critics hate this movie so much   its a completely enjoyable movie   tom hardy has done a fantastic job portraying venom   it makes you think that he is the perfect guy for the role   and it is really nice to hear venom song by eminem in theatres     please go for it and you will definitely enjoy the experience
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie overall highly recommend it
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to critics really good
Oct 5 2018,positive,we were very pleasantly surprised and definitely and were hoping for a sequel
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics i really enjoyed this movie the only issue i had was the very long car chase besides that everything else was really good and the post credit scene has me really pumped
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie not the beso but still a very great movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,i loved the movie venom is my favorite character and the movies is spot on screw everyone who hates this movie i hope they continue for the sequel or im going to be very upset
Oct 5 2018,positive,its a good adaptation of venoms origin the story doesnt need spiderman
Oct 5 2018,positive,im not sure what film the professionals are reviewing  enjoyable funny at times and a worthy marvel film with a far more adult tone my only issue is it should have been an 18 eg felt jarring to see venom bite someones head off and then as the camera pans away not even a body or blood on the floor would have docked a star for this but time hardys performance has pulled it to just half a star docked
Oct 5 2018,positive,good movie all the way
Oct 5 2018,positive,good move my family really enjoyed it was a made for a  wide age group so keep that in mind eddy was great the rest was good jokes where good for the most part looking forward to the next one
Oct 5 2018,positive,amazing movie i never really liked venom as a character but after this movie i love him
Oct 5 2018,positive,the relationship between eddie and venom sold me
Oct 5 2018,positive,entertaining and intense tom hardy is such a great actor bits very well with venom personality
Oct 5 2018,positive,the after affects amazing ment for adult audiences and teens alot of funny parts
Oct 5 2018,positive,ok i read critics reviews before i went tonight so where do i start this movie wasnt perfect it was imperfectly perfect in the beginning it was a little slow but i was entertained tom hardy is a good actor i enjoyed his on screen chemistry with michelle williams the humor was awesome i loved the dual personality play off between venom and eddie brock solid action sony did it right better than anything dc put out except wonder woman by the way im a huge dc fan what bugs me about the critics is that if this was a marvel movie made the same exact way it would have been up there with the ant man score good movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,very entertaining tom hardy is a beast some stuff was over the top but only slightly
Oct 5 2018,positive,the critics know nothing i waited through a fantastic movie waiting for it to dive bomb and that never happened the critics who reviewed this movie poorly obviously saw a different film venom has now taken his rightful place in the pantheon of dark heroes with batman and jack skellington
Oct 5 2018,positive,fun comic book movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,i loved it i went out with my husband to see it and we adored it we laughed and prodded each other and then went home and gushed about it for almost an hour i definitely recommend watching it
Oct 5 2018,positive,at times the movie feeling rushed but tom hardy still killed it as the split personality antihero just the interaction between his character eddie brock and venom were some of the most entertaining moments of the movie unfortunately the villain was weak and needed to have more star power behind it and at times the soundtrack was over powering where it drowned some of the actors when they were talking they did the best they could with out the wall crawler id watch it again and cant wait for the second one to be made
Oct 5 2018,positive,i was excited for venom but didnt have high expectations yet i had way more fun than i thought i would its no masterpiece by any mrans but so what sometimes dumb fun is better than sitting through a boring oscar bait movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was outstanding and right now is underrated
Oct 5 2018,positive,very good movie  work on its own very well share cameos with spiderman universe  it dont have to be cómic accurate to be good  the story  the symbiote  the humor  tom hardy made a perfect eddie brock
Oct 5 2018,positive,while venom had a rushed beginning the ending definitely is worth it solid 85 
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy does it again the banter between venom and tom make the whole movie and the fight scenes just seal the deal dont believe the so called movie critics
Oct 5 2018,positive,perfect example of a film you should go watch before reading the reviews go into it with and open mind and you will find yourself having a brilliant time tom hardy is a fantastic eddie brock
Oct 5 2018,positive,if you give this movie a bad review than you got other issues in your life that makes you a hater its at least 9 outa 10 not perfect but damn good the way it looked the story the humor and directing was great very few bad things maybe 1 or 2 but overall great movie to see
Oct 5 2018,positive,i feel like most of these critics are being extra and dislike everything they see they rate movies between 13 stars and complain about everything its great to give some feedback on what can improve the movie but it be nice if they didnt over  over exaggerate on the ratings the story could have been better yes and so what if you dont know if this is a comedy horror or a love movie does it matter  im glad they incorporated a bit of everything movies now a days like sticking to one thing  gets a bit boring if you ask me venmo is different and im glad it is overall id give it a big thumbs up  get ready to laugh and connect with these characters because you definitely will cant wait for the sequel
Oct 5 2018,positive,we enjoyed this movie im not sure why the critics didnt like it tom hardy is a great actor cant wait to see the deleted scenes when the dvd comes out 
Oct 5 2018,negative,worst movie of the year
Oct 5 2018,positive,the eddievenom relationship was well built and the comedy was wonderful a lot of the things tom hardy said as quips can also be something someone trying to cope with the abilities of the new symbiote seemed realistic as well as funny the villian story a little rushed seemed to be fair and the action a little hard to follow on the first watch but was fun none the less personally 55 for me because i love the character but as for everyone else i believe a strong 45 is acceptable
Oct 5 2018,positive,i have no idea why this movie is getting such a bad rapport it was fun they got the venombrock relationship perfect and the story was decent they also set up a future sequel  overall a very fun movie with great action scenes venom totally steals the show  this is the venom we deserve not the watered down version from spiderman 3
Oct 5 2018,positive,it is slow at points but when its on it is on 
Oct 5 2018,positive,pretty good overall no huge moment in the movie but still surprisingly good and funny
Oct 5 2018,positive,idk why people said it was bad pretty good movie nice comedy and overall good action
Oct 5 2018,positive,great but some cgi wasnt on point but was rly good
Oct 5 2018,positive,i am in love with the performance of tom hardy and other cast big venom comic fan and the film just brought the character to life the interaction between venom and eddie was greater than i expected this movie didnt dissapoint for me cant wait for venom 2
Oct 5 2018,positive,actually a fun good funny action movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,oh fuck this tomatometer this movie deserves at least 60 of rate yes i mean least amount
Oct 5 2018,positive,seriously an amazing movie the entire theatre loved it
Oct 5 2018,positive,entertaining movie considering we have a superhero or villain movie almost every month i really want to see the second part  with carnage
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy was the best venom was very funny
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom is phenomenal
Oct 5 2018,positive,what the movie lacks in the plot it makes up for it by just being a fun to watch movie this movie certainly doesnt have a good story but its just a joy to see tom hardy interact with venom i feel as if some of the critics have good points in about how flimsy the plot is but the important thing is if its entertaining to watch and i feel that venom is a very enjoyable movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,fun to watch best marvel movie in recent 5 years
Oct 5 2018,negative,venom more like mehnom felt like i was watching the sequel to spiderman three
Oct 5 2018,positive,honestly the critics are all wrong i highly enjoyed this movie  im already planning to watch it again no movie is perfect the beginning was slightly rushed  the ending a little lacklustre but other than that i had a great time throughout  highly recommend this movie tom hardy was fantastic  the relationship between eddie  venom was portrayed perfectly topped up with a fantastic antagonist  supporting cast i cant wait to see the majority of these characters pop up again in future movies
Oct 5 2018,positive,the movie had its flaws but it definitely is worth checking out doesnt deserve a 31 on rotten tomatoes
Oct 5 2018,positive,just got back from it loved it there were a few weak points but that is to be expected with the omission of spiderman over all i found the movie very well done and a great lead in to the next chapter of a venom saga small name drops could very well lead to venom joining the larger mcu or a stand alone universe with venom and the others doing their own thing  they did a fantastic job of bringing the gore with out actually showing it to keep it right on the edge of the pg13 rating
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy is eddie brock and venom i believed it
Oct 5 2018,positive,really good movie dont really know why critics are hating it but my 3 brothers and i enjoyed it venom is super funny and the action scenes are awesome 
Oct 5 2018,negative,it was painfully obvious where ratedr content was cut while the acting was solid the postproduction is absolutely inexcusably horrible i have used rotten tomatoes for nearly a decade but only now made an account to make it clear how awful this movie is the only redeeming qualities are in the actors and actresses portrayal of a clearly gimped script in 4 months we will see an unrated bluray directors cut that has an extra 45 minutes of rrated material that should have been included in the theatrical edition the postproduction team on this film should be absolutely proud of their attempt to prove that pg13 renditions of rrated subject material will always be bad this is the absolute worst marvel endeavor since the first incredible hulk
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics the movie is actually good its not perfect and could have benefited from an r rating but overall i thoroughly enjoyed it
Oct 5 2018,positive,the mid credit scene has me hyped for venom2
Oct 5 2018,positive,do not trust the critics this movie is a must see for fans of the marvel cinematic universe tom hardys performance is profound critics do not know what they are talking about just look at the audience score 89
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was great period
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was great the negative reviews are craziness
Oct 5 2018,positive,it should be certified fresh
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics and watch the movie i was highly skeptical because spiderman being my favorite superhero wasnt in this film but it was great the chemistry eddie brock and venom was great the conversations they had between each other were funny definitely recommend it and would watch again
Oct 5 2018,positive,forget about the critics
Oct 5 2018,positive,fantastic movie  if you are familiar with the venom comics than you will be pleased with the movie  the movie was solid entertaining all throughout  dont expect a feel good super hero movie since it is venom  you can tell the professional critics has no clue about venom character origin and probably never read a single venom comic  my only complaint is that they should have brought in the gore and violence to make it rated r  i really hope that is what they do with carnage  its freaking carnage by not making it r will sell itself short of what it needs to be
Oct 5 2018,positive,movie had great action and accurate venom portrayal from comic books but story based was a struggle script could have been better but in all good starting point bases
Oct 5 2018,positive,would be willing to watch the 2nd one worth my money granted not the best movie ever but it was entertaining enough for me to recommend it all stars since it is just an antisuperhero movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,wonderful movie enjoyed every bit of it the fight scenes and action were great there are 2 post credits scenes that you should stay behind to see but i give this movie a 10 1 of the best that i have seen this year
Oct 5 2018,positive,its a great movie funny action packed venom was just amazing
Oct 5 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it had some good action and comedy it was lacking a bit in the story and the end credit scene didnt have any real build up like it should but overall it was a solid movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics on this one although it may not have the best plot ever this movie is hilarious action packed and at times a little creepy as soon as it was over i wanted to see it again
Oct 5 2018,positive,funny fun and fantastically hilarious with one or two confusing fight scenes
Oct 5 2018,negative,im not sure whats going on but this is 3 straight movies now that i have seen that cant help but interject silly political agendas  it started with the sicario sequel completely abandoning what made part one well made the it went on to the new predator trying to convince us that climate change is the reason the predators want to take over earth and now with venom there it is again climate change  stop effing shoving your political vomit into our sports movies restaurants etc  we dont want it in fact we hate it  if you dont quit that sht slowly but surely we will stop paying to go
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie with new fresh ideas
Oct 5 2018,positive,aside of some pacing issues and mildly lacking character development this was a very entertaining take on one of my favorite marvel stories
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom is a good movie clear as everything in life has its bad things has plot holes flat characters and the antagonist that would have to be important is one more of the bunch but leaving aside that venom is a good movie to pass the just believe me you will laugh more than once
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie sony actually tries something different and does a good job the critic reviews are wrong
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie dont let the reviews miss lead u
Oct 5 2018,positive,it could have been so much better
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy did an amazing job as venom and eddie brock and the relationship between the two was always fun to watch movie was funnier than expected and also had some pretty good action scenes
Oct 5 2018,positive,just got back from the theater felt like i was watching a comic book come alive wasnt perfect there were some bad lines but in the end it told a unique story it kept pace well and delivered a lot of content you could feel they cut stuff out to lower the time versus trying to spread butter too thin by the end of the movie i was pumped and couldnt wait to see more to me that is a win i had lots of doubts but this movie actually delivered
Oct 5 2018,positive,great just great plenty of action and great special effects
Oct 5 2018,positive,that was not a bad movie at all it wasnt the greatest movie of all time but i liked it a hell of a lot more than black panther
Oct 5 2018,positive,thought the movie was fantastic and cant wait for there to be a sequel tom hardy is venom
Oct 5 2018,positive,overall enjoyable not amazing but nothing that stood out as bad
Oct 5 2018,positive,i found this movie to be the perfect mix of funny and action with a great relationship between venom and eddie sometimes the movie did seem a little choppy but all and all its a great movie i will see again
Oct 5 2018,positive,great movie  i liked how the venom story was able to stand on its own without spiderman and never got too preachy unlike a lot of the other recent marvel movies  the banter between eddie and the symbiote was perfect and the end credits scene has my hopes up  ill never listen to the agenda driven critics again
Oct 5 2018,positive,highly entertaining and highly underrated fans who arent too bothered by the changing of origins should enjoy this movie it is weird having venom without having the spiderman black suit backstory or spider powers but the venom character is much more like the comics than the one in spiderman 3 besides tom hardy some of the acting is a bit wooden at times but not enough to weaken the film much
Oct 5 2018,positive,the critics are haters this movie is fun
Oct 5 2018,positive,loved it very action packed
Oct 5 2018,positive,so good i personally loved this movie huge marvel fan and venom is my absolute favorite character i loved it i really suggest everyone go watch it and ignore the bad critics reviews its awesome tom hardy is great but thats no surprise and make sure to stick around for the end credit scene
Oct 5 2018,positive,i had a lot of fun watching this moviethe only thing that bothered me is the fist half of the movie was mediocre and dragged for awhille i would have like to see a better development of the vilian overall awesome movie i love to see a sequel and see more of the relationship between eddie and brock
Oct 5 2018,positive,great effects  great venom  as a 90s kid i approve this adaptation
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hard was great in venom  while it wasnt perfect  it was really good
Oct 5 2018,positive,super funny movie  is good and i like it
Oct 5 2018,positive,i loved this movie i suggest everyone go watch it and then make your own decision but you wont regret it
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was an entertaining popcorn flick tom hardy was easily the best part of the film the humor was hilarious but the plot was mediocre evil businessman doing illegal stuff been there done that climax felt like it came out of nowhere venoms character development felt rushed overall an entertaining popcorn flick that doesnt really do anything new
Oct 5 2018,positive,read reviews and expected the worst the whole movie felt rushed but on the whole it was entertaining funny and enjoyable the credits scene was amazing
Oct 5 2018,positive,actual garbage but i love every second of it
Oct 5 2018,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie very entertaining  i will be purchasing the bluray when it comes out 
Oct 5 2018,positive,sorry critics but you couldnt be further disconnected from moviegoers hardy delivered in his performance and the movie had an appropriate mix of action humor and cheese
Oct 5 2018,positive,i dont usually review movies but this one definitely deserves it i dont understand where all the hate comes from this is venom old school 90s venom from the lethal protecter comic which this movie is based on win the story might have been a bit choppy and the beginning third felt like it did drag for a bit but vernon oh man venom oney he shows up the movie really comes into its own i had faith when i found out tom hardy would be both characters and my faith was rewarded    hands down their interactions are the best part of this movie the action sequences where also satisfying though i wish there had been more which honestly is why i dont give this 5 stars you can tell they cut a large chunk of the movie out for the pg13 rating i really wish they would have kept the r rating it definitely would have helped out still the movie was fun and entertaining ill likely see it again
Oct 5 2018,negative,this movie feels very uninspired and tired
Oct 5 2018,positive,i think the critics rating of this movie are way too harsh  its not perfect and its far from the best comic book movie  tom hardy pretty much holds this movie up with his own shoulders and his ability to morph from one emotion to another seamlessly  michelle williams was woefully cast in the wrong role and that wig needed to never shown itself on film  the cgi mainly the dual eddievenom shots were completely unconvincing  the storyline kind of plodded along for a bit  but at the end of the day the movie was entertaining and i felt good leaving the theater  the tone was uneven starting off pretty seriously and ending in an overly lighthearted manner  then the postcredit scene flipped the switch again
Oct 5 2018,positive,i was going into the movie expecting a basic marvel plot so i wasnt disappointed that it was a basic plot that being said this movie was amazing i was expecting to see a very a dark and scary venom like from the ultimate universe was very pleased i was wrong and glad that they made venom as funny as he was in the comics and tv show tom hardy was amazing and was the best choice for eddy brock the effects were great especially towards the end some people might say that it was too slow but i appreciate it more in an origins film especially one that i had been waiting for since spiderman 3s disgrace i dont know why ign and rotten tomatoes are going so negative on this movie glad to see the fans like it and thats really the most important thing here the end credit scene was really great and hope they dont flop this new part of the franchise sony you did great keep it up
Oct 5 2018,negative,it tried too hard to be funny and its wasnt funny and when it tried hard to be scary or gruesome or intense it failed at that also best thing i can say about this movie it wasnt as bad as the dark tower 
Oct 5 2018,positive,much better than the critics say
Oct 5 2018,positive,i actually really loved this movie and doesnt deserve the hate its getting i feel like you need to know a little about venom to really enjoy the movie but overall a really good and funny amazing movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy and venom are a match made in symbiote heaven cant wait for sequel
Oct 5 2018,positive,im getting superhero fatigue but found venom very enjoyable
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont let the negative reviews fool you yes the movie isnt perfect but it captures venom perfectly looking forward to seeing this again and hopefully we can get venom in the mcu
Oct 5 2018,positive,the conflict between eddie and venom is great tom hardy delivers an amazing venom the critics definitely overlooked what this movie was supposed to be very entertaining great story and leaves room for a very anticipated sequel in the post credit scene very well done
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to the critics
Oct 5 2018,positive,really funny loved it
Oct 5 2018,negative,wow i mean holly wow this thing cant bring myself to call it a movie is the most poorly acted directed edited piece of cow dung since probably the time machine brady must really need the money it never accomplishes anything it sets out to do its not funny its boring to the point of yawning fx are amateurish the plot what plot it really shouldve gone straight to video or the trash bin skip this one youll be glad you did
Oct 5 2018,positive,i thought the start of the movie was slow and boring but when he got venom it got alot better fast it is definitely worth seeing if you like action movies 
Oct 5 2018,positive,a little slow in the beginning but once venom action started it gets really entertaining comedy was funny and you can tell tom hardy enjoyed the role id recommend watching it of your a comic book movie fan and dont mind watching some mindless action 
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie does not deserve a bad rating it was fairly action packed with some humor in it most bad ratings are from the fact that if does not have spiderman in it will probably have a sequel or two
Oct 5 2018,positive,far better than the initial negative reviews we all saw certainly some editing  sound supervision issues and theres nothing mindblowing here but fun is absolutely to be had 
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom was a very good movie especially if you know and understand the character and their backround  the movie was good because it showed how the relationship between eddie brock and venom is civil and strong and the comedy in the move is very light and i found it to be quite funny and it makes the movie less dark which is good and the cgi design for venom is very good compared to the third instalment of tobey  maguires spiderman venom which was awful this venom relates to the comics and looks good i feel that the people who saw he movie before critics didnt know and understand venom at all and thought it was gonna be like almost all the other marvel movies
Oct 5 2018,positive,its not an amazing avantgarde film by any stretch but its fun tom hardy is entertaining as always and they tell a decent enough story without spiderman as a driving factor my boyfriend and i enjoyed it
Oct 5 2018,positive,absolutely fanominal tom hardy and venoms developing relationship is so entertaining to experience the cinematography alone will impress any dedicated marvel fan who the heck gave this film bad reviews i was on the edge of my seat the entire time my only advice for next movie is make it longer maybe add an r rating to add some savagery which may be needed given the post credits lol  so good go see this movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,i was expecting this to be complete dog shit totally ready to rip into this movie when i was done with it but i was pleasantly surprised it was a really fun funny movie it has its problems like the scientist lady being killed and completely forgotten about the rich villain and riot not being all that interesting riot is introduced far too late into the movie that turd in the wind line venom and eddie also need just one more scene of them bonding to make venom wanting to stay more  believable maybe them watching et or something the final fight is also way too shakey to properly tell whats going on the music is great the banter between venom and eddie is a lot of fun the scene with the girlfriend wearing venom was awesome the two big action scenes the bike chase and the swat fight are great dont listen to the critics see it for yourself and form your own opinion at the least it is a super fun time
Oct 5 2018,positive,the critics are insane the movie was amazing and exactly what we wanted
Oct 5 2018,positive,loved it enjoyed it at the theatres as the action begins its a load of fun
Oct 5 2018,positive,great film good plot and tons of action and great humor
Oct 5 2018,positive,a very good and somewhat new take on the character for the obvious reason a breath of fresh air when it comes to marvel movies something different and something that is just right
Oct 5 2018,positive,glad to watch thisgood movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,was a good movie wasnt bored at all and critics are wrong
Oct 5 2018,positive,ii have never written a review on a movie on this page but i felt like i should given the bad critic reviews first of all i am a spiderman fan especially the symbiotes this film was a blast though it did take a while to get the origin going  it was a fun ride once we got on this was an exciting take on venom and i cant wait to see what comes next
Oct 5 2018,positive,overall a good moviewent to fast tho
Oct 5 2018,positive,i dont understand all the hate  the life foundation is dumb but i genuinely enjoyed this movie and want more venom and eddy brock
Oct 5 2018,positive,other than some unearned plot points honestly a great fun movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,im not sure why critics hate on this movie but as it turns out it was quite good  im sure they have some technical babble reason but for just plain enjoyment it wasnt that bad  there is language i wouldnt consider suitable for children and it is violent at times  naturally due to the antihero nature of the main character  however it did have some funny moments and by the end youre actually rooting for venom
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom was very enjoyable it was amazing to see venoms abilities play out the way they did also the connection of venom to eddie brock the comedy was slightly cheesy but tom hardy pulled it off so to speak venom was hilarious and his character was amusing i found myself enjoying the movie from start to finish with my family
Oct 5 2018,positive,the movie was a perfect way i would see venom very nasty funny and semi serious i loved the way they portrayed his personality there was a lot character developmentespecially the way he looked he was slimy as i would imagine him and the idea of him snacking on organsfinally i liked how he talked to eddie through his head and they compare eachother
Oct 5 2018,positive,this is the venom i grew up reading in the comics its the venom i wish id gotten in spiderman 3 hardy gives it life cant wait for more from this character
Oct 5 2018,positive,by far the best movie ever
Oct 5 2018,positive,such a great movie entertaining tom hardy nailed the conflictingsymbiotic relationship pun intended eddie has with venom loved it and cant wait to see it again
Oct 5 2018,positive,so much better than my expectations well worth paying the money to see it on the big screen im not sure it will play out with sequels but probably better if it doesnt
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy absolutely nailed the eddie brock and venom relationship this had my childhood wrapped around its finger the whole movie and i am soo glad the audience is actually enjoying this because the critics are insane about this movie bring on the sequel 
Oct 5 2018,positive,loved it  lots of action comedy thrills suspense and much more  tom hardy did an amazing job playing this role  so much fun to watch
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont believe those bs critics and miss out a movie you would end up liking it had a great time watching venom it definitely felt little rushed but it was overall entertaining to see venom come to life very cool action scenes and cgi effects too
Oct 5 2018,positive,do not listen to critics and their out of touch opinions on this film  there is a reason for that large disparity in critic and audience ratings  one of the best comic book origin films ive ever watched and what a great kickoff to the series of planned sequels  movie was well acted  the movie was absolutely not tone deaf like a batman vs superman ie like critics have suggested consistent in tone throughout the whole movie  really a misleading critique on their parts no cringyness throughout the entire film  comedy works amazingly well and the hardyvenom dynamic is absolute magic here story is to the point and well done venom and symbiote awesomeness factor is in full effect here  action is awesome cgi is top notch quality   idk who these guysgirls are who wrote these reviews and what they watched but it seems like theyre the ones who are tone deaf  or bias  cant really tell  dull is probably the safest assumption   bet they think spiderman homecoming was just fabulous lol    probably dont like it because it isnt the predictable formulaic redundant disney marvel universe family comedy that gets churned out every couple of months   movie was a 910 only because i think it can get better which is an exciting thought for me  like i said prior  ignore critic reviews  extremely enjoyable and outright awesome bravo sony pictures and all involved in the making of the movie well done 
Oct 5 2018,positive,better then expected hoping to see less backstory and more action in the next 2 films great balance of seriousness and comic relief  bummer there is no blood bummer these need to be pg13 in order to make it into mcu would have given this 6 if it was r rated
Oct 5 2018,positive,the movie was really funny which was its main goal i think the hype of this movie was that it was going to have a serious tone throughout however i think the humor wasnt misplaced at all marvel has set the bar so high for comic book movies now that if a comic book movie doesnt fit the expectations that you now have because of marvel people automatically assume its not nearly as good as it could have been but venom doesnt take this approach instead it aimed for humor and it got it it was a fun great movie an awesome addition to comic book movies
Oct 5 2018,positive,its a fun movie very much worth seeing in theaters they made the best of a story that doesnt involve spiderman in my opinion go see it its great action fun with comic relief
Oct 5 2018,positive,amazing movie i recommend  everyone see it you wont be disappointed
Oct 5 2018,positive,the special affects are awesome the movie was well written being very funny but also kind of intense i really dont think the lack of spiderman in this story ruins it at all either as they made venom stand out on his own in a good way and its not like spidey cant come in later
Oct 5 2018,positive,really fun movie and a lot of action venom and tom hard was the casting choice in my opinion fantastic movie and for a nerdy comic book fan i really liked the story and the villain
Oct 5 2018,positive,fun from start to finish  stick around after the credits
Oct 5 2018,positive,good storyline funny and lots of action love cenoms voice
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy was phenomenal as eddie and the venom was great except for a couple of weird parts when he talked to eddie i think that riot could have used a little more character development overall great movie with a lot of humor to it
Oct 5 2018,positive,awesome movie comic book classic 
Oct 5 2018,positive,the rotten tomato critics should be fired everything they said about this movie is inaccurate it developed venom as his own character and truly showed actual information about symbiotes that the average superhero fan has no clue about as someone who was extremely hyped for this movie i can say it truly exceeded my expectations while still setting up a sequel
Oct 5 2018,neutral,despite seemingly incorruptible ingredients of spectacular visuals and a stellar performance by tom hardy the cinematic souffle that emerges from this theatrical oven is nothing more than a genre confused campy black sludge and not the one we were hoping for
Oct 5 2018,positive,this movie was action packed and extremely funny who ever said 15 stars is either drunk or on something great movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,extremely entertaining movie  dont listen to the critics  great actioneffects and outstanding performance by tom hardy  funnier than expected even though the story was fairly predictable  i definitely plan to see it again in the theater
Oct 5 2018,positive,one of the greatest movies ive ever seen im definetly going to see this brotastic flick again
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom was a fun and weird superhero movie and thats what makes it stand out from the others tom hardy is a great actor and brings eddie brock to life in a pretty original take much better than we saw in spiderman 3    hopefully we get a sequel and possibly fingers crossed for an appearance in the mcu down the line
Oct 5 2018,positive,you know what despite all that i heard about this venom movie i thought it wasnt bad at all had some good laughs but i can agree that the gore wasnt there and that did take away from venom
Oct 5 2018,positive,truly enjoyed it tom hardy knocked it out of the park venom was fun interesting and exciting
Oct 5 2018,positive,fantastic movie after the critic reviews i was disappointed and worried venom is one of my alltime favourite characters in any media and i didnt look forward to watching a less than stellar portrayal of him tom hardy did not disappoint i have a couple gripes there are some things that could have been better but overall this movie had me smiling throughout laughing heartily and thrilled to see whats next time flew and i was sad to have the credits roll
Oct 5 2018,positive,honestly was everything i would want in a venom movie lots and lots of chaos and venom granted it did have a little bit of a slow start
Oct 5 2018,positive,honestly loved this movie throughout loved venom ever since i was a little kid i was upset that spiderman wouldnt be in this movie but this movie holds out well on its own without him great character performances action and pacing throughout minus a couple of nitpicks like some strange dialogue choices at times and there was one scene that was a little hard to see what was going on my only real complaint is i wish it was a bit longer i cant understand how critics are rating this movie so poorly loved it through and through and cant wait to see it again
Oct 5 2018,positive,osome movie i recommend it to everyone
Oct 5 2018,positive,worth the watch totally awesome
Oct 5 2018,positive,an epic comic book movie full of explosions and great action with a great sense of humor and an acceptable told story
Oct 5 2018,positive,amazing tom hardy did a great job
Oct 5 2018,positive,a decent film with no real downsides but probably suffers from being reduced from an m or r rated film to a pg film still worth watching though if youre going to get this on dvd youre probably better of waiting for a directors or unrated cut
Oct 5 2018,positive,after reading the critic reviews i was pleasantly surprised to find they were wrong venom is a fun movie with a decent plot and tom hardy was good as eddie brock
Oct 5 2018,positive,venom   the best film in 2018
Oct 5 2018,positive,i thought this movie was awesome it was a great time the whole crew was laughing and glued to the seat definitely an unexpected twist tom hardy was outstanding one of his best performances in my opinion will see again or two more time times
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy was a perfect venom choice the character is what ive been waiting for since the crap in spiderman 3 he could have had some better supporting characters but i found this movie entertaining and has some hilarious parts cant wait for the carnage and spiderman
Oct 5 2018,positive,a really entertaining movie is so far to be perfect but is very entertaining
Oct 5 2018,positive,tom hardy is simply amazing some cheesy lines but thats expected with any marvel movie worth it to see 
Oct 5 2018,positive,i enjoyed the film plenty of action scenes i liked the character development as eddie learned more about the symbiote
Oct 5 2018,positive,i just love this movie  i have been waiting for this a long long time   amazing movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,comical exciting and just gory enough to placate fans of the comics
Oct 5 2018,positive,absolutely love it
Oct 5 2018,positive,honestly it was amazing funny action and even romance
Oct 5 2018,positive,was venom a great movie absolutely just the right amount of action and comedy to make a great superhero movie although not a tradition superhero technically antihero movie the only complaint i have is lack of character development
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont listen to these critics theyre always lookiy for a deeper meaning its a fun film with some good jokes if you like action and comedy and a little horror ie that one scene then watch it good night fellow critics
Oct 5 2018,positive,was absolutely amazed with how good this movie is unlike most of the reviews i felt like the beginning was needed and not dragged along will definitely be buying this movie once out on dvd would highly recommend everyone seeing this movie
Oct 5 2018,positive,very good movie tons of action good story line very funny a must see
Oct 5 2018,positive,the first act was slow and pointless but once we meet venom things start to pick up the script is sloppy and the editing is far from perfect but venom deserves at the very least a 50
Oct 5 2018,positive,dont entirely understand all of the adamant negativity surrounding the quality of venom a fun movie in all not necessarily incredible but still enjoyable it misses a few beats but still manages to be just a fun time
