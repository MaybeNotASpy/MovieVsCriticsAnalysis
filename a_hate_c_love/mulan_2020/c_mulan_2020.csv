"Jul 26, 2023",positive,"At its core, Caro's ""Mulan"" is quietly revolutionary, as it revels in the exhilarating sight of a young woman fighting for and earning her place in the world."
"Jul 24, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: When the Emperor of China issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army to defend the country from Northern invaders, Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei), the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, steps in to take the place of her ailing father. Masquerading as a man, Hua Jun, she is tested every step of the way and must harness her inner-strength and embrace her true potential. It is an epic journey that will transform her into an honored warrior and earn her the respect of a grateful nation... and a proud father. As you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I’ve at least “liked” almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998’s Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio. I can’t deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney’s live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There’s only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.  In fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it’s clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another. Finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams’ score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan’s score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn’t get chills during the entire film. It didn’t transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that. Story-wise, it’s a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998’s flick, but that doesn’t mean it’s better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her. Her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn’t want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn’t affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her. Like I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something’s removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the “be yourself” message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan’s (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence. The ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it’s executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It’s far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he’s not able to shine."
"Jul 20, 2023",negative," The new Mulan’s predecessor is one of the most beloved animated movies during the Disney Renaissance era. The musical numbers and the fun and charming characters are just two of the many reasons why Mulan (1998) is a fan favorite. While Disney’s new live-action remake, directed by Niki Caro, follows the same basic plot, there are a few changes made to the plot and the character arcs. Namely, the titular character herself. Disney’s Mulan (2020) follows the story of a young Chinese woman who disguises herself as a man to join the war and become a warrior. She is outspoken and wants to challenge the traditional roles set for women from an early age. In this remake, the writers introduce a concept for a lifeforce, Chi, that makes Mulan special and extraordinary compared to the other girls in her village. Her father advises her that it is best to hide her powers so that it would be easier for the matchmaker to find a suitable husband and bear children. The new live-action remake takes a big risk in eliminating some of the incredible elements of the original animated feature. The remake does not have any of the memorable musical numbers but instead uses instrumental scores to bring nostalgic feelings. Instead of the beloved Mushu, we are introduced to a Phoenix that shows Mulan the way throughout the entire film. That character seems very unnecessary and serves no purpose to the plot. Instead of Shan Yu, the main villain in Mulan (1998), the live-action remake has two villains, Bori Khan and Xianniang. A massive difference in the animated feature and the live-action remake is the character arc of Mulan. This is not the first time that Disney has made a few changes to the plot and character in the previous Disney live-action remakes. But what makes this a massive mistake is that Mulan is written as a character that displays her strength through her braveness, cleverness, and determination. This version of Mulan tends to stray away from the core values of the predecessor. Introducing the concept of a lifeforce does not enable her to learn with the other characters. Her main conflict is not her hidden identity, but not using her powers. She is a natural fighter, a woman with God-given gifts. These gifts make her more capable than the other men in her training camp. In the animated feature, Mulan’s journey is what makes her character unique. Her inability to accept femininity nor masculinity is an aspect that is explored in her arc. Mulan’s quick-thinking and bravery show that she stands out from the rest of the group. She does not need to engage in hyper-masculinity to solve her problems. She finds solutions to them by using her cleverness, not violence. This is where her core value and strength lies. In the training camp, Mulan does not engage with hyper-masculinity. She does not engage with masculinity and femininity. She knows that through using her strength, which is her determination and cleverness, she can achieve her goals. And she does. Mulan learns that there is a higher value outside of the hyper-masculine way of thinking. Mulan’s core values are what drives her character arc. While learning to accept her true strength, empower femininity, and reject hyper-masculinity, she teaches her friends to engage in her good characteristics as well. Unlike her live-action version, Mulan does not use a lifeforce to harness power and strength. Those values are traditionally considered by men but Mulan accomplishes it regardless of her gender expression. For the plot to move forward, the character must learn new lessons from the supporting characters. Without that element, the character’s journey has no purpose. In the animated feature, Mulan meets three friends who engage in hyper-masculinity. They are not problem-solvers like Mulan but use their brute strength to try and achieve their goals. When Mulan and her friends reach the Imperial City to save the Emperor, her male friends, who at the beginning of the film engaged in hyper-masculinity, later demonstrate femininity. By dressing up as concubines to save the Emperor, they learn that there is value in femininity. The characters are learning from each other. The statement here is that by embracing both femininity and masculinity, it works in their favor. The characters learn that there are no limitations to gender expression. The Disney remake does not follow any of the core values that are set in the animated feature. One of them is Mulan’s internal conflict of whether or not embracing her lifeforce would bring dishonour to her family. Her true identity is not challenged. In this movie, her power makes her as capable as, and perhaps even stronger than, the others in the training camp. What makes her strong is her lifeforce and not her gender expression. This is where the movie gets it wrong. Mulan does not learn to reject hyper-masculinity or learn from her friends. Her lifeforce is what stands in the way of the character’s growth. Introducing the character as someone who is naturally gifted and knows everything, makes Mulan bland and uninteresting. In the animated feature, Mulan is not naturally gifted with a lifeforce. Mulan is clumsy, tomboy-ish and funny. Using her cleverness and determination as a character, she learns to improvise when she is in front of dangerous situations. She does not use hyper-masculine traits to win a fight. The new Mulan has a very different personality and character traits. The live-action version of Mulan starts as a superhero. Her journey is not about empowering femininity or rejecting hyper-masculinity, because her internal conflict is about her lifeforce. Her struggle to accept her new identity overpowers everything else about Mulan’s core values. It holds her back from reaching out to her other characters. Disney’s remake of Mulan misses on a lot of the traits from the animated feature. Introducing a lifeforce completely avoids character growth and does not discuss the value of gender expression. When her real identity is revealed, she is expelled from the army and returns home. Again, the problem here is that Mulan was more focused on her powers and not her true identity. It fails to recapture Mulan’s essential character traits and instead diverges away from them entirely. There is no emotional growth between Mulan and her father or between any of the characters in the film. It tries to follow a more conventional story of Mulan while rejecting the core values from the animated feature. It is safe to say that Disney made a huge risk by making this movie. The critical differences in the movie change a lot of Mulan’s character traits, and it is evident that the writers missed the opportunity to make her special."
"May 27, 2023",negative," As Disney brings back The Little Mermaid for a new audience via a live-action remake, it’s worth going back and looking at the films that came before it. In 2010, Disney kicked off a new era of regular live-action adaptations, films that either reimagine or completely trace over the timeless animated classics from where they come from. While we only deal with films that have come out post-Alice in Wonderland (all apologies to the 1990s 101 Dalmatians) and don’t include sequels or spinoffs (2021’s Cruella won’t count), we do have 13 films to take a look at that hem pretty close to the films that they’re adapted from. There are a lot of things you can say about the 2019 Lion King, but it’s just not worth much analysis past the point of saying that it’s one of the worst studio films of the 2010s. It’s the film on this list most guilty for pointlessness. It does just about everything wrong, from its lifeless character renderings to its absolute refusal to do anything even remotely different from its predecessor. It’s a two-hour shrug created purely to pad Disney’s bank account, a film that has absolutely no respect for the audience because they knew folks would just show up to watch this no matter how bad it was. The Lion King 2019 is Disney at its worst, a soulless carbon copy of a vastly superior film that exists only to pander to nostalgia and reap financial benefit. Jon Favreau is just a much better filmmaker than however this turned out. This ghastly adaptation of the 1990s landmark original feels like it deflates anything grand or witty out of some of the most impressive animated filmmaking of all time. It’s not to say Emma Watson does anything wrong as Belle, but she’s trapped in a movie that feels more like cheap imitation than it ever should. The remake completely renders itself useless with its shotty visual effects and it’s complete lack of thematic style. The “Be Our Guest” sequence zaps all the goosebumps you get from the original, and the film’s complete and utter lack of understanding about how the Gaston character functions undercuts the original’s most stunning music number (the aptly named “Gaston”). This film is a careless exercise in capital gain; it mines a true cinema classic for commercial value and leaves nothing artistic in its wake. It’s an overwrought hodgepodge of tonal inconsistency and weighed down by whatever in the world Burton is having Johnny Depp do as the Mad Hatter. It’s not the worst film on this list by any stretch, but it does feel like a product of its time. It’s a Disney film so obsessed with the 3D boom that it forgot to make anything meaningful out of its exaggerated visuals. Disney had to send this Mulan adaptation home during the pandemic, and it certainly was not worth the outrageous price it would’ve cost folks to watch it. The film zaps the fun out of the 1990s smash hit (including those catchy songs), making this the rare live-action remake that actually could’ve benefitted from leaning heavier on the nostalgia. While there is commendable production design within, the film feels joyless for much of its runtime and concludes with an incredibly weak third act that lacks the visual splendor of the 90s film’s fireworks-driven finale. It’s not bad enough to make you want to head for the aisles, but it’s not good enough to not have Robin Williams’ voice in your ears for the entire runtime telling you to just go home and watch the original. Will Smith tries his best for his Genie to be its own thing, but the Williams performance is towering for a reason. This film packs in far too many extraneous details, but it’s not quite as aimless as it could’ve been with a lessor filmmaker than Guy Ritchie. It plays like the most expensive Disney Channel Original Movie of all time; it’s not as cinematic as it is ready to stream. Some of the films higher up on this list deserved a theater slot much more than this one. Angelina Jolie’s impressively spiteful performance as Maleficent keeps this film from veering into pointless territory as Disney respun Sleeping Beauty into a more sympathetic telling for its villain. While the film can fall victim to an overuse of CGI and isn’t nearly as strong when Jolie isn’t on the screen, it is a film on this list that aggressively tries to stand apart from what came before it. The film can’t replicate the original film’s gorgeous animation and crushing “Baby Mine” sequence, but it does add to the story and still capture the same yearning that the titular elephant feels as an outcast removed from his mother. Burton finds plenty to work with in the circus themes, even if the film can stretch itself a bit too thin with the expanded plot. However, a talented director like Burton can find bring some real theatrics that some of these other films sorely lack. While this Dumbo only flies so high, it never feels like it lacks for imagination. It’s not to say this film eclipses the 1955 classic, but it’s far more tolerable in its reimagining than most of the titles on this list. It’s a simpler story to adapt, and movies about dogs are scientifically designed to make dog people get all in their feelings and such. Tessa Thompson does some endearing voice work as Lady, and the talking animal sections are thankfully a step above your average Air Buddies movie (even if they’re still a bit silly and awkward to watch). It’s hard for these films to justify their existences, but this one is perfectly fine for what it is. It’s sweet enough to work, and dogs are great so that’s always a plus. While no Pinocchio film will ever top the original Disney classic, this one has some genuinely inspired bits that diverge from the 1940s film in some visually inventive ways. It also has a cuckoo clock inspired by Who Framed Roger Rabbit. You can’t say that about The Lion King. The problem with some of the movies on this list is that they feel like boring carbon copies of what came before them. For what you can critique about Zemeckis’ wacky vision, you can’t accuse him of laziness. This film has a weird streak to it, and it’s heightened by Tom Hanks being very willing to just do whatever with his Geppetto. It’s not a bad time. The voice cast carries this one, and child actor Neel Sethi makes for a great Mowgli. Like most of the films on this list, this one is always held back by a movie that’s much better than it existing in the ether. However, it’s hard to find a Disney live-action remake that’s this agreeable to watch. Favreau finds enough of a buffer between the original and his film to provide some new sparks of adventure and impressive visuals. The “flying to Neverland” sequence the Lowery signature touch of visual inventiveness. It’s just a major step in the right direction if these films start to feel like they’re actively made by filmmakers instead of crafted in a lab designed for audience comfort and nostalgia. Even if this film can’t fully escape its streaming budget, Lowery still manages to make a story that’s been told plenty of times feel fresh. Cinderella is the rare film on this list that might improve some aspects of the original film, if only because Cate Blanchett’s wicked stepmother is such a scene stealer. Lily James is also fantastic as Cinderella, and this film has much less mice antics. The original film is a stunner, but some of the Tom and Jerry aspects of it haven’t quite aged as well. Branagh sticks a bit more with the regality of it all, and he’s just too competent behind the camera to ever make this feel perfunctory. Nobody is going to say that this film tops the original, but you can at least feel like you’re getting as fresh of an experience as you can with a well-worn tale. David Lowery taking on a remake of Pete’s Dragon at the height of his creative achievement was always a curious choice, but he just nailed this delightful adaptation that transcends the 1970s original. Lowery has two films ranked high on this list, and it’s fascinating that he’s chosen two Disney projects such as this while also making prolific A24 art films like A Ghost Story and The Green Knight. It also helps to have an all-time presence like Robert Redford floating in and out of frame to melt your heart, and the CG on the titular dragon is more impressive than any of the animals in The Lion King. Pete’s Dragon is the standard for any live-action Disney remake because it’s one of the only films on this list that actually feels like it absolutely should exist."
"Jan 7, 2023",neutral," Muchos podemos estar de acuerdo en que “Mulan” está en uno de los rangos más altos de las princesas de Disney favoritas. Su historia no solo fue revolucionaria, sino que engrandeció todo un espectro respecto a lo que una princesa de Disney puede ser. Si hay algo que los live action de Disney han probado es que no todas las historias animadas funcionan para una película en acción real, y dentro de las miles razones por las que esto puede ser correcto, una de ellas es que en el cine animado se aprecia la simpleza, se escogen personajes de dos dimensiones sin muchas pretensiones y toda la atención la gran mayoría del metraje se encuentra en el trayecto de su protagonista.  En cambio, una adaptación live action debe de enfocarse en darle vida propia a los al rededores de su personaje principal. Uno de los problemas principales de Mulan (2020) es que todo se siente de plástico, China no es China y se siente, lo que nos aleja por completo de las amenazas a sus personajes.  La película no logra darle la personalidad tajante que tiene su protagonista, uno de los aspectos principales de su versión animada. Quitaron a Mushu para apegarse a la realidad pero por otro lado agregaron elementos fantásticos que le quitan peso a la seriedad de la invasión mongola.  Como si la película no hubiese podido decidir sobre si era un drama de guerra o una película de fantasía oriental, y en el vaivén, perdió la brújula de su protagonista. Los elementos musicales por momentos la salvan, y tiene un impresionante diseño de vestuario, pero luego aquí no hay mucho que buscar."
"Nov 8, 2022",negative,"Navigates through different terrains and attempts to cross a few borders. Sometimes it does so successfully, and sometimes it doesn't. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Aug 24, 2022",positive," If you’re wondering how the new “Mulan” stacks up against its animated predecessor or even the more recent Disney live-action remakes, this might not be the review you’re looking for. Full disclosure: I’ve never seen the ￼￼original 1998 animated feature. And I haven’t watched any of the latest not-so-warmly received live-action reheats. But I have seen Disney’s new $200 million “Mulan”. You know, the $30 ‘stream at home’ version. And guess what – it’s not bad. Is it worth the high price tag to watch right now? I’ll let you decide. “Mulan” comes from director Niki Caro and the writing team of Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, and Lauren Hynek. Their retelling of this inspirational tale aims at capturing the spirit of the original animated film while also making meaningful choices that set their version apart. The way it sounds, the more recent live-action remakes went to great lengths to follow their originals. “Mulan” 2020 attempts to carve its own identity with a more realistic vision, no songs and no celebrity-voiced comic sidekick. The results aren’t perfect, but they’re pretty darned impressive. Liu Yifei plays Mulan, the spirited eldest daughter of honored war veteran Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma). The two have a loving bond with the father aware that there is something special about his daughter. But his deep devotion to archaic traditions leaves Mulan bound by the expectations of her family, village, and culture. “A daughter brings honor through marriage“, Hua Zhou lectures. “Your job is to bring honor to the family.” Yet in this world of ‘honor’ through marriage, she can’t even choose her own husband. Meanwhile on the outskirts of the empire a warlord with a grudge named Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee) begins attacking imperial garrisons. Lee is a striking presence, with the look and the snarl of a menacing villain. Unfortunately he’s the victim of an all-too-familiar problem in modern blockbusters – bad guys with hardly any depth and the barest motivations. Basically Böri Khan sets out to quench his thirst for revenge by killing the emperor and becoming the new ruler of the kingdom.￼ Not the most original ￼crusade, but he and his soldiers sure look cool carrying it out. With the attacks intensifying, the Emperor (played with stoic distinction by Jet Li) calls for one male member of every family to join the fight to quell the enemy invasion. Hua Zhou, the lone male in their family, prepares to join the war effort despite his failing health. Knowing her father’s chances of survival are slim, Mulan takes his sword and armor and sneaks away, posing as his son and joining the Fifth Battalion led by esteemed Commander Tung (played by Chinese screen legend Donnie Yen). It’s her first venture into the male-dominated world and if her ruse is discovered she’ll have more to worry about than shame and dishonor. The bulk of the film’s second act concentrates on the training of the young soldiers. Mulan is easily the most skilled warrior in her regiment, but ￼showing her abilities would draw too much attention and risk exposing her secret. Therefore much of this segment is spent with Mulan concealing her identity from the other recruits especially the curious and charismatic Chen (Yoson An). What’s missing is the emotional toil. There is certainly an interesting thematic conflict between loyalty to duty and embracing one’s true self. But we rarely see Mulan wrestling with it on an emotional level. We get a few of those scenes and they work really well. We just get too few of them. From there the film moves to an action-filled final third. Surprisingly “Mulan” never quite reaches the scale I was expecting. This could be due to misguided expectations on my part, but the film isn’t a huge sprawling ￼epic. It has all the dressings, but when it comes to the action the film’s snappy pace never keeps it in one place for too long. For that reason some of the action scenes are unexpectedly short and tame, perhaps the result of being a Disney property. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t stunning images throughout “Mulan”. Caro and her DP Mandy Walker shoot some exquisite shots both when filming the diverse landscapes or capturing the gravity-defying fight sequences. One showdown set inside a tight hallway is shot with incredible style and energy. Another fight through some bamboo scaffolding ￼features several ingenious camera tricks and wonderful framing. At the same time Oscar winner Grant Major’s production design and Bina Daigeler’s costumes add something interesting to every composition. Cast-wise Liu Yifei shows nice range moving from a rambunctious rebel by nature to a battle-ready warrior exemplifying courage and leadership. She does good with what emotional material she’s given and her physicality is unquestioned. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are great presences but get little opportunity to show the martial arts prowess what made them such stars. Perhaps the most compelling character is an exiled sorceress named Xianniang (Li Gong). She’s a servant and weapon of Böri Khan who doesn’t take kindly to being called a “witch”. There are hints of a rich and thoughtful backstory, but sadly all we get are crumbs – fleeting references to a pained past that I would love to have known more about. I can see “Mulan” pulling people in a variety of directions. Lovers of the animated original may take issue with some of its creative choices. Those looking forward to its more realistic spin may find it too restrained and safe. For me, the film’s strengths definitely outweigh its shortcomings. “Mulan” pulls us into a vibrant and fascinating world while telling a story full of inspiration and relevance. At the same time I found myself constantly wanting it to go further. Did being a Disney property hold it back? Were my expectations out of whack? I’m not sure. So I end up still unable to tell you if the movie is worth the $30 price tag. Once again, I’ll let you decide. “Mulan” is now available exclusively on Disney+. One of the biggest complaints about this film I’ve been hearing is about Mulan’s magical “chi” powers, which apparently give her far less obstacles to conquer in the story (particularly when she’s first starting out in the warrior camp), therefore stripping her of any relatability or real character progression. Any thoughts on that? I didn’t really have an issue with that mainly because the “chi” powers were so vaguely discussed. I felt hers was deeply tied to her character who was energetic, outgoing, even rebellious. So she nurtured her “chi” powers where someone more reserved or ‘traditional’ wouldn’t. Not sure if that makes sense but that’s kinda how I perceived it. Whoops, I meant “One of the biggest complaints I’ve been hearing about this film”, not “One of the biggest complaints about this film I’ve been hearing” LOL. Sorry about that. By the way, when are you going to see “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” (the new Charlie Kaufman movie, and a much-discussed one too) and “Feels Good Man” (an excellent documentary about, of all things, Pepe the Frog)? They’re both pretty fresh on peoples’ minds at the moment, and I think they’re well-worth checking out. Actually I never got the notification about your question. Actually been working on my review for “Ending Things” tough movie to talk about without spoiling. Still haven’t seen “Feels Good Man”. Hope to before the end of the week. I would really like to see this (haven’t seen the cartoon version) but not subscribing to Disney nor paying on top too. One day it will be on bluray so that will have to do.  I’m not comfortable recommending to anyone that they absolutely should pay $30 to watch it now. I liked it but it’s not without its flaws. While I can’t say that I flat out hated the movie, I felt that it was a missed opportunity.  Don’t get me wrong, the cinematography is fantastic and some of the action is okay, but this new Mulan felt like much weaker version of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  To me, a lot of the characters felt flat, and I don’t think that Yifei Liu was the right person for the role.  Donnie Yen was great, but I hated what they did with Jet Li.  For 30 bucks, this movie’s not worth it.  It really isn’t, especially since you’re not getting the full theatrical experience, which is one of the reasons why I didn’t care for it.  I would recommend 2009’s Mulan: Rise of a Warrior instead.  I think that film is a much better interpretation of the original 6th century poem. I can see where you’re coming from. Many of our issues come from the same places. More attention could have been given to several characters and their storylines. I actually liked Liu but wish they would have given her more to emotionally wrestle with. My only interest in seeing this film is Gong Li.  I just love watching her in films and to see in a big project like this is cool though I’m aware that she’s not given much to do.  I’d probably check it out when it is available for Disney+ members who already pay the monthly fee.  Besides, I was watching Moana as it’s my nephew’s favorite film. Nope, no Eddie Murphy voiced dragons in this one. But I would be really interested to hear your take on it as a big fan of the animated film. I thought that this was a fine adaptation. They do a nice job making it more serious than the animated one.  The cinematography is amazing but the characters just aren’t developed well enough and things feel too glossed over."
"Aug 17, 2022",positive," It wasn’t by choice — my day job finally pulled the plug on my weekly indulgence. And it wasn’t unexpected. But it did happen quickly — I received word literally as I was writing my review of Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn). My last review, it turns out. The move didn’t put me out of work, and I had a bunch of travel planned, so rather than immediately put out feelers to editors and outlets I’d freelanced for before, I decided to take a break and think about what I wanted to write about and how I wanted to contribute to the larger film conversation. No one wants or needs to read my take on Bad Boys III, for example. Then the coronavirus happened, and the economic recession that came with it, and I wasn’t the only film critic out of a gig. (Plus all those trips got canceled.) In the meantime, inspired by the #52FilmsByWomen and #FemaleFilmmakerFriday pledges/hashtags, I came up with a concept for a monthly column focused on films directed by women. The idea is to anchor a roundup of reviews with a major new release, such this month’s Mulan directed by Niki Caro, plus additional titles both recent and classic, documentary and international, feature and short, with an eye toward diversity — one for each Friday, so four or five per month. Then a year from now there’ll be a list of sorts of fifty-two films directed by women — I’m a sucker for a good list. But also, who’s counting? This is the structure I’m going to play with for now — I’m not sure how well it will work with movie release dates and embargos. With no deadlines or editors, I’m going to give myself permission to experiment. (I also didn’t plan on writing this intro — I didn’t want to make any promises I may not end up keeping — but then I thought it’d help to explain what the heck I’m trying to do here.) Still, the ambition and scale of Mulan sing through in this non-musical adaptation that adheres to the animated movie’s version of the Chinese folklore “The Ballad of Mulan” in both broad plot and fine detail — with a couple of key changes to the aesthetic and spirit of the story. Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a lively child with strong chi. There’s just one problem: she’s a girl. And in the patriarchal society of ancient China, girls bring honor to their families by marrying. Like Frozen’s Elsa, she’s advised to hide her gift. But when the emperor orders one male from each family to join the Imperial Army to defend against northern invaders, Mulan ties up her hair and binds her breasts and slips away with her injured father’s armor and sword to enroll so he doesn’t have to. Along the way, she’s guided not by Mushu, the beloved diminutive dragon of the cartoon, but a Technicolor kite-like phoenix that may or may not be visible only to her. But the most significant diversion of this Mulan is with this chi business — our warrioress proves her mettle on the battlefield not only by being clever but by wielding magic too, which undermines the everywoman quality of the animated Mulan. She can’t unleash her full power, however, until she fulfills all three qualities inscribed on her blade: loyal, brave, and true. Another woman with chi, the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li, in fabulous makeup and regalia), on the other side of the fight teaches her this, and it’s not until Mulan’s mane is freed like hair in a shampoo commercial that she realizes her full potential. If it weren’t for Mulan’s chi, however, we wouldn’t get the preternatural stunts that recall (though don’t match) Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, captured with dynamic choreography and camerawork. Meanwhile, all of this unspools against stunning backdrops of otherworldly landscapes and richly ornate production design, from Mulan’s village-in-the-round to the grand Imperial Palace. The very first note I scribbled while watching Mulan was about Whale Rider. The similarities to director Niki Caro’s first film are immediately evident and persistent, and not just because Mulan wields a fighting stick in that film’s opening scene: A girl in a patriarchal society demonstrates a proclivity for her society’s warrior culture but is prohibited from expressing it because of her gender. She secretly pursues it anyway, ultimately emerging the hero. In the case of Whale Rider, that heroine is Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes, at the time the youngest-ever nominee for a Best Actress Oscar), the first-born child of the first-born son of a Māori village leader. With no male heirs in sight, Pai’s grandfather Koro (Rawiri Paratene) opens a school to find a candidate among the local boys — a motley bunch who pale in comparison to Pai’s innate talent, dedication, and reverence for their culture. A sweet, sensitive girl, still Pai cannot help herself and seeks to train on the sly with her slacker Uncle Rawiri (Grant Roa) with the support of her grandmother (Vicky Haughton). When Koro fails to find a suitable successor, he wallows in his failure, echoed by his discovery of a pod of beached whales. It’s only Pai who can coax them back to sea, earning her place at the head of the tribe. Caro had about 1/57th the budget for Whale Rider as for her latest film, so logistics such as how, for example, Pai gets a leviathan turned around in the sand get glossed over. A white New Zealander, Caro does not share a culture with the characters in either film, but with Whale Rider she did build the framework as the go-to director for feminist coming-of-agers. Google “best films by women,” and you’ll find a couple of lists with Claire Denis’s Beau Travail near the top, yet the film has been unavailable on physical media or online — at least as far as I could find — until this month. Janus Films has released a stunning 4K digital restoration of the tone poem loosely based on Herman Melville’s Billy Budd featuring music from Benjamin Britten’s opera also based on the novella. Denis has set her examination of masculinity among a small troop of French Legionnaires stationed in Djibouti. Our narrator is Galoup (Denis Lavant), a sergeant with a Napoleon complex who is reflecting on the events that, it turns out, ended his career. What there is of a story unfolds in a haze of memory and boredom as the men perform domestic chores like laundry and miserable labor such as road-building and repetitive, ritualistic training that’s reminiscent of Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia in its celebration of the human form (though definitely not its politics). Into this hotbed of male bonding and repressed desire arrives Gilles Sentain (Grégoire Colin), a handsome, popular legionnaire whom Galoup vows to destroy out of irrational jealousy and perhaps attraction. Tapping also into the theme of African colonialism that is characteristic of her oeuvre, Denis has crafted a psychological portrait as exquisite and harsh as the East African landscape so gorgeously captured by cinematographer Agnès Godard. Dawn Porter is having a busy year. The documentarian behind Trapped and Gideon’s Army has two new films coming out this year: John Lewis: Good Trouble, which premiered in July just a couple of weeks before the civil rights icon’s death, and The Way I See It, about Obama White House photographer Pete Souza, later this month. I can’t talk about the latter film yet (embargos — gah!), but Good Trouble hits digital/DVD as well as CNN this month with an intimate portrait of the politician and activist. RIP. The documentary covers a lot of the same territory as Lewis’s graphic novels March, though the story about how he developed his oratory skills by preaching to his chickens always plays. And the film struggles with pacing — spending too much time on a Freedom Singers performance and too little on Lewis’s wife. But it’s arresting to watch some of the rare archival footage — even more so to watch Lewis watch it for the first time himself — of how he and his fellow protestors prepared for the lunch-counter sit-ins, and then how they unfolded, as well as his triumphant (though censored!) appearance at the March on Washington and the awful events that took place on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. It’s even more affecting to watch him interact with the public today — never too busy to take a selfie or accept a heartfelt thank you. In I think the only clip from an interview with his son, he’s asked, “What’s it like walking through an airport with John?” “Tedious.”"
"Feb 18, 2022",positive," The Disney live-action adaptations have been a mixed back since the initial streak of releases began in 2010. Despite three releases in the 90s including The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians, and 102 Dalmatians, it was not until the 2010s that Disney’s adaptations of their animated classics became a focal point of the studio’s annual releases.  After the soulless shot-for-shot live-action adaptation of the 2019’s The Lion King, it was hard to imagine the studio attempting an original look at their animated film library. Mulan is a fresh take on prior beloved releases growing up. While Disney purists will likely scream and complain on social media about the 1998 animated film changes, I enjoyed this new take of the story.  Rather than doing a carbon copy, similar to The Lion King, which failed miserably, Mulan is a fresh reimagining that retains the essence of Mulan’s character from the animated film while making sure that the live-action adaptation adds a layer of originality missing from other adaptations. Mulan‘s premise follows most of the animated film’s main plot with Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu), someone who doesn’t quite fit in the expectations of women at the time and of her village leading to her mother, Hua Li (Rosalind Chao), becoming embarrassed continuously by her daughter’s behavior. Simultaneously, her decorated war veteran father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma), seems to take pride in Mulan’s lively spirit. As war is imminent and China’s fate is on the line, the Emperor decrees one man from every family must join the Imperial Army and defend the Empire from the Northern invaders. Despite his ailing health, Zhou steps forward to offer to fight for the Emperor, ultimately leading to Mulan secretly taking her father’s sword and armor and disguising herself as a man named Jun to take Zhou’s place in the Imperial Army. For fans of the much-loved 1998 animated film, disappointment will be on full display as the original elements have been removed. This concept is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Rather than a carbon copy of the animated film, director Niki Caro created a war epic where there was little room for Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, Mulan’s love interest Li Shang and musical numbers. This allowed Caro and the company to focus on Mulan’s character development rather than being tied down to a homage to its animated predecessor. Mulan strived to be more than a rip-off, but present a narrative more rooted in the mythology of both its titular star and Imperial China. While striving and succeeding in creating a new take on the story, Caro does sprinkle references to connect this remake to its animated counterpart, including Harry Gregson-Williams musical ques in his score paying homage to the classic Matthew Wilder and David Zippel song, Reflection. Outside of removing certain characters and music, Caro’s most significant change is Mulan’s connection to qi (or ch’i). This force has been linked to the strongest warriors by Chinese philosophers. The inclusion of this connection adds another layer of authenticity to Chinese culture that Caro and Disney were looking for with this release. Mulan‘s production design is breathtaking and had me longing for a theatrical experience to watch the film as every cent of the $200 million budget was used. The film offers some big-time war action set pieces that are a marvel with dazzling effects that are sure to be in cinephiles’ favorite set pieces of the year. While there is a lot to rave about regarding the film, there is one aspect of Mulan that did not work for me. The film strives to be an authentic tribute to Chinese culture, yet every person speaks perfect English, and there is no Chinese dialogue. While I am well aware that this film is set to be a kid’s film, it would have been nice to see some subtitles on the screen. In a year where Parasite won Best Picture, a more authentic representation regarding language would have been welcomed. In its attempt to be different and original, Mulan cements its place as one of the finest Disney live-adaptions released thus far. While it does not remove 2016’s The Jungle Book as the best of the bunch, it certainly should be in the discussion as the formula for upcoming live-action adaptations."
"Feb 16, 2022",positive,"As remake of a beloved animated film from Disney, there are things that are both admirable and disappointing from it."
"Jan 7, 2022",positive," Fans of the 1998 animated film Mulan know the story of the young woman who masquerades as a man to take her ailing father’s place in the Chinese Imperial Army, ultimately saving China and bringing honor to her family. In  the new live-action version, Mulan follows the same guidelines, but takes some creative turns by adding some fantasy elements as well as some new characters. Unfortunately, it all doesn’t seem necessary. There are several remnants of the beloved animated classic, from the hilarious matchmaker scene to Mulan’s (Yifei Liu) strong bond with her father to her rigorous camp training. Yet it fails to deliver on the relationship between Mulan and her fellow soldiers, including hunky love interest Honghui (Yoson An). Although we do get a rather sexy bath scene with Honghui joining Mulan, who is  disguised as Jun, in the lake, their relationship seems a bit awkward. The film really focuses on Mulan’s qi, the Chinese philosophy surrounding life force energy, and her strange connection with Gong Li’s Xianniang, a witch who works for the villain, Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee). These new additions present more character development for Mulan, especially her relationships with women. Xiu (Xana Tang) is Mulan’s sister and confidante, but really serves no purpose in the plot. Xianniang acts as a warning for Mulan: If she can’t harness her qi the right way, she could end up alone, treated like a witch. But the entire situation makes no sense. The original story of Mulan was important to many because it was about a regular girl who became a legend. But adding a qi element, giving Mulan a sort of superpower, takes away the idea that “a nobody” could become somebody. Now there is this added element that one has to harness appropriately in order to truly become a warrior. It is hard to gauge who the target audience is for this film. The movie tries both to cater to Westernized audiences as well as Chinese audiences, the latter with the added elements, especially with the addition of Gong Li, Donnie Yen, and Jet Li, all obviously dubbed. Knowing this allows you to understand the film’s choices regarding the one dimensionality of the dark-skinned villains, the Rourans; the added martial arts presentation by Yen’s character; and the lack of the memorable cross-dressing scene from the animated film. With the focus on the new and unnecessary characters, the film fails to highlight the other important characters in Mulan’s story. These include her colleagues Yao, Ling, Chien-Po, and Cricket, which is really a loss for the audience. Throughout the film, Mulan has moments interacting with her fellow soldiers, but never more than exchanging occasional vocal jabs. The camaraderie never feels earned. The film does try to introduce Eastern philosophy and virtues to the Western audience, but it feels a little too forced. This is especially true with the idea of qi and the symbolism behind the phoenix. The film depicts the phoenix as a symbol of rebirth, which would make sense if they were following Greek mythology. But for the Chinese, the phoenix symbolizes harmony, the yin to the Chinese Dragon’s yang. This may cause some confusion between the two philosophies and audiences. Still, the film is entertaining and visually stunning. The fight choreography and cinematography are absolutely beautiful and it is remarkable to see an all-Asian cast on the big screen in a Disney feature film. Liu is perfectly cast as Mulan. There were many scenes that felt empowering watching her in battle as both Hua Jun and Hua Mulan. She nails the tormented soldier with a secret, and still maintains her femininity while also kicking ass. Another standout performance from the film came from Mulan’s father, played by Tzi Ma. The relationship between Mulan and her father is key in every interpretation of the Ballad of Mulan. Liu and Ma did not disappoint. Their father/daughter chemistry was so strong and emotional, I began thinking of my own dear father. Mulan is important for many Chinese and Westernized Asians. Although the film may have its faults, it does introduce the story of Mulan to new audiences that would like to see an Asian woman hero. While Liu may not be my Mulan, she will definitely be another Asian kid’s Mulan, and  that’s what really matters."
"Oct 5, 2021",positive," Let’s get down to business: This isn’t one of Disney’s shot-for-shot, song-for-song live-action remakes. Rather, Niki Caro’s Mulan is a serious, often-intense reimagining of the ancient Chinese ballad that also inspired the studio’s 1998 animated hit. More Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Disney Princess story, it’s a beautifully filmed epic that gives Hua Mulan increased agency and confidence. Gone are the songs (catchy as they were), most of the romantic subplot, and the motor-mouthed dragon sidekick. In their place is the tale of a girl with a powerful chi whose spirit defies tradition. Mulan’s loving-but-traditional father (Tzi Ma) advises his daughter to hide her abilities in the interests of keeping the peace and presenting herself as a good matchmaking prospect. But Mulan (played by Crystal Rao as a child and Yifei Liu as a young woman) isn’t destined to be a meek, obedient wife. When the Imperial Army comes knocking, conscripting one able-bodied man from each family to fight invaders led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee), Mulan sneaks out in the middle of the night with her long-ago-wounded father’s armor and sword, determined to take his place and bring her family honor. These plot elements — and several others, from the big avalanche scene to Mulan’s foiled attempt at a solo dip in the lake — will be familiar to fans of the animated version. But Caro tweaks certain aspects of Mulan’s story and introduces new ones, too, in the interests of giving her heroine an even more firmly feminist trajectory. For example, here her potential love interest is a peer, rather than her commanding officer, which removes the iffy power dynamic of the earlier film. And a new character, shape-shifting witch Xianniang (Gong Li), is a strong, tragic woman whose experiences help Mulan understand why it’s so important for her to embrace who she really is. That moment of revelation may be the most important difference of all between the two films: Here, she decides when and how to tell the world her secret, rather than having it discovered as the result of a battlefield injury. She owns her story. Sandie Angulo Chen: Director Niki Caro has spent her career telling women’s stories, so it’s not a surprise that she does justice to the ancient Ballad of Mulan in Disney’s live-action retelling of the epic woman warrior tale. With an international cast of acclaimed Chinese actors, the new Mulan focuses on the protagonist’s personal growth, her acceptance of her power (her chi, which is usually thought of as a male trait), and her devotion and loyalty to family, friends, and homeland. Liu Yifei is terrific as the innocent, hopeful, but incredibly fierce Mulan, who feels compelled to save her son-less disabled father (the excellent Tzi Ma) by pretending to be a young man ready to enlist in the Imperial Army. While there aren’t a lot of laughs (and naturally, no cartoonish dragon sidekick), fans of the original will recognize several callbacks to the animated adventure. Li Gong deserves a shout-out as the Huns’ secret weapon, a powerful sorceress fighter who finds more recognition than animosity in Mulan’s abilities. This is a grown up, dramatic version of Mulan that elevates the empowering, feminist, and family-oriented overtones of the original. Pam Grady: A young woman in ancient China risks her life as well as her family’s honor when she takes to the battlefield in Disney’s opulent, action-packed epic. Mulan’s (Liu Yifei) future was written when she was born a girl. A good marriage is supposed to be her fate, but she takes after her warrior father Zhou (Tzi Ma) and when her country faces a new threat, she rewrites her destiny. Whale Rider‘s Niki Caro directs this $200-million production – the most expensive film to date helmed by a woman – and every dollar is reflected on screen. Thrilling fight choreography, an involving story, and lavish production values add up to rip-roaring adventure with a strong, resilient woman at its center. Light years from the traditional Disney princess, Mulan is a hero who may hail from olden times, but speaks to our own. Susan Wloszczyna: In the hands of Niki Caro, this live action version is a visually-stunning, well-written, high-action war epic that is must-see family entertainment. With a budget of $200 million, – the most for any film helmed by a female –  the high-flying stunts, the gorgeous scenery (courtesy of China and New Zealand), the highly choreographed battle scenes, the excellent special effects – all fairly scream that this is one impressive production. Read full review.  Kathia Woods Disney’s live-action films haven’t exactly been a winning formula. After Lion King, I wasn’t holding on to much hope that Mulan would be better; however, I was wrong. This is the best live-action film that Disney has made. The music and Mushu are gone but what we gain is a warrior. Liu Yifei is outstanding as Mulan. She brings a more serious persona to the screen. Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee, and Tzi Ma are also excellent. The cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning, and the costuming by Bina Daigeler equally strong. All the above make this film a winner. This version of Mulan gives young girls the most important lesson that they are good enough and strong enough. Embracing oneself is the ultimate victory. That is a message that will last much longer than a song. Leslie Combemale New Zealand director Niki Caro has been making gorgeous, meaningful films with messages of female empowerment for her entire career, and has the accolades and awards to prove it. Now she has brought Mulan to the screen, and it’s as powerful and moving as it is a wonder to the eye. ‘Girls Kicking Ass While Dressed Appropriately To Do So’ is my go-to action sub-genres, and Mulan, starring the dynamic and compelling Yifei Liu in the title role, will be added as essential viewing to a film category that, at long last, has started to expand. It is a disappointment that the pandemic means Caro won’t have the worldwide blockbuster she could have had. Folks looking for fun and girl power at the movies, however, can spend $30 for their whole family to see it in their home theaters, and do so in their jammies. Loren King Director Niki Caro’s live-action remake of Disney’s beloved 1998 animated Mulan is by far the most ambitious and rewarding of the studio’s recent remakes, including last year’s Aladdin and The Lion King. It remains faithful to the story, with its ancient origins, while giving it a modernity and a relevance that injects it with new life. It’s an old-fashioned battle epic with a solid female empowerment core. Read full review. MaryAnn Johanson I’m not a fan of Disney’s plan to do live-action remakes of its animated films, but if they will insist on it, here’s the way to do it: Give a young woman’s story to a female director. Niko Caro’s take on the legendary Chinese figure is refreshingly free of the sort of fetishization we often get when male directors take on female action heroes, and also eschews the exoticization of Asian women that often afflicts Western filmmaking. Yifei Liu as Mulan exudes pride, honor, and a strength both physical and psychological. She’s a wonderful role model for girls who aren’t much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations. Jennifer Merin  In Disney’s live action version of Mulan, director Niki Caro pares away the animated version’s cartoonish elements and cuts to the core of the ancient Chinese tale of a rebellious and courageous young women who defied traditional gender roles to become a heroic and honored warrior. The character of Mulan, as played by Yifei Liu, shines as an example of a woman who uses her strength and skills to claim equality in a social system ruled by men. She is an empowering role model for women to fulfill their personal ambitions and potential for leadership. The beautifully crafted film’s compelling story and exquisite production values are sure to make it a classic. Brava, Caro. Marina Antunes Stories of women overcoming great obstacles, embracing their power and finding their true path in the world, often at great threat to themselves and their families, are nothing new. The true tale of Mulan, the Chinese heroine who stood up the empire and ultimately saved them, has already seen life once before as a cartoon but Niki Caro’s Mulan, while familiar in plot, is a beautifully realized, action-packed visual spectacle that brings the ancient tale of personal struggle against great odds to life once again. Nell Minow: The shifting of the storyline to focus on the parallels between Mulan and the witch, two women who struggle to express their essential chi in a world that has rigidly limited expectations for women gives the film additional depth. Niki Caro keeps the film brimming with heart and sincerity so that even in the middle of battle scenes the focus is on what makes Mulan special — her dedication and loyalty even more than her skill and her chi. Cate Marquis As Disney has been busily remaking its animated films into live action ones, some have worked out better than others, but the live-action Mulan is a winner. In this new version, there are no songs, no dragon or cricket, but the film has a shape-shifting woman warrior/witch, more depth to the characters, sweeping action and wonderful vistas, and a distinctive feminist twist to the story.

Niki Caro keeps the film brimming with heart and sincerity so that even in the middle of battle scenes the focus is on what makes Mulan special — her dedication and loyalty even more than her skill and her chi. Cate Marquis As Disney has been busily remaking its animated films into live action ones, some have worked out better than others, but the live-action Mulan is a winner. In this new version, there are no songs, no dragon or cricket, but the film has a shape-shifting woman warrior/witch, more depth to the characters, sweeping action and wonderful vistas, and a distinctive feminist twist to the story.

"Oct 5, 2021",positive," Let’s get down to business: This isn’t one of Disney’s shot-for-shot, song-for-song live-action remakes. Rather, Niki Caro’s Mulan is a serious, often-intense reimagining of the ancient Chinese ballad that also inspired the studio’s 1998 animated hit. More Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Disney Princess story, it’s a beautifully filmed epic that gives Hua Mulan increased agency and confidence. Gone are the songs (catchy as they were), most of the romantic subplot, and the motor-mouthed dragon sidekick. In their place is the tale of a girl with a powerful chi whose spirit defies tradition. Mulan’s loving-but-traditional father (Tzi Ma) advises his daughter to hide her abilities in the interests of keeping the peace and presenting herself as a good matchmaking prospect. But Mulan (played by Crystal Rao as a child and Yifei Liu as a young woman) isn’t destined to be a meek, obedient wife. When the Imperial Army comes knocking, conscripting one able-bodied man from each family to fight invaders led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee), Mulan sneaks out in the middle of the night with her long-ago-wounded father’s armor and sword, determined to take his place and bring her family honor. These plot elements — and several others, from the big avalanche scene to Mulan’s foiled attempt at a solo dip in the lake — will be familiar to fans of the animated version. But Caro tweaks certain aspects of Mulan’s story and introduces new ones, too, in the interests of giving her heroine an even more firmly feminist trajectory. For example, here her potential love interest is a peer, rather than her commanding officer, which removes the iffy power dynamic of the earlier film. And a new character, shape-shifting witch Xianniang (Gong Li), is a strong, tragic woman whose experiences help Mulan understand why it’s so important for her to embrace who she really is. That moment of revelation may be the most important difference of all between the two films: Here, she decides when and how to tell the world her secret, rather than having it discovered as the result of a battlefield injury. She owns her story. Sandie Angulo Chen: Director Niki Caro has spent her career telling women’s stories, so it’s not a surprise that she does justice to the ancient Ballad of Mulan in Disney’s live-action retelling of the epic woman warrior tale. With an international cast of acclaimed Chinese actors, the new Mulan focuses on the protagonist’s personal growth, her acceptance of her power (her chi, which is usually thought of as a male trait), and her devotion and loyalty to family, friends, and homeland. Liu Yifei is terrific as the innocent, hopeful, but incredibly fierce Mulan, who feels compelled to save her son-less disabled father (the excellent Tzi Ma) by pretending to be a young man ready to enlist in the Imperial Army. While there aren’t a lot of laughs (and naturally, no cartoonish dragon sidekick), fans of the original will recognize several callbacks to the animated adventure. Li Gong deserves a shout-out as the Huns’ secret weapon, a powerful sorceress fighter who finds more recognition than animosity in Mulan’s abilities. This is a grown up, dramatic version of Mulan that elevates the empowering, feminist, and family-oriented overtones of the original. Pam Grady: A young woman in ancient China risks her life as well as her family’s honor when she takes to the battlefield in Disney’s opulent, action-packed epic. Mulan’s (Liu Yifei) future was written when she was born a girl. A good marriage is supposed to be her fate, but she takes after her warrior father Zhou (Tzi Ma) and when her country faces a new threat, she rewrites her destiny. Whale Rider‘s Niki Caro directs this $200-million production – the most expensive film to date helmed by a woman – and every dollar is reflected on screen. Thrilling fight choreography, an involving story, and lavish production values add up to rip-roaring adventure with a strong, resilient woman at its center. Light years from the traditional Disney princess, Mulan is a hero who may hail from olden times, but speaks to our own. Susan Wloszczyna: In the hands of Niki Caro, this live action version is a visually-stunning, well-written, high-action war epic that is must-see family entertainment. With a budget of $200 million, – the most for any film helmed by a female –  the high-flying stunts, the gorgeous scenery (courtesy of China and New Zealand), the highly choreographed battle scenes, the excellent special effects – all fairly scream that this is one impressive production. Read full review.  Kathia Woods Disney’s live-action films haven’t exactly been a winning formula. After Lion King, I wasn’t holding on to much hope that Mulan would be better; however, I was wrong. This is the best live-action film that Disney has made. The music and Mushu are gone but what we gain is a warrior. Liu Yifei is outstanding as Mulan. She brings a more serious persona to the screen. Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee, and Tzi Ma are also excellent. The cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning, and the costuming by Bina Daigeler equally strong. All the above make this film a winner. This version of Mulan gives young girls the most important lesson that they are good enough and strong enough. Embracing oneself is the ultimate victory. That is a message that will last much longer than a song. Leslie Combemale New Zealand director Niki Caro has been making gorgeous, meaningful films with messages of female empowerment for her entire career, and has the accolades and awards to prove it. Now she has brought Mulan to the screen, and it’s as powerful and moving as it is a wonder to the eye. ‘Girls Kicking Ass While Dressed Appropriately To Do So’ is my go-to action sub-genres, and Mulan, starring the dynamic and compelling Yifei Liu in the title role, will be added as essential viewing to a film category that, at long last, has started to expand. It is a disappointment that the pandemic means Caro won’t have the worldwide blockbuster she could have had. Folks looking for fun and girl power at the movies, however, can spend $30 for their whole family to see it in their home theaters, and do so in their jammies. Loren King Director Niki Caro’s live-action remake of Disney’s beloved 1998 animated Mulan is by far the most ambitious and rewarding of the studio’s recent remakes, including last year’s Aladdin and The Lion King. It remains faithful to the story, with its ancient origins, while giving it a modernity and a relevance that injects it with new life. It’s an old-fashioned battle epic with a solid female empowerment core. Read full review. MaryAnn Johanson I’m not a fan of Disney’s plan to do live-action remakes of its animated films, but if they will insist on it, here’s the way to do it: Give a young woman’s story to a female director. Niko Caro’s take on the legendary Chinese figure is refreshingly free of the sort of fetishization we often get when male directors take on female action heroes, and also eschews the exoticization of Asian women that often afflicts Western filmmaking. Yifei Liu as Mulan exudes pride, honor, and a strength both physical and psychological. She’s a wonderful role model for girls who aren’t much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations. Jennifer Merin  In Disney’s live action version of Mulan, director Niki Caro pares away the animated version’s cartoonish elements and cuts to the core of the ancient Chinese tale of a rebellious and courageous young women who defied traditional gender roles to become a heroic and honored warrior. The character of Mulan, as played by Yifei Liu, shines as an example of a woman who uses her strength and skills to claim equality in a social system ruled by men. She is an empowering role model for women to fulfill their personal ambitions and potential for leadership. The beautifully crafted film’s compelling story and exquisite production values are sure to make it a classic. Brava, Caro. Marina Antunes Stories of women overcoming great obstacles, embracing their power and finding their true path in the world, often at great threat to themselves and their families, are nothing new. The true tale of Mulan, the Chinese heroine who stood up the empire and ultimately saved them, has already seen life once before as a cartoon but Niki Caro’s Mulan, while familiar in plot, is a beautifully realized, action-packed visual spectacle that brings the ancient tale of personal struggle against great odds to life once again.

"Sep 13, 2021",positive," In a sign of early onset curmudgeonry, I missed the bus on that film, which has meant so much to so many in the years since it came out. I was too old, too male and too steeped in the legacy of the feudal Hong Kong and Chinese action classics Disney was drawing on to recognize Disney’s savvy reframing of the wuxia martial warfare genre for what it was: a flawed but watershed moment in Disney animation’s evolving commitment to inclusion, not only through providing tween girls with their own version of Joseph Campbell’s “hero’s journey,” but also via all the oddball transgendery the film contains.  The new MULAN is a straight up wuxia — no songs, next to no love stuff, and just enough sorcery and magic to keep the action sequences a bit unpredictable.  It’s more STAR WARS than LITTLE MERMAID, with Zhang Yimou’s muse, the tempestuous Gong Li, as as a witchy character without precedent in the animated source material — the female Darth Vader who tries to seduce Mulan (a likable Liu Yifei) into darkness. “Chi” — the Chinese word for the life force, or what an American drunkard might call “mojo”— stands in for the Force, and there’s a lot of aphoristic nonsense about being true to oneself and learning not to live a lie, which really is a legacy of Mouse factory script doctoring.  I think director Nikki Caro ought to be commended for making a brisk and thoroughly watchable piece of corporate art that has to be the unluckiest movie that isn’t called TENET in recent memory. Disney clearly saw this film as an international tentpole that could draw in the nostalgia trade, sell itself to a combined male and female audience skew on the basis of action and the princess-adjacent original, and wow them in the all important Chinese market.  The star-studded premiere was held on March 9, 2020. The belated US covid lockdowns began a week later. Theatrically speaking, the film was never released. It’s six months, one plague and a desperate general election ploy by the Bullhorn-in-Chief later, and we’re now supposed to believe that suspending disbelief for a movie celebrating a Chinese legend is an act of anti-MAGA treachery (lead actress Liu Yifei’s twitter support for the brutal police crackdown in Hong Kong is a repellant water muddier too). Expect a late night tweet declaring this movie part of a Biden-led anti incumbent plot, because it’s coming. Oh God is it coming.  But beyond the commendable feminism it inherited from Disney’s original, Mulan doesn’t have enough of a point of view to be a blunt instrument in the culture wars. It’s vaporous, but with its sweeping vistas and epic battlefields, it would have played a lot better in a theatre, if there were still theatres. Instead, MULAN has shuffled off to that graveyard of aspiration known as Disney+, where it will meet with the usual muted applause. We used to see a lot of Gong Li back in the 1990s, when she starred in what for me is still the greatest Chinese film ever made, Zhang’s Bergmanesque chamber piece RAISE THE RED LANTERN. It was one of their five follow-ups to the almost as great RED SORGHUM — a watershed of Asian cinema. Gong was an instant icon the way only a few actors before her have been — Loren, Brooks,  Daindridge, Karina, Gong’s contemporary Penelope Cruz. Like each of them, she was possessed equally by fire and ice.  Someone at Disney (perhaps Nikki Caro) has a love of that great and bygone era of Asian cinema, where masterworks were weekly occurrences if you knew where to look for them: art house cinemas, Chinatown mini-malls, bootleg DVD kiosks in grimy downtowns. Gong has made almost no films in the past decade. Yet she isn’t just sympathetically cast here, she’s showcased, allowed to run away with every scene she’s in, with her beauty and her acting gifts softened but intact. A shockingly aged Jet Li is on hand too — so far removed from his Hong Kong action heyday as the Chinese emperor Mulan defends that I literally did a double take when I realized from the credits that was him. And Jason Scott Lee, who once played Bruce Lee in a movie and was Disney’s live action Mowgli chews scenery rather delectably as a heavy who is even more broadly played than he was by a cartoon. All of these actors gave me great pleasure in a time when movies were a rare and unruly gateway to the complex pop cultural hall of mirrors that is Asian culture. Each filled their American devotees to the brim with visions of what heroism, empathy and sorrow look like to a Hong Kong cop or a Chinese laundress. I’ve come to believe that international movies serve a critical function in this era of rising ethno-nationalism, in that they make it harder to hate blindly when blind hate is called forth by the bitter politics of the now. Having loved Gong Li through Zhang’s camera the way Zhang surely did; having leapt from buildings wearing Jet Li’s raffish smile; I know something about the Chinese people that Donald Trump never will, which is that they cry and cheer for the same things I do, and that if you cut them they don’t just bleed, they bleed acrobats and opera. As Cold War the Sequel beckons, MULAN the Remake takes the form for me of an unintended requiem for a time where hope and amity weren’t a platitude but a kind of background hum in theatres showing scratchy prints of Cantonese language masterpieces to the metronomic tick of two audio tracks made of optical sound. I don’t yearn for that time exactly, but I do salute the cortege as it rumbles past. I can see nothing in the clouded future, but my memory of Gong Li’s face."
"Aug 31, 2021",negative,The stakes are lower... It's just not as strong a story.
"Aug 10, 2021",positive," I've long avoided Disney's live-action remakes. They strike me as some of the most creatively bankrupt content of the last decade. But ever since the first trailer for Mulan appeared more than a year ago, I thought this might be the one to bring some originality to the table and be worthy on its own merits. I was mostly right. Yifei Liu shines in the title role. She's already a star in China, but this should make her one in America as well. The loyal oldest daughter, Mulan rebels against the system that forces her to be only a wife and maiden, when her skills and drive show she's meant for much more. Yet she remains committed to honoring her family, even at the risk of her own happiness, and eventually her own life. When the emperor (Jet Li) institutes a military draft, her aging father (Tzi Ma) is forced to heed the call. This is basically a death sentence, as he's already feeble and almost certainly would be killed in battle. So Mulan flees under cover of nightfall with her father's armor and sword, joining the ranks with the other untrained boys. And while there are training montages galore, the songs are gone. That fits this more serious-minded war film, but it's only noticeable because the original had such great numbers as ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make a Man out of You."" And while there's also no Eddie Murphy-voiced dragon, the film still has its moments of comic relief, deploying them as needed. But the film is mostly dark, thanks to the ruthlessness of its villains Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and Xianning (Li Gong). Both actors have experience in martial arts films that serve them well. And director Niki Caro – the first woman to helm one of these live-action remakes – shows considerable skill with the action. She's already proven she can deliver emotional dramas (including Oscar nominees Whale Rider and North Country), but she rises to the occasion here, which should open doors to bigger projects. Director of Photography Mandy Walker (Hidden Figures) and the stunts team also excel. There's no doubt this movie – with its impressive costume design and epic scope – would have played better in a movie theater on a giant screen with perfect sound. But since that's not exactly safe right now, Disney made the right call, giving everyone a chance to see it early. Whether you want to pay $30 to access it is entirely up to you. But whenever you see it, you're finally seeing a live-action remake that's not a mere nostalgia play, visual effects show-off, or pointless exercise in profit-making. Mulan stands on its own, and it stands tall."
"Jul 27, 2021",neutral," “Loyal. Brave. True” These are the words repeated over and over again in Mulan, Disney’s live-action adaptation of the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, a girl who takes her father’s place in the Emperor’s Imperial army.  For many, the 1998 cartoon, also by Disney, was our first introduction to this tale of a young woman who would defy tradition and break all the rules to protect her father. We were excited to finally see the amazing fight sequences come to life, hear the amazing soundtrack once more, and see Li Shang in the flesh. Out of those three, we got one and a half…sorta. Directed by Niki Caro, Mulan is a mix of the real-life folk tale, and the animated interpretation. From the animation, we have references to characters like Crickey, the cute cricket that brought Mulan good luck in the funniest ways, the matchmaker, Mulan’s clumsy faux pas with the tea set, and Shan Yu’s hawk. I say references because what we have in the live-action aren’t exactly the same as the characters and scenes we know. Cricket is now a man played by Jun Yu, one of Mulan’s (Yifei Liu) comrades in the army. As for Shan Yu’s Hawk, she is also a human, a  witch named Xianniang (Li Gong). These changes are acceptable, to a degree because Caro and the writers want to ground the film in realism, but one change that doesn’t work is the use of qi. In Chinese philosophy, qi is a circulating life force contained within the human body. But here, it’s the explanation for everything that makes Mulan the person we were inspired by. In the animation and the legend, Mulan’s bravery and gumption come from her strength of character. It was her will to risk her life in joining the army and her tenacity to excel in training going against Shan Yu that made fans fall in love with her. She was an example that young girls and women could do anything we set out minds to, as long as we believed in ourselves, but this isn’t the case in Caro’s film. Here, it’s qi that’s responsible for Mulan’s – or Hua Jun as her alias has been changed from Ping – abilities as a fighter and ability to kick sharp objects with precise aim. Mulan isn’t the strong-willed girl because she was raised by loving parents, a father who encouraged her to be herself and believed that she would come into her own when the time was right. She’s amazing because she’s been blessed with a special gift that only boys are supposed to have, which as a premise is actually contradicted by Commander Tung (Donnie Yen). Because she possesses this qi, Mulan is told she must hide it, lest she brings dishonor on her family which would lead to exile. Herein lie the crux and failure of the entire film. Since qi has been set up as this mystical energy that women aren’t supposed to have, any woman who does, is automatically set up as an enemy of the male characters, as has been done with Xianniang. Banished by her people for her abilities, Xianniang is a woman filled with bitterness and the thirst for revenge. She sees men as weaklings whose narrow mindedness makes her view them as being beneath her. And to be honest, I don’t blame her. But rather than have Xiannang use her power to create the world she envisions where women can be who they want to be, she uses them in service of Bori Kahn (Jason Scott Lee) the leader of the Rourans, the mortal enemies of the Emperor (Jet Li), which is another contradiction within the film. If Xianniang is so powerful and despises men and everything they stand for, why is she helping them? Apart from the misconception of what qi is, the wasting of Li Gong and her talent’s on a character that wasn’t even necessary to the story, and the implication that without her qi, the live-action Mulan would be incapable of doing what legend and animated Mulan did (ironic right?), the film is dry. In a story where time is of the essence, Mulan feels like a slow slog over rough terrain, rather than a tension-filled action epic. In comparison, the animation is more gripping and entertaining. Even though it’s a live-action, there was no need to remove the humorous and light-hearted moments the animation is known for.  And I hate to say it, but this score doesn’t compare to Jerry Goldsmith’s original. Gone are the bold 80’s synth sounds and brass instruments that got us excited over what was taking place on the screen. There isn’t even a musical reference to “Make A Man Out of You” one of the most popular songs in the Disney pantheon or “True To Your Heart,” sung by 98° and Stevie Wonder in the end credits (the disrespect!). Instead, there are brief refrains of “Reflection,” and lyrics from the songs incorporated into the dialogue which sound forced and unnatural. That said, the best part of Mulan is the actors. Li does a fine job of playing a character struggling to hold back and conceal what comes most naturally to her. Lee has the right amount of intensity as Bori Khan, which prevents the character from feeling like…well…a cartoon villain. While there’s no Li Shang, we do have Hong Hui (Yoson An), a fellow soldier who sees and trusts Hua Jun, but like the other’s he isn’t given much to work with story-wise. And of course, Ming Na Wen makes an all too brief appearance, to the delight of everyone. Though the film is pretty to look at, the scenery, colorful costumes, and famous actors aren’t enough to hold one’s attention for the entire two-hour runtime. With the caliber of actors gathered, I just wish their characters had been given more depth. For a film that’s pretty lengthy, it feels as though nothing much happens overall. The writing fails them, the fans, and ultimately Mulan herself because it is neither loyal to the story, feels brave, nor true to who she is.

"Jul 13, 2021",positive," Directed by Niki Caro, Mulan was initially scheduled to premiere in theaters this year, bringing its story of a young woman destined to be a legendary warrior to the biggest screens possible. Ideally, audiences would have been able to soak in its vibrant colors, stunning natural vistas, and spectacular choreography while star Liu Yifei delivers a performance as compelling as it is exciting. But alas, that’s not the world we live in right now, and Disney wisely chose to prioritize the health and safety of audiences by sending Mulan straight to streaming service Disney+ as the first big test of its Premier Access service, which lets subscribers see first-run films for an additional fee. It’s a commendable decision — particularly for a film that cost more than $200 million to make — and will hopefully be a sign of things to come as Hollywood continues to deal with the industry-rattling effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. And yet, even after watching Mulan in a well-equipped home theater, I can’t help wishing there was the opportunity to see the film on a massive, state-of-the-art screen despite my strong feelings about the danger posed by indoor cinemas right now. Fortunately, Mulan offers a rewarding experience no matter what type of screen you see it on. A live-action remake of the 1998 animated feature of the same name, Mulan delivers more than just spectacle, thanks to its immensely talented star, Liu Yifei. Liu handles the story’s quiet moments as comfortably as its most elaborate scenes, adding just the right amount of nuance and emotion to Mulan’s struggle to weigh her boundless enthusiasm against the restrictive expectations her family and community place on young women. Mulan’s life is a balancing act that has her abiding by traditional Chinese culture and exploring the tremendous potential of her chi, the energy she harnesses to perform amazing feats of acrobatic skill. It’s those amazing feats that lead her father (portrayed by The Farewell actor Tzi Ma) to a moral quandary as he tries to reconcile his daughter’s gifts with the traditional expectation of quiet subservience placed on women her age. To abandon the latter would lead to dishonor for the family, and Tzi delivers a strong performance as his character struggles with the idea of sacrificing his daughter’s potential to protect their family. Mulan’s decision to pose as a man and join the Emperor’s war against the invading Rouran legions follows the basic premise of the film’s animated source material, but the story incorporates more modern themes in ways that help in making Liu’s performance feel fresh and contemporary despite being set during the Han dynasty. This willingness to take an old story in new, timely directions makes Mulan feel like the least Disney-esque of the studio’s live-action adaptations of its animated films so far, and elevates it above the typical rehash of well-worn tales. Although Caro’s film does a nice job of setting itself apart from its animated predecessor both thematically and tonally, it’s in the action sequences and choreography where Liu and Mulan shine the brightest. The film’s cast features quite a few veterans of martial arts cinema, including Jet Li (as the Emperor of China) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story actor Donnie Yen (as the leader of the Imperial Army and Mulan’s mentor). Although they’re each given a brief scene or two to showcase their skills, it’s Liu who steals every action scene she’s given with a sense of calm control that makes her extraordinary action scenes seem even more wonderful to behold. In fact, it’s when she’s showing the least regard for the laws of physics that Liu seems the most comfortable as Mulan — making her performance and the choreography that makes it possible that much more impressive. As the film’s primary villain, Jason Scott Lee is given some opportunity to show off his own action skills, and the actor who once portrayed martial arts legend Bruce Lee in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story makes good use of the limited time he’s given. There’s a widely held belief that Hollywood’s best heroes tend to come from films with memorable villains, but Mulan defies that old adage by making Lee’s savage character, Bori Khan, almost an afterthought in Mulan’s ascension. If there’s anyone who does manage to steal a scene or two from Liu, it’s Gong Li as the shapeshifting witch Xian Lang, whose own struggle for recognition in a world ruled by men offers a dark reflection of Mulan’s journey. Gong is at the center of several fantastic, effects-driven sequences in Mulan that add to the film’s visual splendor, and her performance is both subtle in all the right ways and gloriously over the top when the moment calls for it. From its wonderfully filmed action sequences to its supremely talented star, Mulan checks off all the boxes for a Hollywood hit and another win for Disney in its mission to recycle every animated feature made by the studio. Simply calling it a remake of the 1998 movie does it a disservice, though, as Mulan accomplishes something Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and many of Disney’s other live-action remakes weren’t willing or able to do: It makes its story feel fresh and timely. That’s no small feat, given the film’s historical setting and well-worn story, but what Liu brings to the role and the way it makes Mulan’s experiences relatable give it a presence outside typical remake territory. That’s why it’s such a shame that Mulan isn’t likely to have the same opportunity to impress audiences that other films — Disney and non-Disney alike — have received in recent years. It boasts some of the most gorgeous sequences, sets, and scenery you’ll find in a film these days, and yet somehow the power of its story and its lead actress’ performance still manage to feel bigger than all of that eye candy. Disney+ may have developed a reputation for being the mothership for all things MCU and Star Wars, but the streamer is home to so much more. Most notably, it's filled with classic Disney movies and TV shows, as well as hit films throughout the years that were released by Disney and 20th Century Fox (which Disney now owns). Its library has also amassed a good amount of holiday content, so on top of being filled with superheroes and spaceships, Disney+ is also a go-to for anyone who loves the Christmas season. The vast majority of American comic book fans may have very little familiarity with Judge Dredd, a character who has headlined the weekly comics serial, 2000 AD for 46 years. However, Dredd is considered to be an iconic character in British comics, and fans in the U.K. can't seem to get enough of his sci-fi adventures in the far future of Mega-City One (which spans most of the East Coast of the former United States of America). In this world, there are no police. There are only those who serve as judge, jury, and executioner. And among the Judges, Judge Joseph Dredd is considered to be the very best. Judge Dredd's popularity was so great that Sylvester Stallone headlined the first Judge Dredd movie in 1995. But that movie toned down the edges that made Judge Dredd so compelling, and the film even gave Dredd a wacky sidekick played by Rob Schneider. So perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that Judge Dredd isn't currently on any streaming service. Conversely, the 2012 reboot, Dredd, is currently enjoying a massive surge in popularity after it joined the top 10 most popular movies on Netflix. When you think of Disney, the first thing you think of probably isn't science fiction. Over its long history as a dream factory, Disney has been known first and foremost for fairytales and flights of fancy, but science fiction and futurism have always been central to the Disney project.

"Jun 5, 2021",negative," After such massive financial successes as Beauty and the Beast and especially last year’s The Lion King, it was of course highly unlikely that Disney would stop mining their history of beloved animated classics for live-action remakes. And given that they rather shamelessly marketed the former as a feminist re-invention (it wasn’t) and reconfigured the latter as a celebration of Blackness (it isn’t), how surprised should we be that now Mulan has been positioned as both another feminist re-invention and a hallmark of diversity? Also unsurprising is the fact that it’s neither of those things, but instead just another instance of a studio paying some very play-it-safe lip-service to representation in a pretty transparent attempt to secure more market share. Based, of course, on the fondly-remembered 1998 Mouse House cartoon musical, this new Mulan strips out all of the songs (not to mention the wisecracking dragon and the vaguely queer subtext) in favor of a western audience-friendly wuxia redesign, owing a lot more to something like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than anything else. Young Hua Mulan (Yiu Lifei) disguises herself as a man to fight in her war-hero father’s place for the Emperor against the Northern invaders. Whereas the original was a chatty, largely comic affair about a young woman’s self-actualization, this Mulan embraces a more earnest story of using innate power (in this case her Qi) to serve the country’s destiny, a rather ooky — and deliberate — concession to nationalism that probably assured Disney’s ability to get this past Chinese censors. It also probably helped that so many famous Chinese and Chinese-American performers are present here. Li Gong, one of the most beloved actresses in Asia and a staple of (director of Hero and the 2008 Olympics opening ceremonies) Yimou Zhang’s cinema, appears as an enigmatic sorceress. Tzi Ma, who’s had a long supporting career in American films (from Rush Hour to The Farewell), is Mulan’s father. The legendary Donnie Yen is Mulan’s commanding officer, and the equally amazing Jet Li is completely wasted as the Emperor. With all that representation in front of the camera, it’s disheartening to find such a lack behind it. Niki Caro seems to have been chosen as an acceptable compromise — at least this isn’t helmed by another white dude director — but some Chinese or Asian production crew, director, or at least writers might have gone a long way to inject some meaningful cultural insight here instead of the banal Chinese stereotypes of “honor” and “family.” What’s more, this wuxia-influenced tale of a female knight almost completely disregards the very rich history of Chinese martial arts films about virtuous swordswomen (not to mention concubines or female students or soldiers — watch 1964’s Beyond the Great Wall, a truly tragic, nationalistic, and feminist work of Chinese cinema). Even Chang Pei-pei, star of the seminal martial arts film Come Drink With Me, gets dragged into this mess with a wasted cameo as a grumpy matchmaker, a big come-down from her incredible turn as the villainess of the far more reverent Crouching Tiger. And while accounting for the film’s disappointments, it must be said that the action here — easily the source of its greatest conceptual promise — is adequate at best. There is no reasonable explanation, other than token representation from Hollywood-familiar faces, to hire athlete/performers like Li or Yen if the visual strategy is to simply indulge in green-screen spectacle and medium shots of characters battling dozens of enemies that are just out of frame. There’s no way a proper stunt team wasn’t available for real wirework or martial arts training; cycling through alternating slow-motion and speed-ramped shots of people walking on walls does not a wuxia make. Mulan merely cribs from its vast cinematic legacy, dilutes it with marketable window-dressing, and then expects to be congratulated for all that half-assed representation."
"Apr 29, 2021",positive," Some of the recent Disney life-action remakes - and Aladdin, I am definitely looking at you - are little more than pale imitations of the original animations, losing their charm in translation. But this reimagining of Mulan, thankfully, is up there with David Lowery's Pete's Dragon in finding something fresh to say with the material by jettisoning the songs and the emphasis on comedy in favour of bringing its more emotional and adventurous themes to the fore. Whale Rider director Niki Caro (working from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Laurent Hynek and Elizabeth Martin), draws on the fine martial arts tradition of Chinese wuxia to give this tale of a young woman who disguises herself as a man to save her father from battle an epic sweep. Where the 1998 animation played the gender differences down purely stereotypical lines, and already feels dated in its outlook, this version finds much more nuance, with the choices of Mulan (played with verve by Yifei Liu) being as much to do with family honour as they are with the fact that she's female. When a man from each household is called to serve in the army by the emperor (Jet Li), Mulan - who we see feels the Force (Chi in this case, although Star Wars fans will feel right at home) takes up her elderly father's (Tzi Ma) sword in the night to spare him from the fight. This fresh-faced army must train to take on Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), who is bent on vengeance and has the handy help of a shapeshifting ""witch""  Xianniang (Gong Li), who is embittered after years of being ostracised for her powers. Of course, Mulan faces the threat of being caught out in her lie, particularly at shower time, which provides a few lighter moments, but the action largely centres on how resilient and self-assured she is in even in the face of this. There's a warm sense of pulling together in this film - where the animation constantly highlighted male/female differences for cheap laughs, this one instead shows the unifying force of camaraderie and highlights the fact that many of the perceived differences matter little in the heat of battle. Xianniang is a great addition offering a sort of tempting 'dark side' to Mulan's light, with Li's nuanced performance making her a lot more complex than simply an 'evil stepmother' type as we see how years of being an outcast have brought her to this. The scriptwriters also subtly beef up the women's roles in other ways, so that we see the perceptions of what is expected of her as 'a young woman' are more societal than the fault of her father. The story, however,  is really here to serve the action - which sweeps in on waves of impressive family-friendly set-piece battles that favour balletic intensity over bloodshed. Where live action has fallen short of the versatility of the animation in other remakes, here there are no such problems, with wire work and aerial and horse trick shots flowing freely in ways that make you wish that Covid hadn't stopped the film getting the big screen treatment it truly deserves. The graceful addition of a phoenix, symbolising the spirit of Mulan's ancestors, also adds a mystical touch, without being oversentimental and counterpoints well with Xianniang's eagle transformation. This has been made firmly with family audiences in mind  but while it may mean it treats some of its weightier themes lightly, it proves no barrier to spectacle."

"Mar 16, 2021",negative,"I can only describe Mulan as a visually spectacular disappointment. Void of any emotional resonance, the film eschews coherent storytelling for what amounts to an Orientalist war epic masquerading as a feminist win for Asians everywhere."
"Feb 10, 2021",positive," We've got yet another offering from Disney+ that we thought we'd see at a theater. But hey, 30 bucks later, and here we are. Talking the Mulan remake. You did it, Walt. Congrats. How was the movie though? Listen and find out! "
"Feb 5, 2021",positive,"  For the most part, Disney’s grand experiment of making live action versions of their classic animated films has not been a success. Sure, it’s made them oodles of money, but creatively the movies have been less than fulfilling, either being little more than shot-for-shot remakes or uninspired retellings of stories we know and love.  When the trailer for the new Mulan came out, it was immediately clear that it would be something different. In fact, it bore little resemblance to the animated musical, with no hint of low-brow shtick or even songs. For all intents and purposes, it looked as if director Niki Caro and writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, and Lauren Hynek would treat the story with gravity and purpose.  I’m happy to say that is exactly what they delivered. The base story remains the same: When the Chinese Army conscripts one man from every family to fight against invaders, Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) secretly steps in for her ailing father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma). Properly disguised as a man, Mulan joins the army and quickly impresses with her level of dedication and skill, especially when she goes up against fellow soldier Honghui (Yoson An).  The invaders have some truly intimidating people leading them, including the fearsome Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and Xianniang (Gong Li), a witch who can transform into a bird. As Mulan rises in the ranks of the army, the invaders get ever closer to accomplishing their goal of overthrowing the emperor (Jet Li).  Caro and her team, taking inspiration from any number of fantastical Chinese action movies, go all-in with fight scenes that are both exciting and beautiful. The fluidity of the movements, the creativity of the staging, and more make the sequences a wonder to behold. For many, it will their first exposure to the type of scenes seen in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and the accessibility of Mulan’s story makes it a great entry point.  While the film is kid-friendly, it’s not aimed strictly at children, as evidenced by its PG-13 rating. There is no blood, but the violence in the film is definitely stepped up over your typical Disney outing. It also stays true to the goal of building up a strong woman while still maintaining her femininity. Mulan is fierce, determined, devoted to her family, and alluring, with all of those elements combining to paint a full picture of a woman at a time when women were usually subjugated.  The film pays homage to the cutesy elements of the first film without actually going down that road itself. Gone is the dragon Mushu, both because he doesn’t mesh with the story at large and because he was considered culturally insensitive. The sidekick Cri-kee, an actual cricket in the original film, is reimagined as a slightly goofy fellow soldier named Cricket (Jun Yu), who brings humor to the film without undercutting the drama.  What many fans of the original may miss the most are the songs, but their absence makes complete sense. Having these particular characters break into song would break the spell that the rest of the film casts. Still, Caro and composer Harry Gregson-Williams know they can’t get rid of the familiar music completely, which is why snippets of music from the popular song “Reflection” are woven in throughout, and actual reflections of Mulan pop up at key moments in clever ways. There are also full versions of the song sung by Christina Aguilera in English (an updated one from her 1998 version) and Liu in Mandarin during the end credits (Aguilera also sings a new song, “Loyal Brave True”).  The film features familiar faces like Tzi Ma, Jason Scott Lee, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, and Rosalind Chao, but Liu is the star through-and-through. She brings everything you could want to the role and more, exhibiting the spirit of Mulan in multiple ways. Yoson An offers great support as a rival/slight love interest, and it’s easy to see him gaining more work in English should he desire it. Mulan is easily the best live action remake Disney has put out, both because the story lent itself well to taking out cartoonish elements, and because the filmmakers put in the work toward making it stand out. Seeing it on the big screen would have been great, but streaming it through Disney+ is still worth every penny. Editor's note: A lot happened this week, so here's your chance to get caught up.

"Jan 29, 2021",positive," 
	The last time we saw the story of Mulan, a young woman who disguised herself as a man to enlist herself in the Imperial Army in place of her ailing father, it was in the form of an action musical that was Disney's first animated film to feature an Asian heroine. 
	Twenty-two years later, Disney has dropped the songs and upped the body count in ""Mulan,"" a live action remake, featuring an all-Asian cast and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" producer Bill Kong behind the scenes. The movie premieres this week on the Disney+ streaming service. 
	Based on a sixth century legend called ""Ballad of Mulan,"" the new film lets go of many of the stereotypes that marred the animated version, hewing more closely to the traditional tale. Set in China during the Han dynasty in a quiet village, the story follows Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei), the martial arts-trained eldest daughter of famed warrior Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma). 
	When the Emperor of China (Jet Li), fearing a threat from the invading Rouran army, led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee), a skilled warrior fuelled by anger over his father's death and shape-shifting witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), he orders the conscription of one man from every household in the land to form a mighty militia. 
	As the father of all daughters, Fa Zhou volunteers but is in no shape to go to war. Unbeknownst to him, Mulan disguises herself as a man and enrols, risking her life and the dishonour of her family if she is discovered. 
	""Mulan"" doesn't feel like the other recent Disney live action do-overs. It is different enough in style, emotional content and tone from the animated movie to be a stand-alone with only a tenuous connection to the past. 
	Director Niki Caro drags the story into the 21st century, emphasizing themes of female empowerment, allowing Mulan find her own inner strength and potential and not rely on a Disney prince. The sparks that flew between Li Shang and Mulan in the original are mostly absent — as her commanding officer, the power imbalance was deemed inappropriate for 2020 — and have been replaced by platonic love interest Chen Honghui (Yoson An). 
	The reported budget of US$200 million is very much evident on the screen. The gorgeously shot Wuxia-style action scenes are epic, and for the family audience, relatively bloodless considering how many people are dispatched by Mulan's deadly blade. Occasionally they fall prey to a heavy hand from editor David Coulson, but the sheer size and scope of them, even on the scaled down Disney+ television presentation, are eye-popping. A more intimate climax with life-or-death consequences for Bori Khan, Mulan or the Emperor, is a nicely rendered showdown that effectively delivers a good, exciting mix of action and character dynamics. 
	""Mulan"" is a welcome addition to the Disney remake roster. It plays like a grown-up version of the animated film, bringing the story into the modern age, while keeping the family appeal intact. 
	Academy Award winner Charlie Kaufman scripted ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" mind-bending movies that essay themes of identity crisis, mortality and the meaning of life through a metaphysical or parapsychological filter. His latest project, ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things,"" an adaptation of Iain Reid's bestselling novel and now streaming on Netflix, fits on the shelf next to his best-known work. It's a fascinating road trip—and head trip—that is equal parts unsettling atmosphere and tension. 
	Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons play a new couple on a road to trip to visit his parents at their rural farm. Although she has misgivings about the relationship, and is thinking about calling it quits, they seem well suited, playfully singing show tunes and talking as they stay just ahead of threatening snow squalls. 
	The storm intensifies after they reach the farm and the couple are snowed in with his welcoming but eccentric parents, mother (Toni Collette) and father (David Thewlis). As the group gets to know one another over an awkward dinner, the young woman — who is never identified by name — has feelings of unease that intensify as questions arise about her boyfriend's mental health. 
	""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" is a cerebral, slow-burn story of suspense and menace anchored by four terrific performances. Collette and Thewlis are wonderfully weird, bringing these strange, somewhat inappropriate characters to vivid life without giving away spoilers as to what's to come. Plemons is well cast as the all-American boy with a secret, but it is Buckley who dominates. The role is written internal, and much of the interesting stuff happens in her head, but her work is never cold or clinical. She brings warmth to the character as the very fabric of her psyche is being challenged. It's a long strange trip, but Buckley's exploration of the frailty of the human spirit is compelling. 
	As director and screenwriter Kaufman takes his time, allowing the characters to mix and mingle, physically and perhaps mentally, and the suspense to build. It's a tricky dance. He dispenses just enough information to move the story forward while creating an atmosphere that grows until the film's final 20, trippy minutes. Kaufman artfully brings the movie's themes of regret and longing into focus with a bizarre and beautiful climax. 
	Based on Bill Keenan's bestselling hockey memoir of the same name, ""Odd Man Rush,"" available digitally and on demand, stars Jack Mulhern as a hockey player with NHL dreams who ends up in Sweden's minor pro league. 
	Mulhern is Bobby Sanders, a hockey-obsessed young man whose dreams of big-time sports stardom are dashed by injury. Despite surgeries and being banged up, he plays in Europe on the periphery of pro hockey and is eventually traded to a team in Sweden. He's living his dream, but then he starts a relationship with Elin (Elektra Jannson Kilbey), a woman he meets at the local market. His love of the game never subsides, but Elin and problems with an old injury make him re-evaluate his priorities and just who he would be without a hockey stick in his hands. 
	""Odd Man Rush"" is an ode to everyone who has ever put on pads with dreams of NHL glory dancing about in their heads. Which is pretty much everyone who has ever played hockey. Sanders is the guy we don't hear about very often, the grinder who wasn't destined for greatness. That point of view differentiates ""Odd Man Rush"" from most other sports stories. 
	It's a movie that loves the underdog and the game. Hockey kids like Trevor Gretzky and Alexa Lemieux, daughter of Mario Lemieux, make appearances alongside cameos by former NHL player and referee Paul Stewart and Edmonton Oilers associate coach Jim Playfair, which add authenticity to the storytelling. 
	Filmed in some of the same locations as 70's sweary hockey-film ""Slap Shot,"" ""Odd Man Rush"" spends a great deal of time on the ice but, like so many sports films, it's not actually about the game. It explores universal questions of dream-fulfilment and how much of oneself you give to that dream, thoughts most of us have had whether we've ever played shinny or not. 
	The story of ""Feels Good Man,"" a new documentary now on VOD, begins with ""Boy's Club,"" a comic series about four characters, including Pepe the Frog, in what artist Matt Furie called the ""post college zone."" He based the quartet on the personalities of he and his friends. They don't have a plan for their lives, but they do know they enjoy drinking and hanging out. 
	After publishing on MySpace for a time, Pepe's catchphrase, ""Feels good man,"" caught on. Memes started to pop up on other sites and one fan even wrote a song about Pepe's habit of pulling his pants all the way to the ground when he stood to pee. 
	Pepe was discovered by the users at 4chan, a website described as ""a Darwinian competition for attention,"" where the most popular posts float to the top of the page, earning the most replies. Others sink to the bottom and fade away. Like a video game, but unlike other social sites, it is a winning and losing system that fostered a culture of anonymous, but nonetheless attention-hungry users. One 4chan user says it is a place to express things you don't feel comfortable saying in real life. Memes help the posts stand out and Pepe, the slacker frog, was co-opted by people who liked his expressive face — Sad Frog, Smug Frog, Angry Pepe, Feels Frog, and ""You will never..."" Frog — but didn't know anything about ""Boy's Club"" or Furie's work. 
	Nonetheless, Pepe's popularity grew and soon he had a clothing line and pop stars like Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry were paying tribute. ""Pepe had escaped and he was roaming around and it was fun for a while… until it wasn't anymore,” Furie says. 
	The 4chan community, upset that Pepe was no longer theirs and theirs alone, began making the memes as distasteful as possible. ""It's so offensive, it can't be co-opted."" Images of Pepe with swastikas and highly racialized language began to appear. The character's simplicity and malleability made him a perfectly adaptable figure for memes and videos. 
	What began as an innocent icon of harmless hedonism was then adopted by white supremacist and incel groups. By the time Donald Trump retweeted a meme of himself as Pepe, Furie had lost control of his own creation. ""I think that President Trump is a real-life version of Pepe,"" says Look Ahead America executive director and photo data expert Matt Braynard, ""in his ability to illicit a reaction, get attention and express people's hopes and fears."" 
	""Feels Good Man"" details how Pepe the Frog went from benign entertainment to an ultimate representation of internet troll culture. As a writer for The Atlantic says, ""Pepe allows [the alt-right] to pretend they are kidding but they are not kidding. They want you to be both scared by the threat and be mocked for being scared in the first place. To cause psychic anguish."" 
	Furie was horrified. As an artist who wanted to write children's books, Pepe was an albatross around his neck, both for his reputation and his finances. A huge order of merchandise, destined for mainstream stores, had to be destroyed, lest it wind up in the hands of white supremacist groups. Furie worked to reclaim Pepe, reframing him as an avatar of love and happiness, not hate. But as an internet security expert tells him, ""That's a tough genie to put back in the bottle."" 
	Pepe's reputation rehabilitation eventually takes the form of lawsuits against Alex Jones and his ilk, but the interesting stuff here isn't about the copyright infringement or intellectual property fights, it's about Pepe as an omen — an unexpected sign that things are changing in ways many can't quite understand. ""It was a warning that something was shifting in society, that something had gone wrong,"" says scholar John Michael Greer. ""We need to listen, because it's not going to go away."" 
	""Feels Good Man"" is part cautionary tale, part culture war study and part story of the reclamation of art. Its brisk pace, aided by interesting talking heads and loads of animation, entertainingly breezes through the details of the various subcultures that aligned to subvert Furie's creation on the world stage. 
	Set in the near future, the action begins during an important presentation for Red Eye, a new device capable of accessing memories. ""A contact lens,"" announces inventor Conrad Stallman (Neil Napier) at the product launch, ""that records not what the eye can see but what the mind can remember. 
	""We are made up of our experiences and the memories of those experiences. Now, your memories are no longer a thing of the past. Be where you remember being. See old friends, family."" 
	Stallman's sales pitch is compelling, but backstage there are problems. ""It's not ready,"" says Red Eye's head programmer Elise Perrott (Michelle Thrush) as she scurries away, returning to her lab. There she gives her best friend, Metis researcher Margo Elson (Tommie-Amber Pirie), the secret password for her work computer. ""Consider yourself my back up plan,"" she says ominously. 
	The next morning, after a tormented sleep, Margo awakens to the news that Elise has been found dead in her lab of an apparent suicide. 
	Investigating the case is Thomas Elliot (Greg Bryk), a troubled police officer who, when asked if he is the detective on the case, snarls, ""Til someone tells me otherwise."" He's a tough guy who drinks expired milk and has a habit doing things like inexplicably kicking open the already open door to Elise's apartment. ""You know you could have just asked me for the key to the door,"" says Margot, arriving a second later. Or perhaps he could have just used the doorknob, but either way, he's a walking cliché. The two agree to work together, he'll do the police work, she'll help him navigate the high-tech aspects of Elise's work. 
	Secrets abound and there's suspicion and skullduggery around every corner. The brand-new technology has a serious glitch, a shady multi-national security company is hiding something and Thomas has more baggage than the cargo hold of a 747. But there's more. A hacker named Jade Drayton (Madison Walsh) hints at something huge. ""You've wandered into a war no one knows is being waged. A war of conscience and knowledge."" 
	A return to Margo's childhood home, the scene of trauma, forces her to confront old memories that may hold the key to solving the mystery of Elise's death. 
	Benjamin Ross Hayden, the Métis director, writer, producer and actor from Calgary, weaves together a story that embraces new and old. Margo is a scientist but it is her connection to and belief in Indigenous traditions that gives her the inner strength to get to the bottom of the mystery of ""Parallel Minds."" 
	Cliched and melodramatic dialogue mars the film, which is a shame because the female characters have great promise. Margo, Jade and Elise are interesting people and the engines that keep ""Parallel Minds"" moving forward. 
	""Parallel Minds"" shows promise. There are many cool ideas here, but they are hampered by a modest budget unable to realize the set pieces Hayden offers up. There's stylish photography and some good location work, but the film's ambition outstrips its execution."
"Jan 28, 2021",negative," There is a lot of pressure riding on ""Mulan"", Disney's latest live-action adaption. For one, its $200 million price tag, even with a traditional release, would have required a lot of Millennials to rush to the theater. Factor in a global pandemic, a sliding economy and no tangible end in sight, and Disney's best hope in recouping their money is by charging $29.99 to those who already pay for a Disney+ subscription. ""Mulan"" tells the story of the titular character, Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu), a young girl living in rural China. She has a very particular skillset, an inner power that translates to grace, agility and strength. As a child, she flies down shingled roofs, gliding from one end to another like a wireless trapeze artist. However, a woman's place in traditional Chinese culture is to be neither seen nor heard, and as such, Mulan must dim her shine to accommodate everyone's expectation of her, particularly her father's. In such a repressive society, the only way she can bring honor to her family is to impress the matchmaker and nab a husband, a seemingly innocuous task that proves impossible from the smart, free-spirited Mulan.  Meanwhile, the Rourans, a fearsome tribe of barbarians led by hulking, scar-faced Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) alongside the witch Xianniang (Li Gong) whom he has enslaved to do his bidding, have overtaken a northern outpost and are a threat to the rest of China. The Emperor decrees that one man from every family must join his Imperial Army to defend the nation and its people. Mulan's father (Tzi Ma), though an honored warrior, is old, weak and incapable of surviving another fight, though he willingly registers lest his absence brings dishonor to his family. Mulan makes the courageous decision to dress in her father's armor, steal his sword and sneak out in the dead of night. With her chest strapped down tight and her voice lowered to an unconvincing growl, she joins the Imperial Army in her father's place. There, she learns archery and is pushed to her limits, that is, until she allows her true potential to rear its gorgeous, kick-ass head. When she can fly past swords and shoots arrows with the kick of her foot, only then has Mulan found her true self once more. She is the only hope the Emperor has in facing off with another powerful female force and the evil brute behind the vengeful plan. I say this with pure irony: ""Mulan"" needs to give us a smile. The film is humorless and heavy. It ditches the musical numbers and ample comic relief of the animated version, from Cricket to Mushu to nearly every male character, save the villain and  love interest. This iteration takes itself very seriously. It's hard to enjoy even a well-known, well-loved story when the film focuses too much on aesthetics and hardly at all on character development and relationships. It moves quickly through plot development that it frequently feels like we are skimming through the story. In this way, Mulan herself is like a stranger by the time the credits roll, and her comrades in the army are bumbling fools whose true underbellies are never revealed. It is refreshing to see the studio at least try to make this one different from their 1998 hit, turning our heroine into a martial arts master, an aspect of the film that really works and gives ample credit to wuxia films that came before it (think the wired acrobats of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). Director Niki Caro alongside cinematographer Mandy Walker bring a female perspective that is necessary and often overlooked in a film with a strong female lead, particularly one who moves and acts like a moral, sword-wielding super hero. But ""Mulan"" is ultimately a disappointment, unrecognizable for fans of the original and offering very little for those looking for a film that stands upright on its own merit."
"Jan 27, 2021",positive," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Mulan” might not have had the commercial or critical success of other animated movies from Disney’s 1990s glory days. But from a cultural standpoint, the film was just as, perhaps more, significant as “The Little Mermaid” or “Beauty and the Beast” because it gave young Asian American girls a Disney princess all their own. That made it easier to overlook concerns about the movie’s racist caricatures, appropriation of Chinese culture, and gender norms, which were outdated even for 1998. Not to mention, it failed to meet the true measure of a good Disney movie: all of the songs, save for one (“Reflection”), are completely forgettable. So, the studio was wise to ditch the source material and start over for the live-action “Mulan,” streaming on Disney+ starting Friday for $29.99. Representation indeed matters, but so does entertainment value, especially at this price point. The new version, like the original, is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, which dates back all the way to the fifth century. If you’re expecting a wise-cracking dragon named Mushu voiced by Eddie Murphy to show up, this isn’t that movie. When we meet her, Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, is an independent, free-spirited girl living in a close, tight-knitted village. She is one with her Qi, portrayed here as sort of the Chinese version of the Force and which gives her a particular set of skills that would make her a great warrior. But because she is a girl, she is told to repress her Qi and instead agree to an arranged marriage and “bring honor” to her family. Fans of the original will get a kick out of the matchmaker scene. While completely reimagined, it’s still one of just a few instances of fan service-- keep your ears on the music playing in the background of the scene and don’t miss a surprise cameo at the end of the film, too. Shot-for-shot callbacks bogged down live-action versions of “Beauty and the Beast, "" “Aladdin” and “The Lion King,” so it’s a good thing “Mulan” gets it out of its system early on. From there, war breaks out in the country, forcing each family to send one man to join the fight. Mulan, loyal, brave but not exactly true, disguises herself as a boy and runs off to take her ailing father’s place in the Imperial Army. The film wanders into familiar territory in the base camp scenes, from the awkward situations typical of gender disguise movies to the standard “Rocky”-style training montage from every underdog movie. The story finally finds its groove when the battalion is sent to fight and Mulan is forced to reveal her true identity. Director Niki Caro (“Whale Rider”) deserves credit for bringing “Mulan” not only into the real-ish world, but giving it a modern sensibility and level of authenticity. Her heroine is already strong, gifted and empowered at the jump, and doesn’t need a man, as the song goes, to make a man out of her. Instead, the script gives Mulan an unlikely ally, a witch played by Gong Li, for a more feminist bent. The new version also disposes of Li Shang, Mulan’s shirtless and somewhat problematic supervisor/love interest with Donny Osmond’s singing voice from the cartoon. Yoson An as Honghu takes his place in a relationship that’s more platonic. The original “Mulan” is one of the few Disney animated films with a body count. Still, this version is darker and more violent than you’d expect even in 2020 given the target audience. And, unlikely as it sounds, the film is much more of an action movie than it is a fairy tale. Caro brings the high-energy of a Jason Bourne movie and the gravity-defying flair of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” to the fight sequences. Disney clearly wanted to broaden the film’s appeal and the presence of martial arts stars Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Jason Scott Lee certainly add gravitas to the proceedings. For hodophiles, the film is gorgeously shot and does justice to the beauty of China and New Zealand, where the movie was also shot. It’s a shame the film isn’t playing on the big screen. But the movie is far from perfect. The message, while admirable, is surface-level deep, and the film is fraught with cliches and one-dimensional characters. There’s a noticeable lack of emotion that Christina Aguilera belting a few bars of “Reflection” could’ve easily fixed. The release of “Mulan” has been delayed several times, yet its arrival this weekend comes at just the right moment. This is an aspirational film, for Asian Americans and young women. That makes it relevant, particularly in these divided times. But more than that, the movie, with its heroic story, intense action and sweeping scenery, is an unexpected epic-- the kind of escapism all of us could use right now. In those ways, consider “Mulan” priceless. “Mulan” is available to Disney+ subscribers who unlock Premier Access for $29.99 starting Sept. 4.

"Dec 31, 2020",neutral," Oz Perkins’ take on the classic Brothers Grimm fairytale, albeit with a switcheroo in the title, delivers a darker take on a familiar story. What Perkins brings to this table are beautiful visuals - at times, haunting in their execution - a gloomy atmosphere and a story told through Gretel which ends up being an interesting (and mostly successful) choice. It’s A24-lite. However, Gretel and Hansel plods along without any real moments of tension, horror, or fear to accompany the locations that almost demand them. Everything is set up for this to be a real chiller but it’s sadly lacking in chills and thrills. Lillis is more than able in the lead role and Alice Krige is deliciously macabre as Holda (aka The Witch), the cuisine-obsessed woodland-dwelling oddball with sinister intentions for our protagonists. However, Sam Leakey as Hansel fails to reach the standards of his co-stars and ends up coming across as rather flat. The same can be said of Gretel and Hansel as a whole, it’s all a bit flat. Beautiful to look at but lacking in many other aspects required to elevate it to above-average levels. The ambiguous trailer for Antebellum was great (to me, at least) and it did what any trailer should do - it raised my interest in the movie and I became quite excited to see just what the movie was actually about. Then I watched Antebellum. Oh boy. The marketing screams “From the producers of Get Out”, Jordan Peele’s movie that delivers a stark, timely and effective message on racism and attitudes alongside being a damn good horror flick which is everything Antebellum is attempting yet manages to fail to be on pretty much all counts. Of course, the idea of slavery is abhorrent and the on-screen treatment is unpleasant to watch but Antebellum feels like a shallow attempt at shouting for people’s attention and then not really having what it takes to back up the cries. It seems opportunistic, playing on shock and exploitation tactics in place of gravitas and drama when the latter really would have made for a better story (given the horrific subject matter), allowing for the grislier aspects to carry greater emotional heft. When the movie’s big twist comes, I wanted to gouge my eyeballs out at the sheer absurdity of it - there’s suspension of disbelief and then there’s being treated like an idiot. Antebellum succeeds mainly at looking pretty good, wasting its uber-talented cast (Monáe is solid as she firefights through), and, well, that’s about it really. It finally happened! The New Mutants received a theatrical release! Of course, having suffered years of production issues and delays, scrutiny and interest were always going to be high in this movie which almost handicapped it before the projector ran on the first showing. The New Mutants, for all of its troubles, isn’t a bad movie, in fact, it’s quite good (quite being the operative word here). If you’re expecting a car crash mess of a flick, you’ll likely be disappointed but it really isn’t excellent either - it’s simply adequate. Pinned as a ‘superhero-horror’ movie, it certainly felt a bit different from the norm but Boone holds back on the horror overall (whether by his judgement or by the studios) which is a shame as The New Mutants had a chance to provide something substantially distinct but merely ends up as being slightly quirkier than its peers. Maybe this is simply down to Anya Taylor-Joy’s odd Russian accent? It’s a strange one for sure but the cast as a whole is fine - no-one really stands out in a movie that has plenty of forced moments designed to give the audience exactly that, the big moments, however, these don’t really pop in the way they were intended. At times it's cliche and at other times fun, The New Mutants serves as a peculiar superhero offering compared to its bigger-budget contemporaries. One of the original cinematic casualties caused by COVID-19, Mulan found its home on Disney+ amidst a storm of production controversy and the pressure of living up to the much-loved 1998 animated offering. Yifei Liu took the sword in this version and, as Mulan, is very good in the lead alongside a terrific supporting cast including the likes of Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma, Gong Li, and Jet Li. Liu imbues the character with steel and affability that makes her easy to root for. Visually, the movie is also very strong - it’s colourful, grand, and a joy for the eyes. That's just it though, Mulan has strong performances and visuals but not a lot else. Gone are the songs and verve of the 1998 version, instead replaced by drama, adventure, and (well-choreographed and more-violent-than-expected) action. The lack of songs isn’t an issue, it’s the nagging feeling that Mulan is too by-numbers and, at times, surface-level - the inescapable feeling that this is very much style over substance. The additions to this iteration provide different dimensions than before but it feels too polished to really accentuate the statement that Mulan and Disney were desperately trying to hit home. Beautiful visuals, great performances, and some solid action can’t fully mask the rather empty centre that Mulan carries. Having delivered the surprisingly good Aladdin in 2019, Guy Ritchie has gone back to his wheelhouse with The Gentlemen - a British gangster flick full of wit, punch, humour, and great performances (nearly all-round). It’s a movie very much playing to the Ritchie ‘in-crowd’, if you aren’t a fan of his previous efforts, this probably won’t make you change your mind, however, fans of his will likely lap this up. There’s less action here than one might expect, instead replaced by more of the trademark-Ritchie back-and-forths between characters (mainly the wonderful Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam), but this trade allows The Gentlemen to feel less frenetic than, say, Lock Stock or Snatch - and, in this case, that’s a positive. What it also ensures is a slightly messy narrative that, whilst not derailing, can at times be a challenge to keep up with. Thankfully, strong performances from McConaughey, Farrell, Grant, Hunnam, and Dockery help soothe this burn though Henry Golding feels underutilized in the cookie-cutter role of Dry Eyes. It’s cool, it’s snappy, it’s fun and stupidly entertaining, The Gentlemen is evidence of a director flexing his established genre muscles and allowing himself to have a bit of fun once more. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm arrives fourteen years after the first Borat affair lit up cinemas worldwide and created a wonderfully bizarre Kazakh comic icon. Stuffed full of shocking comedy moments and sharp social commentary, it felt like it dropped at the perfect time. Its sequel sadly doesn’t possess that same timing luck or either of the aforementioned qualities. Instead, it feels like a misguided attempt to recreate what came before in an already-greatly changed landscape. Nothing within Borat 2 feels as ‘shocking’ as Cohen intends, it just feels forced - in particular, a dance between Borat and his on-screen daughter Tutar (the impressive Bakalova) stood out as cringeworthy. The satire isn’t anywhere near as cutting as before - possibly due to real-world politicians and political events feeling more satirical than anything else - and during my viewing, I couldn’t help but wonder what the point of this really was. That’s not to say there aren’t good qualities - the opening act is strong, there are a few great gags (as there usually is with Cohen) and many of the original ‘Borat-isms’ retain their humour - but, sadly, Borat 2 doesn’t hit with the same fire the original did all those years ago. From the stage to the big screen, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom tells the story of art, racial attitudes, and exploitation in 1920s Chicago focusing on Ma Rainey (Davis) and her working band in the recording studio fighting against white managers and businessmen for control of her sound. A lot of focus has been on Chadwick Boseman and here he gives possibly his best performance - he really is wonderful. Though it will probably be best remembered as Boseman’s final movie, Ma Rainey is stuffed-full of excellent performances - Viola Davis is imposing and excellent in the titular role with Turman, Domingo, and Potts all providing great supporting performances. There’s a very stagey feel to the movie that the actors all buy into, the dialogue seems lifted directly from the stage show and the cast does a fine job with the long passages of dialogue and back-and-forths. At times, however, it can feel too stagey but that’s not an issue when everyone is on form like they are here. The period feel has been recreated nicely with the sets and costume design and, at a cool ninety-minutes, it’s snappier than one of Ma Rainey’s hits. Ma Rainey provides a marvellous swansong for Chadwick Boseman, another vehicle for Viola Davis’ talent, and a biting look at the ugly machinations of the music industry of old (...hopefully of old) and the awful racial attitudes within.

"Dec 26, 2020",positive," We've got yet another offering from Disney+ that we thought we'd see at a theater. But hey, 30 bucks later, and here we are. Talking the Mulan remake. You did it, Walt. Congrats. How was the movie though? Listen and find out! "
"Dec 21, 2020",negative," For over a decade, Kilkenny, Ireland-based Cartoon Saloon has produced under-the-radar animated features for adults and smart kids. With the astonishing Wolfwalkers, Cartoon Saloon gives us a profound and humane movie that should shame Pixar. Set in 17th-century Kilkenny, Wolfwalkers concerns the growing friendship between two girls, one a wolf hunter’s daughter, the other a werewolf. The five films in Steve McQueen’s triumphant Small Axe series run the gamut of genres, from courtroom drama to prison movie, but Lovers Rock feels the most personal. Inspired by the reggae house parties of McQueen’s West London youth, Lovers Rock has all the energy and danger of a legendary party, continually spinning on a razor’s edge between ecstasy and disaster. Most critics shrugged in apathy or confusion at Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s playful and thoughtful foray into cinephilia-fueled Franco-existentialism. However, I could not imagine 2020 without Catherine Deneuve’s marvelously self-lacerating lead performance. Anti-colonialist fury rendered as psychedelia-tinged exploitation, and with Udo Kier to boot? Count me in. Brazilian writer-director Kleber Mendonça Filho (Aquarius) and co-director Juliano Dornelles deliver this alternately absurd and disturbing tale of a Brazilian village fighting off armed mercenaries. An equally sad and euphoric story of dance as an expression of cultural and sexual identity. Levan Gelbakhiani does remarkable work as Merab, an ambitious trainee at the Georgian National Ensemble who falls for his top male competitor. Australian filmmaker Rodd Rathjen made the debut of the year with this harrowing story of slavery at sea. Based on real accounts of human trafficking in the fishing industry, Buoyancy follows the experiences of a 14-year-old Cambodian boy forced to work on a trawler run by a sadistic captain (Thanawut Kasro). With this low-flame anti-western, Reichardt recreates the bleakest of dystopias: a world without butter. Into this pitiless frontier floats the region’s first cow, a potent symbol of sweetness in a harsh and cruel existence. Director Sasha Neulinger pores over video footage from his childhood, where he finds his long-time abusers hiding in plain sight. Rewind is easily one of the most upsetting films of the year, but it’s also a non-exploitative and inspiring story about confronting past horrors. Another Small Axe entry from McQueen, this time the story of an aspiring policeman who wants to change the system, only to find racism and corruption at every turn. In the lead role, John Boyega delivers on his early promise, giving a gripping performance of quiet fire. The former title finds Charlie Kaufman in full wormhole-of-the-mind mode, while the latter is Nolan at his most thrilling and semi-comprehensible. Neither of these mind-scramblers fully satisfied on an emotional level, but both films impressed with their aesthetics and ambitions. Enough people endured enough minutes of this repugnant Fifty Shades knockoff to make it Netflix’s most-watched film of 2020, even though the rampant fetishization of Stockholm Syndrome makes it feel like an erotic rewrite of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. With the new release of every atrocious non-movie, Netflix looks more and more like a front for international money laundering. Starring a half-asleep Charlize Theron, The Old Guard is another of the service’s misguided attempts to launch a blockbuster franchise. This bomb boasts dozens of insufferable creatures, but none more insufferable than Robert Downey, Jr. Dolittle is a spectacularly ugly exercise in focus-groupthink that tries to please everyone, inevitably pleasing no one. Disney continues its insufferable series of live-action adaptations of animated classics with the dreary Mulan. The culturally apocryphal dragon from the cartoon is gone because this is painfully serious stuff, but also Mulan has magic powers now because kids sure do love them superheroes. Pick a lane, people. Disturbingly, these cinematic blowhards are both considered major awards contenders. Da 5 Bloods accelerates Spike Lee’s devolution into paranoid incoherence. Chicago 7 almost plays like a parody of Aaron Sorkin-style self-satisfaction, only it’s written and directed by the real Sorkin, so it’s terrible.

"Dec 17, 2020",negative," “Let’s get down to business…” to destroy a classic. In the last few years Disney has been rebooting many of its 90s animation movies – Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin…and now Mulan. While I quite enjoyed the previous reboots, Mulan falls well short of their success in my eyes. Although this incarnation follows some of the plot from the animation version, 2020 Mulan does not have Mushu, Li Shang, or singing! Disney have quite literally stripped its own film of many of its best parts.  Like its animated counterpart the film shows Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) take her father’s place in the Imperial Army – to do so Mulan must appear and act like a man. The 1998 version worked because it was funny, the songs were catchy, the characters were vibrant and full of personality, and it had a strong female character who was normal.  2020 Mulan on the other hand is not funny, is not a musical (though it did integrate some of the original songs into the film’s score), most of the characters (such as the new love interest Chen Honghui (Yoson An), and known characters Yao (Chen Tang) and Chien-Po (Doua Moua)) don’t have the same verve and Mulan herself was far from normal. Everything about this movie was completely unbelievable: from the power of the supposed-to-be-normal Mulan to the ridiculous dialogue. Sadly, Disney have succeeded in ruining what was an amazing film. Some reboots should never be made and this 2020 Mulan was definitely one. For me, 1998 Mulan will always remain one of the best Disney films ever made, with a female character who was strong in her normality. "
"Dec 13, 2020",negative," Since 2002, eclectic New Zealander writer/director Niki Caro has been struggling to reach the same level of accomplishment of Whale Rider, her sophomore feature film. After the passable dramas North Country (2005) and McFarland, USA (2015), and the expendable The Zookeeper’s Wife (2017), she returns with Mulan, a live-action adaptation of the 1998 animation feature of the same name by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook. For this Disney-production, Caro engages in a simplistic tale, a sweet candy confection filled with a feminist prowess that, despite well-intended, favors style over substance. Mulan (Yifei Liu) is a fearless girl who, disguised as a male warrior, undertakes an incredible journey as she joins the imperial army to save her aging father (veteran Tzi Ma) from the burden of war and potential death. The film also welcomes acclaimed Chinese-born Singaporean actress Gong Li as the witch Xianniang, and action star Jet Li as the Emperor of China. The dazzling physical battles, captured under the supervision of cinematographer Mandy Walker (Tracks; Hidden Figures), are insufficient to overcome the petty humor (the stinky smell joke about the heroine is repetitive) and faint romance. What should have been edgy and thrilling turned into a disappointing routine. If nothing else, Mulan looks gorgeous."
"Dec 10, 2020",neutral," Months after Disney made its live-action remake of Mulan available to rent for an eye-watering $30, it’s now finally free to stream for folks with Disney+ subscriptions. Cue stragglers like myself coming in to see what all the hullabaloo was about. Shop talk surrounding the film’s controversy has largely come and gone, so I’ll keep this review brief: I’d set my expectations low and therefore, I had a perfectly nice time taking in all the glitz and glamour that comes with a star-studded cast and $200 million production budget. However, the film’s brilliant parade of color and Hong Kong-style action feels oddly soulless. Some dissonance stems from the 4th-6th century source material, a Chinese folktale titled the Ballad of Mulan that sees its heroine sacrificing everything to defend an autocratic emperor. Such an obedient soldier makes for a dull hero by American norms, where wariness of government is built into our DNA and idolized through such patriotic bangers as ""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" and “Let freedom ring!” A cowboy-maverick-anti-masker, Mulan is not. On top of that, director Niki Caro and her team of screenwriters make it doubly hard to root for Mulan (Yifei Liu) by giving her natural-born abilities that eradicate the much more satisfying emotional journeys of hard work, cunning, and a good old fashioned underdog story. In 1998, Disney’s animated Mulan used no such superhero theatrics, and its character development felt all the stronger for it. Finally, whiplash TikTok-style editing—with none of the fun irreverence—leaves no time for moments to resonate. The beautiful artifice of Mulan remains, yes, but don’t pull back the curtain because you’ll find nothing behind it. Mulan might star a woman who infiltrates the army to prove that women can be warriors, but her end game still relies on gaining the approval of men: Her father (Tzi Ma), fellow soldiers, and the emperor (Jet Li) all stoke anxiety in Mulan who seeks to win them over. Rather than smash the patriarchy, Mulan validates these very same men who couldn’t see her value until she waved her magical abilities in their faces. Sure, there’s an argument to be made for change coming from within a broken system. But when Mulan rejects a much more interesting offer to be mentored by the “witch” Xianniang (Gong Li), I couldn’t help but feel disappointed at seeing her dismiss an opportunity to grow and flourish outside of the confines of mens’ expectations altogether. I suppose I should just be glad we’re following a female protagonist at all. And don’t get me wrong, that definitely goes in the “pro” column, especially given how Mulan isn’t the sole woman in a sea of men—something we still see in movies like the Tomb Raider series or standalone features Arrival (2016) and Gravity (2013). Instead, Mulan easily passes the Bechdel Test as she holds relationships with several women throughout the film, something screenwriters Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek explicitly made a priority from the get-go. In minor roles, we see her sister, mother, and the village matchmaker. And while her emotional story arc mostly centers her relationship with her father, the film’s most interesting pairing occurs between Mulan and the antagonistic, shapeshifting Xianniang (who doesn’t exist in the original poem—a welcome case of taking creative license with old material to suit modern needs.) Mulan and Xianniang’s similarities as powerful and ostracized women, combined with their opposing philosophies on morality, provide tension not unlike what you see between Rey and Kylo Ren in Star Wars. Unfortunately, that potential is quickly squandered. Caro’s Mulan displays no appetite for ambiguity and instead punishes Xianniang as the flat villain she so clearly isn’t. Meanwhile, Mulan’s relationships with other women feel equally flat, appearing solely to prove that she’s “not like other girls”. Her silly sister screams at spiders; her mother forces Mulan into gender norms; and the matchmaker herself epitomizes outdated ideals of subservient femininity. In fact, nowhere do we see traditional presentations of femininity appreciated in the film at all. Adornments like makeup and womens’ clothing become the butt of visual jokes, whereas Mulan’s martial arts expertise and efficiency in killing a bunch of nomads become the traits that launch her into heroism. In short, the representation of women onscreen feels mixed. But behind the scenes, it’s unequivocally great that a female director and three female screenwriters were placed at the helm of such a high-profile movie. While they hardly execute a perfect ten, the broader goal is for women to be allowed to produce something mediocre and not get punished for it during their careers. I genuinely hope this proves to be the case for Caro and team. First, the papercuts: A white director working from a script written by four white screenwriters was already worthy of a passive aggressive, “Is this really such a good idea?” But not a dealbreaker on its own.  Then came the wallops. In August 2019, Mulan’s star, Yifei Liu, tweeted her support of the Hong Kong police at the height of their brutalities against pro-democracy protesters. By the time that firestorm had subsided, Mulan stepped in it again as audiences noticed in September 2020 that the film’s credits thanked propaganda departments in China’s western province of Xinjiang, where parts of the movie were filmed—and where horrific atrocities against Uighur Muslims, such as forced internment and sterilizations by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), continue to this day. Knowing all this, I had hoped that a Disneyfied sheen of an American blockbuster could keep the grossness of Chinese authoritarianism at bay. But when faced with stunning desert-scapes and dramatic cliffs, I couldn’t help but wonder if I was observing the land of forcibly displaced communities. Other jolts, like seeing actors who have publicly supported the CCP and by extent the party’s aggressions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, kept taking me out of the scene. Watching Donnie Yen as Commander Tung twirl a sword recalled his starring role as a martial artist in Ip Man 4 (2019), a movie whose chest-thumping nationalism and dog whistles like “we are all Chinese” took me by surprise. Even the incomparable Gong Li as Xianniang, the film’s best character by far, felt tainted given Li’s similar loyalties. Thankfully, such lightning rods were tempered by the purer enjoyment of seeing Asian American stars like Hong Kong-born Tzi Ma or Southern California natives Jason Scott Lee as the villain Böri Khan and Rosalind Chao as Mulan’s mother. And when I glimpsed the film’s cameo of Ming-Na Wen, I gave a silent internal whoop. (The actress, born in Macau and raised in New York City, had voiced Mulan in 1998.) I’d like to pause for a moment, however, to make it crystal clear that a) my critiques of the CCP hardly excuse the United States’ own dismal record on human rights, and b) I don’t think actors need to “be quiet” any more than I would wish for Colin Kaepernick to “keep politics out of sports.” On the contrary, I think it’s exciting when actors stand up for what they believe in. But as paying consumers, we’re well within our rights to avoid movies whose actors harbor political leanings we find repugnant. In my case, as a Taiwanese American who worries about the increasing number of CCP fighter jets soaring over the heads of her family members in Taipei and Kaohsiung, the shadow of Chinese influence on Disney’s 2020 remake of Mulan distracts from the escapism I seek in a feel-good movie. Even from this vantage point, however, I can still appreciate the opportunities a huge project like Mulan has opened up for Asian American talent. It’s not the fault of individuals that Disney fumbled its appeals to the global theatrical market, or that studio heads missed the chance to hire much-needed authenticity in Mulan’s core creative team. (This thread by Chinese historian Xiran Jay Zhao hilariously recounts the many, many ways that Mulan makes no sense to people versed in actual Chinese culture.) More work and visibility for Asian American talent will always be great, and Mulan certainly accomplishes that goal. With one hand grasping for China’s moviegoing audience, as the other refuses to let go of its American roots, Mulan collapses into confusion. And it still underwhelmed at China’s box office. So between this remake and Netflix’s Over the Moon from a few months back, can we stop trying to lump together Chinese nationals and Chinese diaspora, and instead stick with movies that can actually appeal to both? Everyone loves a brainless action romp, for example. I’d gladly take The Meg (2018) over misguided pandering any day."
"Dec 6, 2020",positive," Walt Disney’s ongoing run of live-action adaptations of their past animated hits reaches a fresh height in creative futility with Niki Caro’s Mulan, a non-musical riff on the company’s 1998 hit. It would be deeply unfair to claim this remake is actively bad. The performances are solid, the production design is attractive, and the camera is always pointing in the right direction. At the same time it is genuinely difficult to justify its existence. One can usually fall back on a minimum justifications of brand recognition and commercial opportunity; I am not sure that it is the case here. Both films tell versions of the Chinese folk story of Hua Mulan, a young woman who runs away from home to take her father’s place in the Imperial Army. The story originated in the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (4th-6th century CE), and through the 20th and 21st centuries has remained a popular subject for Chinese films and television serials. Disney’s first attempt to mount Mulan in 1998 has been widely seen as an attempt by the company to capitalise on the Chinese film market. For the second attempt the film seems even more aggressive in capturing that audience. The new film removes all elements that were seen as a barrier to mainstream Chinese success – the songs, the comedy dragon sidekick, and so on – and casts key roles with three of the most popular Chinese actors in the world: Donnie Yen, Gong Li, and Jet Li. For Jet Li, who plays the Emperor, it is his first major role in seven years. The film also assiduously casts a Chinese actor in the title role: Liu Yifei, who previously co-starred with Jet Li in Rob Minkoff’s 2008 film The Forbidden Kingdom. It is worth pausing briefly to remember The Forbidden Kingdom, a flawed but admirable attempt to produce a Chinese-style wuxia picture through a Hollywood lens. It does this by not only sticking to broadly iconic story and character elements, but by presenting them all from the perspective of a white American teenager. It openly admits to being a Hollywood film, albeit with the trimmings and iconography of Chinese cinema. The animated Mulan did much the same thing. The story’s origins were from China, but the film itself was Disney through and through. This is where the 2020 attempt diverges, and ultimately fails. It tries valiantly to be an authentic wuxia picture. It casts major stars of the genre, and shoots inside China for authenticity (including, controversially, the human rights nightmare that is Xinjiang province). Harry Gregson-Williams’ score is rich with traditional Chinese instrumentation and melody. The costumes are absolutely beautiful, as is much of the photography – but is not shot or edited like Chinese wuxia. The tone of its characters and conflicts cannot help but feel Americanised. Its fight scenes lack the lyrical aesthetic of the films it impersonates. Superficially it is entertaining enough, but the moment it invites comparison to its genre it reveals itself as exactly that: something superficial. Certainly Caro’s film is more accessible to children, but it is paced like a work for adults. It seems bizarre that Disney would spend so much time and expense making this film. It was never going to capture a Chinese audience to the degree they wanted – and why would it? It apes a style it fundamentally does not understand, and gets actively cringe-worthy when it starts to misunderstand the concept of ‘chi’. It offers a story for Chinese audiences that has been repeatedly filmed in recent years – the 2008 Jingle Ma adaptation is rather enjoyable – and tells it to them in a foreign language. While it is always pleasurable to watch Donnie, Gong, and Jet – although here the latter sounds painfully dubbed – there are better films in which to view each of them. It is nice to see Tzi Ma (The Farewell) in a larger-than-usual role, and its refreshing to see Rosalind Chao playing her own ethnicity for once (her two most famous roles to date are as a Korean in M*A*S*H and as a Japanese botanist in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). Liu Yifei does an excellent job of Mulan as well, and even resembles her animated counterpart more than I had expected. The bottom line for English language viewers is that, unless subtitles are a major obstacle, there are literally dozens of films easily accessible via home video and streaming services that offer a better experience. In retrospect the very things that Disney eliminated – songs, humour, a dancing cricket and an upbeat tiny dragon – are the things that enabled the earlier version to stand out. "
"Dec 5, 2020",positive," CONTINENTAL DIVIDE (1981). Although Continental Divide was the first film released under Steven Spielberg’s Amblin banner, it’s best known as that movie where John Belushi plays a totally normal guy. And he’s quite good at it, delivering an easygoing turn as a Chicago newspaper columnist who hightails it to the Rockies to interview an ornithologist. But when Ernie Souchak and Nell Porter (Blair Brown) first meet, it’s clear they have nothing in common: He prefers city life, cigarettes, and booze; she prefers nature, animals, and tranquility. Naturally, they fall in love. It may be true that opposites attract, but there is so little common ground between these characters — none, in fact — that their romance is never believable. The film is at its best when it ignores their relationship and concentrates on other matters (Ernie tackling big-city corruption, Nell studying American bald eagles). Regardless of what’s happening in Lawrence Kasdan’s schematic screenplay, Belushi and Brown save the movie with their warmth and charm. D.C. CAB (1983). “Why are women so uptight? They’ve got half the money and all the pussy!” And so it goes with D.C. Cab, the sort of disreputable comedy that could only have been made during the 1980s. Like many faves of the period, it’s lewd, crude, and rude, but it deserves a salute for featuring as eclectic a cast as can be found this side of Otto Preminger’s Skidoo. Its plot is nothing more than the usual nonsense: Various misfits — in this case, taxi drivers — earn no respect until a crisis forces them to band together and save the day. Harold (Max Gail, Wojo on Barney Miller) runs the place, Albert (Adam Baldwin) is the new kid on the job, and the excitable Tyrone (Charlie Barnett) has a crush on Irene Cara (who appears as herself in a brief cameo). There’s also Mr. T as a conscientious cabbie, Gary Busey as a foul-mouthed joker, Bill Maher (yes, that Bill Maher) as a sensitive sort, Paul Rodriguez as a ladies’ man, The Barbarian Brothers (using up 5 of their 15 minutes of fame) as rowdy drivers, Whitman Mayo (Grady on Sanford and Son) as Mr. Rhythm, and Timothy Carey as the Angel of Death. Whew! Despite that roster, the movie’s not particularly funny, but a few six-packs could help. MULAN (2020). While 2019’s photorealistic remake of 1994’s The Lion King felt like Disney staging its own invasion of the body snatchers — everything looks the same, only stiff and emotionless! — this live-action Mulan thankfully avoids frigid fealty to its animated 1998 predecessor. Instead, it jettisons all of the songs, most of the knockabout humor, and even Mushu the scene-stealing dragon (Eddie Murphy in basically a test drive for Shrek), leaving behind a durable drama told with sweep and style. As before, Mulan (Yifei Liu) is a headstrong young woman who, learning that her frail father (Tzi Ma) must join the Imperial Army in a time of war, disguises herself as a man and takes his place on the battlefield. The silly scenes (e.g. Mulan, the matchmaker, and a tea set) are played too broadly and should have been removed, and the picture’s view of the Chinese notion of “chi” leans so heavily on Hollywood ideals that it’s surprising no one ever says, “May the Chi be with you.” But the story is inspiring, the action scenes are rousing, and cinematographer Mandy Walker’s shot selections are dazzling. All this plus the great Gong Li as a sympathetic villainess. THE NEW MUTANTS (2020). Despite all the production upheavals, all the conflicting visions, and all the false starts (when it comes to release dates, the film’s been bounced more than a ping pong ball), this middling X-Men entry is still superior to Dark Phoenix (reviewed here), the depressing dud that managed to kill off a once-proud franchise. Setting up a new series of X-rated adventures — but mangling the assignment so thoroughly that follow-ups are unlikely to materialize — this centers on five troubled teens confined to a remote hospital. The newcomer is the Native American Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), who becomes the instant BFF of the Scottish Rahne (Maisie Williams), gets along with the hickish Sam (Charlie Heaton) and the Brazilian Bobby (Henry Zaga), and runs afoul of the Russian Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy). All are mutants with unique powers, but it isn’t until they pool their resources that they’re able to conquer their inner (and some outer) demons. Even with most of the film devoted to exposition, this feels unformed and unfinished, with half-baked YA interludes, ill-defined villains, and ungainly action sequences. POPEYE (1980). It’s easy to see why many critics viewed Popeye as an abomination upon its initial release; it’s also easy to understand why select reviewers declared it an unqualified winner. Those who can get on its wavelength will appreciate its eccentricities; those who cannot will find its whimsy the equivalent of waterboarding. Those who detest it will insist that the choice of Robert Altman as director was a horrific one; those who love it will insist his hiring was a stroke of genius. The overacting by all involved might be suitable for the project, but it’s uncured ham nevertheless. Robin Williams (Popeye) mumbles, Shelley Duvall (Olive Oyl) frets, Paul L. Smith (Bluto) roars, and I have no idea what Ray Walston (Poopdeck Pappy) is doing. The suitably dilapidated sets are certainly more impressive than the wince-inducing tunes by Harry Nilsson (I much prefer his charming tunes for 1971’s The Point, reviewed here). Blu-ray extras include archival interviews with Altman and Williams, photos from the movie’s 1980 premiere; and the option to cut to all the songs featured in the film. POSSESSOR UNCUT (2020). David Cronenberg’s first films were intriguing but also messy, muddled, and cold to the touch — they featured pawns rather than people, and the ideas often threatened to overpower the execution. His son Brandon Cronenberg might be offering a generational déjà vu, as his sophomore effort (I haven’t seen his first picture, Antiviral) unspools in similar fashion. Brandon has swiped his dad’s recurring obsessions — betrayal by one’s own body; loss of identity; the relationship between man and machine; the allure of sexual perversities — and applied them to this thriller about an outfit that employs brain-implant technology to place its agents inside the bodies of innocents to perform assassinations. As the group’s top killer (Andrea Riseborough) tries to carry out her latest assignment, she finds her subject (Christopher Abbott) unexpectedly fighting back. Some heady ideas are ultimately buried under the film’s lack of specificity and surplus of gore. TRADING PLACES (1983) / BEVERLY HILLS COP (1984) / THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) / COMING TO AMERICA (1988). Beginning with his dynamic film debut in 1982’s 48 Hrs., Eddie Murphy headlined nothing but hits for a full decade, marking him as one of the most reliable box office draws of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Sadly, 48 Hrs. hasn’t been treated to a deluxe new release, but four other flicks from this robust period are being offered in newly remastered editions, two in 4K Ultra HD (Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America) and two as part of the Paramount Presents series (Trading Places and The Golden Child, the latter also making its Blu-ray debut). A variation on Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper, Trading Places teams Murphy with fellow Saturday Night Live player Dan Aykroyd for a sharp comedy in which a bet made by sleazy millionaires Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche) results in snobbish executive Louis Winthorpe III (Aykroyd) being left homeless and penniless while street-smart hustler Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy) is given Winthorpe’s house, job and finances. The two stars (especially Murphy) are terrific, and the supporting cast provides additional flavor: Bellamy and Ameche as the insidious Duke brothers and Denholm Elliott and Jamie Lee Curtis as, respectively, the butler and the hooker who assist our heroes. Murphy’s biggest hit, Beverly Hills Cop also remains noteworthy as the film that best makes use of his explosive comic instincts. He’s sensational as Detroit cop Axel Foley, sniffing out his best friend’s killers in swanky Beverly Hills with the help of by-the-book LA detectives Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (John Ashton) and the hindrance of stern police captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox). This high-octane action-comedy was originally conceived as a vehicle for Sylvester Stallone, who (thankfully!) dropped out after many cast and crew members were already in place. Daniel Petrie Jr. and Danilo Bach earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, although so much of the dialogue was ad-libbed by Murphy that he probably deserved credit as well. This was followed by a pair of lamentable sequels. With The Golden Child, Murphy unfortunately (if unsurprisingly) morphs from Explosive Comic Talent to Narcissistic Action Star. No one else could have played Axel Foley, Billy Ray Valentine or 48 Hrs.’s Reggie Hammond quite like Murphy, whereas a dozen other actors could have tackled The Golden Child’s Chandler Jarrell in exactly the same preening, paycheck-cashing manner. After a Tibetan boy (J.L. Reate) with mystical powers is kidnapped by a demonic emissary (Charles Dance), those responsible for the child’s safety determine that Chandler, a Los Angeles social worker who specializes in finding missing children, is “The Chosen One” and thus the only person who can rescue the tyke. The Golden Child offers lots of special effects but little else that can be deemed special. Trading Places director John Landis reteams with Murphy five years later for Coming to America, a sweet-natured comedy with an R-rated edge. Murphy delivers one of his most gratifying performances as Prince Akeem, who, with his reluctant aide (Arsenio Hall) at his side, travels from his African homeland of Zamunda to New York City in the hopes of falling in love. Naturally, he elects to look for his future queen in Queens. James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair play Akeem’s parents, King Jaffe Joffer and Queen Aoleon; six years later, the pair would reunite to portray another royal couple, Mufasa and Sarabi, in the animated smash The Lion King. Added bonus: The clever cameos that loop back to Trading Places. All four films are sold separately. Extras on Trading Places include a new discussion with Landis; a making-of featurette; and deleted scenes. Extras on Beverly Hills Cop include audio commentary by director Martin Brest; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; and a piece on the music. Extras on The Golden Child include a new making-of featurette and the theatrical trailer. Extras on Coming to America (which is also available as a steelbook containing a bonus poster) include a making-of featurette; pieces on the contributions by makeup artist Rick Baker and costume designer Deborah Nadoolman, both of whom earned Oscar nominations for their work on the film; and a chat with Murphy and Hall."
"Dec 5, 2020",positive," Mulán difícilmente será recordada como algo más que la película que estrenó en Disney Plus en medio de la incertidumbre de la industria cinematográfica. Al mismo tiempo, llevará por siempre la etiqueta de suceder a uno de los clásicos animados más queridos. Sin embargo, en una época inmersa en un ambiente social que constantemente evoluciona, lo que debería resaltar de la película no son sus diferencias con un producto antaño, sino la reflexión que hace de temas universales y actuales. Dicho esto, aunque en general la nueva Mulán no es una película en extremo sobresaliente y memorable, sí contiene varias piezas afortunadas. El filme construye un rompecabezas en donde lo importante es un discurso feminista atemporal, como comprueba la verdadera edad de este relato. El relato es tratado con mucha elegancia y solemnidad por parte de Niki Caro (Whale Rider, North Country), una cineasta cuya carrera se ha caracterizado por plasmar en pantalla personajes femeninos empáticos, fuertes y aleccionadores.  «Existieron muchas historias sobre la gran guerrera Mulán (Yifei Liu), pero ancestros, ésta es la mía», resuena un diálogo inicial que está colocado allí por algo más que el azar. La directora Niki Caro abre la cinta con una confesión en la que advierte al espectador que no debe esperar revisitar aquello que le marcó hace veintidós años con dibujos animados, sino que buscará encontrar su propia esencia en la hechura del cine de nuestros tiempos.  Aunque la obra palidece a la sombra del encanto y el humor de la original de 1998, es de reconocerse el esfuerzo que, tanto guionistas como directora, hacen por tratar de actualizar una leyenda, que a pesar de su progresismo nato, aún se queda corta para los estándares modernos de hoy, cuando los roles de género han tomado cada vez menos importancia para validar el verdadero valor de una persona. En el mismo orden de ideas la narrativa coquetea con el romance, pero nunca lo consuma. Y ése es un punto congruente al suponer así que la heroína no necesariamente debe encontrar el amor para sentirse plena y completar su viaje de aprendizaje. La cinta tampoco cierra la posibilidad del amor, pero no lo destaca, dejándolo en segundo plano entre homenajes más importantes.  Si bien se trata de una producción estadounidense enfocada claramente para un público anglosajón, Niki Caro se permite experimentar con la estética de las épicas wuxias de Zhang Yimou como La casa de las dagas voladoras, u otras con más difusión en nuestra cultura como El tigre y el dragón de Ang Lee.  Concebida bajo dichos parámetros, la nueva Mulán abandona (casi por completo) la infantilidad y el humor tontarrón, para abrazar una acción cinematográfica y narrativa. En ésta, los escenarios son un personaje más, dispuesto para ayudar en las batallas cuerpo a cuerpo -pasillos estrechos en donde los personajes pueden caminar desafiando la gravedad-. O en donde su utilizan artefactos que desafían las leyes de la física como túnicas voladoras que propinan golpes y lanzas tan precisas como veloces.  Para el mismo propósito, la fotografía colabora con movimientos de cámara que refuerzan la fisicalidad de la escena. Estos también nos regalan varios cuadros memorables que acentúan la identidad de esta película como un blockbuster de gran presupuesto que debe servir fielmente al eye candy.  Sin embargo, todo lo anterior queda eclipsado por un guion que falla al explotar cada una de las identidades de aquellos personajes que no son Mulán. Si acaso, existe una cierta atención en el personaje de «La bruja» (Li Gong). Uno que resulta en una novedad para esta nueva visión de la leyenda, pero que tiene una finalidad concreta para servicio del mensaje de la historia. A pesar de sus fallos y de un encanto que no termina de consumar por completo, la película Mulán de Niki Caro brilla por sus esfuerzos. Sus esfuerzos de consolidar un discurso -no forzado- feminista actualizado para las nuevas generaciones; el de hacer un homenaje al género Wuxia; y el de ser en general un filme muy entretenido, con una estética impecable. La película rehúye por completo de una aburrida repetición, como sí sucedió con otros live actions de Disney como la reciente El rey león de Jon Favreau.

"Dec 4, 2020",negative," In some ways, Mulan represents a major departure from Disney's approach to live-action remakes of its beloved traditionally-animated movies. Unlike the Emma Watson-led Beauty and the Beast, the Will Smith-starring Aladdin, or Jon Favreau's The Lion King (technically not live-action), the new Mulan is not a musical. Yes, it's not the first one; Disney allowed Favreau to do the same for The Jungle Book (more or less, it had a couple of songs). But Mulan has also excised characters and introduced new ones. Out goes the small pet dragon Mushu — voiced by Eddie Murphy, who served as a comic relief — because it wasn't received well in China, and in comes a shapeshifting witch called Xianniang, played by Gong Li, considered the best actress in China today. At the same time, Mulan is not bold enough. The axing of Mushu is just one way Disney is catering to Chinese interests. For instance, the villains in Mulan have been changed from the Huns (as they were in the animated version) to the Rourans, to make the film more historically accurate. But Mulan herself is still shown to be a citizen of Imperial Han China, even though the original tale — “The Ballad of Mulan” — states that she was part of the Northern Wei dynasty. Why? Maybe because the Han make up of 92 percent of China's population today. The Emperor in Mulan instructs his people to “defend the Silk Road” which makes no sense because the region wasn't part of China then. The problem is, Mulan isn't a good movie. And what makes it all the more annoying is that it had potential to be a good movie. Mulan sets out its world quite plainly in the opening minute itself. Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma, also infrequent narrator), Mulan's father and a war veteran, tells us that her daughter is capable of something only men are allowed to wield. It's called Qi (pronounced Chi), and it's described as an energy that pervades all living things, but only some individuals can harness its power. Qi is a central principle in Chinese martial arts, and it's been virtually used everywhere by Hollywood (from Iron Fist to the upcoming Shang-Chi). Mulan's definition of Qi makes it sound like the Force, and it's not the only parallel to Star Wars here. Zhou adds that Qi is only for warriors, and that's not something daughters can become. Still, he's happy to indulge her, even though those around them do not approve. Hua Li (Rosalind Chao), Mulan's mother agrees. She's concerned because daughters need to conform in society to find a good husband. Pressured from all sides, Zhou asks the young Mulan (Crystal Rao) to “hide her gift away and silence its voice” — this makes the film open to interpretation, as even a LGBTQ story — and do what is expected of her: bring honour to the family through marriage. Mulan is crushed, and though she generally does what she's told, she doesn't entirely give up as she matures into a young woman (Yifei Liu). So when the Emperor (Jet Li) decrees that one man from every family should serve on the Imperial Army to fight off the invading Rourans, Mulan believes it ought to be her. Her father is in no state (he walks with a cane) and is forced to enlist only because he has no sons. Powerless to stop her dad from leaving and knowing that he would most likely not return, Mulan does the unthinkable: she takes her father's place in the Imperial Army. With women not allowed to serve, this means Mulan must disguise herself as a man. It's easier said than done. Being in the army involves being around other men at all times, in the showers and at night. Of course, what they are really there to do is to train, and Mulan proves herself to be more than an equal at everything. And they better train, for they are up against no ordinary enemy. The Rourans are led by Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), a capable and smart warrior leader who has united 12 nomadic tribes and who's looking to avenge his father's death at the hands of the Emperor. But they have an ace up their sleeve, in the aforementioned shapeshifting witch. Xianniang (Gong Li) — she's credited as such, but never named during the film — is extremely powerful. She can take over her enemies' bodies, or turn herself into a bird: a solitary eagle or a murder of crows. Xianniang has allied herself with Böri Khan because she wants to live in a world where she's not vilified and called a witch. Mulan's world, which doesn't afford any power to women, has never accepted her. Xianniang is a fascinating introduction to the world of Mulan, in not only what she represents but how she challenges the foundation of the narrative. Deep into the film when Mulan reveals herself to be a woman, she's expelled from the army, even though she's single-handedly delivered a victory against the Rourans and shown herself to be better than all the men in her battalion. Later, she has to risk her neck, and needs the support of her fellow officers, to convince Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) that there's a credible threat to the Emperor's life. And Mulan is only accepted back home by society after she saves the Emperor's life, and in turn, the kingdom itself. That's a lot. You shouldn't have to prove you're so exceptional just to be granted the most basic right: equality. Women get a raw deal in Mulan's world (ours too) and Xianniang has understood that the world has no place for people like them, and that she must remake it in her image. And that's what she proposes when she confronts Mulan, that she come over to her side: “Join me, we will take our place together.” She's the Kylo Ren to Mulan's Rey, if I were to draw another parallel to Star Wars, which makes Xianniang much more of an anti-hero than a villain. Their dynamic ought to be the heart of the film, and for a brief moment it is. But Mulan ultimately wastes all that potential as it cuts short Xianniang's arc for the most meaningless of plot points, and lays bare how clueless the film's writing team is. It's a shame because Mulan had the opportunity to improve upon the original. Disney is intent on turning its beloved animated movies into live-action franchises. The Lion King 2 already has a director. Prequels to Aladdin and Cinderella are in the works. We've already had two Alice and Maleficent movies. And a dozen more remakes are in various stages of development. Disney tried being safe with Mulan and its China pandering failed. Being safe has worked elsewhere. Both Aladdin and The Lion King made over a billion each, despite being terrible movies. If it's going to give us these movies, Disney may as well start being bolder. Because as it stands, Mulan is a bland feminist fable that dispels some gender stereotypes but fails to do much more. Mulan is out December 4 on Disney+ Hotstar. It's also now available outside Disney+ “Premier Access”, without the need to pay a $30 additional fee."
"Dec 3, 2020",negative," Mulan finds a way to offend just about everyone. Are you a feminist? Prepare to be disappointed by the film’s simplistic idea of empowerment. Do you consider yourself to be a champion of human rights? Then you will no doubt be incensed at Disney’s wilful ignorance of mass atrocities. Or maybe you’re simply a fan of the movies? Good luck with director Niki Caro’s impersonal take on the material.  While the artistic merit of Disney’s live-action remakes has always been questionable — their existence can be attributed more to Hollywood’s condescension towards Chinese audiences than any creative reasons — these movies also appear to be getting consistently blander. In what should be seen as a slap on Disney’s face, Mulan was roundly rejected by China when it released theatrically over there, hopefully putting an end to the West’s incursions into that market.  Both Hollywood and Bollywood have, for far too long, thought of China as an easy paycheque. They’re shoved subpar ‘products’ down the country’s throat, convinced of its less-demanding tastes. But Chinese audiences have caught on. And this time, it’s personal. Unlike Thugs of Hindostan, which was simply a bad movie that no one in China wanted to pay to watch, Mulan attempts to ‘honour’ Chinese culture by putting millions of American dollars on what has to be the most glaringly misguided Hollywood film of its kind since the Keanu Reeves-starrer 47 Ronin. It’s cultural appropriation on a massive scale.  In a classic attempt at misdirection, Disney put together a largely Asian cast, but neglected to retain this sensitivity while hiring the crew, which is predominantly white. At the helm, the studio stationed in-house talent, Niki Caro. Her presence might appease those who prefer stories about women to be told by women, but you see what I’m getting at? By having a woman at the helm, they’ve solved one problem, but what cultural insights could a New Zealand filmmaker possibly bring to a Chinese story? It’s like handing Zoya Akhtar the reins to a Rosa Parks biopic.  And in this crossfire of cynical decision-making, the audience suffers. Not only is the new Mulan a dreary slog, it’s wilfully ignorant of the spirit of the animated original. Caro has, as you might have heard, discarded the songs and affected a more serious tone, similar to the epic films of Jhang Yimou and Ang Lee, the latter of whom passed on directing Mulan. She has also, perhaps at Disney’s encouragement, changed the ethnicity of the main villain. Mulan cannot be divorced from the cultural context that surrounds it, simply because these are decisions made by the filmmakers, and by making these decisions, they’ve invited discussions about them.  It would have helped had it been a better film, with an engaging story and empowering message, but it feels overwhelmingly uninspired — just an excuse to make more money. This is unforgivable, considering the sheer number of resources at Caro’s disposal.  Why, for instance, do the elaborate sets look like they were constructed three days before filming, when they should have looked more lived-in? Why does the CGI look so artificial, when multiple reports have pegged the film’s budget to be in the vicinity of $200 million? If you thought Henry Cavill’s computer-generated mouth in Justice League looked odd, wait till you see what they’ve done with Jet Li’s face in Mulan. Convince me that it is not poorly done Deepfake. The legendary Li is just one of the many casting coups that the filmmakers have pulled off. The ensemble also includes Gong Li, who plays a shape-shifting witch; Tzi Ma, who plays Mulan’s father; and the great Donnie Yen, whose skills as a martial artist are completely wasted in a film that would rather cut combat scenes haphazardly than let Yen get down to business.  Of all the live-action Disney remakes, Mulan is the one that deviates the most from its animated original. While most of these movies — Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King — have been rather respectful of the source material, Mulan constantly trips over itself by trying to reinvent the wheel. It is also too preoccupied with being politically correct, which, as far as preoccupations go, is noble, but also something that demands sincerity. There’s very little of that here. "
"Nov 27, 2020",negative,"Still, Liu is engaging and sympathetic which helps us stick it through to the end, though who the intended audience for this film is remains a mystery."
"Nov 18, 2020",positive," Culture is a reflection of your community, and popular culture tells the story of many communities in real time. We talk about the best (and sometimes the worst) it has to offer, while providing keen insight and analysis about the things that you care most about."
"Nov 13, 2020",neutral," Much like its strong-willed protagonist, Disney’s live-action remake of 1998’s Mulan has had to overcome its fair share of adversity. One of the year’s most anticipated films, Mulan’s release plans were thrown for a loop when the pandemic hit. While the film was eventually given a “Premiere Access” release on Disney+, the one-time fee on top of the regular subscription price did not sit well with many subscribers. Fortunately, with Mulan arriving on Blu-ray this week, a wider audience will now be able to experience the film. Set in 630 AD, when honour was the most important form of currency for families, Niki Caro’s film tells the story of a fiercely independent 18-year-old named Mulan (Liu Yifei who is magnetic in the role). The daughter of a famed warrior, Zhou (Tzi Ma), Mulan would rather spend her free time mastering her father’s fighting techniques than preparing to find a suitable husband. As fate would have it, Mulan’s martial arts abilities prove beneficial when a warlord, Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), attempts to dethrone the Emperor (Jet Li). Building an army to stop Khan, the Emperor decrees that every household is to send a man to build an army to stop Khan. Fearing for her aging father’s life, as he volunteers to fight since he is the lone male in the household, Mulan disguises herself as a man named Hua Jun and secretly enlists in her father’s place. Keeping the framework of the animated film, Caro’s adaptation never strays too far from the source material. However, it leaves its own unique mark thanks in part to its visual splendor. The cinematography and costume design are both vibrant and breathtaking to behold. The rich colour palette really pops off the screen, even in the chaotic and thrilling action sequences. Caro draws heavily on inspiration from both the wire fu techniques employed in films like Hero, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the works of the Shaw Brothers when constructing her fight sequences. Creating an action film that is both graceful and energetic at the same time. Although its technical flourishes make for an invigorating experience at times, Mulan never quite finds its footing from a narrative perspective. The film clearly wants to make a statement about patriarchy and the ways girls are unfairly pushed into societal boxes from a young age, however, it never feels as inspirational as it aspires to be. Furthermore, the changes that Caro brings to the story, most notably the subplot involving the witch Xianniang (Li Gong), does little to elevate the overall story. Which is why some moments, such as Xianniang’s key decision late in the film, play more like plot conveniences rather than true female empowerment. Showing flashes of brilliance throughout, Caro’s film never reaches the heights it aims for. As a result, Mulan is a film that entertains, but does not completely satisfy."
"Nov 13, 2020",negative," THEY have had a couple of minor misfires but on the whole, Disney’s recycling scheme has been a big success. Live-action remakes of animated classics Cinderella, Beauty And The Beast and Aladdin have all been the big box office hits of their years.  But the Mulan  redo marks something of a departure. For one thing, it’s avoiding US and UK cinemas to go straight-to-digital – an unprecedented move for a $200 million movie.  But as this violent action film isn’t suitable for young children, it will have to do remarkably well with teenagers and grown-ups. And it’s the tone of the film that really sets it apart from its fellow remakes. There are no song and dance routines, no cutesy side-kicks and no jokes. This handsomely shot but unusually dour film takes its Chinese mythology and Tang Dynasty setting extremely seriously. It is well-cast and its bloodless violence is slickly orchestrated. But something felt a bit off with it's message. And it took me a while to twig what it was. It wasn’t Mulan (Liu Yifei). By today’s standards, she’s pretty much a bog standard heroine – a young Jedi-like warrior from a rural backwater. As girls aren’t supposed to fight, her father Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma) has told her to hide her “ch'i” until the local matchmaker finds her a husband. Then soldiers arrive in her walled town. A rebellion has broken out on the frontier and the Emperor (Jet Li) has ordered a man from each family to join his army. Before Mulan’s frail father Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma) can limp off to die in battle, she steals his armour, hides her flowing locks and takes his place at a boot camp run by the fearsome Commander Tung (Donnie Yen). The cross-dressing Mulan, now going by the name Hua Jun, impresses Tung with her unsmiling dedication to at least two of the three noble virtues – loyalty, bravery and honesty. And it looks like the Emperor will need her gravity-defying fighting skills. The rebel army of Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) is laying waste to one of his garrisons with the help of shape-shifting witch Xianniang (Gong Li). It was when Khan began to rally his troops, that I realised what was amiss. Deep down, I wanted to be on the side of the villain. When Khan’s generals threaten to abandon him, he reminds them of lands lost in a recent war and of his father, whom the Emperor murdered by his own hand. From here, every move Jet Li’s Emperor made added fuel to the fire. He sends limping old duffers to die in battle, assassinates rivals and barks orders while perched on a garish golden throne. “I know my place,” says the feminist icon when the witch invites her to team up with her and bring down the woman-hating Empire. “It is my duty to fight for the kingdom, to protect the emperor.” Tellingly, the film is still getting a very wide theatrical release in China, a privilege not afforded to the original Mulan. This new version, with its villainous rebels and its message of virtuous “loyalty” sailed through the office of the Communist censors."
"Oct 23, 2020",neutral," Disney’s long-awaited, live-action remake of Mulan is full of legends. There’s the historic warrior Hua Mulan herself, of course, the hero of Chinese folklore immortalized in the 6th-century poem “The Ballad of Mulan,” who disguised herself as a man to go into battle in her father’s stead. Her story was given renewed life in Chu Renhuo’s 17th-century novel Romance of Sui and Tang, and tributed, from then on, ad nauseum: with historical accounts, movies (not only by Disney!), plays, poems, a crater on Venus.  But the legends I have in mind are still living: They’re the names on the marquee. There’s the Wushu master, fight choreographer, and action icon Donnie Yen, star of, among other things, the deservingly popular Ip Man franchise. There’s Jet Li, near-unrecognizable in his role as the Emperor of China, and Gong Li, one of China’s greatest and most celebrated living actresses, who — fabulously and appropriately — adds a bit of sorcery to the mix. There’s wuxia legend Cheng Pei-pei, too, recognizable to an American audience as Jade Fox from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but more notable for starring in the gangbusters wuxia classic Come Drink With Me (1966). And there’s added finesse by way of Tzi Ma (as Mulan’s father, Hua Zhou) and Rosalind Chao (as her mother, Hua Li), both of whom, like many of their co-stars, have long since made headways into the American mainstream, with films like Rush Hour and The Joy Luck Club to their names. This murderer’s row of actors — stars who have all, to varying degrees, led successful crossover careers on which Disney is cannily trying to capitalize — is perhaps the most impressive thing about the new Mulan. As directed by New Zealander Niki Caro and manifest onscreen by star Liu Yifei, who could herself become a crossover as of this movie, Mulan is an altogether just-fine affair. It is soggy with bland action and an oversimple script, self-undermined by all the juicy imperial conflict and menacing wizardry that more or less get marginalized in favor of the movie’s topical but unengaging Big Themes. Mulan’s story, in its many folkloric variations, is a Pandora’s box of potential: There’s war and filial piety, honorable deception, upturned codes of masculinity, and, obviously, a heroic feat of cross-dressing. There’s the fact that, as legend has it, Mulan apparently passed as a man among He-Men for over a decade. Can you imagine? The day-to-day drama of that. The terror, but also the bravery, but also the utter shenanigans, of that. Now there’s a movie.  The movie we get instead is decidedly less exciting, less engaged with the fine-grained particulars of Mulan the person and instead overly smitten with the markets it’s trying to navigate and Mulan’s status as legend. She’s an icon, pure and simple — literally, in this case, as the script imagines little for her beyond the broadest possible strokes. Mulan opens with a young Mulan, in hot pursuit of a chicken run amok, making a mess of her village and souring her family’s reputation in the process. It’s because she’s got a power which, we’re told, women aren’t meant to have: an overabundance of chi. And when her father reminds her that sons bring honor through battle and daughters — meaning Mulan herself — bring honor through marriage, he sets us up for a story that by and large writes itself. Mulan will meet with a matchmaker; she’ll mess that up (while still, to our sympathetic eyes, showing that she’s made of the right stuff). And when an invasion from roving tribe of Rouran warriors threatens to overtake the Silk Road, and with it the empire, an imperial decree will force Mulan’s war-hero father to consider stepping back into battle with no hope of return.  It’s no spoiler to say that Mulan goes to war for her father. And, really, as a re-adaptation of a story Disney has told before, spoilable material doesn’t exactly abound here. But there are key differences from the 1998 movie. Disney’s priority this time around is not to repeat past mistakes — financially, that is. That animated Mulan, with its boisterous, catchy hero-anthems and altogether playful attitude, didn’t play so well in China, where viewers complained that their storied heroine had been overly Americanized. She was too individual. The new Mulan instead tries to have it both ways: admirably independent but, with Eastern values kept tightly in mind, steadfast in her commitment to family and community. There’s even a #MeToo-friendly update: Gone is the animated movie’s (somewhat homoerotic) flirtation between the disguised Mulan and one of her male superiors, Captain Li Shang. Instead she gets to flirt, very cautiously, with a guy of her own rank, Chen Honghui (Yoson An), whose butt she entertainingly kicks. The new film is all about navigating compromises like these, pivoting from crisis to crisis in broad, heightened, and often fairly vague strokes — in part for kids’ sake, someone will argue, which doesn’t give kids enough credit. The most satisfying but still under-explored addition is Gong Li’s Xian Lang, a villain of a sort, only not really; she, like Disney’s new take on Maleficent, plays more like a complicated antiheroine whose fate as a powerful woman shares more than a little in common with what awaits Mulan should her chi be revealed to men.  But because that revelation never feels like a true threat, because the movie is vague and broad in so many ways, something about even this arc proves unsatisfying. No one expects the Disney version of Mulan’s story to be rigorous — even if the most powerful movie studio in the world could afford to take any risks it pleases. No one expects it to dig deep — even if digging deep, being true to ourselves, and unlocking our inner potential are among Disney and the self-help industry’s evergreen themes. It’s no wonder Disney acquired the Star Wars franchise — just as it’s no wonder that the concept of chi, as described in the new Mulan, feels conspicuously similar to The Force. Which probably tells us where The Force came from in the first place.  A better movie would make that connection feel like a more genuine act of reclamation. It’d have a bit more attitude. It’d take better advantage of its deep bench of action stars. It might even — I know, I ask too much — pay more thorough tribute to the Hong Kong B-movie and wuxia classics it very deliberately evokes without really selling us on the point. Instead, Mulan emerges as a curious act of market negotiation. It is a perfectly fine movie; it will no doubt be meaningful for children, especially those who could afford to see more of themselves onscreen in heroines like Mulan. But its cast, its attitude, its overall eagerness to please — all benefits, one would think — don’t add up to a good movie. They add up to a blueprint of the movie this ought to be."
"Oct 16, 2020",negative," El remake en acción real del clásico Disney se acerca más a la balada original, haciéndola más auténtica. Pero el tono más serio acaba pesando demasiado. Qué mala suerte la de 'Mulan'. Disney tenía en este remake en acción real de su clásico animado de los 90 a una de sus mayores apuestas del año, en esta resaca que iba a ser 2020 tras un 2019 en el que reventaron la taquilla varias veces gracias a remakes como 'El Rey León' o eventos como 'Vengadores: Endgame'. Pero llegó el bicho. Y una película con un presupuesto rumoreado de 200 millones de dólares no podía arriesgarse a un estreno a medio gas. Mucho menos en China, zona cero de la pandemia, ya que esta película está hecha para contentarlos a ellos. La pandemia ha acabado condenando su estreno y Disney, que no piensa jugársela como Warner con 'Tenet', ha decidido probar un nuevo modelo de ""estreno premium"" en Disney+. En China, eso sí, llegará a la gran pantalla. Y mejor para ellos. La relación del gigante asiático con la 'Mulan' de 1998 es un poco complicada. Parte del público considera que la cinta de Tony Bancroft y Barry Cook es un cúmulo de errores históricos y topicazos, con el pobre Mushu como principal problema. Se nota en la nueva versión que han puesto mucho esfuerzo para no ofender a nadie y para demostrar (o aparentar al menos) que esta vez han hecho los deberes. La película de Niki Caro se acerca mucho más a la leyenda de Hua Mulan que a la princesa Disney, Fa Mulan. Empezando por recuperar el nombre original de la balada y no la ""americanización"". Desde el principio se nota un cambio de tono y, para alegría de los que aborrecen los calcos de las películas originales, empieza buscando su propio camino describiendo ya a Hua Mulan como una joven diferente de la que conocimos en los 90. La Mulan de Liu Yifei ya demuestra desde bien pequeñita que es realmente ágil y habilidosa. La película lo justifica con el chi, un término que representa la energía de todo lo que nos rodea y que será mencionado varias veces en la película. El padre de Mulan le pide que lo esconda porque las mujeres que canalizan tanto el chi son consideradas brujas y son repudiadas por la sociedad. Ella debe ser discreta, una futura esposa y madre fiel y una chica bien educada. Mulan tiene que esconder su propia naturaleza, como si fuera Elsa. Luchar contra su verdadero yo hará que sí tenga su camino de aprendizaje como el que tenía la Mulan de dibujos animados en el entrenamiento del ejército, pero esta vez la meta será más hacer las paces con ella misma que convertirse en una guerrera, conquistar el ""auténtico"" del mantra de esta película: ""Leal, valiente, auténtico"". Porque ella ya es una guerrera, solo tiene que enseñárselo a todo un país. Para apoyar este nuevo camino han incluido un nuevo personaje, Xianniang, interpretada por Gong Li. Esta mujer (que sirve también para equilibrar un poco la balanza entre tanto hombre) no ha escondido su control del chi y, por tanto, es considerada una bruja, una deshonra. Aunque bruja sí que es porque es capaz de transformarse en otras personas o animales. Aun con las buenas intenciones de haber incluido este personaje, su aportación no tiene el peso que creo que pretendían y, además, resulta un disparo en el pie para una película que justificó la falta de Mushu porque iba a ser una versión más realista de la balada. Pero hay magias y magias, al parecer.  Metámonos en comparaciones. Todo el tono de la cinta es claramente más serio, más solemne. Tanto, que acaba resultando demasiado serio y excesivamente solemne para las dos horas que dura. La película carece por completo de alivios cómicos, no ya de un secundario bufón como Mushu sino de algún mínimo momento para romper con tanta seriedad. Ni la escena de la casamentera, ni los compañeros de barracón de Mulan son capaces de hacer reír, y eso, de nuevo, pesa en el ritmo de una película tan larga. Al verla casi parece que ni siquiera estemos ante una película de Disney. Aun con todas sus incongruencias históricas, la 'Mulan' animada contaba con un encanto y personalidad que su remake no tiene. Vamos, echo de menos a Mushu. La decisión de optar por una película de artes marciales más que por un cuento típico de la casa justifica que las canciones no tengan cabida en el metraje. No tendría sentido que se rompieran a cantar. Al menos la estupenda banda sonora de Harry Gregson-Williams nos ofrece un par de guiños a 'Nombre y honra nos darás' y 'Mi reflejo', y Christina Aguilera se marca una increíble versión de su éxito de la película original en los títulos de crédito, que no esconden más que eso y la nueva canción de la película, 'Loyal, Brave and True'. Pocos guiños más encontraremos al clásico animado, más allá de la escena de la casamentera o llamar a uno de los soldados Grillo. La nueva 'Mulan' no busca darnos otra vez la película que ya conocemos, sino dar la versión que creen que querría el público chino. Así, se han afanado por arreglar los errores históricos y hacer una película lo más respetuosa posible con la cultura china. ¿Pero acaso en China no saben divertirse? Ya hemos hablado de Mushu y de las canciones. Tratemos la tercera patata caliente de la nueva 'Mulan': Li Shang. El icono bisexual para el fandom de la película de animación es dividido en el remake en tres personajes: el comandante Tung, líder del ejército, interpretado por Donnie Yen, el sargento Qiang, personaje de Ron Yuan, y Honghui, compañero de barracón de Mulan, encarnado por Yoson An. Este último es lo más cercano a Li Shang que encontraremos aquí, y tiene tan poquito espacio en el metraje (aunque cuenta con un par de escenas en las que la camaradería roza con la tensión) que reduce mucho la posibilidad de que se forje nada más con ella que compañerismo. Pero, como en el caso de Li Shang, dependerá de los fans. Del lado positivo, encontramos unas escenas de acción resultonas aunque abusen de los tiempos bala y Niki Caro utilice demasiado el recurso de girar el escenario y no los personajes. Al menos las coreografías son muy vistosas, claramente pensadas para que lucieran en una pantalla grande. Porque sí, a 'Mulan' se le nota el alto presupuesto en esas escenas, en su maravilloso diseño de producción, en un vestuario impresionante, en unas localizaciones preciosas. Todo eso no lo vamos a poder ver en una sala de cine, y es realmente una pena. La película es totalmente una superproducción hecha, al menos visualmente, con mimo. Intentad verla en la pantalla más grande posible aunque no pueda ser en la ""pantalla grande"". No se podrá decir, en definitiva, que el remake de 'Mulan' no ha intentado labrar su propia leyenda. Es una película claramente distinta, más madura que la anterior. Pero ese cambio también le quita gran parte del encanto a la princesa Disney. Liu Yifei protagoniza una historia inspiradora envuelta en una puesta en escena muy bonita y colmada de detalles (y probablemente más rigurosa). Pero el clásico animado también era inspirador y nos dio a una princesa Disney adorable y valiente, y con mucha más personalidad que la de la nueva versión. Aunque las dos cuentan con la posibilidad de hacer que niñas y niños luchen por ser quienes son, rompiendo los moldes que hagan falta, la primera versión era mucho más divertida. Buscar con tanto ahínco una película de la que no reniegue el público chino ha acabado por enterrar el sello de Disney. Y películas de artes marciales ya hay muchas. Algunas, incluso, también se llaman 'Mulan'. Lo peor: Es demasiado seria y solemne, y ha perdido la personalidad que sí tenía la animada. Ese diseño de producción merecía verse en pantalla grande."
"Oct 5, 2020",positive," If you were
a fan of the 1998 animated film version of Mulan, this 2020 live-action
feature is the perfect adaptation without being a carbon copy. I was curious to
know if it would still hold up without the joyful musical selection and
charismatic character Mushu played by Eddie Murphy, and it
did by going far beyond some fun-filled adventure for children. If you’re also into
martial arts there’s a surplus of hand-to-hand action to satisfy you as well. While
the fights aren’t the best choreographed that we’ve seen on any screen, they’re
still high enough in standard to get the juices flowing especially with popular
actors from Asian cinema behind all the punches and blows. The titular
character for Mulan played by Yifei Liu (The Forbidden Kingdom)
was perfect in all forms. She had the look, the physicality, and all the
necessary acting skills to sell herself as a noble warrior. While her character
was a handful early on, her role was a great example of how some people find it
difficult to confine themselves to the everyday standards of a given culture.
It was clear that Mulan is someone whose sole purpose in life was to shine. The
additions of Donnie Yen
as Commander Tung and Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan also delivered the goods as well. Both are clashing
on opposing sides than the other for good versus evil, and the film created a
great balance showcasing this conflict. With me being a bigger fan of Donnie
Yen, one disappointment for the film was the lack of use for the character. He
had his fair share of screen time, but I just wanted more. I mean, it’s Donnie
Yen for crying out loud! As far as the action is concerned it by
far reached my expectations (which were admittedly very low for reasons unknown).
As stated before, I have seen better martial arts films, but this one still
holds weight, and I can see myself going back for multiple viewings for not
just a great film, but to get a high from a few fight scenes that made me feel
good inside. I thought the battle tactics were well thought out, strategic, and
planned, and the use of fantastical abilities was sewn in with great accuracy
without appearing too unbelievable for someone not familiar with this form of
entertainment. Such as characters running up walls, transforming into animals,
or possessing unusual levels of strength. It was an easy transition for me, but
maybe somewhat jarring for others.  I respect dearly the overall story of
Mulan. A young woman wanting to represent and protect her family based on her
own personal beliefs and culture. What this film teaches may be simplistic to
some, but at its core, the foundation is to fight for what you believe in no
matter the cost. This sums up the character Mulan in a nutshell, and I can get
behind any character with that much passion and motivation. I’m not an expert on Chinese culture,
but from the little I know I thought the production team did a fantastic job.
The costumes appeared accurate (from what I know), and the set designs were
filled with detail which made you feel as if you were there. It Is very clear
that a lot of time was spent to get everything just right, and from these
lenses, they nearly knocked it all out of the park.  I enjoyed Mulan as much as I enjoyed
the original 1998 animated film. While there were a few nitpicks here and
there, it’s still a film I would recommend to others, and would happily see in
theaters given the option. This film doesn’t fall into the best category, but
more of a personal favorite of mine given the context of action and hand-to-hand
fighting. I wasn’t expecting to be blown away, but I can’t honestly say there
were large or even small portions that turned me off entirely to give a lower
score. "
"Oct 3, 2020",negative," It may look like a film and quack like a film, but something’s just not right with the new Mulan, based on the classic Chinese tale of a young woman who gets conscripted incognito in her disabled father’s place to fend off northern invaders, and gets exposed – yet saves the emperor anyway. Niki Caro directs this live-action remake of the 1998 Disney animated film with a notable lack of vision. The placement of Mandy Walker’s camera is off and limiting, and we frequently wish for another angle, or a wider one. This is worsened by David Coulson’s slightly sluggish editing. Grant Major’s production design feels stagey: supposedly outdoor locations (excluding the battle scene) are obvious soundstages, and the phoenix that replaces Mushu, who was beloved even in China, looks like a kite. And American Humane wasn't able to say in the end credits that no animals were harmed.  The military tactics are atrocious, on both sides. The good guys deploy undertrained conscripts against veteran cavalry, choose a low-lying field for a staging ground, and fall for blatant traps. For their part, the bad guys, led by Jason Scott Lee’s Böri Khan, depend on the subterfuge, shapeshifting, and black magic of Xianniang (Gong Li, delivering the most complex performance of the film), and yet they constantly belittle her. I’m sure that’ll turn out fine.
 It’s just as well that the fight choreography is credited to “Walker and her team,” as it’s pointlessly flashy and – worst of all – graceless. Unlike actual martial arts patterns, the moves on display during military training seem to have little real-world applications. Actual fight scenes are filled with busywork and few hits. And though Mulan’s swordplay is more beautiful, her actual signature move is, I kid you not, a bicycle kick rendered in slow motion. She does it thrice.
 Then there’s the script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, and Lauren Hynek. I have no problem with the elevated language used to convey “classical” Chinese. But there’s just too much clunky exposition. Surely you can find a way into Mulan’s head without constantly having people explain things to other people who should already know them.
 The character motivations make no sense, either. Whereas in the animated original people are exposed or put in danger by mistake or out of neglect, here it happens by choice. When first reporting for duty, Mulan actively picks a fight. The bad guys start the avalanche themselves. Mulan reveals her true gender unprompted. Xianniang tells Böri Khan of her inevitable betrayal without being forced to. Emperor Jet Li gives up the protection of his imperial guards. The list just keeps going.
 Even a remake should be judged on its own merits, but I think the implausible motivations are a byproduct of trying to preserve the same narrative structure as the original. Problem is, the first version was essentially a collection of songs, montage sequences, and fight scenes strung together with Eddie Murphy jokes. The only reason it worked so well is because of how much realism animation can discard – the background for about a fourth of the film was just colors.
 2020’s goal of live-action realism means it has to find a way to navigate jarring scene transitions and behavior bound by physics. Sometimes it works: Mulan avoids showering by volunteering for night watch every single night. Other times, not so much: she pisses off the matchmaker (Pei-Pei Cheng) by misplacing the teapot to hide a very scary-looking spider, when using her words would have sufficed.
 The most perplexing unforced errors have to do with the central message of the film. Like the other entries in Disney’s recent string of “princess” films, it’s about female empowerment. Central to this is the soldiers’ oath to be “loyal, brave, and true,” where “true” apparently means “authentic,” or something like “uncompromisingly honest.” Feminism (or any other discourse) of this tenor is, as a practical matter, isolating and unconducive to material progress. A better message for this non-children’s film would have been to be principled, yes, but also flexible. You should stay true to who you are, but you need not always flaunt it – especially during a war.
 Xianniang tells Mulan as part of a psy-op that concealing her gender makes her weak. Unfortunately, she’s right: Mulan’s father (Tzi Ma) instructs her to hide her powerful qi because a girl needs obedience and grace rather than martial prowess. But she has to be true to herself and tap into the qi that flows through all things to become the powerful warrior she was always meant to be. This isn’t the only parallel with the third Star Wars trilogy. Just as Rey’s power is chalked up to her being Palpatine’s daughter, Mulan’s qi is inherited from her war-hero father. In both cases, this turns an egalitarian tale (1998’s Mulan was a nobody, as was the Rey of Star Wars: The Last Jedi) into an aristocratic affair.
 This brings us to the cultural critique. Despite some historical inaccuracies, at least this Mulan doesn’t offer the vague Orientalism of 1998, so I credit the filmmakers for giving it the ol’ college try. Where it comes up short is in focusing too tightly on the hero’s journey of self-empowerment at the expense of everyone else, except Xianniang, who gets a character arc only because it’s basically the same arc as Mulan’s. To Western eyes, it might seem like the original was also about the hero’s journey, but it was careful to couch everything in accepted social logic. Mulan was not a natural warrior (Crystal Rao delivers a portrait of the warrior as a young girl in the remake). She was never confused about who she really was under that armor, and just wanted to be recognized for who she was. She believed in the value of traditional marriage, despite her lack of wifely skill. She thought it important to get along well with her brothers-in-arms.
 2020 tosses all of that. When Mulan accomplishes the impossible training task, we don’t see her comrades cheering her on; instead, we get a shot that echoes the individualist Romantic painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog. The training ends not when the unit can fight as one, but when Mulan accidentally reveals her skill with a javelin. Honghui expresses doubt that she’d come to her fellow soldiers’ aid, and it’s justified by her behavior up to that point in the story. Mulan ends up in a duel with Xianniang because she leads a small group of anonymous soldiers who charge into a trap. She defeats Böri Khan not with ingenuity and resourcefulness, but thanks to a qi-unlocking speech by the emperor. And she ends up with not a man but a sword; it’s her younger sister (Xana Tang) who gets matched. The film proffers the opposite of the self-censorship or Chinese jingoism some had feared.
 Rigidity of thought leads to rigidity in style. The film feels monotonously gloomy and serious, and grace notes, such as a shot of Mulan emerging from mist, come few and far between. Liu Yifei is artful with the sword, but it’s Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) who actually fights with one in close-quarter fight scenes that obscure the swordplay. Canted angles during garrison sieges add flair but little excitement, unlike the similar shot in the climactic battle of Thor: Ragnarok – and Xianniang’s fighting style seems modeled after Cate Blanchett’s Hela.
 The gray overtones are a pity, for the Confucian social logic that Mulan doesn’t really uphold in this film is a surprisingly flexible one. The Analects (yes, I’m bringing out the big guns) has Confucius saying, “A moral leader is not a specialized utensil” (君子不器) (2.12, translated by David R. Schiller). One shouldn’t adhere rigidly to a set of rituals but find a style of ritual that best fits the occasion and one’s own personality. The cross-dressing soldiers in 1998 reflected this. But though there’s self-expression in Confucian social logic, there’s no Confucian social logic in this film’s self-expression. It’s a valid yet regrettable artistic choice.
 And the story of Mulan should be social and flexible – to be clear, I’m not faulting the film for being creative with the source material. The original Ballad of Mulan (here’s a translation) is actually the tale of a soldier who, like Cincinnatus, gives up her military rank and privileges as soon as she can. Only after she returns home and changes clothes do her comrades realize she’s a woman. The moral in the coda is that, when men and women do the same task with equivalent proficiency, there’s really no difference. But you’d never know that from seeing either of the film adaptations."
"Oct 2, 2020",positive," “Mulan” and “Tenet” are two major blockbuster films that are, in many ways, linked together. They’re both big Hollywood films that were delayed from the coronavirus pandemic. “Tenet” chose to be released in theaters this weekend. Cities and state with open theaters are showing the film this weekend. It’s unclear how well it’ll do. But the film — headed by Christopher Nolan — is going full blast in its effort to return to normal. But “Mulan” chose a different route. Starting Friday, Sept. 4, the film will be available for $30 on Disney Plus through Premier Access. You can stream it, download it and keep it as long as you’re a Disney Plus subscriber. In a few months, it’ll be free on Disney Plus for subscribers, too. After watching “Mulan,” the one major thought that stuck with me is that this really is the perfect family film for the pandemic. When your family is stuck at home, few films are better films to watch than one that promotes positive messages about honor, trust and doing right by your family. “Mulan” is a live-action remake of the animated film, which tells the story of a young woman who takes her father’s place in the emperor’s army, looking to fight off a group looking to takeover the Imperial City in China. It’s a tale we’ve seen before. Many of us know it. And despite some slight changes — like the lack of musical numbers and no Mushu — the film mostly sticks to the script of the original. The film, in many ways, reminded me of “Star Wars.” A young hero with extraordinary abilities on a journey to save a group from destruction. There’s even a tie-in with the Force — in this film, it’s called the Chi — so it’s hard not to draw that comparison. There are sword battles and emperors all around as well. There’s even a Darth Vader-like witch character who represents the dark side version of Mulan. In many ways, “Mulan” is like the “Star Wars” movie we never got — a young heroine who must honor her family going through training in order to defend her world.  And it’s a beautiful film. The colors dance on screen. The contrast of the emperor’s army, wearing red and the invaders, wearing black, is beautifully shown. Sunsets, an avalanche and journeys through the woods all pop off the screen, so it’s an excellent film to watch from an aesthetic point of view. The film does have its flaws. It runs a little too long with multiple endings, much in the same way that “Lord of the Rings” ends. Some of the themes and messages are a little heavy handed. The whole “phoenix rising from the ashes” motif gets a lot of play in this film. And the story moves so quickly that you don’t have time to really get a deep dive into the characters and embrace them. We don’t really learn too much about Mulan’s fellow soldiers, which makes their relationships feel a little hollow. Families may find it difficult to sit through some of the battle scenes. This film is rated PG-13 for a reason (the violence) so don’t expect a clean film in that way. There isn’t blood necessarily, but the battle scenes do show some harsh blows, cracks and snaps that will make you wince if you’re not expecting it. One or two of the battle scenes definitely don’t work well for a children’s film and fit more along the lines of the PG-13 rating. But the film has more important messages sprinkled throughout, and the most important is about honor. Defend those who need help. Give aid to the weak. Always keep your family in mind and do right by them while staying true to who you are. Don’t pretend to be someone else. Don’t hide behind your identity. Embrace who you are for the sake of yourself and your future. Mulan, as a character, is a wonderful role model for young girls and boys, too. She sticks to who she is and keeps her family values strong. She doesn’t let the naysayers knock her down. She doesn’t allow people to bully her or fall victim to the demands of others. She stands up for herself and her true values. She stands as a strong leader. Though there is a slight romance angle in this film, the romance isn’t the entire story. It’s more about power, leadership, strength and honor — all values that can help young children grow into strong adults. It’s a family film with a message. “Mulan” is available for $30 right now, and that’s a good price if you’re a family about to watch the film. Normally you’d pay north of $40 for tickets to see the film in theaters — and that’s not counting the popcorn, the food and the drinks. Now, you can have a night at home with the family, cuddled together under blankets, watching a film that will remind you what’s important in life. Family is what we get to take with us, and watching a film about family with your family will only hit that home. It’s unclear how “Mulan” would have performed in the box office if the coronavirus pandemic hadn’t delayed it. We may never know. Maybe we’ll get numbers from Disney about downloads and whatnot, but we don’t know the true impact of it from that perspective. But in a world full of darkness — a world where death tolls rise, hate speech polarizes and positive messages seem to be lost — having the option to watch a lighthearted film from the comfort of your own home is a win for anyone."
"Oct 2, 2020",neutral," The story: The spirited Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a girl who grows up doing things boys like to do, such as climbing and practising gongfu, to the dismay of her parents (Tzi Ma and Rosalind Chao). After raiders led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and his witch ally Xian Lang (Gong Li) lay waste to several cities, the Emperor (Jet Li) issues a conscription order for the men in the kingdom. Mulan sneaks away in military garb, passing as a man, to take her father's place in the army. A live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated feature, which is based on Chinese legends. When Disney pulls a piece from its animation library for a live-action freshening up, it observes a few rules: jettison the musical numbers; erase the slapstick; delete the racism and lastly, give the grown-ups something to chew on. What is harder is to fill the void with content both kids and grown-ups will enjoy, especially if steering clear of a cultural faux pas is high on the priority list. With this film, Disney has decided to play it safe. The theme of female empowerment, similar to the one that drives 2019's Aladdin, drives this movie as well. But while the tale set in the Middle East soars, the one in ancient China sinks. The 2020 Mulan adaptation suffers from the problem that also plagued 2019's Dumbo (based on the 1941 children's classic), an update that felt more like a mummification. For starters, a choice was made to have everyone speak English in a simplified, non-idiomatic manner. This is an odd decision because if you want characters in ancient China to speak English, you might as well go all in, and have them use the language as naturally and freely as Aladdin's characters do. The next sin is over-Sinicising the exposition. It is the verbal equivalent of crowding a set with ""Oriental"" lanterns and calligraphic scrolls while an extra in a top-knot slurps noodles from a bowl. Here, it happens with ""qi"", mentioned with dismaying frequency as an explanation for Mulan's unfeminine ways. If a word-cloud were to be made from the dialogue, ""qi"" and ""family honour"" would fight for top place. But the worst example of overdoing the gravitas must be the phrase ""Loyal, brave, true"", uttered an excruciating number of times and now the title of the official song performed by Christina Aguilera. Putting aside how it is what's known as ""tattoo Chinese"" - the clunky, Google-translated text favoured by those seeking ethnic ink on their bodies - it is a mantra that sounds profound at first but meaningless if one takes five minutes to think it over. A new character, Gong Li's witch Xian Lang is an interesting new character who deserves a better story arc than the one given in the film. Director Niki Caro, to her credit, is adept at playing with shades of melancholy - there are a couple of tearjerking moments here - but she was handed a tough job."
"Sep 29, 2020",positive,"This Mulan is more straightforward than subtle. There are battles to be fought, an emperor to aid and a girl embracing her power. I wanted something more challenging, artful, disruptive."
"Sep 28, 2020",negative,"Cold, shallow and lackluster despite breathtaking cinematography and costume design."
"Sep 25, 2020",positive," Autumn is well and truly here. The days are getting colder and the nights are getting darker, but if there's one positive to fewer evenings out and more evenings in, it's catching up on these epic movies under a blanket with a hot cuppa. The Terminator franchise looked a goner following 2015's botched and baffling reboot, Terminator Genisys, but this cracking new entry brings the sci-fi action thriller series thrillingly back to life. Ignoring the last three instalments, the movie recreates the irresistible kinetic drive of the first two Terminator films and also sees the return, 28 years on, of Linda Hamilton as kick-ass heroine Sarah Connors. This time Connors is joined by an even more unflinching female hero - an enhanced human soldier named Grace, played with rangy athleticism and sweaty determination by Mackenzie Davis. Grace's role is a familiar one. Echoing the first two Terminator movies, she has been sent from the future to protect the person who holds the key to humanity's survival from the agent of a homicidal artificial intelligence. Humanity's big hope is gutsy Hispanic factory worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), whom we encounter in the Mexico City of 2020, and the remorseless and unstoppable killing machine that is out to get her, played with implacable menace by Gabriel Luna, is a Terminator Rev-9 model sent back from 2042. By now you will, of course, be experiencing a strong feeling of déja vu, but director Tim Miller (Deadpool) and his team positively revel in their movie's repetitions and sprinkle Dark Fate with plenty of knowing callbacks to the earlier films. The biggest of these is Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose role I will leave you to discover. James Cameron is also back, incidentally, as a co-writer and producer. Despite Arnie's presence, Dark Fate remains a determinedly female-driven film and its trio of badass heroines are brilliant. Maxine Peake lets rip as a brash and bolshie Northerner who gets out from under the heel of her abusive husband to become a stand-up comedian in 1970s Britain. The audiences at the gritty working men's clubs she plays don't know what's hit them - and neither does Paddy Considine's smitten book shop owner. There are laughs and tears here, plus an achingly beautiful soundtrack by Richard Hawley, while Peake's defiant heroine has enough brass to keep a doorknob factory going for months. Washed ashore on a desert island following a nautical disaster, Kiersey Clemmons's Jenn shows pluck and resourcefulness as she gets to grips with the exigencies of survival, from lighting fires to spearing fish. Being alone is terrifying enough, but she comes to realise, chillingly, that she is sharing the island with an unseen predator. This taut little thriller from genre specialists Blumhouse starts off as a Castaway-type survival adventure and then turns into a gulp-inducing horror movie. The film is most effective in its first half, before we discover the exact nature of the threat Jenn faces, but Clemens's gutsy, largely solo performance keeps us gripped all the way. An absolute dead ringer in the role, Renée Zellweger is uncannily good as Judy Garland in this fascinating biopic of the legendary star. Like the recent Laurel and Hardy biopic, Stan & Ollie, the film's focus is the end of a starry career and, like the double act in that movie, also finds her performing in Britain. The setting is 1968, Garland is 46 and wrestling a lifetime's demons as she struggles to perform a five-week series of concerts at the Talk of the Town in London, 30 years after The Wizard of Oz shot her to fame. As she tries to keep her act together - with help from new beau Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) and unflappable assistant Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley) - the movie gives us insightful flashbacks to her early Hollywood career and the source of those demons. We see the teenage Judy (Darci Shaw) bullied and drilled by MGM studio boss Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) on how to comport herself on and off screen, and given uppers and downers to keep her working, diet pills to suppress her appetite. The origin, it is clear, of her later addictions and mental turmoil. Director Rupert Goold does, it's true, leave the supporting cast in the shade - including Rufus Sewell as Garland ex-husband number three, Sid Luft, at odds with Garland over the custody of their two children. But the movie's spotlight is where it should be: on Zellweger's Judy. Brilliant at conveying both the star's vulnerability and her still radiant charisma, she is simply sensational - and eminently deserving of her Best Actress Oscar. Righteous anger surges through this urgently timely film for the era of Black Lives Matter. It begins, all too familiarly, with a white police officer pulling over a black couple in a routine traffic stop. Daniel Kaluuya's Slim and Jodie Turner-Smith's Queen have just endured a dismal, spark-free first date (he's unassertive; she's guarded and abrasive), but after the needlessly aggressive encounter with the cop ends in violence they end up as outlaw fugitives, the black Bonnie and Clyde. First-time director Melina Matsoukas's movie isn't just about anger and social protest, however. It is also a road movie and a love story, with Slim and Queen's burgeoning romance unfolding against a backdrop of resonant land- and townscapes as they journey from Ohio towards Florida, much of the way in a vintage turquoise Pontiac Catalina. Kaluuya's and Turner-Smith's chemistry is gorgeous, but the politics is always there, even in off the cuff remarks. 'Why do black people have to be excellent?' asks Slim. 'Why can't we just be ourselves?' With Whale Rider director Niki Caro at the helm, Disney has turned its 1998 animated adventure based on a Chinese folk tale into a spectacular live-action adventure. Liu Yifei plays the story’s eponymous heroine, a spirited maverick who disguises herself as a young man and takes her ailing father’s place in China’s army to defend the country from northern invaders. The new movie drops the animated film’s songs and Eddie Murphy’s dragon, instead giving us a shape-shifting witch, played by Chinese screen legend Gong Li, and thrilling martial-arts combat reminiscent of the gravity-defying action in such films as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers. Chinese-American actress Liu pulls off all these moves with vim and verve, and she conveys the essence of the story’s defiantly disobedient rebel, too. It’s a shame, though, that we can’t enjoy her exploits on the big screen as Caro’s $200million epic has gone directly to streaming on Disney+. A film critic for over 25 years, Jason admits the job can occasionally be glamorous – sitting on a film festival jury in Portugal; hanging out with Baz Luhrmann at the Chateau Marmont; chatting with Sigourney Weaver about The Archers – but he mostly spends his time in darkened rooms watching films. He’s also written theatre and opera reviews, two guide books on Rome, and competed in a race for Yachting World, whose great wheeze it was to send a seasick film critic to write about his time on the ocean waves.

"Sep 22, 2020",positive," Long ago in China, during the time of emperors, Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) is a young woman of marriageable age. Although her rural village is small, a matchmaker (Pei-Pei Cheng) is employed to find her a suitable husband. The problem is Mulan excels in martial arts and doesn't want to be married. This stresses her mother, Hua Li (Rosalind Chao), but her sister, Hua Xiu (Xana Tang), admires her. The other females in the village, however, look down on Mulan when the matchmaking efforts fall apart. Along the Silk Road trade route, the warrior Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee) leads his Rouran hoards toward the Imperial City to take over China, leaving devastation in his path. In response, the emperor (Jet Li) commands that one male from every family must join the imperial army to stop Khan. But Mulan's father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma), a hero who was injured in previous wars, only has two daughters, so he must join the army. Mulan cannot accept her father's sacrifice. She steals his sword, a gift from the emperor with the words ""loyal, brave and true,"" engraved on the blade to describe Zhou's character. She dresses like a young man and makes the treacherous journey to the training camp where she joins other young men who have been conscripted to fight Khan. Khan has a secret weapon, however, a witch, Xianniang (Li Gong), who is a shapeshifter, and is employed to cause havoc so Khan wins his battles. Xianniang was cast out from her village as a child because of her abilities and Khan took her in and gave her a home, recognizing her powers as no one else ever had. Mulan successfully hides her gender but because she will not shower, the men in her unit complain about how badly she smells. Chen Honghui (Yoson An), a young man in her unit, admires Mulan, but she does not want to be friends with anyone. She does promise her unit, however, that they will be safe in the battle to come. ""Mulan"" is the best live-action film to come from Disney in a very long time. Directed by Niki Caro, who gave us the luminous ""Whale Rider"" in 2002 about another young girl called to leadership, revisits familiar thematic territory with a much larger budget. I first watched ""Mulan"" on my 18-inch computer screen but it deserves a very large screen because there is so much to take in. The beauty of the cinematography by Mandy Walker is incomparable and the soundtrack includes melodies from Disney's 1998 animated version of ""Mulan,"" rather than the songs themselves. Usually, too many writers spoil the soup, so to say, and with four writers, Disney took a big chance at losing or skewing the plot, as they did with its 2012 film ""Brave."" Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek and Elizabeth Martin wrote the screenplay that some critics feel favored action over character development. I was engaged in the story from beginning to end, looking to see if the narrative would fall into the Disney romance trap or present an authentic heroic character. I think the current Mulan, as played by Lui, is a young woman her father, family and village could be proud of. At first glance, it might seem like the film fails this test, but looking carefully, you can see that ""Mulan"" has a strong and authentic human, feminist theme guiding it. The answer is yes to the first question; yes to question two, though the conversation starts out about men and marriage (and possible romance) but moves soon enough to family, community and the greater good. As for question three, the women all talk about a man because the culture dictated that marriage was how men and women lived their lives. Though never enthusiastic about possible marriage, once her father was conscripted to the army, Mulan believes her call to take his place transcends whatever good the security of a successful match might give her. Carrying through the feminist theme, the juxtaposition between Mulan and Xianniang proves to be one of the high points of the film. They begin as adversaries, with Xianniang, who morphs into a hawk when needed, threatening Mulan because ""women are not allowed to be powerful."" But Mulan calls out Xianniang to be her best self, letting go of the trauma and bitterness of her childhood and servitude to Khan. If you look carefully at this masked character and the beautiful tiara she wears, it is made out of chains. Actually, both women are hiding their identity, Mulan with her clothing and hair knotted in a bun, and Xianniang with her mask. Their motivations, however, are very different. Neither character becomes free or fully a woman until they have the courage to reveal their true identity. Birds are used as important symbols throughout the story. The film opens with a young Mulan chasing down a renegade chicken and Xianniang turning into a predatory hawk, a negative view of woman's power, and ends with the phoenix, a positive feminist symbol of beauty and sacrificial strength. In an era when ""truth"" is a precious commodity, and lying or deception in the public square is becoming more normalized because there are almost no consequences, Mulan's deception offers viewers something important to talk about. Sure, it's just a story, but cinematic stories tell us who we are and who we ought to be, says Georgetown University professor and author Theresa Sanders. This film offers us a chance to ask what I might have done in a similar circumstance, such as being Jewish in Germany during World War II, or being a Christian who is asked to hide people the government is hunting down. Films are a moral laboratory, after all, and a perfect space to talk about things that matter.

"Sep 22, 2020",negative,A live action mulan actually does lend itself to them doing some pretty great things but it's so similar to the animation with nothing that made the animation endearing [and] charming.

"Sep 22, 2020",positive,"Unlike some movies in the $100-million club, Mulan puts the money on the screen."
"Sep 20, 2020",positive," Lealtad. Valentía. Verdad. Tres virtudes que todo gran guerrero debe poseer. Desde pequeña, Hua Mulan ha demostrado tener dichas cualidades gracias a su carácter aguerrido y a una fuerza indescriptible que emana de su interior. «El chi es para los guerreros, no para las hijas», expresa su padre. «Es hora de que ocultes tu don, de que silencies su voz». En una sociedad cuyo único destino es el de convertirse en esposa y madre, la joven protagonista desafiará las normas culturales para demostrar su valor y su lugar en el mundo.  Continuando con la tradición de adaptar sus historias animadas en producciones de live-action, Disney apuesta en grande con Mulan, una re-interpretación de la cinta de 1998, la cual se basa en una popular leyenda china. La directora Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper’s Wife) está al frente de esta épica de más de 200 millones de dólares de presupuesto que busca complacer no solo a los fanáticos de la película original, sino también al exigente paladar de uno de los mercados cinematográficos más importantes a nivel internacional. Una tarea difícil de balancear, sobretodo después del decepcionante desempeño de Aladdin y The Lion King, dos de las propiedades más queridas de la casa de Mickey Mouse.  Esta nueva versión de Mulan se despoja por completo de los números musicales, inclinándose por algo más serio y menos infantil. Estamos ante el primer live-action de Disney en ostentar la clasificación PG-13, una que se gana a pulso gracias a sus violentas escenas bélicas no aptas para los más pequeños de la casa. Al igual que en el clásico animado, Mulan nos transporta a un periodo antiguo de la civilización china reinado por las grandes dinastías. Tras enterarse que una tribu nómada del norte avanza en batallón hacia la ciudad imperial, el emperador (Jet Li) ordena que un hombre de cada familia se una a las filas del ejército para enfrentar a los invasores.  Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) pone en riesgo el honor de su familia y desafía la tradición del país al hacerse pasar por hombre y enrolarse en el ejército, tomando el lugar que le pertenecía a su padre, un ex-soldado que no está en condición de participar en el combate armado. Bajo las órdenes del comandante Tung (Donnie Yen), la protagonista se someterá a un extenuante entrenamiento físico que le permitirá demostrar la fuerza, la valentía y el liderazgo que lleva consigo, y que tanto se ha encargado de reprimir durante años. La joven tendrá que andar con extremo cuidado para no levantar sospechas entre sus compañeros, ya que si estos llegaran a descubrir su verdadera identidad, le esperaría el máximo castigo: la muerte.  Este nuevo visionado de Mulan sobresale por su magnífica fotografía, a cargo de Mandy Walker, y por el increíble diseño de vestuario de Bina Daigeler. Es una lástima no haber tenido la oportunidad de disfrutar de tan fastuosa producción en formato IMAX, donde seguramente los paisajes, los colores y las secuencias de acción tendrían un mayor impacto. Aunque algunos filtros restan claridad a las escenas bélicas, éstas poseen la energía y el dinamismo que caracteriza al género Wuxia, cine de artes marciales con sofisticadas coreografías. El score añade ese toque épico a la película, y a la vez sacia la nostalgia de los amantes del musical animado al incluir las memorables notas de Reflection.  El mensaje principal de la historia mantiene el mismo poder que hace 22 años. No obstante, Disney decide darle un giro más moderno, haciendo hincapié en una nueva virtud – la devoción a la familia –, y dándole mayor autonomía a su personaje principal. El golpe emocional es más fuerte en esta nueva versión, gracias a las interpretaciones de Yifei Liu y de Tzi Ma, quien da vida al padre de la protagonista.  Aunque Mulan sale ventajosa en comparación a otros recientes remakes de Disney, el live-action pierde el humor, la simpatía y la magia que caracterizó a la producción animada. Los números musicales ayudaban al desarrollo de los personajes y a conectar con sus emociones. La ausencia de estos hace que algunos eventos sucedan por mera inercia, y el guion no sabe bien como llenar (o explicar) dichos espacios vacíos. Personajes como Mushu y la abuela de Mulan son completamente eliminados, llevándose consigo el toque cómico y ligero que ambos agregaban al relato. La película también carece de magia, pese a la introducción de Xianniang, un nuevo personaje interpretado por Li Gong con el cual se busca recuperar el toque de fantasía de la original, pero que resulta forzado e innecesario en el desarrollo de la trama. A diferencia de la antecesora, aquí la amenaza del ejército invasor es mínima y, por ende, uno siente que no hay mucho en juego en las acciones que emprenden la protagonista y sus compañeros.  Pese a todo ello, Mulan es una aventura entretenida, cuyo mensaje de aceptación y emancipación seguramente resonará con las nuevas generaciones. Una épica que merecía haber debutado en la pantalla grande, pero que, aún en casa, la escala de su ambición es palpable. Más allá de ser una princesa de Disney, Mulan consolida su legado como una valiente y honorable guerrera, devota a su familia, y siempre dispuesta a defender y proteger a su pueblo.  Esta película no tiene nada de empoderamiento. La Mulan original le enseñaba a las niñas que con esfuerzo e inteligencia podían hacer cualquier cosa. Pero esta cosa enseña que solo si naces con superpoderes puedes triunfar."

"Sep 17, 2020",negative," From the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes, Cultured Vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming. Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Full disclosure, I haven’t seen any of the Disney live-action remakes since the Jungle Book (which I enjoyed) because I either felt like they looked bad (Lion King), or I just wasn’t interested (Beauty and the Beast). I hope the fact that I’m neither all in on the remakes nor think they’re all garbage gives this negative review credibility, because I was genuinely interested in Mulan and had pretty high hopes for it. I mean, how could I not have high hopes, the live-action Mulan showed so much promise. The cast is filled with martial artists who have made classic martial arts and wuxia films. It’s based on one of the most iconic Disney Renaissance movies. And, as we’ve seen from trailers and posters, the costumes and sets are impeccably designed. But all of these points of praise turn against the movie as it either fails to capitalize on them properly or pushes them beyond their breaking point. The cast boasts Donnie Yen, Jet Li, and Gong Li, all of whom have starred in martial arts and wuxia films. These are actors that can do incredible choreography for a camera and this is no exception for Mulan; it is clear that a lot went into these action sequences. But for some reason, the oft-cited complaint about far too much cutting during action remains a problem for this film that has great choreography and performers who can make it look amazing. Watching bad or mediocre action be cut to hell is one thing, but when you can see that these action scenes could have been great, it’s almost painfully disappointing. To be fair, there is one great action sequence in the film, when Mulan (Liu Yifei) and a band of other imperial soldiers give chase to the Rouran villains who acrobatically flip around on their horses to shoot at their pursuers. We get to see some great horseback action choreography in all its glory, without the hindrance of constant cross-cutting. Like the other Disney classics, the original Mulan is iconic for its music, and I would say that one song in particular has stood the test of time as an important piece of modern movie and internet culture. Yet, the remake has no musical sequences, instead only hinting at some of the original songs through the score. The most we get is an orchestral version of “Reflection” that plays a few times throughout the film. But there’s not even a hint of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You”, and I cannot understand who in the creative process or at the Disney offices decided that the most beloved song from the original movie should be entirely erased from this remake. This erasure of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You”, along with the loss of the other musical numbers, would be disappointing no matter what. But given that we hear hints of “Honor to Us All” and that the orchestral “Reflection” plays as a refrain throughout the movie, it makes the absence of the most culturally important and beloved song from the original more glaring and frustrating. It’s undeniable that a lot of work went into the costumes and sets for the film, and all of them look beautiful. But at a number of points the movie magic slips away and things begin to look too artificial. This is especially a problem with the film’s presentation of the sky. There are so many scenes in the film where the sky is such an astoundingly bright mix of colors that it really just makes the viewer conscious of the fact that these visuals were created on a soundstage in front of a green screen. There’s a scene towards the end in particular that takes place on a bridge in front of one such too-glorious sky that’s reminiscent of the “I Gotta Go My Own Way” bridge sequence in High School Musical 2. It’s confusing to me that the Disney Channel original movie, with its sparkling reflective water in the background, looks better than this US$200 million epic. Sadly these major issues that arise from what could, and should, have been positives aren’t the only ones that drag it down. Throughout the film, most often during action scenes, the edges of the screen blur into soft focus, recreating the worst aspect of Netflix’s Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Instead of updating or even acknowledging Mushu, the remake has a phoenix that flies around every so often and leads the movie to give us a new version of the memed to death “this shot is brilliant” shot from Game of Thrones. The romance with the very charming Honghui (Yoson An), that is overwhelmingly the best thing about this remake, isn’t properly resolved and ends up feeling very unsatisfying. And there’s even a moment of bad dubbing that feels like the creators just gave up and said “ah, it’s good enough.” I really wanted to like this movie. Mulan is one of my favorite Disney animated films and this remake has so many great components, but it fails to even be the sum of those parts. It left me wondering who this was for. The absence of the songs make it not nearly as fun as the original animated film, and the undermining of the action with bad editing makes those sequences pale in comparison with the other action films some of the stars have been in. Mostly, this just left me wanting to rewatch the original Mulan and see Donnie Yen and Jet Li fight in Hero.

"Sep 16, 2020",positive," Drama starring Yifei Liu and Donnie Yen. With China threatened by invaders, the Emperor declares that one man from each family must step up to help defend the country. But with her warrior father in ill health, fearless young woman Hua Mulan decides to pose as a man, take his place and fight for her nation. A young woman poses as a man to join the Imperial Chinese Army's fight against fearsome invaders, but her subterfuge brings the risk of exposure and shame for her family, in Disney's engrossing live-action adventure. The approach is more serious than in the studio's 1998 animated version of the story (there's no wisecracking mini-dragon sidekick for starters), and an equal-rights agenda adds to the gravitas. Kiwi director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) takes her cinematic cues from Zhang Yimou's noted wuxia epics Hero and House of Flying Daggers, replicating their intoxicating blend of exquisite historical Chinese visuals and inventive CGI-assisted action. To deliver this within a family-friendly package is no mean feat, and credit should go to Yifei Liu, who gives a vulnerable-yet-dashing central turn as Mulan, while Gong Li adds complexity as an outcast sorceress. Perhaps a smidgen more humour wouldn't have gone amiss, but this is imaginative, eye-popping cinema, winningly open to the riches of Chinese culture and stirring in its feminist engagement."
"Sep 15, 2020",negative," MULAN *1/2 (115 minutes) PG
After much hyping and many delays, Disney’s much-anticipated historical girl-power action drama has finally landed. And what a thud it makes. Mulan is Disney’s $200 million live-action remake of its wonderful 1998 animated hit. Regrettably, its chief achievement – as with the studio’s remakes of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book and Dumbo – is that it reminds us just how good the original was. Kiwi director Niki Caro (Zookeeper’s Wife; Whale Rider; North Country) fills the film with a lot of brash colour and high-flying movement but not a lot of emotion or energy. Weighing the film down no end is the character of Mulan. For all her fighting skills and warrior spirit, our heroine is difficult to warm to as she slices and slashes her way to the film’s climactic face-off. She may have an independent spirit but she is given no inner life by the stony-faced lead performance from Yufei Liu, who twirls through the film with one stern expression (possibly two) frozen on her face. She’s a tough cookie, we know, but does she have to be such a cold fish? She is presented as such a stolid ice maiden warrior there’s no real vulnerability to her. The saga of Mulan is set long ago in a semi-magical time of war where a young girl with super-human fighting abilities pretends to be a boy so she can join the Imperial army and do battle with her nation’s enemies. The Emperor (Jet Li) is threatened by a band of ruthless horse-riding bad guys who like piling the helmeted heads of their victims into neat stacks to intimidate the populace. Their leader Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) is an especially motivated gent, determined to avenge the death of his father by penetrating the Imperial palace and slicing the Emperor into several pieces.

Bori Khan’s guys are fearsome enough. They ride mighty steeds, wear imposing black garb and have nifty archery skills wherein they can bullseye a pursuing adversary while riding backwards on their horses. On top of this they have a supernatural ally in Xianniang (Gong Li), an attractive witch (aren’t they all?) with heavy eye make-up who has the ability to change form, her creature of choice being an all-seeing eagle. Yet the witch has a hidden agenda. While she’s meant to be bad to the bone, Xianniang has an over-powering personal interest in Mulan and her remarkable strength, called ch’i (or “qi”). Her hunger to partner with Mulan leads to a lot of familiar-sounding Star Wars-like chatter about this all-encompassing, Force-like ch’i energy. You half-expect Obi Wan to do a walk on. In battle Mulan acquits herself with exceptional skill, but when the inevitable moment comes and her true identity is revealed her fellow soldiers are thrown into a tizz, unable to reconcile her heroic feats with the fact that she’s not a bloke. Even given the license we grant a magic-tinged film such as Mulan it’s a stretch to swallow how the face of a beautiful, smooth-skinned young woman can go unnoticed amidst all the rough features and facial hair of her fellow soldiers, none of whom ever whispers to another: “Hey, does that dude look like a lady or what?”. The ruse worked in animation but not here. Putting a bit of schmutz on her face certainly doesn’t do the trick. It makes the training sequences look like an elongated blooper. And those training sequences are long and largely unnecessary. We know from the get-go that Mulan possesses seemingly super-human abilities when it comes to jumping, leaping, flipping, balancing, running, kicking and swordsmanship. (Or should that be swordspersonship?) So why does her prowess need to be restated so many times? Where’s a good training montage when you need it? Have the Rocky films taught us nothing? This underscores another major flub in the adaptation from the 1998 film. Mulan was not a born soldier and so had to work hard to prove herself. That made her journey tougher and, thus, far more interesting. So why gift Mulan MkII with innate fighting skills? It robs her character of growth and challenge. It’s another point of departure from the original that turns Mulan into an expensive bland out. The most unenviable hurdle faced by Mulan is its desire to stage great battle scenes, but within the confines of a family film. It wants so badly to deliver impressive hand-to-hand clashes, yet has to dial down the violence to hang on to its all-important PG rating. It’s a tough trade off. With the sweeping aerial shots of warriors charging across the landscape, no problem. Up close, however, well, there clearly can’t be any geysers of blood or brutal dismemberment, you can’t dwell on all the stabbing and the spearing and the slicing that’s obviously going on. Hence the killing has to be muted and abstracted with fast editing, yet it all still looks a tad phony, especially when Mulan neutralizes her enemies just by whacking them them. One kick and down they go. There are lots of armoured soldiers on horseback and on foot engaged in a cacophany of clanging – sounding much like somebody rifling through a cutlery drawer – but there’s nothing particularly thrilling in the cinematography by Mandy Walker (Australia; Hidden Figures; Lantana), which is very mannered and conventional. We never get the sense of grandeur we saw in the battle scenes from Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films, nor the tension Stanley Kubrick generated in that classic skirmish in Barry Lyndon. When it comes to seeing Mulan as a girl-power film championing the cause of female action heroes who can hold their own and have minds of their own and thrive on their spirit of independence, well – yeah. We got that. We’ve had it for decades now. These are powerful themes to have driving a narrative, but filmmakers need to work much harder to make them play naturally on-screen and to stop making out as though they’re anything new. After all, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and its magnificent kick-ass women is 20 years old. Indeed, the making of that girl-power classic was inspired by the success of the original Mulan, which demonstrated the mass-market appeal of strong action-movie female leads. Most studios have made the costly decision to wait out the virus before unleashing their big films. These include such popcorn sellers as: Wonder Woman: 1984; No Time to Die; ; Fast & Furious 9; Black Widow; Ghostbusters: Afterlife; Candyman; and A Quiet Place 2. In a normal world, Mulan probably would have made about $800m to a billion in cinemas. Then, once it had soaked up every last cent from its theatrical run, it would have been released into the stream where it would have made a comparable amount of dough. So by going straight into the stream, the film carries the daunting burden of needing to make around twice what it would normally make in its home market release to reclaim the revenue it was denied at the box office. Thus, the expense of seeing it on TV. Should Mulan eventually get the numbers it would normally have done it won’t be the game changer many predict. The movie business is way too conservative for that. It might lower the level of anxiety about releasing big films straight into the stream, but one successful case wouldn’t be enough to create a new business model. Never forget, studios will not easily surrender the beautiful billions they make at the cinema before sending films to the lounge room. They want those crowded houses. Should Mulan tank, forget about seeing any of 2020’s other big films at home in the near future. No studio head would have the stones to declare: “We shall succeed where Mulan failed!” Not with billions at stake. Almost any film with a global profile draws heat of one sort or another and Mulan is no exception. Eddies of controversy have graced the film’s release, with some souls in the LGBTetc community upset that the romantic fizz between Mulan and her superior in the original film has largely vanished in this one (but for a passing hint). There have even been grumbles that the film wasn’t directed by an Asian. Ang Lee (Life of Pi; Brokeback Mountain; Sense & Sensibility) was apparently approached but couldn’t do it due to scheduling conflicts. Hmm. Given that he directed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon one wonders what wonders he would have brought to the table. Those sold on the hype might justify paying $35 to see Mulan at home. But is it worth it? An idea might be to cram as many people in front of the screen to help make it a viewing “event”. But it’s probably better to wait until 4 December when you can see Mulan on Disney+ at no extra charge. That’d be the best call."
"Sep 15, 2020",positive," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. After months in limbo, the live-action “Mulan” claims its place as the best Disney remake to date. With so much riding on its success, “Mulan” dared to be different, honoring not one but two source materials – the beloved 1998 animated film and the Chinese folk song “Ballad of Mulan” – and creating an entertaining movie that stands on its own.  The story will be familiar to fans: When her weakened father, Hua Zhou (played by Tzi Ma), is called to serve in a second war, Mulan (Liu Yifei) disguises herself as a man and joins the imperial army in his place. If discovered, she faces the death penalty. She steals his armor and sword, which in this telling has three words inscribed on the blade: loyal, brave, and true. This becomes the film’s guiding mantra, as Mulan tries to embody these values in a society that makes no room for a female warrior. The film is a visual masterpiece. Shot in New Zealand, it is full of rich colors and textures from start to finish. Every costume, set, and even prop is beautifully crafted, transporting viewers into a highly saturated version of sixth-century China. In battle, cannons and sword fights play second fiddle to beautifully choreographed martial arts. Characters run sideways along walls, flip head-over-heals on horseback, and dodge arrows à la “The Matrix,” with all the dramatic, slow-motion shots you’d expect from a classic martial arts movie. It’s thrilling to watch, and an impressive accomplishment for director Niki Caro.  In 1998, the animated film “Mulan” offered a generation of young girls a new kind of role model, one who defied gender norms and expectations. Disney’s live-action remake stumbles in spots but holds true to that legacy of empowerment. The lack of shot-for-shot fidelity to the animated classic will inevitably disappoint some viewers. There is no Mushu, Shang, or sassy grandma. A training montage scored by an instrumental version of “Reflection,” the hit song from the original film, is an ultimately underwhelming nod to the 90s movie. But that’s OK – unlike her animated counterpart, this Mulan is already a skilled fighter, a natural master of chi, the energy connecting all living things. It’s a quality that is demonized in women and celebrated in men.  The most rewarding change is the villains; instead of the one-dimensional Huns, this movie sticks to the original legend by centering on a vengeful nomadic group known as the Rourans. The Rourans are assisted by enslaved witch Xian Lang, played brilliantly by Gong Li. In a parallel to Mulan’s chi, Xian Lang’s gifts are feared by men. Like a sheep in wolf’s clothing, Xian Lang is an interesting mix of enemy and ally. When she and Mulan first meet on the battlefield, she sees right through Mulan’s disguise. “Your deceit weakens you,” she tells her, which inspires Mulan to reveal her identity, helping chip away at that question about loyalty, bravery, and truth.  Still, the film is far from perfect. A couple of the fight scenes felt hastily cut, attempts at humor rarely land, and, strangely, I don’t recall a single drop of blood in the entire movie. Most distracting for me was the ham-handed bird imagery. Mulan is followed by a multicolored, computer-generated phoenix that acts as a sort of spirit guide, frequently swooping in and yanking attention away from the breathtaking cinematography. Xian Lang also transforms herself into a hawk or flock of crows often. All together, these effects felt a bit overdone. The opposite is true for the lead actress. While her co-stars were busy emoting, Liu kept Mulan’s face too restrained. There’s nothing wrong with taking a subtle route, but with every other element of this film being so over the top, it was jarring to have the main character maintain such a neutral facade. Ultimately, the most moving scenes revolve around family, particularly those between Mulan and her father. This movie takes time to develop their relationship, offering viewers insight into the pain of raising a child in a world that simply is not built for her. As the narrator, Hua Zhou puts these family relationships front and center, securing the movie’s status as a timeless retelling of the female warrior folktale.  And his opening words are a good reminder for “Mulan” fans and new viewers alike: “There have been many tales of the great warrior Mulan. ... This one is mine.” Editor's note: While reportedly much of ""Mulan"" was shot in New Zealand, in its opening weekend, filmmakers revealed that some research was done in Xinjiang in China, and authorities in the region were also thanked in the credits. That is controversial because of human rights concerns about the treatment of the Uyghur population there. Claims that the movie was filmed in the region have followed. Disney had not commented as of Sept. 9. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

"Sep 14, 2020",positive," No Mushu, no songs, no problem. It’s an empowering action spectacle  that, although it stumbles out of the gate, is held aloft by its progressive depiction of life in the barracks, lush pageantry and committed actors who who hit more than they miss."
"Sep 13, 2020",positive," A new telling of the narrative poem, “The Ballad of Mulan,” which also inspired the 1998 animated film, Yifei Liu stars as Hua Mulan, a young woman who risks her life and her family’s honor to save her father from conscription in the Imperial Army. A war hero in his day, Zhou (Tzi Ma) is now an old man, living with age and injuries from the battles of his own youth. When the Emperor orders one man from every family to join the army, Zhou, who only has daughters, knows he is duty-bound to serve. But Mulan sneaks away in the night, disguises herself as a man, and takes her father’s place. Myths and fairy tales are full of stories about daring young women who don’t fit into their prescribed societal roles. They fight norms and expectations to forge their own paths. Mulan’s motivation doesn’t come from her own innate sense of destiny or inner feelings of suppressed greatness, but of a simple desire to protect her father. Not unlike Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Mulan willingly gives up her own future to save him. But where Belle’s sacrifice involved a castle and a giant library and servants, Mulan’s sends her into war against a deadly enemy. Niki Caro takes great care to set the scene of Mulan’s quaint life. We first meet her as a precocious young girl who is clearly different from her younger sister. She is especially close with her father who appreciates all the things that make her so unique, even while having to break the news that her life’s duty will be to get married one day. It could have been a heavy-handed and cliched conversation, but the tender moment between father and daughter rests under the comforting weight that they both know this is an unfair expectation. As her older, marriageable self, the pageantry of tradition receives a light-hearted touch. Her face is painted, she’s wrapped in traditional dress, her long, flowing hair is tied up into a knot on top of her head, and she shuffles her way to the matchmaker’s house for tea. The silliness of the scene is not to mock these ancient traditions, but to portray Mulan’s lack of attachment to customs that would require her to become a painted doll and judged for her marital worthiness. Caro finds the delicate balance between the importance of tradition and the need some have to unburden themselves from it. Yifei Liu presents herself as a stoic leading lady, rarely revealing her true emotions about anything, and certainly never when anyone is around to see it. It is trait women rarely get to portray, as the “strong, quiet types” are usually reserved for men. Liu does so with a level of grace and dignity that never leaves us questioning whether Mulan has feelings, only what they are. Liu is also surrounded by a talented cast of supporting actors, including Donnie Yen, Yoson An, Jun Yu, and Ron Yuan, as well as Jason Scott Lee and Gong Li. These supporting performances are good, even if the characters themselves are virtually indistinguishable, standard-issue military commanders, conscripted soldiers, bad guys. Two scenes between Liu and Li, however, are particularly compelling for what they don’t say, almost as much as for what they do say. The performances and well-known story would be enough to make Mulan an enjoyable movie. But it isn’t merely enjoyable, it is a film to be savored. Mandy Walker‘s stunning cinematography showcases majestic landscapes and mountain ranges, the serenity of a small lake, the delicate porcelain of a teacup breaking. Grant Major‘s production design captures scale and scope, from a small, rural village to the Emperor’s sprawling gilded palace. He and costume designer Bina Daigeler developed a striking color palette perfectly suited to a historical epic tinged with elements of fantasy. The use of color also makes this live-action telling feel more closely related, though entirely separate, from its animated sister. In this age of live-action remakes of animated favorites, Mulan stands out from the rest, not only for its beauty and grandeur but for its overwhelming sense of necessity and importance. Like its heroine, this is a film that forges its own path and is content to be its own magnificent creation."
"Sep 13, 2020",positive," When Disney announced they would be making a live action version of Mulan, many people were in an uproar.  Some because characters changed, others for fear the film would be whitewashed.  Walt Disney Pictures and screenwriters Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek, and Elizabeth Martin came through with a film that both honored the spirit of Ballad of Mulan as well as the 1998 animated feature. When we first meet young Mulan in live action, she chases a chicken onto a roof much to the dismay of her entire village.  The only person even remotely proud is her father, until he realizes it wasn’t honorable for a young lady.  Crystal Rao plays young Mulan in a couple scenes, but still gives a great performance.  Tzi Ma (Man In the High Castle, The Farewell) plays Mulan’s father, Hua Zhou, with another great performance. Mulan’s mother, Hua Li, is sternly yet lovingly portrayed by Rosalind Chao who Trekkies may know as Keiko O’Brien. Liu Yifei is great as Mulan-her fighting skills and up close work really convey Mulan’s struggles.  Instead of Li Shang from the 1998 animated film, we get Donnie Yen playing Commander Tung.  As always, he kicks butt while adding some mentorship without the problematic romantic undertones. For those who miss Li Shang’s attraction to Mulan, enter the adorable Yoson as Chen Honghui, a co-recruit of Mulan who makes the same googly eyes at her the entire movie. During training, one of the commanders says “I’ll make men out of every single one of you,” harkening back to the song “I’ll make a Man Out of You” from the cartoon. Jason Scott Lee portrays charismatic Rouran leader Bori Khan, based on Shan Yu from the animated film. Gong Li plays Xian Lang, a shapeshifting witch who is an ally to Bori Khan.  We get a cameo from Jet Li as The Emperor of China.  He has been noticeably absent from film in recent years, thankfully his youngest daughter convinced him to take it.  He mostly sits on a golden throne and gives orders, but he does get do a bit of fighting. While none of Director Niki Caro’s setups are particularly groundbreaking, they are still well done at conveying the story.  She mixes beautiful wide sweeping shots with more upclose intimate scenes. Caro and her team did do an excellent job showing Chinese culture with elaborate sets and gorgeous costumes.  The presentation of loyal, brave, true, and devotion represent the long time values of China’s people.  Although it is about war, this film is for the most part family friendly.  If you allow your children to watch superhero movies, Mulan is more friendly. Paying $29.99 for this film on top of a Disney+ subscription, might not be your cup of tea, but if you have a subscription and can wait until it is released, watch it when you can. Mulan on Disney+ is not a musical and characters have been changed from the 1998 film, but it still honored the spirit of Ballad of Mulan as well as the animated feature."
"Sep 13, 2020",negative," It’s impossible not to be conscious of the politics surrounding the release of Disney’s flying martial arts, picturesque live-action remake of Mulan. A noisy campaign to boycott the film has been growing since its star, Chinese actor Liu Yifei, voiced support for the Hong Kong police during the city’s pro-democracy protests last year, culminating with this week’s revelation that it was partly filmed in Xinjiang, where human rights abuses are alleged against Muslim Uygurs. Disney’s transparent desire to capitalise on the Chinese market – with a faithfully unquestioning stance – explains the watered-down adaptation, which appeases more than it excites. In this new take on the epic gender-flipping Chinese tale, solemnity takes precedence over lighthearted comedy. What’s lost from the studio’s delightfully fun original 1998 animation – encapsulated by Eddie Murphy’s vibrant mini-dragon sidekick, Mushu – is shimmered over with a grand multimillion-dollar treatment. Mulan’s story originated as a Chinese 5th- or 6th-century poem, “The Ballad of Mulan” by Guo Maoqian, in which the (most likely fictional) female warrior Hua Mulan takes her father’s place when the emperor enlists one man from each family to serve in the imperial army to defend the empire from northern invaders. As a popular children’s folk story, Mulan has been seen as the Chinese equivalent of France’s Joan of Arc, and for centuries has inspired Chinese retellings in films, novels, plays and operas, most recently in the eponymous 2009 film directed by Jingle Ma. Its best-known Western version is Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook’s 1998 English-language animated film, an adaptation that also connected particularly with Asian–American and other diasporic audiences. New Zealand-born Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper’s Wife) directs the animation’s live-action remake as a cinematic large-scale event with gravitas and occasional family-friendly whimsy. It’s a combination that leaves the film unchallengingly palatable, although spectacularly good-looking. With characters springing fully fleshed from their two-dimensional animation equivalents (with some changes to boot), Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek and Elizabeth Martin’s screenplay seizes this opportunity to sketch out the ingrained values that propel Mulan to her ultimate humble victory. The retelling embeds a reflexive play on its narrator, who at the start of the film acknowledges that there are “many tales of Mulan … this one is mine”. The identity of this omniscient narrator is Mulan’s father, Hua Zhou, but the ambiguity of his statement seems to be less of a self-critical nod to its all-white writing and directing team, and more of a shield against any potential criticisms of cultural inauthenticity or historical inaccuracy. The overall narrative trajectory of the film mirrors its model. The film opens with Mulan as a child, chasing an escaped chicken through her home village. When she gleefully catches the bird, she’s immediately reprimanded for the disorder she’s caused. While there’s some fleeting pride on her father’s face (Tzi Ma, in yet another poignant hard-faced-but-soft-on-the-inside dad figure), the judgemental titters from the village quickly turn that feeling to shame. In the film’s present time line, Mulan is now a young woman – her “powers” squandered, her personality concealed. Her mother, Hua Li (played by The Joy Luck Club’s Rosalind Chao), teaches Mulan to hide her gift as a form of protection and, instead, to bring “honour to family” as a daughter destined for marriage. But Mulan’s refusal to bow to the pressure to be a quiet, composed woman sees her bolting away on her horse in the dead of night, determined to save her ailing father at the risk of her own life. It’s difficult to watch Caro’s film and not nitpick the changes between the animation and the live-action film, as Disney’s recent string of remakes have often emphasised nostalgia over originality (Jon Favreau’s 2019 The Lion King included scenes that replicated its animated predecessor shot for shot). On the other hand, Caro’s take on Mulan’s story goes beyond the purist definition of “adaptation”, opening new facets on Mulan’s gritty journey to respected warrior. There are minor adjustments, such as the inclusion of Mulan’s younger sister, to more significant changes, in particular the splitting up of her previous love interest, Captain Li Shang, into an older Commander Tung (Donnie Yen), and a younger ally, Chen Honghui (Yoson An). It leads to one of the film’s more-awkward-than-funny scenes, in which Honghui catches Mulan bathing in a lake: he offers her a truce as “equal[s]”, as she desperately turns her back to him, attempting to conceal that she is a woman. The differing attributes of the two versions are tied less to any creative liberties and more to the tone and spirit that underpin each of them. The lively 1998 animation had an amusing, tongue-in-cheek flavour, with the inclusion of Matthew Wilder and David Zippel’s melodic ballad “Reflection” and the catchy boot-camp song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You”. These songs emotionally express, respectively, Mulan’s cathartic questioning of her identity, and the transformative empowerment that comes with overcoming physical adversities. Caro’s film fades these tunes into the background of Harry Gregson-Williams’ thrumming orchestral score as mere whispering reminders. This furrowed-brow seriousness also leaves the tracking of Mulan’s triumph over her male counterparts to explicit dialogue – Commander Tung literally says, “We are going to make men out of all of you” – and earnest training montages. In skimping the comic antics attached to Mulan’s mistaken identity, the film also sacrifices any angsty romantic confusion between Mulan and Honghui, which had a hand in fostering Shang’s character development in the animated version. The film’s sombre wartime mood is, however, aesthetically exquisite. In an attempt to create a wuxia film – a martial arts storytelling genre with a long tradition in Chinese culture – the script sneaks in superficial mentions of “the power of chi” that spell out the need for Mulan to harness chi to truly flourish as a warrior. What taps into the genre more successfully are the detailed production design and martial arts choreography, with slow-motion lifts into the air with red drapery, impressive arrow-dodging, wall-climbing and rooftop-jumping on imperial palaces. Mandy Walker’s cinematography slickly turns the camera all degrees and angles to capture its heroine’s gravity-defying movements. Perhaps on the big screen the theatricality of its action would have appeared more dazzling – nevertheless on the small screen, as it’s released on Disney+, it’s still strikingly elegant. Liu largely plays Mulan as staid and unsmiling, which works in this version as there’s nothing much to laugh about. Liu and Gong Li – in the role of Xianniang, a shapeshifting sorceress who has crossed to the dark side – are Chinese stars who bridge the Hollywood gap, acting in a film where the Asian cast members speak in accented English. In the light of the two actors’ local backgrounds, it presents an intriguing parallel with their characters’ duality as women vilified for their special powers. As a slave to Jason Scott Lee’s one-dimensional villain, Böri Khan, whose vengeance story is relatively pedestrian, Xianniang’s insecurities are given vulnerable depths. Ironically, although screen legend Gong is easily the strongest actor in Caro’s ensemble, her character ultimately must play second fiddle to Khan. Gong invests Xianniang with a yearning to be accepted, a feeling that Mulan fights under her desire to break free of her disguise. Caro taps into that sensitivity, highlighting how female submissiveness can become conditioned and internalised by anyone. However short-lived, the blurring between good and evil poses a moral question for Mulan, allowing her to emerge as a fuller, more realistic leader who has considered the complexities of her choices. While Mulan’s adventures as she wields her sword across desert battlefields are more for spectacle than to represent any real progressiveness, Caro’s film still stands as a welcome refreshment among Disney’s repertoire of remakes. The drama may follow the studio rule book of underscoring the same simple message over and over – this time it’s “loyal, brave and true”, as well as the overused Asian principle of “family honour” – but the overall effect is easy enough to swallow if you overlook Disney’s preservation of its own mantra for the obvious commercial benefits. Whether the film satisfies the cultural resonances it claims to uphold is another question altogether.

"Sep 12, 2020",positive," I want to remind everyone that I’m in my 14th year as a film critic and am a voting member of the Critics’ Choice Awards. I’m happy also to tell you that I’ve been accepted as press to cover the Toronto International Film Festival this year. Stay tuned for updates! First up, Mulan a stunningly gorgeous film about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to fight in the Emperor’s Army. Yifei Liu stars as Mulan, a brave, devoted daughter. Tzi Ma stars as her father. It’s the folk tale of Hua Mulan and Disney’s stunning live-action retelling of a woman who disguises herself as a man to fight for her king and country. Unlike in the 1998 animated version, Mulan joins the army not only to spare her father but also because she has astonishing fighting moves. Mulan discovers she’ll never unleash her chi—inner energy. She realizes if she wants to lead, she must confess to her commander that she is a female. Her journey is intertwined with that of another woman with unusual abilities.
Disney’s recent remakes have fallen short in the script department, “Mulan” has the girl empowerment story and the stunning visuals. I’m Way in four stars out of four. “Mulan” raises the bar in Disney sequels. This one is outstanding. The strong, gorgeous storyline for Mulan, the female character, sets a wonderful role model for all girls worldwide."
"Sep 12, 2020",negative," The slick and stylish remake admirably takes a different approach than its predecessors in the recent parade of Disney live-action adaptations of the studio’s animated classics by straying further from the 1998 original. That’s a worthwhile endeavor, but the transformation of a lighthearted coming-of-age story into a darker battle epic generally fails to take the material in a compelling new direction while subtly streamlining cultural specifics for mainstream consumption. The story takes place in China many centuries ago, when the title character (Yifei Liu) has the physical gifts of a great warrior. Yet her gender renders her ineligible to serve on the Imperial Army, even with the country on the brink of war. When the emperor (Jet Li) decrees that a man from each clan must serve, Mulan’s ailing father (Tzi Ma) is forced to volunteer. Wanting to break free from rigid patriarchal customs, Mulan disguises herself as a man in order to infiltrate the army and save her father. This version of Mulan deviates from the kid-friendly tone of its source material by jettisoning the musical numbers and the romantic subplot. It also replaces the wisecracking dragon sidekick with a soaring phoenix whose presence brings with it some obvious metaphors. The thinly sketched if well-intentioned tale of female empowerment spotlights a tough-minded character who’s resilient and courageous—a worthy role model for girls from any cultural background. Plus, Liu’s spirited portrayal generates sympathy for Mulan’s perilous mission and her ethical dilemma. Still, the androgynous scheme is less convincing in live-action form, particularly when compared to the vivid intensity of the battle scenes. As directed by Kiwi filmmaker Niki Caro (Whale Rider), the film is highlighted by pristine production values, including gorgeous cinematography and a dazzling array of visual effects. As a war movie, it’s oversimplified and predictable if occasionally chilling. However, the intimate character-driven sequences resonate more powerfully in reflecting Mulan’s journey to acceptance and self-discovery. The film amps up the violent swordplay and combat action — along with the requisite slow motion for gimmicky emphasis — yet lacks the narrative depth and dramatic urgency to match its visual splendor."
"Sep 11, 2020",positive,The stunning natural vistas and jaw-dropping PG-13 action sequences make this a film every member of the family is likely to enjoy.
"Sep 11, 2020",positive," I am very much a nonfan of Disney’s adventure in mounting live-action versions of its animated films. With the exception of 2016’s The Jungle Book, The Mouse has not yet found good creative reasons for any of these do-overs, and these movies have played like unintentional self-parody. They are the Hollywood equivalent of what we’ve seen in politics in recent years: those who’ve always had miserable motives for their words and actions no longer feel the need to pretend otherwise, and are saying what had previously been the unsaid quiet parts out loud. With these mostly tedious reboots, Disney is not even hiding the fact that its business these days is grabbing cash however it can. Small wonder, then: its new version of Mulan does not, in fact, play like an unintentional parody. Alas, it doesn’t play as much of anything else, even as it diverges from the original cartoon in more substantial ways than its live-action-remake predecessors have. And yet this is not the distinguishing mark that it might have been. I felt that the silliness of the 1998 cartoon, and the insipid songs tacked on to force it into the Disney-musical category, undermined the serious side of the tale it was telling. The limp music and the goofy sidekicks are gone here… but they haven’t been replaced with something else. We’re left with a tale that is so solemn that it avoids almost all humor. And it doesn’t have much life, either. We still have young Mulan (Yifei Liu: The Forbidden Kingdom), chafing at the limitations placed upon her as a girl in imperial China, where the only way she can bring honor to her family is by becoming a silent, obedient wife to a man she won’t even get to choose for her husband. An active, lively young woman, seeking another path to honor that also honors her own desires, she disguises herself as a boy and sneaks off to take the place of her disabled father (Tzi Ma: Arrival, The Campaign) when the emperor (Jet Li [The Expendables 3, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor], briefly) calls up an army to repel invading Huns. It’s all… fine (she said with a sigh of resignation and of low expectations just barely exceeded). Mulan may be a bit too simple for adults and a bit too violent for kids — this is like a martial-arts movie for grade-schoolers — but I guess that isn’t the worst thing in the world, if it gets Western kids excited about Asian cinema. It’s all… acceptably inoffensive, if less than wholly engaging. The big thing that Mulan does get right is director Niko Caro’s (McFarland USA, Whale Rider) visual take on the legendary Chinese figure: it is refreshingly free of the sort of fetishization we often get when male directors take on female action heroes. Caro eschews, too, the exoticization of Asian women that often afflicts Western filmmaking. (Three of the four screenwriters are also women: Amanda Silver [In the Heart of the Sea, Jurassic World], Elizabeth Martin, and Lauren Hynek; Rick Jaffa [Rise of the Planet of the Apes] is the fourth.) It’s a low bar, but one that too many movies cannot seem to get over. Combined with Liu’s stately central performance, in which she exudes pride, honor, and a strength both physical and psychological, it makes this Mulan a wonderful role model for girls who aren’t much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations, which is rare in children’s movies. I do wish, though, that the movie was craftier about the spiritual connection between Mulan and the witch Xianniang (an absolutely badass Li Gong: Hannibal Rising, Curse of the Golden Flower), who is allied with the Huns. The movie pops its head above the parapet just a tad for the idea of women having to hide all sorts of gifts if those gifts aren’t the ones women are “supposed” to have… and then it instantly pulls it back down again. But… fine. If the gender dynamics here aren’t as problematic as those of some Disney movies, there are other worrying matters. Some fans are calling for the film to be boycotted because of star Liu’s public support for Hong Kong police and their violent crackdowns on pro-democracy protestors. That may be a matter of how well a movie lover wants to — or is able to — separate the art from the artist. Far less ambiguous is Disney’s own tacit support for Beijing’s genocide of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region of China, where some of the film was shot; the movie’s credits thank multiple propaganda departments in Xinjiang for their assistance in the production. That thing about saying the quiet part out loud? It looks as if Disney has decided that ensuring access to the newly lucrative Chinese moviegoing market, no matter what horrors Beijing is engaged in, is something it can openly court without damaging its business in the West. Can it? Mulan is the Alliance of Women Film Journalists’ Movie of the Week for September 11th. Read the comments from AWFJ members — including me — on why the film deserves this honor. So none of the filmmakers—not the director nor any of the four screenwriters (nor, apparently, the costume designer)—were Chinese? This feels like a huge missed opportunity to have an Asian story told by Asian storytellers through an Asian lens; I’ve read complaints about how the film mishandles Chinese culture*. This feels particularly inexcusable in an era where we’re pushing to have stories about POC told *by* POC, and several successful films have already done so (Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians, The Farewell, and many others). I wonder how much more authentic and fresh and surprising the film could have been if there’d been more Asian creatives onboard behind the camera, who could have helped to avoid Western blind spots, challenge tired Western tropes, and push the story in bold directions. Looked some more into this, and wow. They really DIDN’T have a single Chinese or East Asian person in any significant leadership role behind the scenes. The interview (below) with the costume designer—”I went to all the European museums with a China department, and then went to China and soaked up Chinese culture for three weeks”—is just cringeworthy. How is this acceptable in this day and age? Can you imagine how much flak Black Panther would have gotten if it were made by an all-white team? How many justified complaints there would have been about ignoring all the Black creative talent that was right there waiting to be tapped? And, more to the point, how much shittier the film would have been as a result? And considering that Disney itself saw fit to have an Oceanic Story Trust to ensure authenticity in Moana, it’s really surprising that they made zero effort here. …Particularly when they’re trying to win over, y’know, AUDIENCES IN CHINA. They didn’t stop to consider that Chinese people might be offended (or at least unimpressed) by foreigners trying to sell them THEIR OWN STORY that’s been in their bones for thousands of years? Sheesh. “When I watch things like Niki Caro’s Mulan, I see in it the way white Americans see me: accented, mystical, bound, some would say hobbled, by notions of honour, drowned in centuries of arcane history and hipster appropriations of ancient concepts like “chi,” for instance, kung fu for another. I am seen, if I am seen, by white Americans as this collection of half-formed impressions and the vague notion of ineffable otherness. Mulan confirms that I am not like you and never will be, and the pain of it makes it difficult for me to watch.” As MA wrote, Disney is now saying the quiet parts out loud by being open about its mercenary motives here and in China, and the problem with these remakes is that the quiet parts and the loud parts have all been smoothed over into a moderate hum.  To appeal to as many people/countries as possible, Disney has become unable to say anything important or inspire any intense emotions, and when these characters can’t speak important truths or be authentically emotional, they start feeling like Asian puppets with all their strings being pulled by wealthy white people engaged in some light, trendy cultural tourism. This is really fascinating to me, because where I saw an Asian protagonist who didn’t seem other-ized — at least compared to other Hollywood depictions — an Asian-American did still see that.  Adding: Want to highly recommend this very thorough and nuanced piece by Jeannette Ng. Yes, representation and lack of “authenticity” is an issue here, but not the only one, nor (arguably) the most pressing. This is such a great essay, and it really speaks to why it is so important that we get a truly wide diversity of voices talking about film and pop culture (and everything!). Because no matter how woke a middle-aged white lady like me would like to think I am, it’s not truly possible for me to write from a perspective that isn’t my own, and not truly possible for me to  appreciate how, in this instance, an ethnically Asian Westerner will see a movie like Mulan. (Needs to be said, too: We need *multiple* Western Asian, and Asian Asian, perspectives on this film, and all films, because there is no monolithic block of thinking anywhere, in any culture or subculture). Yeah I had heard (wrongly) that this movie was going to be helmed by a Chinese director and that was pretty much the only thing that raised my expectations above ground level. Not that making a movie with that central theme is a bad, but it just seems like a really bizarre (and bad) choice to do it with this movie.  It’s a story that’s originally about a regular woman who just wants to keep her grandfather from being killed and manages to find the courage and gain the strength to succeed beyond anyone’s expectations even her own, and they turned it into yet another Chosen One narrative about someone born with super-powers. And I think it undermines any feminism if the message is “don’t underestimate women — if they clearly have super-powers and you couldn’t stop them if you tried.”"

"Sep 11, 2020",positive," Join our host EJ Moreno in a discussion about 2020’s Mulan, the Disney+ exclusive set for release this week. In what he says feels like an homage to Chinese epics, there’s something about this movie that feels like tired territory for the Disney brand. EJ talks about the film’s impressive line-up of actors, changes from the original, and if it’s worth the price tag attached. When the Emperor of China issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army to defend the country from Northern invaders, Hua Mulan, the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, steps in to take the place of her ailing father. Masquerading as a man, Hua Jun, she is tested every step of the way and must harness her inner-strength and embrace her true potential. It is an epic journey that will transform her into an honored warrior and earn her the respect of a grateful nation…and a proud father. “Mulan” features a celebrated international cast that includes: Yifei Liu as Mulan; Donnie Yen as Commander Tung; Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan; Yoson An as Cheng Honghui; with Gong Li as Xianniang and Jet Li as the Emperor. Niki Caro directs the film from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Elizabeth Martin & Lauren Hynek based on the narrative poem “The Ballad of Mulan.” EJ Moreno is a film and television critic and entertainment writer who joined the pop culture website Flickering Myth in 2018 and now serves as the executive producer of Flickering Myth TV, a YouTube channel with over 27,000 subscribers. With over a decade of experience, he is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic who is also part of the Critics Choice Association and GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics."
"Sep 11, 2020",positive," When Disney announced its live-action Mulan remake in 2015, some thought they’d set themselves an impossible task. To win over new audiences while keeping fans of the original happy is no mean feat, but to do it without any songs and no Mushu, Eddie Murphy’s fan favourite sidekick, would be even tougher. After COVID-19 put paid to its theatrical release, cinemagoers will finally get to watch the new movie on Disney+ this week. Can it deliver the goods? In case you aren’t familiar, Mulan is the story of its eponymous heroine (Liu Yifei), a young woman living in rural China with her parents and younger sister. When we first meet Mulan, she is a focused young girl whose energy flow – or chi – catches the eye of her concerned parents. “Chi is for warriors, not daughters,” she is told by her father Hua Zhou (The Farewell’s Tzi Ma), before local villagers brand her “shameful” for displaying athleticism and a fiery, independent spirit. According to them, Mulan is destined to dishonour her family – and the only way to redemption lies through marriage. In this society, there is no place for a woman outside of the household. The sad truth is that Mulan knows she can bring honour to them all, but is unable to do so in the way she feels natural: through combat. Eventually, she takes her handicapped father’s place in the Imperial Chinese Army to spare him the stress and danger of battle. Disguised as a man, she struggles with their unfamiliar world and the hardships of intense physical training while contending with her fellow recruits. By the time she is ready for war, a terrifying new threat has emerged in the form of vengeful Rouran warrior Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee). In the original 1998 animation, Li Shang, Mulan’s commander and love interest, was tasked with getting China’s defending force in shape. But here, to much scepticism from fans, Shang has been omitted. Luckily, splitting the role into two characters in the remake facilitates Mulan’s character development. Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) and friendly rival Chen (Yoson An) give her confidence and a level of respect she never receives from her family. Elsewhere, new character Xian Lang (Gong Li) plays an integral part in shaping Mulan’s actions. A witch with shapeshifting powers, she, like Mulan, is a woman that struggled to suppress her chi. However, she chooses to embrace it and subsequently becomes an outcast to society. Eventually, she is left with no other option than to ally with Bori Khan and use her powers for evil. While she presents herself as another female fighter, she shows Mulan what could happen if she goes down the wrong path. Although Xian provides the story with complexity, Bori Khan unfortunately comes across as under-developed and one-dimensional, which makes the film less gripping. For the most part though, Mulan is dominated by Liu, whose strong performance balances emotion with physical prowess. Visually, director Niki Caro incorporates elements of martial arts films – or wuxia – to highlight her protagonist’s athletic ability. Elsewhere, the story focuses on her character and spiritual development without being overly referential to the Disney film. Director Niki Caro’s modern update may take things in a different direction, but it makes Mulan a more empowering character. Thanks to her creative eye and Liu Yifei’s star turn, Mulan is the best live-action Disney adaptation to date."
"Sep 11, 2020",negative,Far from the most aesthetically bankrupt Disney movie of the last few years.
"Sep 11, 2020",positive," Niki Caro’s live-action remake of the 1998 Disney animated classic has arrived on Disney+ as a premium title available to view for an additional $39.99. Aaron Yap found enjoyment in watching Mulan, even if it could do with harnessing more of the daring exhibited by its titular, gender-switching heroine. Disney’s $300 million live-action adaptation of their 1998 animated hit Mulan has landed—in my bedroom, and that’s okay. Understandably, it’ll be difficult for some viewers to extricate the final product from the swirling cloud of politically-charged controversy and circumstance that’s plagued it for months. That’s okay too. If the reservation is around the decision to dump a blockbuster of this scale onto a streaming platform on Day One—well, from this viewer’s standpoint, it quickly dissipated. It’s possible that the finer details of Grant Major’s intricately layered production design cannot fully be appreciated on telly. But there’s also the realisation that we’re now all so accustomed to experiencing costly HBO spectacle like Games of Thrones at home—or on the bus—that it feels just… normal. The film itself is an eminently watchable, meticulously mounted period adventure that’s good enough for you to wish that it was a little better. It could do with harnessing more of the daring exhibited by its titular, gender-switching heroine. For better or worse, Mulan is a Disney movie, on-brand with broadly universal themes that’ll slot in comfortably with any of their classic fairy tales or Star Wars instalments despite its Chinese folklore origins. It’s exactly what you’d imagine a Mouse House wu xia pic might be: turning up to the party as handsomely crafted as money can buy, but lacking the innate poetic grace and artistry of a King Hu or Zhang Yimou epic. And like most of their recent live-action adaptations, the film flattens out the imaginative quirkiness of their animated counterparts in pursuit of grittier realism. You won’t find characters suddenly bursting into song, nor a cute cricket sidekick with a knack for inking Chinese calligraphy here. Occasionally when it does veer into cartoonish slapstick—such as the recreation of the original’s match-making scene—the effect can be slightly jarring, given the overridingly serious tone. Fortunately, it remains a visually arresting entertainment, with Mandy Walker’s cinematography soaking the costumes, sets and locations in an almost-psychedelic vibrancy that would pop off any screen regardless of size. The fight choreography is serviceable, not shredded to bits but also apparent there’s room for refinement and innovation. A pivotal set-piece like the climactic showdown between antagonist Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and Mulan on top of wooden scaffolding could have used a touch of Tsui Hark’s resourceful creativity to make it really hum. The cast is phenomenally stacked with veteran Chinese talent—including Shaw Brothers icon Chen Pei-pei in a small part, and a rather unrecognisable Jet Li—but only a few manage to leave an impression in such a crowded space (the film’s fleet pacing doesn’t afford sufficient screen time either). Tzi Ma is heart-breaking as Mulan’s disabled father, while Gong Li’s shape-shifting witch Xian Lang, a new character addition, provides a nuanced presence missing elsewhere in the film. Reminiscent of Zhang Ziyi, Liu Yifei’s steely, duty-bound magnetism carries her through the action capably—dodging and shooting arrows, back-flipping on horses, riding into battle—although one can’t help but wish for a more compelling personality. As it stands, her Mulan succeeds insofar as being an exquisitely constructed porcelain vessel for the story’s themes of courage, honor, loyalty and female empowerment."
"Sep 11, 2020",positive,"A movie of impressive scale and clear visual command, an effort that, for my money, far surpasses its animated predecessor."
"Sep 11, 2020",negative," Kiwi director Niki Caro’s live-action remake of Disney’s 1998 animated epic Mulan, itself drawn from a centuries-old Chinese legend, has spectacular moments but proves too long and a touch, it must be said, smug. The most expensive movie ever helmed by a woman, it’s one of those epics that couldn’t NOT be controversial for a bunch of reasons, not least of which is the annoyance that, after many cinematic delays due to COVID-19, it’s now finally available to stream on Disney+ instead (but only for subscribers willing to shell out an additional ‘$34.99 for ‘Premier Access’). Politically, too, there’s much here that’s problematic, including stars with pro-Hong Kong views, unease at Disney conspicuously getting its claws into China, and some heavy #MeToo rethinking – all of which makes this a tricky title to critique. Auckland mainly stands in for China as we meet the young Hua Mulan (here played by Crystal Rao) in a death-defying if awkward-looking opening scene that demonstrates that she’s never played by the rules and, therefore, has always been an outsider. Later, as an adult, she’s played by Yifei Liu (chosen from a casting call of 1000 hopefuls), and she’s still resisting tradition, something which concerns her loving Dad Zhou (the prolific Tzi Ma, recently seen in Tigertail) but upsets her mother Li (Rosalind Chao) greatly. Li states that “a daughter brings honor through marriage” and sends Mulan and her sister Xiu (Xana Tang as a character deliberately added to the story) off to the local matchmaker (Pei-Pei Cheng, another veteran) for a contrived comedy sequence that demonstrates that Mulan isn’t exactly the marrying type. When Rouran invaders headed by the villainous Bori Khan (an overacting Jason Scott Lee) attack and threaten the Emperor (action star Jet Li), the Imperial Army put out an order that one man from each family must fight. And, as Zhou is old and knackered and doesn’t have any sons, Mulan naturally ties her hair back, strikes out and joins up under the name Hua Jun. Looking decidedly unmanly (in the spirit of other gender-bendering pics like Yentl), she must endure all the tropes of having to wash when the men aren’t looking and struggling with the appropriate sexist banter, all the while knowing full well that stern Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) could execute her if he knew the truth. Jun/Mulan also goes up against shapeshifting witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), an ally of Khan’s who knows her secret and with whom she shares some common ground, as he uses her magic to his advantage but treats her disrespectfully. And, speaking of magic, there’s some semi-Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon wall-running and roof-leaping as well, much of which looks a tad clunky. Mandy Walker’s cinematography is strong enough to make you regret that this couldn’t viably be released in cinemas, and the name Chinese cast is pretty good too, and yet, somehow, it doesn’t quite work, in much the same way that Disney’s rehashing of its own The Lion King faltered."
"Sep 10, 2020",negative,"While glorious to look at, the movie still feels slightly hollow. All the right pieces are there, but an emotional connection to the characters is lacking."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive,"Director Niki Caro expertly balances the drama, humour, adventure and action, creating a thrilling big-screen epic with potent emotional resonance and lots of female power."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive," Mulan, a ravishing transformation of a well-regarded yet minor Disney title, is one of the very few live-action remakes from the studio which improves on the source material. It’s not a slavish reproduction like Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King, safe-bet pantomimes that dared not stray from their crown-jewel source material. Nor is it a bloated grotesquerie like Tim Burton’s Dumbo, which nearly doubled the running time of the original with mismanaged themes showcased in an unnecessary and ill-conceived second act. Unlike those other corporate iterations, this Sinophilic delight actually feels like a fresh start. The new and improved Mulan still tells the Han Dynasty story of a young woman who runs away from home to take her father’s place in a conscripted Imperial army and fight off a horde of marauders. But it jettisons many of the cartoonish conceits like animal sidekicks and ancestral ghosts, and upgrades the fighting styles from lumbering WWE smackdown to whirling-dervish Wuxia elegance. The whole film has a muscular visual flair, with sweeping camera movements and cast-of-thousands set pieces that make this Chinese legend feel truly epic. The script nicely balances the woman-warrior imperative with organic questions of honor, respect, and candor. Two new set pieces, one on a sulfuric frozen lake and another on scaffolding over smelting basins, add dazzling displays of derring-do. Best of all, there’s an entrancing new tragic villain in the form of hawkish Xian Lang (Gong Li), a shape-shifting witch who sports avian talon-fingers and a mournful longing to find her place in the world. “Your deceit is my shame,” says Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) to a gender-revealed Mulan, but he could be talking about the original 1998 film. That animated hit, well-received by critics and audiences alike, had the Mouse House’s impeccable art direction and visual panache along with decent action, comic relief, a bit of romance and a few catchy musical numbers. But the whole exercise felt like Middle Kingdom mimicry. It was deeply Western in its execution, right down to the Broadway showtunes. Not helping were the culturally tone-deaf voiceover talent: most of the principal actors, aside from Ming-Na Wen’s Mulan, weren’t even Chinese. Puerto Rican American Miguel Ferrer? Japanese Americans Pat Morita and George Takei? Plus Jewish cross-dresser Harvey Fierstein as one of the soldiers who eventually cross-dresses near the end, as well as Eddie fucking Murphy as a diminutive jive-talking dragon called Mushu? Seriously? Not to mention a superfluous cricket with the name Cri-Kee. Jeezus. This time around, Disney wised up and enlisted a slew of Chinese thespians, some of whom are longtime international stars. Jet Li! Donnie Yen! Gong Li! Bob Iger’s no fool: he and his bean-counters know that the real money isn’t in New York and L.A. but overseas in Beijing and Shanghai. Mulan represents their most brazen attempt yet to serve that billion-person market, and the casting proves it. Liu Yifei is great as the titular heroine, but my mind kept wandering back to spunky, spiky Zhang Ziyi in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And if there’s any fault in Mulan, it’s that Ang Lee’s seismic action-romance looms large over it. So, too, do a myriad of jaw-dropping spectacles from protean auteur Zhang Yimou, whose ass-kicking epics like Hero and House of Flying Daggers are stone-cold dazzlers. Chinese moviegoers may enjoy Mulan, but it isn’t anything they haven’t seen already. And that’s the film’s real fault: it’s a handsome, sumptuous, intelligent, dignified production that doesn’t really feel inventive, let alone revelatory. Then again, maybe it will awaken some wide-eyed Disney+ viewers to a whole new world of international movies.

"Sep 10, 2020",positive,"This Mulan may have been made for the big screen, but it is impressive anywhere."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive," But it wouldn’t be anything without a leading lady who is both a crouching tiger and a hidden dragon when it comes to martial artistry and saber swinging as she subtlety emotes her pent-up feelings beyond her cross-dressing masquerade. With Liu Yifei, a star is truly born.  She is gifted enough to hold her own during the few humorous interludes (such as her avoidance of showering with the fellows, who take note her odiferous state), as well physically adept enough to make us believe she can fly through the air with the greatest of ease on horseback, high in the sky or in the midst of battle on rooftops. Yes, we see the PG-13 deadly consequence of war with piles of bodies and arrows piercing flesh. But the tone of sacrifice and honor requires it. If there is a downside, the baddies in charge of the villainous invaders of the Imperial City don’t quite make the cut. Jason Scott Lee is a scar-faced sneering baddie bent on avenging his father’s death. We have seen this before. Meanwhile, his female meanie counterpart is Xian Lang (Gong Li), a shape-shifting witchy woman who believes she never given her equal due in causing chaos and mayhem. The best scenes, as they should be, are between Mulan and her fellow war hero father, played by Tzi Ma of The Farewell. Their relationship provides the beating heart of this gritty fairy tale, one that any child.

"Sep 10, 2020",negative," Sometimes movies, like people, have baggage. These unavoidable aspects don’t necessarily unfold on-screen, but they color the viewer’s perception regardless: production issues, expectations, historical context. Disney’s remake of Mulan, unfortunately, has more than most.  As the latest live-action remake of a beloved animated film, it has to live up to what fans love about the 1998 original while also battling the less-than-remarkable reception preceding remakes have garnered. That alone would be plenty. But Mulan is also a milestone for Asian representation in American blockbuster cinema: a big-budget film without a single white actor (although plenty of white creatives are behind the camera) and a cast stacked with Asian American and East Asian talent. Then came a pandemic, and now, Mulan is the guinea pig for a new kind of release: a $30 “Premiere Access” stream in addition to a Disney Plus subscription, a one-time fee for the chance to catch a would-be theatrical release three months before it would stream as a regular Disney Plus offering in December. That Mulan is the trial balloon for this release as opposed to, say, Black Widow — to name another derailed Disney release — is suspect and another weight on the back of an already overburdened film. Mulan feels extraordinarily compromised, something only bolstered by calls for a boycott over star Liu Yifei’s support of the Hong Kong police department’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The movie itself feels like an anticlimax: Mulan is merely a serviceable film that’s rather easy to forget. It does not live up to the expectations placed on it, nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics. It’s a movie mostly noticeable for what isn’t there. If you can shut that out, what’s on-screen is often gorgeous to look at.  Unlike a lot of Disney’s live-action remakes, Mulan is not a shot-for-shot remake. It takes liberties, but they’re all relatively small, and the plot of the 2020 film is nearly identical to that of the 1998 original. Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) is the daughter of a noble warrior and disinterested in the business of being a proper lady whose only ambition is marrying well. Instead, she aspires to be a fighter, like her father Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma) — and when the Emperor decrees that every family send a man to serve in the fight against northern invaders, she decides to disguise herself as a man, Hua Jun, to serve in place of her ailing father.  With a plot so similar to the original, the new Mulan struggles to define itself beyond what it removes from the Mulan of the ‘90s. Some absences are not missed — like Eddie Murphy’s talking dragon Mushu — but others, like the musical numbers, leave an emotional void that the film doesn’t really try to fill. It makes Mulan a strangely passive character, which is reinforced by the movie’s biggest change: portraying Mulan as uniquely connected to her Chi.  According to the film, Mulan’s uncanny ability to tap into her Chi is what makes her a superhuman spear-kicking warrior essentially from birth, a genetic compulsion to hop on rooftops and play with swords from childhood. It is, frankly, a ridiculous addition. There is little Mulan does that feels like she decides for herself.  Despite feeling fundamentally hollow, Mulan is a pleasure to watch on a screen. It’s the kind of beautiful that makes you mourn for the loss of theaters in 2020. Fights are wonderfully composed and consistently staged in interesting places. Despite battles that mostly unfold in mountainous deserts, Mulan finds ways to spill color across the screen. In another diversion from the original, the film introduces magic, mostly in the form of the sorceress Xian Lang (Gong Li), a shapeshifter in the service of the Rouran invader Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) whose power adds even more visual flair to a movie brimming with it.  Mulan is popcorn cinema without the popcorn. Choosing severity over fun, it prefers its characters to appear strong instead of real. While it does a lot of work to look like it comes from a place, it does little to feel like it does: there are few jokes, few memorable exchanges, and surprisingly little camaraderie for a movie featuring a bunch of soldiers. The result is something that plays like a very good band performing a forgettable cover, one that’s more about imitating a sound than giving it theirs. For a movie about a woman learning to own her identity, Mulan cannot seem to form one of its own. "

Last week, I reviewed the original animated classic and, while it has some issues, I enjoyed it.  Despite not liking a lot of the live-action remakes, ‘Mulan’ was one that I was excited for, especially since Disney were aiming to tell the original story, instead of doing a direct remake of the 1998 classic. And, after seeing ‘Mulan’, I can express my opinions.  ‘Mulan’, once again, tells the story of the titular character who takes her father’s place in the Imperial Army, disguising herself as a male soldier and ultimately becoming a heroine. The live-action remake of ‘Mulan’ was, ultimately, fine. The film could be split into two parts, in terms of quality: the first 30 minutes, and the last 90 minutes. The first 30 minutes of the film explores Mulan’s childhood up until she runs away from home to join the army. This first act was filled with blatant exposition dialogue, wooden acting and uneven pacing. However, once Mulan joins the Imperial Army, the film feels like it was directed by a different person, as the pacing, acting and action is tighter and more evenly paced. The last 90 minutes were definitely more exciting and enjoyable.  The main cast all do a good job as the characters that they play. Yifei Liu, who plays the titular character, fits comfortably into the role and carries the film well. Her interaction with the rest of the main cast also works as she grows into a confident woman. The general look of the film, i.e.: locations and costumes, are gorgeous and are my favourite aspect of the film. It’s mostly a colourful and vibrant film, until the Army goes to war, where bright colours are swapped with the murky greys and browns, symbolising the grisly nature of war.  There are a few references to the original animated film. For example, some lyrics from ‘A Girl Worth Fighting For’ is used as dialogue from one soldier, as he explains his perfect woman (‘I don’t care what she looks like/I just care what she cooks like’), and the score uses the song ‘Reflection’ when Mulan succeeds in training. None of these references felt forced and it was a joy to hear them being used naturally in the film.  However, this film does have its problems too. When Disney first announced this remake, they said that Mushu the Dragon would not appear in the film, a decision that I agreed with. However, it’s been replaced by a Phoenix who supposedly watches over, and protects, Mulan. I say supposedly because it only appears once in the film, making it a pointless character. I understand the symbolism of the character being a protective guardian but, if that’s the case, then its appearances should be more regular. The main enemy has also been replaced. Instead of the war being against The Huns, it’s against the Rorian Army and a Witch. This was a huge disappointment to see as, like previously mentioned, Disney were supposedly aiming to tell the original story of Mulan. However, this is not necessarily the case and that is a shame to see. Another issue was the cinematography. For the most part, it’s fantastic and cinematic, making each scene stand out. However, the film does have a lot of slow-motion shots, which don’t work and make the pacing uneven. They will also appear at random moments usually without reason. If these were taken out, they would make no difference to the film whatsoever. As well as this, some shots during the opening battle scenes are strange. The camera will, at times, follow the perspective of the one being attacked, meaning the shot will flip round, appear upside down or sideways. It’s an interesting technique, but it isn’t consistent, making those scenes a horrible experience. If you want to see a film that does this camera technique perfectly, I recommend seeing 2018’s ‘Upgrade’. Overall, ‘Mulan’ is fine. The last 90 minutes is better than the first 30 minutes, however it could’ve done with another edit and script rewrite. If you’ve never seen the original animated film, you’d probably enjoy this more than someone who has seen the original. While it’s not a bad film, Disney should’ve stuck to their word and done a telling of the original story, which this was not.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Sep 9, 2020",negative," Mulan juega un papel especial en la serie de remakes fuera de la animación de Disney que se han llevado a pantalla grande en los últimos años. Especialmente después de que El Rey León, a pesar de sus posibilidades técnicas casi ilimitadas, se dedicara a copiar plano por plano a su original; algo diferente vemos en Mulan. La directora Niki Caro deliberadamente y de manera rápida, presenta los motivos de la película animada de 1998 del mismo nombre, basada a su vez en la balada china Hua Mulan. Al mismo tiempo, desarrolla un lenguaje propio para la historia de Mulán, que se caracteriza sobre todo por ser una gran epopeya. Uno de los cambios más sorprendentes en comparación con el clásico de Disney, es la forma en que se tratan las canciones conocidas, que ya no son cantadas por los actores, sino que se fusionan con la música de las películas de Harry Gregson-Williams. Además, la nueva edición prescinde por completo del dragón Mushu, que en el original es el compañero de la protagonista. Una de las razones de esto fue la mala reputación del personaje entre el público chino, como reveló el productor Jason Reed antes del estreno en el cine, el lugar de Mushu lo ocupa ahora un impresionantemente animado Fénix, que acompaña a Mulán (Liu Yifei) en su viaje. Algunas de estas adaptaciones son, por eso mismo, decisiones estratégicas destinada a optimizar Mulan para el mercado cinematográfico mundial, con especial atención a China. Aquí es donde los elaborados éxitos de taquilla de Hollywood pueden lograr una parte no subestimada de sus resultados de taquilla. En lo que respecta al subtexto político, Mulan se encuentra, por lo tanto, en un camino de mala suerte. Sin embargo, muchos cambios también benefician a la historia y a sus personajes, especialmente en lo que respecta a Mulán. Niko Caro acompaña a su protagonista en un viaje heroico clásico, pero le permite tener mucho más control sobre su propio destino que en el caso de la película de animación; ahora, por ejemplo, es la propia decisión de Mulán confesar su verdadera identidad, después de que ella se había colado previamente en el ejército como hombre para salvar a su debilitado padre de una muerte segura. El guion, escrito por cuatro personas, es un ejemplo de cómo no siempre es la mejor idea poner todo un consorcio en el contenido. Mulan también intenta ser bastante a la vez, tiene las típicas escenas humorísticas que son obvias en este tipo de producciones. Hay escenas de acción en las que la heroína del título puede mostrar que no sólo ayuda a su hombre, sino a todos los hombres juntos, en el medio hay un poco del componente histórico. En otros puntos la película se enamora de aspectos fantasiosos y viejas leyendas, que se desenvuelven para darle un poco de sabor a la historia. Incluso hay espacio para líneas argumentales feministas, cuando la aventura del lejano oriente no sólo cuenta la lucha de Mulán, sino también la de Xian Lang, para quien en un mundo dominado por los hombres sólo habría el papel de la bruja sumisa. Por supuesto, una dura crítica de tal injusticia siempre es bienvenida, pero la implementación en Mulan deja mucho que desear y en el mejor de los casos puede ser calificada de inconsistente, especialmente en lo que respecta al final, que es decepcionante, casi cursi y que ignora por completo muchos de los aspectos anteriormente mencionados del mundo del guerrero chino. De todos modos la lógica está, a lo sumo, en segundo lugar en esta película, que es constantemente eclipsada por el espectáculo al servicio a los fans y las agradables apariciones de estrellas famosas, cuyos papeles son casi siempre superfluos. La chica Mulán no gana al final, porque cree en sí misma, se supera a sí misma, se mantiene firme o como quieras llamarlo. No, finalmente sale victoriosa del conflicto, porque sus adversarios toman decisiones estúpidas, que a menudo están en conflicto con su personalidad como se describe anteriormente, y las leyes de la física no parecen aplicarse a la joven guerrera. Junto con algunos momentos ociosos entre las escenas clave, la versión 2020 de este clásico de Disney puede por lo tanto describirse como cine de palomitas de maíz en el mejor de los casos, sin más. Niki Caro gasta el considerable presupuesto en cada toma sin crear uno de estos exuberantes e intercambiables espectáculos de éxito de taquilla. En cambio, ella trabaja concentrada con enfoque narrativo y por lo tanto hace que las relaciones y perspectivas sean claras, aunque el guion es bastante simple y deja pocas dudas sobre lo obvio. Sin embargo, esto no hace nada para romper el efecto de atracción de la película. Mulan se sumerge en la sublimidad del paisaje, sin importar cuán obligatorias sean las estaciones del viaje de Mulán.

"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Disney has an identity problem when it comes to their live-action slate. Efforts like The Lion King and Aladdin are too tethered to their source material to craft their own voices. Others such as Dumbo fall apart in the absence of any clear sense of purpose. Mulan removes the talking animals and musical numbers from the equation, plotting its own course through the ancient Chinese folklore. Armed with a $200 million budget, a record-setting sum for a female director, Niki Caro crafts a visually breathtaking experience. The New Zealand landscape is beautiful, if not a bit distracting for a film set in China. CGI can bring practically any concept to life, but other Disney efforts have suffered from an over-reliance on green screens. Mulan is competently acted, though it’s hard to say that any particular talent steals the show. Yifei Liu brings grace and a sense of determination to the title role, but she’s a bit too reserved. The absence of a confidant figure such as Mushu who is in on the ruse puts some strain on Liu’s ability to express the struggle at the core of the narrative. Unlike it’s animated predecessor, Mulan puts its supernatural elements at the heart of the conflict. Mulan is basically turned into a superhero, exhibiting “chosen one”-type powers that diminish the feminist message that the film is trying to convey. Here, women can do anything, if one has special powers to dodge arrows and transform into animals. The screenplay is pretty lackluster. While following the same basic trajectory of the source material, swapping out the Huns for Rouran warriors, the film never quite finds its heart. Mulan never really clicks with her fellow warriors, a fairly forgettable bunch who never receive much attention. Caro largely keeps romance out of the equation, a refreshing dynamic for a Disney film. Mulan’s journey is one of the self, determined by her own actions rather than gauged in relation to the feelings of a man. It might have been interesting to see how the film addressed plotlines from the original in a world with larger LGBTQ equality, but Disney has demonstrated no grace in this area anyway. Mulan is a flawed movie. The action sequences help buoy the film through its less compelling sequences. The brief attempts at humor do little than serve as reminders of how much heart Eddie Murphy brought to the original. With that in mind, it’s easier to forgive the lack of comedy. It seems absurd to think that a live-action effort could have ever surpassed its predecessor in this regard. With Mulan, Disney shoots for more than a shot-for-shot remake of the past. The result is a little clunky at times, but compelling enough to justify its existence. Skeptics of Disney’s live-action genre may not be completely convinced, but Caro brings something fresh to the conversation. It is an entertaining film. That might not feel like high praise, but it’s a step in the right direction. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary!

"Sep 8, 2020",positive,So instead of doing a play by play remake of the animated film they tossed out the songs and the Eddie Murphy type comedy. Good for them for sticking with an epic adventure movie that promotes girl power.
"Sep 8, 2020",negative," We’ll admit it. When we first heard that Mulan would be the next Disney animated film getting the live-action remake treatment, we were skeptical. No Li Shang? No Mushu? No singing? It seemed like the film was glutton for punishment — but then the first trailer dropped, and our faith was slowly restored. Maybe, we thought to ourselves, taking Mulan in a new, more “serious” direction would lead to more creative freedom, and the end result could be a beautiful Disney take on a classic war story steeped in legend. Sadly though, the film we got was decidedly not what we’d hoped for. It was devoid of all charm from the original, but also over-reliant on the audience’s familiarity with the story to get us to keep watching. With new concepts like “chi” and a shapeshifting witch padding the runtime an extra half hour, Mulan is a sluggish, messy film that somehow manages to be less feminist than the original. Starring Yifei Liu as the titular Fa Mulan, Mulan follows a spirited young woman, gifted with immense power called “chi,” who is living in Imperial China and disguises herself as a man to join the army and save her injured father from having to sacrifice his life. In addition to struggling to conceal her identity from her superiors (Donnie Yen, Ron Yuan) and her cohorts (Yoson An, Doua Moua, Jun Yu) Mulan also finds herself grappling with invading warlord Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and the shapeshifting witch who fights alongside him, Xianniang (Gong Li). If the latter half of that sounds unfamiliar to you, it’s because this reimagining of Mulan adds quite a bit of new material and changes even more — but with very little success. The biggest cosmetic change is obviously the lack of singing, which we don’t terribly miss because it admittedly would’ve felt a little odd, given the more historical/war-centric tone the film seems to be aiming for. On a similar note, although the film is a little stale without Mushu as a source of comedic relief, that’s also one aspect of the original that makes sense to cut if the filmmakers were looking to take Mulan in a new direction. Beyond those two things, however, virtually every other change from the original is for the worse. We don’t quite understand why Shan Yu (whose terrifying voice was provided by the late Miguel Ferrer) had to be changed to Bori Khan, a character who, for all intents and purposes, is the exact same as Shan Yu, just less intimidating. Jason Scott Lee is unremarkable in the role, which seems to be by design, because the film is very transparently pushing Xianniang as the film’s true antagonist. On paper, her story really works. She’s a direct foil for Mulan, a sort of reflection for the path she could have taken, had she not stayed loyal, brave, and true. However, the film is so intent on making them two sides of the same coin that it feels forced and artificial as opposed to natural, especially because Xianniang and Mulan don’t meet until halfway through the film, and have no connection that would link them — symbolically or otherwise. It’s a shame, because Gong Li gives the film’s best performance as the shapeshifting witch, and she’s a genuinely sympathetic figure, as well as a very visually striking one. However, every time she clashes with Bori Khan, we can’t help but wonder why she doesn’t just deal with him then and there. She’s an incredibly powerful witch, and he’s just a regular man (albeit an intimidating one). It makes no sense that she continues to just sit by and take his insults and do his dirty work when at any time she could kill him and be on her way. Her obvious power but unwillingness to take control of her situation not only makes her difficult to root for, but also makes the film as a whole frustrating to watch. And so her sacrifice to save Mulan at the end of the film feels meaningless because she spends the entirety of the film doing nothing but taking insults and abuse from Bori Khan. Despite the frustrations we had with Xianniang, she was just one of many changes/new additions to the film that drove us up the wall. Far and away the worst addition was the introduction of “chi,” a magical sort of life force that Mulan apparently has the ability to harness. The movie spends its first ten minutes introducing this concept, but we can’t for the life of us figure out why this had to be added to the film. The presence of chi utterly decimates what makes Mulan great: It takes her from a simple woman willing to do an extraordinary deed to protect someone she loves, to a Luke Skywalker-style hero who already has amazing powers and doesn’t need to struggle or work to develop her gifts; she already has them. The addition of “chi” isn’t the only way Mulan decimates what was once a strong character. On the whole, Mulan has little to no personality, and instead of making active decisions for herself, she spends the runtime being told what to do, pushed around, and saved by men. Instead of forging her own path and acting in defiance, Mulan only gets to win when men in the narrative allow her to. The film has a half dozen unremarkable male characters, all of whom blend together due to their lack of a discernable personality. Where Mulan was once known for its quippy, fast-paced dialogue, this Mulan feels sluggish and uninspired. The worst part is that, even though there’s an ensemble filled to the brim with male characters, the film cut out the most memorable man from the original: Li Shang. Instead, the role is split in two — Donnie Yen as the commanding officer, and Yoson An as the friend/potential (but unfulfilled) love interest — and neither really make a lasting impression on us. Despite all of the attempts to differentiate it from the original, though, Mulan is still reliant on the audience’s knowledge of (and affection for) the original to make the story work. The story barely scrapes along and never really raises stakes or emphasizes key moments, seemingly because it assumes the audience already knows what’s going to happen. Whether on purpose or not, it falls back on the original to move the story along, which is especially frustrating because of how much that contradicts with the filmmaker’s narrative of making this version of Mulan a new, refreshing take on the original. Mulan wants to have it both ways, but it’s painfully obvious that if the original didn’t exist, this film just wouldn’t work. Despite it’s beautiful, colorful costumes and sweeping cinematography, Mulan is also lackluster in terms of filmmaking. The fight scenes have a hokiness to them that takes us immediately out of the seriousness of this remake and has us scratching our heads as to whether or not the filmmakers intended for us to take it seriously. The sudden zooms, frequent cutting, and erratic camera movement all give the fight choreography a cartoonish (for lack of a better word) feel to them, and we don’t mean that in a good way. Although it does boast some decadent visuals and a standout performance from Gong Li, Mulan‘s unnecessary changes and additions both pad the runtime and weaken its protagonist, resulting in an overworked and underbaked slog of a film that does the original a true injustice.

"Sep 8, 2020",positive," “Loyal, Brave, True” (忠勇真) are the three words engraved on the Hua family sword, comprising Mulan’s central motif that in turn reflects this live action remake’s reexamination of what constitutes Chinese feminism. Mulan turns out to be a pleasant surprise—that Disney’s creative capacity for thematic and visual reimagination is being consistently expanded by its feminist projects (as in Beauty and the Beast), and also that the film is a potent antithesis to its predecessors that are unimaginative CGI clones of their originals (such as The Lion King). Though it is a pity that Chinese female talents are absent in the writers’ room of Mulan, director Niki Caro and the film’s writing team have demonstrated their decent understanding of Chinese feminism’s essence: our women’s loyalty, bravery and truth rising above patriarchal confinements like a phoenix—the divine symbolisation of Chinese femininity. This understanding rings true to the original ballad of Mulan, which dates back to the 6th century and has been carried on by generations ever since. However, in its second half, Mulan’s impressive capture of such essence is eclipsed by repetitive bombardment of actions that will appear unoriginal—especially for Chinese audiences, who are way too familiar with such standardised choreography of martial arts. Despite Mandy Walker’s kinetically grandiose cinematography, the film—for the mere sake of spectacle—also mismatches several Chinese landscapes and architectures with geographical and historical inaccuracies. Every Chinese girl will still end up having a soft spot for Mulan thanks to its brilliant final touch: the emperor gifting Mulan a new sword, on which “Devotion to Family” (孝) is added alongside “Loyal, Brave, True”. Mulan’s solemn eyes reflected on this sword mirror the core of the film’s Chinese feminism: her unwavering strength in protecting her loved ones that raise her up to become who she is: an honourable warrior. SYNOPSIS: Set in ancient China, a fearless young woman, out of love for her family and country, joins the imperial army by disguising as a man. She embarks on an epic journey battling the invaders and brings great honour upon her family and herself as a true warrior."
"Sep 8, 2020",neutral," After numerous delays due to the Covid pandemic, Disney’s live action Mulan (2020) has finally rolled out through their streaming platform, Disney+. The troubled release schedule along with the company’s pricing decision (currently, you can only watch it by dropping $30 on top of a monthly subscription rate) created a significant buzz. Now that it is out, we come to realize that all the talk was for naught. This is a bland retelling of the Chinese folktale, wavering between wanting to set its own identity and capturing the nostalgia for the 1998 animated version. Say what you will about Disney animated features – the watering down of real-world problems, the emphasis on idealized fantasy, etc. – what they do so well is take straight forward concepts and present them so that it adheres to both young and adult sentimentalities. This is especially true for the “Disney Renaissance” period of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, where they basically perfected the formula. The music, colorful characters, and high-end animation made the stories easy to digest and themes simple to understand. There was a lot of charm that went into them, and that includes the 1998 Mulan. The story: Hua Mulan (Yifei Lui) is a precocious young woman living in ancient China. Her free spirit puts her in conflict with the strictly held traditions of her society, especially when it comes to gender roles. An early scene with the Matchmaker (Pei-Pei Cheng) is meant to assign Mulan with a prosperous husband, but that interaction goes sour immediately. Mulan’s independent persona calls her to act when the invading Rourans – led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) – attack the country determined to overthrow the Emperor (Jet Li). One man from every family is ordered to fight for the army. The only man in Mulan’s family is her father Zhou (Tzi Ma), an aging warrior who can barely manage to hold his sword upright. To save her father, Mulan steals his sword and armor and takes his place, impersonating a man under the name Hua Jun. The setup has a problem that was barely covered in the animated version but is amplified here. Both emphasize a progressive, feminist view of the central character. However, where the animated version focused on a female choosing her own path despite the rules of law, the live action version jumbles that theme by juxtaposing it with ideas of honor and loyalty. This Mulan is meant to push against conventional traditions, but she fights for an Emperor and for a country that maintain those rules. She breaks the law by being a woman and enlisting in the army, and yet she sides with the very establishment that oppresses her for being a woman. Sure, her being there likely saves her father’s life, but not once does she question the edict that prevents her from being her true self. Seen in a different light, the clunkiness of the writing (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, Lauren Hynek) and direction (Niki Caro) make it so that the villain has more of a sympathetic journey than anyone else. Bori Khan is supposed to be the evildoer, but we learn that his mission is based out of revenge. The Emperor stole his people’s land and killed his loved ones. Bori Khan turns to a powerful, shapeshifting witch (a shamefully underused Li Gong) to help clear his path to the Imperial City. There is enough backstory to Bori Khan for us to at least understand his perspective. We learn nothing of the Emperor other than he lives in a lavish palace and wears decorative clothes made of gold. Jet Li’s performance is directed to be stoic, almost passive – there is no personality to the Emperor that allow us to connect with him. In terms of action, the choreography and special effects heavily borrow from Chinese martial arts/Wuxia films. But the cinematography and editing construct the action scenes like a modern American blockbuster, needlessly shooting people from waist up from multiple different angles and cutting between every punch and kick. The action is indecipherable, it has energy but lacks visual coherency. Action and fight scenes are often handled in the same way as a dance number, so why on Earth is it only partially shown? One of the most impressive things to watch is people performing difficult feats and making it look effortless. When the filmmaking gets in the way, it pulls the rug out of all the hard work that goes into the set pieces. As an action/martial arts film with a female protagonist, Mulan pales in comparison to the hundreds (maybe even thousands) of Chinese produced counterparts. As a Disney movie, it severely lacks the charisma and magic associated with the company. It is pretty to look at, but that’s all it has to offer. Once we dig beneath the façade do we realize how shallow it actually is."
"Sep 8, 2020",negative," Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the fact that the film was so clearly designed for the big screen, drenched in spectacle and just begging to be experienced in a crowd. Unlike the majority of Disney’s lackluster remakes, Mulan is prepared to step away from simply copying the 1998 original and actually try something new. In fact, this version is essentially a wuxia film (it’ll remind viewers more of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than of the Disney classic); more of a modern interpretation of the Chinese legend than ‘just another remake’, and the spectacle of that vision feels completely wasted on a television screen.  Gone are all the elements that we know and love; there are no songs, love stories or talking animals, all of which are pushed aside as the story instead leans into themes of family, honor and trust. It’s almost admirable that the film strays so far from the original text on which it’s based in favor of new ideas, and it certainly shouldn’t rub people up the wrong way quite like previous remakes have done, as it doesn’t fall into the same traps. In fact, Mulan has all the elements to become something brilliant… so why doesn’t it? The answer to that is simple: it’s Disney. The studio’s model thrives on creating movies for mass appeal; ones that can rarely be called ‘bad’, since there almost always competently made and well-acted, but that are hardly ever bold enough to become something great. With very few exceptions, they’re usually what one might call ‘pretty good’ or even ‘just fine’, and that’s because that’s precisely what they’re designed to be; movies that neither offend nor blow anyone away. The reason Mulan never becomes more than ‘fine’ is because it’s unwilling to fully embrace the ideas at the heart of it. A fully Chinese wuxia movie that focused more on the mental strain of Mulan’s actions and on her interactions with those around her would’ve been far more interesting than what we got: essentially, a Marvel movie. It follows the same basic structure and is every bit as formulaic as any MCU release. In fact, Hua Mulan herself is now a superhero. This new interpretation of the character has the power of chi, and once again, that could’ve been interesting had it been handled creatively, but Mulan is introduced as the perfect fighter from the very beginning. She attempts to conceal her skills from fellow soldiers, but never from the audience, so it’s pretty difficult for the combat sequences (however pretty they might be) to have any real tension.  In the end, while Mulan isn’t as problematic as many other Disney remakes, the principle remains the same: thinking these films will be equal in quality is ignorant of what made the classics so special in the first place… the animation itself. Much like most others, Mulan worked better as an animated film because it was purposefully created that way; it’s how the story was supposed to be told, and although this remake has a more respectful approach than most, it’s still devoid of any of the charm that made the original so beloved. It’s visually stunning, the action sequences are terrific and Liu Yifei is fantastic in the lead role, but it lacks the magic, heart, character or life of its animated counterpart. In short, it’s ‘just fine’, and you’ll likely feel just as you did after Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King: wishing you were watching the original.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.
