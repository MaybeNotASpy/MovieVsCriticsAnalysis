Mar 28 2024,positive,works on its own and as a chapter in a larger movie universe that pays off quite well
Mar 28 2024,positive, the monsterverse has turned into one of the more consistently enjoyable franchises in all of movies as godzilla king kong and all of the fellow monsters rampage against each other for global supremacy  well yknow there are also lots of human subplots but were never really there for the people on the ground no were there to see a clash of the titans for the ages and the four films weve gotten so far have all been decently fun at worst and stunning spectacles at best  ahead of this weeks latest installment godzilla x kong the new empire lets rank the movies in the monsterverse and see how these movies stack up against each other in the grand scheme of the kaiju universe  a riff on 1970s vietnam films kong skull island gave the monsterverses proper introduction to king kong and sent its human subjects on a terror ride through the jungles of a mysterious island with lots of monsters to battle the monster action was actually pretty thrilling but the film doesnt do some of its main characters a lot of favors with the script however john c reilly nearly steals the whole movie as a stranded world war ii soldier who helps the main cast navigate the terrain  godzilla and kong finally got a chance to battle each other in 2021s godzilla vs kong a psychedelic brouhaha for the ages across cosmic landscapes and unsuspecting cities sure the human elements can detract from the mayhem but the kaiju battles are so inspired and genuinely eyepopping that its hard to complain this one might be the most pure fun of all four  while the film just could not live up to that absolutely sensational first trailer its still a very compelling monster film with some of the better human characters in the series godzilla taking on so many notable villains from the toho history of the character was so cool in a modern landscape and finally getting mothra in the series to help the big lizard out was an added treat the scope and melodramatics of this one meshed really well with the unfiltered desire to let these beasts go at it  gareth edwards is one of the best filmmakers of his generation to understand scale and his godzilla film is one of the better monster films of the last decade it feels like something bigger than you one that pits pitiful humans against dueling forces of nature beyond comprehension bryan cranston delivers the best human performance in any of these films by a mile and edwards big battle scenes feel ripped out of an apocalyptic nightmare its a stunner in every sense of the word 
Mar 23 2024,neutral, its too bad that godzilla king of the monsters features far sludgier cgi than the two previous monsterverse installments2014s godzilla and kong skull islandbecause the muddy imagery fails to capture the grandeur of the movies ambitious lineup of classic creatures mothra rodan and king ghidorah bathed in murky blues and bleary rain none of them register with the awesomeness they deserve to say nothing of the title hero this time defending his turf against the new titans the human storyinvolving a tug of war between two divorced scientists vera farmiga and kyle chandler over their teen daughter millie bobby brownis uninvolving to say the least though i did appreciate how the various expeditions theyre on treat godzilla and company like specimens analyzing acoustics measuring vitals tracking locations there are moments when godzilla king of the monsters resembles a fantasy version of a national geographic documentaryexcept those tend to deliver far more stunning visuals without any special effects whatsoever
Jul 24 2023,neutral, synopsis the new story follows the heroic efforts of the cryptozoological agency monarch as its members face off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah when these ancient superspecies  thought to be mere myths  rise again they all vie for supremacy leaving humanitys very existence hanging in the balance king of the monsters is the sequel to 2014s godzilla and the third movie in legendarys monsterverse which also includes kong skull island in 2021 godzilla vs kong is scheduled to be released as some of you might know godzilla king of the monsters is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019 not because i expected it to be a beautifully written heartfelt story with fullydeveloped characters who i would immensely care about i was incredibly excited because its freaking godzilla and from the few images that i had seen it looked absolutely stunning i didnt need an oscarworthy screenplay or amazing performances i just wanted a decent and logical this last word is important narrative with reasonable characters and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other so my expectations were neither complex nor as high as some other people might have unfortunately i left the theater extremely disappointed i cant deny the impeccable vfx and the infinite amount of wallpaperworthy images spread across the entire film some scenes are filled with jawdropping cinematography astonishingly gorgeous monsters and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat however when the two pillars of any movie story and characters are so far away from even remotely working there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster i wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding game of thrones and i will stand by it im always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills but if i have to choose between a technically seamless movie and a film with a fantastic story and fullydeveloped characters i have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice ultimately thats the huge problem here the screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes ive seen in the last few years characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly generally a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist a comicrelief guy a duo of bantering personalities or a military general who always wants to attack something even though everyone knows its not the most intelligent decision king of the monsters has all of these types and more more seriously michael dougherty and zach shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary useless stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights turning them into minutes of complete boredom i yawned during a godzilla blockbuster yawned how sad is that i really enjoyed gareth edwards 2014s godzilla at the time the most common complaint was that there wasnt enough godzilla in it most of the characters were wellwritten despite that some could have been more fleshed out king of the monsters is kind of the other way around there are dozens of monsters and bonecrushing titanic fights but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters in the first installment even though i also wanted more godzilla when he actually shows up i was so freaking excited since i had to wait for the third act to watch the titans fight the buildup that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy this sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written there are a lot of fight sequences and i wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes the dilemma is that those periods need to exist making the whole thing look like a doubleedged sword that the director is trying to avoid on one hand you cant have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively otherwise these will lose impact over time and become monotonous so you need to spend time with the horriblywritten human characters on the other hand you cant have dumb characters with unclear motivations onscreen for long periods otherwise the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes king of the monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other no one wants to have backtoback fights because theyll lose the impactful energy but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to expositionheavy powerpoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name i cant even remember the main characters names and i watched the movie yesterday i cant blame the cast everyone gives good performances millie bobby brown madison russell continues her path to become one of hollywoods biggest stars in less than 10 years shell have an oscar in her hands i guarantee you that kyle chandler mark russell does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script and ken watanabe dr ishiro serizawa is the only one who delivered a solid performance and had a suitable character fruit of the previous film vera farmiga dr emma russell is connected to the worst character of the movie atrociously irrational decisions made by emma and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters
Mar 8 2023,neutral, synopsis the cryptozoological agency monarch faces off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah if youre a fan of the japanese godzilla movies from 50s 60s 70s and beyond then godzilla king of the monsters is the film for you if you want oscarworthy acting and a complex story then you may want to skip this one i love monster movies and have been obsessing over this trailer since the first teaser was released while this film is far from perfect it definitely delivered the titanfighting action that was missing from the 2014 godzilla movie godzilla king of the monsters has a plot contrary to popular belief it focuses on russell family vera farmiga kyle chandler millie bobby brown and the monster tracking secret organization monarch giant monsters dubbed titans each with their own cool nickname pulled from legends or history are waking up and wreaking havoc monarch scientist and godzilla fanboy dr serizawa ken watanabe is convinced godzilla will come to the rescue and restore balance if you have not seen kong skull island or the first godzilla i recommend seeing at least kong for a better explanation of monarch their mission and history but they are not necessary viewing to understand this film there are a few returning characters from the first godzilla movie and many things mentioned from both godzilla and kong skull island my favorite thing about this film was the plethora of titans they introduced and the way they set the stage for future monsterverse movies there were also so many nods to the classic movies it was obvious the people that made this movie were fans of the old ones other than the ridiculous amount of monster fighting action theres also a ton of cool planes and other gadgets thanks to the extended look at monarch operations we get in this film i loved the scale they set how massive this operation has become and how hugely impactful godzilla and the other monsters are something cool i noticed in this film is that its filled with women in powerful places military command running senate hearings pilots scientists and they dont make a big deal about it or make it a gimmick it was nice to see it as just a normal thing instead of a selling point of the movie ken watanabe is fabulous as always and one of the better acted characters in the film millie bobby brown also does a decent job in her first big screen appearance another positive is the designs of the titans themselves i loved that ghidorah rodan mothra and others were easily identifiable and basically just big budget versions of their former selves now on to my list of things i didnt like the acting was kind of cringeworthy except millie bobby brown shes perfect but the thing that really bothered me about it was every line of dialogue sounded like a quip or cheesy oneliner especially kyle chandler the dad and bradley whitford monarchs nerd character much of the cg was good there were moments where it looked like they forgot to finish it but i was too distracted by the big monsters fighting to care the thing i didnt like was ghidorah and rodans eyes they were too human or something and it was weird on close up shots i also felt like this movie fell into the category of fantastic trailer  okay movie which was disappointing the trailer with somewhere over the rainbow playing in the background is one of my favorite trailers of all time so i had high expectations and unfortunately they werent entirely met the biggest issue i had with this film was the sound mixing and score i dont know if ive just been spoiled by epic action movies with equally epic scores lately but godzilla king of the monsters was severely lacking in that department there were so many perfect moments that just screamed for a big musical moment like godzilla getting back up after getting beat up and we got nothing even when the score was doing something interesting we could barely hear it over the guns and monster noises it was such a letdown to wrap up godzilla king of the monsters delivered the epic monster action it promised in the trailers it was a big budget homage to the classic japanese films many of us grew up watching i am really torn on how to rate this film i feel like it needs two grades one for monster movie quality and another for general film quality though it has many flaws i think godzilla king of the monsters is a solid b  a monster movie i highly recommend it to any godzilla fan and suggest seeing it on the biggest screen possible as for my actual general film grade im going to have to deduct some points for the score sound and script issues that being said i cant wait to see whats next for the monsterverse and godzilla vs kong 2020 if you do see this film the credits are filled with interesting tidbits and there is a post credits scene at the very end so stick around for that
Aug 21 2022,positive, in 2014 director gareth edwards brought godzilla back to the big screen his monster reboot was the 30th film in the near 70yearold godzilla franchise and the first film in warner brothers interconnected monsterverse i loved the movie and its slowburning oldschool creaturefeature vibe relatively new director michael dougherty krampus takes the reins of the sequel godzilla king of the monsters and delivers a movie quite different from its predecessor the slowburn is gone and the largescaled kaiju action is front and center and where the edwards film could also be sold as a standalone movie this one feels very much a part of something bigger and broader i wouldnt call this a spoiler but the last film ended with godzilla sinking back into the ocean after leveling san francisco in a fight with an earththreatening monster jump ahead five years paleobiologists mark russell kyle chandler and his wife emma vera farmiga lost their young son during the destruction of san francisco they have since divorced under the stress of loss leaving their 12yearold daughter madison millie bobby brown caught in the middle while mark has been off the radar emma has been working with the supersecret shadow organization called monarch theyve been monitoring not just the movements of godzilla but the locations of numerous other monsters called titans scattered across the globe in various forms of hibernation even more emma has constructed a device called orca that emits a sonar pulse which can either calm or rile the titans this catches the attention of a devious ecoterrorist group mark is drawn into the chaos and a lot of big monsters rise up the human dynamic is interesting in a variety of ways the russell family drama is easily the most intimate but its the broader human story thats most compelling as dougherty himself describes it to entertainment weekly the world is reacting to godzilla in the same way we would react to any other terrifying incident in that we are overreacting we see mankind responding to the monsters impulsively  out of fear and uncertainty and the question becomes how far can humanitys intelligence and ingenuity take them in the face of such mighty threats all of this is explored through a fine ensemble  ken watanabe sally hawkins charles dance thomas middleditch bradley whitford david strathairn zhang ziyi among others they all fall in nicely with a script that hearkens back in a measured way to the classic toho studio films we get countless reaction shots stunned utterances and quick quips some may not like what theyre going for but i got a kick out of it and i appreciate how the film steers clear of drawn out exposition and loads of scientific mumbojumbo a handful of characters do get pushed to the side but thats okay because they do exactly what they need to do  service the story and keep it moving towards what we really are there to see  the monsters and the titans really are the showcases in addition to godzilla we get classic toho creations mothra rodan and king ghidorah the creature designs are stunning and their epicscaled clashes are breathtaking spectacles the special effects lawrence shers crafty cinematography and topnotch sound design makes for some truly satisfying and immersive kaiju mayhem i can already hear the pushback from those wanting more human drama in a movie about massive earthmoving monsters i actually like the way they unpack the human story amid a breathless array of action and i appreciate how they add layers of intriguing mythology without drowning us in babble and i can also hear those wanting more of godzilla on the screen there are indeed huge segments where we dont see him but i was fine with it because his presence never leaves our mind while things were playing out in front of me i kept thinking but godzilla so it makes sense to me that many have dismissed godzilla king of the monsters the way they have but at the same time it saddens me michael dougherty has delivered a godzilla movie that is unquestionably actionheavy probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creaturefeatures but while the film is tipping its hat to its roots its also subtly holding a mirror to modern society i feel many have missed that element which is unfortunate but when that human detail is combined with some of the best big monster action ever put on screen all i can say is long live the king its a ton of fun unfortunately it didnt get the best reception which i obviously disagree with but hopefully itll do good enough to keep the series going  cant wait to read your take on it im with you the mediocre reception has really surprised me it was a great time at the theater and exactly what i like about big summer movies i also love how it doesnt shy away from its roots i was really surprised that this movie was given such a rough ride really  for me it was amazing epic monster bash  the human element was there enough to connect all the dots and the fight scenes were off the wall good the kid in me that relished seeing all theses iconic giants brought to life and although there was much going on i never thought it lost its narrative nor the human element   plus i liked the fact that didnt over use godzilla  it made his appearance more epic after rewatching the first one before seeing this one  i also have come to enjoy that one even more i always liked it but have rethought a few of my concerns with it after recent viewings   i was a a bit disappointed in hows this one has been received  perhaps it was too long after last one but since they are knee deep in godzilla vs kong  we are assured of at least one more  solid 9 out of 10 from me and one hearty roar for the king of monsters  yes you absolutely nail it im really wondering what peoples expectations were for this i found there to be more story depth and satisfying mythology building than i ever expected and then the monster action the film packs some truly epic sequences that my son and i absolutely loved i cant wait to see it again hate to be a naysayer but i could not stand this movie for me the problem was a huge technical one i couldnt see it it was all too dark and creatures were far too obscured i just couldnt make heads or tails of what was on the screen you say the creature designs are stunning but i simply couldnt tell this made it way too frustrating for me to enjoy my full review should be up tomorrow but thats the gist of it oh bummer hate to hear that if that were the case for me i would certainly feel the same way for me it was often breathtaking thankfully the screen i saw it on was great which definitely provided a better visual experience i might check it out on tv though i missed the last film version though i really want to see the rest of the entire japanese series the first movie really got this particular version off on the right foot it was too slow for some but i thought the slowboil was just right for that film this movie is probably too actionpacked for some me i loved the big action and it felt in line with the story this one was telling hope to see it again before it leaves theaters love your positive take on a movie thats just gotten slammed ugh mind you i still havent seen it but youve reconfirmed that this will be a great time for me i am literally baffled by the bad press i dont know maybe dismissive is a better word i found it to be an absolute blast full of oldschool and nostalgic monster action i think it dodges so many of the potholes that can often make a movie like this a real drag for me it almost felt yanked out of a time capsule but with a stunning new coat of visual effects paint i was lukewarm on 2014s godzilla but everyone ive talked to about king of the monsters say this one straight up rocked admittedly there are few movies im excited for postendgame loved endgame but its a lot of movie and a lot of hype to come down from this one however seems right up my alley i really enjoyed godzilla 2014 but king of the monsters is a much different movie the monster action is simply fantastic and i would definitely recommend seeing it on the big screen it was even more fun watching it with my son hope you get a chance to check it out hahai know same here i saw it in theaters on its opening night with the dbox seating the seat moves and vibrates which was awesome especially with the movies action scenes yeah pity  i enjoyed the higher stakes action  premise  and the discovery of atlantis  even if they had to destroy it to save the world
Mar 2 2022,negative, sometimes when watching an actionpacked finale in a hollywood spectacle the oversaturation of cgi causes your eyes to glass over and your mind to numb into a sleepy state somehow the filmmakers have spent hundreds of millions on special effects animating impossible creatures superhero battles alien invasions and untold destruction but none of it has the necessary emotion and energy to counteract our visual exhaustion or keep our attention certain blockbusters have this quality where the third act descends into digital white noise and the viewer cannot help but lose interest entirely competent hollywood filmmakers know how to use cgi to enhance the material and impress their audience whereas others resolve to throw endless computerized stimuli at the screen in the final battle and hope for the best for that reason godzilla king of the monsters is exceptional its an entire movie that functions as a relentless cgi assault on the viewers eyeballs sustaining a heightened level of fireworks that would usually be reserved for the denouement it carries on like this for the morethantwohour duration and although initially diverting it gradually wears the viewer down into a trancelike state of disinterest call it digital blindness in the same way that snow blindness results from severe overexposure  godzilla king of the monsters is director michael doughertys bigger louder and more tiresome sequel to the 2014 reboot godzilla a movie that served its purpose blandly enough to earn some admiration for its technical competence and impressive cast even though juliette binoche and bryan cranston played characters who died too soon however after a recent rewatch my already lukewarm feelings about godzilla have cooled not that it matters most of the characters from the first movie have not returned for the followupsave for sally hawkins in a thankless and throwaway appearance and ken watanabe who is forced to deliver fortune cookie jokes the sequel also boasts a roster of recognizable names and faces not that any of them have anything interesting to do each actor has been typecast in a familiar way making it easy on screenwriters dougherty and zach shields who concentrate less on the human fodder than the enormous zoological specimens on display  the action starts when in the destruction caused by godzilla in 2014 parents vera farmiga and kyle chandler lose a child leaving their marriage in shambles and their teenage daughter millie bobby brown in the middle five years later farmigas character dr emma russell works with monarch the secret agency that monitors humongous animals like godzilla known as titans secretly dr russell also works with an ecoterrorist played by the evervillainous charles dance and they plan to awaken the hibernating titans to wipe out most of humanity and bring about ecological balance its a standard the earth is dying and humanity is the disease argument popular among hollywood villains these days see kingsman the secret service inferno or avengers infinity war meantime monarch and the us military try to stop russells plan hawkins watanabe zhang ziyi and bradley whitford are the scientists david strathairn and oshea jackson jr represent the soldiers chandler is the concerned titanwhisperer who just wants his daughter back and thomas middleditch provides the comic relief  dougherty approaches digital blindness in the opener with mothra a tenstory moth that spits sticky webbing and he continues punishing us with cgi for the duration every major sequencefrom the first appearance of godzilla to the antarctic emergence of the movies main baddie ghidorah a threeheaded dragon from spacetakes place in some manner of visually muddy inclement weather conditions battles between the titans such as the first clash between godzilla and ghidorah amid an oppressive snowstorm are a struggle to watch because theyre so murky and obscured these colossal monsters tangle underwater in a hurricane in a burning city in the rain or atop an exploded volcano along with the shaky camerawork its almost as though the filmmakers dont want us to make out whats happening moreover in each location the image looks as though its been run through color filters mostly blue gray or orange giving everything a digital flatness and hued sameness that is monotonous to behold for any length of time and while the global plot leaps around several locations the world over somehow as the grand finale unfolds it does so underwhelmingly on the ruins of fenway park godzilla king of the monsters also desperately wants to establish an expansive franchise wherein 2014s godzilla takes place in the same cinematic universe as 2017s kong skull islandall to create enthusiasm for the upcoming sequel godzilla vs kong in 2020 conspicuous references to kong and skull island are meant to titillate fans and build anticipation for the inevitable meeting between the giant iguanagod and the gargantuan ape but since godzilla fights several titans throughout this largescale sequel the notion of godzilla coming to blows with just king kong seems rather underwhelming in any case godzilla king of the monsters has done an effective job of making largerthanlife creatures completely inert and any popcornmunching fun that mightve come from such a show has been reduced to a dismissive shrug the viewer watches in a perpetual state of numbness consuming but not processing oblivious to any attempt at story or theme because the movies primary concern is delivering a sensory explosionbut we experience only the drowsy effects of digital blindness
Sep 29 2021,negative,strong action weak dialogue unfortunately
Mar 6 2021,negative, directed by michael dougherty godzilla king of the monsters follows an assortment of onedimensional characters including millie bobby browns madison kyle chandlers mark and vera farmigas emma as they race to prevent a series of buildingsized monsters from destroying the planet filmmaker dougherty working from a script written with zach shields delivers a predominantly tedious disaster that strikes all the wrong notes right from the getgo as the movie boasts or suffers from an exceedingly distractingly slick sensibility thats reflected in its myriad of lessthansubstantive elements  with this especially true of the pictures uniformly underwhelming and incoherent action sequences such moments rendered entirely with computers are about as convincing and compelling as a thirdrate video game cutscene and although the movie is fleetingly tolerable when focused on the exploits of its impressively eclectic human cast which includes david strathairn bradley whitford sally hawkins and charles dance godzilla king of the monsters is increasingly dominated by dimlylit setpieces that perhaps inevitably pave the way for an interminable second half thats capped off with an astonishingly tedious final battle  with the end result a very expensivelooking flop that seems unlikely to please even the most indiscriminate of viewers
Feb 18 2021,negative,  godzilla is one of those movie creatures who will never truly die first dreamed up in japan in 1954 at the height of the atomic age the nuclearpowered monster has unleashed destruction in more than 30 japanese productions and three american productions including the new godzilla king of the monsters  taking place five years after the events in 2014s godzilla the basic gist of the film is that a group named monarch is tasked with studying and keeping at bay the group of 17 monsters that have been found around the globe a rival group believes the monsters should be released letting nature take its course however it may ill give you one guess as to which group wins that battle  as a result monsters like the threeheaded dragon king ghidorah giant moth mothra and pterodactylesque rodan proceed to wreak havoc as only giant monsters can its up to the movies plucky group of humans to bring an end to the havoc and this time theyll need the help of godzilla in order to do so  no one goes into a godzilla movie expecting high art but its still stunning how incoherent the movie truly is the plot such as it is devolves into a rambling mess almost from minute one that leaves the epic clashes between the monsters to carry the day but even those are just a mishmash of special effects where its next to impossible to tell whats going on until the battle is over  one of the only things keeping the film afloat is the general watchability of its laundry list of movie stars the cast which has five oscar nominations among them includes kyle chandler vera farmiga millie bobby brown ken watanabe ziyi zhang bradley whitford sally hawkins charles dance thomas middleditch aisha hinds oshea jackson jr anthony ramos and david straithairn all of them deserve better than the material theyre performing but each of them also elevates it in one way or another  points do go to the filmmakers led by writerdirector michael dougherty and cowriter zach shields for keeping the visible human death toll to a minimum action films too often wantonly destroy cities with seemingly no regard for the thousands of deaths that destruction would cause in this film two of the biggest scenes take place in antarctica and in the middle of the ocean taking humans mostly out of the equation  fun could also be had in watching the film by playing a spot the reference game only four monsters are truly showcased but godzilla superfans will no doubt relish either the appearances or allusions to other monsters from the franchises history there are also a handful of references to skull island which harkens back to 2017s kong skull island and also hints at whats to come in the alreadyforthcoming sequel 2020s godzilla vs kong  its difficult to know what could make godzilla king of the monsters a truly enjoyable film but a start would be to focus on what everyone wants to see  the monsters  and leave the tricky plot mechanics for pretty much any other movie if you go by the movies life in small towns can either be quaint and neighborly or drudgery where even the smallest change to the daily routine can be cause for excitement the latter is certainly the case in laroy texas where a case of mistaken identity leads to the small texas town having more crime than its seen in its entire existence ray john magaro is a sadsack character seen as a pushover by the most important people in his life his former beauty queen wife stacylynn megan stevenson and his brother junior matthew del negro who manages the hardware store where they both work early in the film ray is shown evidence that stacylynn might be cheating on him by wannabe private detective skip steve zahn bringing even more misery into his life while sitting in a parking lot lamenting his horrible life one night ray is approached by a man with an envelope full of money and a request to kill a man although initially taken aback ray decides to take the job if only to bring something different and exciting into his life the real hitman dylan baker doesnt take kindly to someone stealing work from him and ray soon finds himself in several situations that upend his world completely written and directed by shane atkinson the film is a lightweight but still enjoyable take on a fargoesque story the fact that ray has three separate elements with which to deal  his cheating wife the seemingly everpresent skip and his inadvertent entry into the world of crime  gives atkinson different avenues into which to channel the story which keeps the film from becoming repetitive he also upends expectations at multiple points in the film from the excellent opening scene to the climactic sequence while some of the characters adhere to storytelling conventions several take detours that keep the film from relying too much on texas stereotypes ray especially keeps viewers on their toes as just when it seems hes becoming predictable he makes an unanticipated choice the film does get bogged down a bit in the middle section after an initial jolt of energy that comes with the setup of the story stacylynn and junior are both mostly onenote characters whose importance to the plot doesnt help them much the real hitman after making a great first impression recedes into the background too often the few times he does pop up make you wish his role called for him to be in more scenes magaro is good casting for this role as  much like he did in past lives  he plays the wellmeaning guy who is overshadowed by others in a way that makes you root for him and hate him at the same time zahn has the type of face that allows him to easily play the comic relief but hes also good in more earnest moments baker makes the most of his relatively limited screentime if only had had more laroy texas doesnt do enough to be a completely absorbing crime thriller but with a few good performances and a story thats familiar but still surprising it has more highs than lows with a deadly crime spree the most interesting thing to happen in this small town it might be worth visiting again laroy texas is now playing at galaxy grandscape in the colony it is also available on demand at home it will screen as part of the usa film festival on april 19
Jan 31 2021,neutral,  from the get go rocketman the new elton john jukebox biopic starring taron egerton is more revealing and blunter than last years wildly popular but hagiographic queen movie bohemian rhapsody  using flashbacks john in full stage regalia tells the story during an aa meeting the movie and his tale begin with a revelation my name is elton hercules john and im an alcoholic and a cocaine addict and a sex addict and a bulimic and a shopaholic who has a problem with weed and anger management  jumbled up in the mix are his terrible parents bryce dallas howard and steven mackintosh  when he tells mom hes gay she replies we will never be loved properly his songwriting partner and muse bernie taupin jamie bell plus mounds of cocaine and hit songs used to punctuate the autobiographical action unlike bohemian rhapsodys prudish attitude regarding freddie mercurys homosexuality rocketman is out and proud detailing johns intimate relationship with partner and manager john reid richard madden  part moulin rouge by way of ken russells tommy rocketmans startling opening number the bitch is back establishes that this is no warmed over bohemian rhapsody clone it is a musical not simply a musical biopic characters burst into song and elton john songs are woven into the score  of course music is a large part of the story in the tradition of musical theatre dont let the sun go down on me isnt simply performed as one of johns biggest hits its moves the story forward as a duet between john and his exwifetobe renate blauel celinde schoenmaker  to illustrate the transcendent nature of johns starmaking us debut at the troubadour in los angeles director dexter fletcher gets metaphysical as he plays crocodile rock both john and the audience levitate as if the music is taking them to a higher place its trippy but wordlessly conveys the excitement of those early gigs add to that dancing teddy boys and flamboyant stage costumes and rocketman feels broadway bound  the surreal storytelling effortlessly captures the heady who wants to go to a party at mama casss house days of elton johns early rise to stardom later when john becomes a walking singing rock n roll cliché director dexter fletcher amps up the style to portray the lifestyle the musician himself describes as madness as such the biographical details are jumbled but rocketman is more about capturing the moment not the exact details  it is glittering eye candy but there is much humanity on display in one remarkable scene taron egerton as john prepares for a live show with copious amounts of cocaine and wine staring into the mirror he tries to find his game face from deadeyed to sparkly in the flash we see the two sides of a man who once said i wish i was someone else  egerton is a dead ringer for john even if doesnt sound like the voice from the classic recordings in a performance that portrays the humanity and the outrageousness of someone who says i do not live my life in blackandwhite egerton grabs the singers essence  dick james who advises john to buy something flashy put on a great show and dont kill yourself with drugs add to the flavor of the piece but it is egertons show he can sing and dance but also mines the character to find an emotional resonance missing from many biopics  rocketman is sometimes a little too on the nose in its song selections as taupin who will eventually call the singer his brother and john bond the soundtrack plays border songs hes my brother let us live in peace refrain its a tad obvious for a movie that pushes buttons in terms of style portrayal of sexuality and the flexibility of the biographical timelines  by the films coda however its clear this is a tale of selfreckoning there is much talk of reinvention of killing the person you were born to become the person you were born to be and as john becomes the person he is meant to be this very specific storys im still standing message of resilience becomes universal  if blue öyster cult were to write the hit song godzilla today theyd have to change the lyrics in 1977 they sang oh no there goes tokyo today the prehistoric sea monster has expanded his worldview beyond asia and is now concerned with the entire planet  the action in godzilla king of the monsters begins when paleobiologist dr emma russell vera farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are kidnapped by terrorists what would these bad people want with this emma and madison turns out emma belongs to the cryptozoological agency monarch a scientific watchdog group who study the titans creatures long believed to be myths  along with her exhusband dr mark russell kyle chandler emma invented the orca a device that allows communication with these mysterious beasts more importantly for the bad guys at least it can also control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level  as reluctant hero mark teams with dr serizawa ken watanabe and dr graham sally hawkins to save emma and madison from the kidnappers the titans mothra rodan the threeheaded king ghidorah and others rise threatening to destroy the earth its the ultimate clash of the titans as godzilla who now appears to have a beer belly stomps in to level the playing field cue the blue öyster cult go go godzilla yeah  godzilla king of the monsters is a remarkable achievement its one of the most incomprehensible movies in the godzilla franchise and that is really saying something this story of restoring harmony to the world by releasing these angry monsters is pure codswallop and remember this is the series that once devoted an entire movie to the king of the monsters teaching his dimwitted son how to how to control his atomic breath  ill start with the script and i only call it that because it contains words and was presumably written by people and not some kind of kaijuautocliché generating device ripe with pop psychology moments of crisis can become moments of faith deep horrible dialogue weve opened pandoras box and there is no closing it howmanytimeshaveweheardthat and several big emotional moments you wont care about because the characters are walking talking bmovie stereotypes the movie is as clumsy as the script is dumb  but you dont go to a godzilla movie for the human content you go to see titans battling it out and on that score godzilla king of the monsters delivers unlike the 2014 gareth edwards reboot the new film wastes no time in introducing the radioactive monsters we then sit through a bunch of pseudoscientific pontification until the main event the cage match between gzil and his threeheaded foe in those moments the film improves mostly because these characters dont spout endless exposition about saving the world they simply fight its wrestlemania with firebreathers and when theyre wreaking havoc its a good fistpumping time  godzilla king of the monsters is in 3ddeath destruction and decibelsand has a certain kind of cheesy appeal watching the cast of good international actors try and play it straight as they muddle through the nonsense leading up to the climax is fun for a short time but next time i hope we get more actual monsters and less monstrous scripting  he was once the single most successful american fashion designer ever a man who counted andy warhol and liza minelli among his best friends studio 54 was his playground and he made pill box hats a sensation after designing one for jackie kennedy he was halston a pioneer nearly forgotten today  from his early days as head milliner at bergdorf goodman to his stunning late 1960s success to his domination of the 1970s he defined what was fashionable for the incrowd  he took away the cage says former halstonette pat cleveland he made things as though you didnt really need the structure as much as you needed the woman  he designed luxurious pieces from single pieces of material usually silk or chiffon doing away with the extras like bows and zippers creating form fitting clothes that as minelli says danced with you his clothes were for a modern time when womens lives had changed and they were very popular you were free inside your clothes says model karen bjornson  in 1973 he created a sensation presenting a runway show at the palace of versailles which made him one of the first american designers to rock the world of parisian couture minelli says the staid audience were wowed by the show they went bananas all that energy and that joy and that wonder and that curiosity that is america years later he made similar inroads in china breaking through in a way none of his contemporaries were able to emulate  the ambitious designers company was growing as quickly as his acclaim money came in the form of business deals with norton simon holding company that also owned cosmetics giant max factor and a disastrous deal the down market jcpenney one reporter labels the deal from class to mass and it marks the decline of halstons empire  french filmmaker frederic tcheng is a specialist in the genre of fashion docs he previously directed diana vreeland the eye has to travel and coproduced and coedited the feature valentino the last emperor its a world he understands and the kind of story he is expert in telling for the most part his instincts dont let him down here he doles out the details carefully weaving together the personal and professional story of a man whose career was destroyed by excesshe spent 2000 to 3000 a week on cocaine  and compromise  tcheng s choice to use a framing device an unnamed narrator played by fashion blogger tavi gevinson posing as an employee in the halston archives feels like an unnecessary addition given the natural dramatic rise and fall of the story  halston is part biography of a creative genius part cautionary tale for artists who throw their hats in the ring with big corporations and lose everything including the right to use their own name
Jan 29 2021,negative, in 2014 godzilla left us with a san francisco in smoldering ruins and the very injured title character returning to his mysterious home in the depths of the ocean having saved the world from nearguaranteed destruction by a pair of radiationhungry mutos  five years later godzilla has his work cut out for him again this time against a monster of mythical proportions king ghidorah a threeheaded water dragon reminiscent of the lernaean hydra as well as the other flock of highrisesize creatures that nightmares are certainly made of right away you know godzilla king of the monsters is a film that is not making a push for oscar gold but is focused purely on packing in the entertainment punches perhaps this is what boxing fans find so appealing about their sport or even those who follow the abhorrent game of tennis for that matter they come for the spectacle for the headtohead combat of two or more adversaries and to watch how the bodies hit the floor ken watanabe and sally hawkins return as doctors at monarch the cryptozoological agency  whatever that means  in charge of tracking godzilla and keeping the other secret monsters of the world in hibernation this time around the russell family is at the center of the film mark kyle chandler and emma vera farmiga are the resident experts in the technology that can communicate with the beasts and their daughter madison millie bobby brown astutely keeps tabs on what her parents are doing when a rogue ecowarrior hijacks emmas technology and releases the monsters to set the world back to its natural order the monarch ninjas must race across the world and around the clock to tame the titans but what they quickly learn is that their only hope rests on their fire breathing king godzilla if the terminology and technicality sound vague thats because they are the science if real is above the average viewers pay grade but it also doesnt always add up even to us layman folk however we forgive the science of convenience to get  from a to b in the most thrilling way imaginable the movie runs through action sequences like my fourteenmonthold plays with her toy figurines our human protagonists are thrown onto submarines and military jets traversing the world multiple times which in the brief timeline of the film doesnt seem physically possible in fact you know its all a bit much when midaction sequence you find yourself thinking about when they sleep or use the loo or do any of the logistical things people need to do in a day and listen its ridiculous godzilla king of monsters attempts to pack in so much bang you forget why the fighting started in the first place its an action film on steroids and like with most great terrible blockbusters you may be guilty of laughing at a corny throwaway line or absurd scenario at least a few times before the credits roll despite this or perhaps because of it this godzilla installation is fast fun and pretty much exactly what we want from a sequel five years in the making the story veers in outlands so far removed from reality they could only come to life in a high budget scifi summer blockbuster that at the very least wont be called boring

Dec 16 2020,positive,the story is a little bit of hollow its a little bit orced but  big but godzilla makes up for it the return of godzilla and all of these friends is pretty amazing and pretty epic
Dec 7 2020,negative, director michael dougherty actors kyle chandler vera farmiga millie bobby brown ken watanabe bradley whitford sally hawkins charles dance thomas middleditch ziyi zhang aisha hinds oshea jackson jr ive years have passed since the devastation caused by godzillas climactic battle in san francisco while many have attempted to move on mourning mother dr emma russell vera farmiga has committed herself to her work on the orca a bioacoustic sound wave system that may hold the key to controlling godzilla and other titans when the doctor is kidnapped by jonah alan charles dance and his band of ecoterrorists emmas daughter madison millie bobby brown is dragged into the madmans dangerous scheme to release more behemoths being held by secretive monsterhunting organization monarch  led by ishiro serizawa ken watanabe and vivienne graham sally hawkins despite his hatred for godzilla madisons father mark kyle chandler agrees to assist monarch in their quest to locate and aid the gargantuan reptile against their mutual enemies  including a newly freed threeheaded abomination hellbent on dominating the world we must keep our faith in godzilla the worlds most famous lizard monster has been conveniently taking a fiveyear hiatus so that the events of this sequel can directly line up with the span of time between films humanity hasnt learned much during the break once again building containment fields that immediately fail to hold their prisoners and devices of control that are unable to exhibit much command over their targets its certainly not an original idea to have humans quarrel over meaningless authorities yet that seems to be the major premise here indeed the first halfhour of godzilla king of the monsters rehashes themes from every monster movie of the last 20 years further delaying the inevitable clash between godzilla and longtime nemesis ghidorah is a collection of hackneyed personas every generic character blueprint appears sometimes in multiples a nerdy scientist middleditch a wisecracking technician whitford the precocious headstrong child brown the guiltridden father running away from his family chandler the griefstricken mother consumed by her work farmiga the grimacing stonefaced villain dance and a wealth of military personnel some barking serious orders others providing cynical utterances researchers and politicians and the dialogue is bland to match from commonplace conversations to laboratory lingo to military mumbojumbo far too many supporting players populate the picture with not a one feeling fresh or necessary fortunately monster zero promises some excitement though its the kind that probably wont live up to expectations special effects have come a long way since the maninasuit gimmicks of the originals or harryhausens stopmotion derivations so ghidorahs appearance is fairly amusing the space creatures movements are mesmerizing particularly as its three heads writhe in a natural oscillating cadence but despite the sizable budget there are still copious amounts of obfuscation pummeling the screen rapid cuts and camera angles storms and environmental debris and flickering lights paired with nighttime shots all keep the kaiju combatants blurred and entangled specific choreography is impossible to sort out godzilla king of the monsters is an epitomic example of bombastic spectacle unable to overtake terrible storytelling accidental hilarity finds its way into the film through candid lines from an emotionless antagonist ludicrous transportation conundrums as the main characters zip back and forth across the globe and the nonsensicallyignored physics of nuclear explosions and blast radii oversized stealth jets flying through violent tempests while miraculously pulling off complex rescues and submarines diving and surfacing from extreme depths with the ease of a toy in a bathtub but the visuals are the least of the problems the narrative is more focused on motivational speeches awestruck expressions and commentary phonily emotional sacrifices artificial predicaments designed to inspire lastminute heroism and laughable staredowns between man and titan the filmmakers opted to follow the techniques of the transformers series rather than pacific rim resulting in massive amounts of destruction and collateral damage with very little substance the monster battles are intermittently enjoyable but the humans and their trivial woes continually interrupt them to ruin the momentum for a film promoting the fine balance between mankind and nature godzilla king of the monsters cant seem to balance the petty people the colossal kaiju or the reasons for all of them to exist in the same storyline designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Nov 20 2020,negative,a surprisingly dull affair as far too much time is spent on a truly ridiculous plot involving the freeing of godzillas rivals and far too little on epic monster throw downs
Nov 10 2020,positive, ever since the dawn of time prosperous minds have dove headfirst into this indelible question cutting through the dichotomy of our civilization and its past for the right answer what happens when human beings try to reshape the world by using the dangerous creatures to clear the table who has the true power then in mike doughertys godzilla king of the monsters this theme is explored just enough to set up the wild and overthetop action sequences featuring godzilla king ghidorah mothra rodan and other endangered yet still highly dangerous species its the cryptozoological agency monarch and various other black ops security mercenaries along with it that have given these otherworldly monsters a rebirth on earth that kicks off the deadliest of times picking up after the events of gareth edwards 2014 film dr emma russell vera farmiga is living in mourning peace with her daughter madison millie bobby brown from stranger things estranged from her father mark kyle chandler so effective here emma is testing a new technology that can alert harness and tame creatures from different worlds but what happens when such tech gets into the wrong hands such as a mercenary like jonah alan charles dance aka tywin lannister on game of thrones chaos can break out alliances are tested and families are destroyed enter ken watanabes wise yet dr serizawa and sally hawkins dr vivenne graham two holdovers from edwards film that carry over the story here along with computer wizards like rick stanton a hilarious and muchneeded bradley whitford and sam doleman thomas middleditch mark tries not only to reconnect with his family yet save them at the same time by the by the monsters come and go with the humans not sure who they can trust so you get the drill right humans running scared yet with purpose while monsters both good and bad attack and roar doughertys film scratches the surface of the methodology of these creatures while providing the audience with what they really came for crazy action and monster fights you didnt come to this movie for a geology session without coffee and donuts you bought a ticket for godzilla to take on the threeheaded dragon thing over the city of boston sorry fenway park fans it is the consistently rousing action that makes king of the monsters a worthy spring escape the 2014 film was bogged down by a terrible aaron johnson performance and way too much deliberations and talky nonsense every monster film needs a little substance but dont forget to keep the pace and tension up you dont need to be a godzilla nerd to roll with the punches here as watanabes doctor and chandlers expert will keep you informed about whats going on but your eyes will be served plenty of candy try and tell me there isnt a rush inside you when godzilla and ghidorah make a mad dash for each other crashing through skyscrapers and streets for a battle i judge an action thrillers quality based on how many times i lean up out of my seat to get tuned into the picture and lets just say there were several occasions here its not heavy nor is it too light but screenwriters dougherty and zach shields layer the plot with enough thrills and scares to keep audiences busy and alert you wont be bored and quite frankly youll be tired in the end the cast gives the film muchneeded weight when they were casting the film the filmmakers knew quality was more important than quantity chandler gives mark instant conviction the mans been putting out solid work since he took over coach taylors desk on friday night lights farmiga gives emma the soulful duality thats required hawkins and dance are solid whitford is the highlight here injecting humor into any scene he can even if its playfully saying zilla after someone says god brown doesnt get much to do here except look scared concerned and ready to run the trailer really placed a focus on her character so seeing her being given not much to do was somewhat disappointing if youve watched the netflix original series youll know she can handle a lot watanabe doesnt work enough in america these days but hes popped up in two films recently this and detective pikachu and given each of them some muchneeded soul he plays a doctor who is more connected to godzillas origin tale than he is civilizations future its as if the rent on his forgiveness for our world ran out and he wants to explore a lease on another planet serizawa has skin on each side of the game here and a scene late in the film between his doctor and zilla is one of the better ones i have seen all year its quiet patient and emotional setting up the big finale the action can get overbearing at times especially with the title character making several appearances right at the exact moment that he is required most of the time godzilla looks like a drunk war soldier who showed up the vfw a few minutes late barking and shouting about whats right his battles with ghidorah felt more like a 12 round boxing match accelerating yet exhausting at the same time then again i liked the rockyesque touch given to godzillas story here showing us a creature who may not be as monstrous as the humans trying to dictate his pace like the understated brilliance of the king kong stories hes out of his own time and element looking for safe passage yet running into harms way at every turn theres intrigue there that dougherty doesnt miss godzilla king of the monsters is a fun spring kick to the senses delivering on the action and boosting a cast that knows how to hit the proper dramatic notes therefore giving the tale extra weight and space i wont write this down on my yearend best of the year list but i will advise you to see it it fulfills the promise of the trailer and eradicates the dullness of the 2014 film who is the real monster creatures or humans that may never truly be answered but this actionheavy film gives the theory some credence amidst the war
Sep 9 2020,positive, godzilla king of the monsters if were being honest completely sucks but it sucks in that special kind of way that makes a guy feel kind of special its the kind of suck that you instantly forget about except for that weird tingling in your nether regions that serves as a reminder of the sucking  theres no question that godzilla king of the monsters should have been and could have been a much better film there are moments when director michael dougherty following up on gareth edwards serious and silly 2014 film taps into the soul of the godzilla films and in these moments godzilla king of the monsters flirts with being an upper tier godzilla film unfortunately these moments are often shortlived and surrounded by abysmal editing choices excessive and unnecessary exposition and wonkily awkward dialogue that serves little purpose other than constantly reminding us how completely unnecessary the humans are in this overly populated cast of one and twonote caricatures  godzilla king of the monsters isnt a necessary film its not even a good film really however toho devotees are likely to embrace it for the most part and those seeking escapist cinematic fare could definitely go more wrong than sticking with this nearly brainless plodding disorganized but still rather fun and cheekily endearing endeavor  the godzilla franchise is cinemas longest running and franchise though certainly there are others that could claim to have a wider reach the franchise has encompassed 30 feature films television breakfast cereals and a host of other pop culture outlets on its way to having attained its current iconic status globally most people have managed to see at least a godzilla film while others including friend and film journalism peer evan dossey have plopped themselves down in front of a big screen and watched quite literally every godzilla film ever made  in case youre wondering evans a fan of this film while recognizing its flaws he embraces the culture of godzilla and feels like godzilla king of the monsters embraces that culture and brings it to life  the third film in legendary pictures monsterverse brand behind 2014s godzilla and 2017s kong skull island godzilla king of the monsters is a difficult film to describe precisely because the film is less about narrative and far more about cgi kaiju kickass sequences and goofily fun action sequences somewhat reflective of tohos heisei era flicks think godzilla vs destroyah this is a film that defies its overly complicated plot with overly simplified action sequences  the military also has their eyes on the tool of course and a certain refrence to 1954s gojira should bring more than a few smiles to faces for true godzilla devotees  if youve managed to follow that last couple of paragraphs then youre also an obvious devotee of my writing because im even sitting here reading it back to myself thinking that doesnt make sense godzilla king of the monsters doesnt make a lick of sense but it has a lot of fun along the way dougherty who directed the films krampus and trick r treat has crafted a visually appealing film with enough affection for its cinematic roots that its hard not to imagine that folks are absolutely going to love it while one could easily argue the visuals are often dark and muddy theres a consistency within those visuals to the toho films that is admirable and its hard not to get a goofy ass grin on your face when such monsters as mothra king ghidorah kumonga and a few other surprises pop up along the way  the humans theyre mostly irrelevant here with millie bobby brown being one of the most appealing while sally hawkins now an academy award winner being completely and utterly wasted  bear mccrearys original score is loud booming and domineering though at times mccreary serves up delightful hints of akira ifukubes godzilla scores from the 1950s and 60s and suddenly all feels right within the godzilla universe one cant help but wish hed stuck even consistently within that musical realm  godzilla king of the monsters isnt a good film it simply isnt however its also not the disaster many will proclaim it to be and its fair to say that it earns its way within the godzilla franchise its close enough in tone and aura to not be considered a guilty pleasure because one need not feel one iota of guilt for enjoying a brainless exercise in monster mashing and kaiju bashing 
Jul 28 2020,positive,king of the monsters is a solid powerhouse kaiju story that even manages to find the time to make us like a couple of the human characters as well thats a win in my monster book
Jul 27 2020,positive, five years after godzilla becomes known to the world an ecodystopian plot is set into action that involves releasing more of these titans in order to reverse humanitys mistakes shock almighty it doesnt work instead titans wreck havoc led by the threeheaded monster gidorah only one other titan can stand up to the apocalypses resident bully and thats big g himself although gidorah is not the only one he has to watch out for  it speaks volumes that each of the four primary monsters are named in the end credits  played not by their motion capture artists but by themselves dougherty is letting his kaiju fanboy euphoria overtake him with godzilla king of the monsters and it works a treat there are subtle nods and callbacks to the detailed history of the beasts and a character arc that so deliberately mirrors the bleak finale of the 1954 original the american rerelease of which gives kotm its name such care is taken for each major monster to have its own distinct personality sounds and look this is especially true with gidorah the fallen angel who is an easy villain to detest the embodiment of an insidious repulsive evil all of these are evolutions of toho studios original creations and a stunning demonstration of what modern motion capture can do taking in the magnificence terror and spectacle of these monsters reminds you of why we have movies like this most importantly however the battles are as vicious and intense as you like weirdly for a film with a 500foot threeheaded dragon some of the final moments feel over the top mostly though the kaijus are finally seen as the best version of themselves the most heartpounding set piece is a chase involving the giant pteranodon rodan near the mexican coast but the ultimate showdown is between godzilla and gidorah with these two mighty foes at the centre kotm has plenty of moments where it rivals avengers endgame for biggest visual spectacle of the year dougherty holds nothing back raining fire without mercy and for this he deserves massive credit unfortunately kotm cant really move the monsterverse forward like it wants to since it falls into some all too common pitfalls as with godzilla 2014 the humans serve little purpose other than occupying screen time that should be taken up by the monsters they at least seem less robotic than aaron taylorjohnsons moody military maverick but the family dynamic of the russells is uninspiring very much going through the motions as far as the troubled family thread goes they still emerge as the highlight amongst a spirited cast with little to do sally hawkins especially after her incredible performance in the shape of water 2017 feels wasted here the cast arent helped by an occasionally appalling script which takes so long to kick into action besides a strange plot based around a device that can summon titans left out of the trailers for a reason you suppose and some nonsensical motivations the dialogue is shoddy it does nothing beyond moving the plot along and suffers from some horribly corny moments one line in particular is criminally awful  youll know it when you hear it admittedly however you dont watch kotm for engrossing character work you watch it to see kaijus kick the shit out of each other and at least it gets that right dont let naysayers put you off  godzilla king of the monsters is a lot of fun and a bombastic salute to the franchises history although you might want to consider losing a brain cell or six if you want to come away heralding it as a masterpiece director michael dougherty turns godzilla up to eleven but ultimately this beast is all killer and no filler
Jul 8 2020,negative, godzilla king of the monsters 2019 is a spectacular mess this is an ugly tensionless blockbuster where characters do stupid things while staring at computer generated skyscrapersized monsters battling it out in mundane fashion its a neverending assault on our visual auditory and common senses now what i just mentioned may be a selling point for some of you and with that i say more power to you if you come out of this thoroughly entertained thats great i wish i couldve had that experience  director michael dougherty who cowrote the screenplay with zach shields molded this story  a continuation of warner brothers monsterverse that includes the previous godzilla 2014 and kong skull island 2017  with a flat lifeless energy visually the action is depicted as though it were photographed through mud often taking place at night during a rain storm or blizzard or in the middle of a dust cloud an early set piece happens in antarctica of all places where a nighttime snow storm obscures our vision badly its all chaos with no clarity one of the major gripes some audience members had with godzilla 2014 was the lack of action with the monsters or titans as theyre described this time the action is tripled and yet we arent rewarded because the visuals are so damn murky is it too much to ask that an action scene take place in the middle of the day while its sunny outside its unfortunate that a talented cast is wasted with such undercooked material oshea jackson jr david strathairn ziyi zhang and sally hawkins are all exceptional actors and yet are given nothing to do are tossed to the side or are simply forgotten about as the plot progresses poor vera farmiga she is saddled with a character who defies all logic her dr emma russell has developed a machine that can communicate with the titans through sound waves and yet her motivation isnt to control them so much as to let nature balance itself out theres a strange bit of dialogue in which she explains how civilization has destroyed earths ecosystem and the emergence of the titans is natures way of correcting itself regardless of the substantial loss of life that will come of it basically shes thanos but with a phd  safety is not treated with much urgency among these people emma knowing full well how hazardous her work is willfully brings along her daughter madison millie bobby brown to her secret laboratory to witness her experiments play out it doesnt help that the compound is then ambushed by ecoterrorists lead by charles dance in an attempt to steal emmas technology this leads to emmas exhusband mark kyle chandler going on a personal quest to save emma and madison chandler is the only rational character we get he clearly sees the danger of the titans and yet his warnings fall on deaf ears chandler exudes the same kind of dadintellectualeveryman quality that sam neill brought in jurassic park 1993 but is let down by a far lesser narrative the plot settles into repetitiveness as our characters travel across the world on a super jet witness a titan fight just to be caught up in the mayhem and having to escape before being crushed and then traveling to a new destination to do it all over again for a movie where the action is the selling point there is a surprising lack of it amongst our human characters when they are not running towards or away from danger they simply stand around a command center looking at monitors or out of windows the art direction has such little ingenuity that a scene taking place inside of a submarine looks like it could have happened on the super jet also the set design does not distinguish the two locations well enough the story is so underwhelming that a situation involving twins is brought up as though it were important but is then thrown away with no real relevance or impact ive heard of actors making cameos in a movie but its rare to see an actual plot point be treated like one i found myself squirming in my seat during godzilla king of the monsters as a means of keeping myself engaged theres very little here that i found fun entertaining or enjoyable at any level its a drag of epic proportions im jealous of those who will like this i wish i couldve seen the movie they saw
Jul 7 2020,positive,everything my soul needed kaijus mercilessly destroying each other destruction an epic music score cheesy lines and beautiful cinematography full review in spanish
Jun 28 2020,positive, the postcredits scene its been around for a long time much longer than the classic ferris bueller plea for the audience to finally leave in fact animal did something similar at the end of the muppet movie seven years earlier mostly because of the marvel cinematic universe theyve become even more popular as of late in my opinion the number one best of these is from a marvel film spiderman homecoming being that it was released worldwide on the same day i consider it to be the greatest practical joke ever played upon movie theater audiences the second best to me was at the end of kong skull island even though i knew the film was a litmus test to see if what had been started in godzilla could continue as a franchise it was still an amazing surprise to this longtime kaiju film fan the promise set forth with that postcredits scene has now finally been realized with godzilla king of the monsters its been five years since the battles between godzilla and the mutos wreaked all kinds of destruction and showed the world that monsters exist the organization monarch has been locating and subsequently keeping an eye on these creatures known collectively as titans one of their lead researchers is emma russell vera farmiga who has developed a machine called the orca that mimics the frequencies titans use to communicate after the first successful test she and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are kidnapped by alan jonah charles dance and his team of ecoterrorists monarch recruits emmas exhusband animal behaviorist mark kyle chandler to help track down his family and the orca in the process they discover that godzilla has been straying from his usual migration patterns heading directly into the path of jonah and his plan to loose all of the known titans upon the world godzilla king of the monsters henceforth to be known as gkotm is a very worthy successor to the previous films amping up the monster action and even giving us a framing plot thats just as good as kong and better than the one in godzilla its also the big budget version of these creatures weve been waiting for since the summer of 1998 the human element is well thought out with characters whose fates you get genuinely concerned about who cause you to inch toward the edge of your seat when theyre in peril these arent cookie cutter central casting characters wandering around like supporting players in a slasher film just waiting to get stomped or chomped instead these roles were filled with actors of a quality caliber returning for a second round with the big guy are sally hawkins ken watanabe and david strathairn joining the fight with them are bradley whitford thomas middleditch aisha hinds oshea jackson jr and in a somewhat familiarfeeling dual role zhang ziyi also keep an ear out for a cameo actor to be called a familiar name of course what you truly want from any godzilla film old or new is monsters the character designs the gkotm effects team came up with are amazing they have taken the classic kaiju a lot of us have grown up loving and given them the upgrade that goes above and beyond a fans wildest dreams i genuinely think the creators of the original japanese creature suits would and should be proud of the design work in this film not only does gkotm give us great monsters it expands the mythologies of these beasts the focus is primarily on the big four from the toho films godzilla mothra my personal favorite rodan and king ghidorah yet were also given a glimpse into what totals according to the films scientists seventeen different species sure this is a blatant setup for future films and it would ring more as such if this wasnt already the third entry in the franchise as well as a fourth having finished principal photography with several winks to longtime fans gkotm delivers the kaiju mayhem and serious storytelling that should satisfy all audiences and yes theres another nice postcredits scene hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Jan 17 2020,negative, what if i were to say that a summer blockbuster was boring worse yet what if i were to say that a summer blockbuster starring vera farmiga ken watanabe sally hawkins oshea jackson jr and more were boring what if i were to say that said summer blockbuster wasted its cast its simple premise and its handful of provocative themes and what if i were to tell you that a random pa accidentally spilled their bottle of mountain dew voltage all over the camera staining 75 percent of the film an opaque shade of blue i cant corroborate that last statement but i canas much as it pains me to do soverify the rest in what appears to be a response to godzillas reception five years ago godzilla king of the monsters triples down what audiences were clamoring for thats more mayhem more laser breath and yes more monsters however all of that comes with a caveat more lens flares more michael bayhem more awkward cuts and less cohesion in both fight scenes and pacing make for a ride that goes on for way too long and still ends before it begins dont peg me as some plotdriven square though the main issue with king of the monsters isnt necessarily its plot its just how apparent it is just how left of center it exists without enough care to either blossom or completely get out of the way that plot concerns a socalled cryptozoological agency monarch as they fight against a trio of godsized monsters that includes dragontype destructor rodan mothra the giant moth and for all the franchise fans out there the threeheaded king ghidorah again there arent many plot devices here the entire plot is a device in and of itself and while that would be fun in more secure hands it instead seats the audience with a handful of dreadfully dull characters the closest to a conduit exists in the form of dr emma russell farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown both of whom have their own turbulent relationship with the family patriarch mark kyle chandler alongside them are science experts ishiro serizawa watanabe and ilene chen ziyi zhang who in their infinite wisdom let in the little fact that ghidorah is godzillas arch nemesis they naturally decide to pit godzilla against the new team of threats things get scaly things blow up things get really dark really dusty and then really bright again thanks to a cacophonous light show of visual effects rinse repeat the end but despite this schematically sound setup king of the monsters tries its hand at a semblance of commentary directorcowriter michael dougherty and cowriter zach shields build the film around environmentalist ideologies that dont go much of anywhere its idiosyncrasies point to more genrebending potentials but the film instead uses this base as filler add in the fact that the film exists to bathe in destruction and it ends up at the south end of an alreadyextraneous moral compass this isnt to say that the entire film is preoccupied with some sort of message however that would only be the first 80 minutes or so which come out to a very long first twothirds the arc is almost entirely dependent on tone as well and while the film starts much more akin to gareth edwards godzilla it veers farther into cartoon territory without telegraphing its shifts or recontextualizing its earlier scenes its closest efforts in doing so are personified with dr rick stanton bradley whitford a joke dispenser who feels stuck in an entirely different film instead the unifying motif is its platinum color palette courtesy of lawrence sher the cinematographer behind movies such as war dogs and the hangover trilogy its all blue all the time here save for the wide shots of the fiery abattoir that comes to be and if he and dougherty are feeling generous there might be some red in there as well its economically shot but not fun to look at often lacking a sense of scale or grandeur each monster each crash and each blow are so isolated that the film doesnt feel light on its feet but void of weight instead cordcutting once carried the promise of reducing live tv costs but with most services nearing a 100 per month that statement checks less every day that said there is a handful of cordcutting services with reasonable monthly prices below we list them maybe youve just seen oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathonor more fun yet rankall of christopher nolans films or maybe youre one of the few who havent seen interstellar yet if you are then you should change that immediately the dystopian epic is one of nolans best and with that incredible twist in   which netflix country has interstellar for whatever reason the hunger games series isnt available in the same countries around the world youll find the first and second aka the best installments in hong kong for instance but not the third and fourth its a frustrating dilemma especially if you dont even have a single entry in your region which is   which netflix country has each movie of the hunger games
Jan 10 2020,positive,ill say this is probably going to be one of the best event movies of the year it succeeds in the scale of what this movie should be and what fans hoped it would be
Jan 10 2020,positive,  the gareth edwardsdirected 2014s godzilla  is by no means a bad film that may not come as a ringing endorsement but it makes sense given the impact that film had on the cinema goers of the world while praised for its sombre tone and appreciation of scale the film was nonetheless criticised for its reluctance to show its titular monster in all his kaiju glory legendary pictures seems to have heard the outcry of audiences everywhere and have seen fit to produce godzilla king of the monsters a film that knows no sense of the word restraint  in this movie there are several different bouts between monsters the size of skyscrapers after godzilla emerged to defend the modern world from destructive titans five years ago hes taken a muchdeserved sabbatical from being defender of the earth that is of course until a griefstricken mother takes it upon herself to unleash the worst titan of them all king ghidorah in a misguided attempt to save the planet for future generations  to go into the story further would be tantamount to actively repelling viewers from the cinema as it all boils down to a series of plot contrivances put in action for the sole purpose of getting two monsters within fighting distance of each other the dialogue is a mix of bad jokes and technical mumbojumbo to describe it as jargon would be an insult to intelligence and does just enough to get you to the next fight without being completely irritating in godzilla king of the monsters its all in service of action so its a good thing said action is wildly entertaining  whether youre a longtime fan of the pantheon that is godzilla films or a newcomer to the monster mash its hard to imagine not being entertained by whats on screen what used to be people in rubber suits battling stopmotion puppets can now be appreciated with an attention to detail that often goes unnoticed in blockbusters still as fun as it is to watch the film feels perhaps appropriately given godzillas massive jaw a little long in the tooth if not for the massive scale of the action demanding to be seen on the big screen id say this is a film best viewed in a format where you can skip ahead to the best parts
Jan 9 2020,positive, by dan tabor film critic its been five years since godzilla reboot decimated the multiplexes that film was an artier take on the monster film directed by gareth edwards monsters rogue one that seemed to focus more on the human story than the giant lizard namesake that has spawned 30 films since then there has been a refocus of the series thanks of course to marvel to franchise up these monster films this rethink was introduced in the follow up kong skull island which setup not only one of cinemas most beloved monsters but also a mythology that hinted at legendary who produced these films would be bringing tohos entire rogues gallery of monsters to this new cinematic universe this was very exciting news to longsuffering godzilla fans who have waited patiently to see these monsters unleashed onto a new generation cribbing a page or two from avengers infinity war godzilla kotm takes place five years after the events of the first film the once shadowy monarch organization has come to prominence as humanitys monster liaison with the revelation that 17 of these apex predators known as titans are hibernating around the planet or they were until they were awakened by a sonar device called the orca wielded by a group of ecoterrorists lead by colonel alan jonah charles dance aka tywin lannister from got who want to rebalance the world by allowing the titans to cleanse it the film begins with dr emma russell vera farmiga the monarch scientist who developed the orca  which can control the titans through bioacoustics  getting kidnapped along with her daughter madisonmillie bobby brown its then up to her estranged husband and former monarch scientist dr mark russell kyle chandler to navigate kaiju battles around the world while bringing his fractured family back together blessedly the first titan the terrorists bring back is godzillas infamous nemesis king ghidorah the three headed dragon also known as monster zero godzilla kotm wisely ditches the arthouse pretense of the first reboot and delivers a rockem sockem old school kaiju beatem up unlike his predecessor director michael dougherty krampus trick r treat isnt stingy with the goods either just minutes into the film godzilla is on screen in all his glory doing just what he does best laying waste to anything that gets in his way we soon learn that mankind once worshipped the titans as gods and some are benevolent godzilla mothra and some are in league with lucifer himself king ghidorah the film culminates in the brutal and breathtaking spectacle of team godzilla taking on team ghidorah sure its campy and a bit goofy but its the right direction for these films and the right audience to target since godzilla belongs to the monster kids both young and old there were moments watching godzilla kotm when i was once again a bedazzled 10 yearold kid watching godzilla fight king ghidorah for the very first time cheering on the good guys hoping godzilla triumphs again it says a lot that a film can still inspire that kind of awestruck reaction from a 40 something film geek who sometimes thinks he has seen it all but this movie managed to do just that time after time loud over the top and utterly unrelenting godzilla king of the monsters is the wrestlemania of kaiju films and makes no apologies for it

Dec 6 2019,positive, im not a godzilla person or at least i wasnt until 2014 when i was a year into dating a certified godzilla person and gareth edwards godzilla was released and i was shocked to discover that i was weirdly into giant monsters beating the shit out of each other i even told my grandpa who i thought was a godzilla person that this new one was pretty good he looked at me sideways and said quite calmly aly i think youve lost your mind well maybe i did because i married that godzilla person watched from the sidelines as he dove in headfirst into 65 years of godzilla movies and wrote an opus about them had a baby with him and watched godzilla king of the monsters with said godzilla person and son of godzilla person not once but twice  twice  since receiving a review copy of the dvdbluray the baby tried to eat my face after the first viewing  parenting win this is all a longwinded way of saying i never would have predicted that i would be in the apparent minority of people who loved godzilla king of the monsters this was the blockbuster that critics chose to lambast upon its release in may because like the 2014 film the humans are onedimensional because unlike the 2014 film there are too many monster fights those are criticisms i dont agree with or understand because theyre exactly what make king of the monsters a good godzilla movie maybe even a great one if unironically loving alien covenant and to a lesser extent prometheus has taught me anything its that sometimes you have to let go of caring about the human characters and root for the monsters and  or robots instead the central family of vera farmiga kyle chandler and millie bobby brown and their emotional journeys are fairly milquetoast their names are emma mark and madison for crying out loud and the parents separated after their son andrew was killed during the events of godzilla  but who cares while some of them play a more active role in the story literally waking monsters theyre really nothing but human witnesses of a world that must change in order to undo the damage humans have done to it this story is too big for humans to be either the protagonists or antagonists some fall one way or another of course but its the monsters  the titans  who are the real heroes and villains some like godzilla and mothra want to save the world others like ghidorah and rodan want to destroy it none of them really care about the tiny humans who either try to help in the tiniest of ways fuck up in some majorly royal ones or wisely flee at the sight of real tangible gods  you see that photo at the top thats it thats the movie godzilla has always worked best as an allegory for the consequences of human destruction whether its nuclear testing or climate change do you think those consequences give a shit about whatever story weve been telling ourselves for generations to make ourselves feel better about how small we are  the best example of this blending is the discussion of motioncapture performance both godzilla and ghidorah were performed by motioncapture artists each one of ghidorahs heads was played by a different actor and dougherty calls this the natural evolution from the man in the rubber suit in the original toho films hes not wrong and this is a pretty decent way to recontextualize a method of acting that has been underappreciated at least since the days of gollum most tellingly though dougherty smiles throughout every single one of his talking heads most directors undoubtedly love what they do but it rarely shows in special features even taika waititi sounds bored out of his mind during the thor ragnarok commentary so its pretty wonderful to see one who is so genuinely enthusiastic about his film and the franchise in which hes playing its worth watching all the special features for doughertys contributions alone another aspect of king of the monsters that i adore is its reverence and incorporation of world mythologies into godzilla lore i could probably go on about that forever but the dvd has me covered a dorky 15minute featurette called monsters are real interviews various professors and cryptozoologists about this very topic its not necessarily the best special feature  i would say those would be the evolution of the titans and monarch in action collections  but its worth a view if only because it leans so hard into the campier aspects of godzilla for better or for worse and thats ultimately the deciding factor on whether or not king of the monsters is for you the science isnt any stupider than what youd find in star wars or the like the humans are just humans the monster fights are and i dont say this lightly the fucking tits this movie is beautiful on bluray and the special features are actually special so overall id recommend adding this to your collection should you find yourself a godzilla person and not a total stickinthemud
Nov 22 2019,positive,the monster fights alone are worth seeing on a huge screen just dont go looking for a realistic plot or science
Nov 22 2019,positive,as the puny humans flail godzilla the cary grant of giant monsters emerges with his dignity intact
Nov 7 2019,negative, with trick r treat director michael doughtery taking over from gareth edwards godzilla king of the monsters follows the efforts of the cryptozoological agency monarch as its members face off against several godsized monsters including godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his nemesis  the threeheaded king ghidorah although he has only directed three films edwards has established himself as a filmmaker that is confident with bigbudget features following his departure from the production in 2016 it allows doughtery to step in to make his first bigbudget film with so much pressure to deliver on the success on the 2014 film the sequel needed to up the scale on edwards mammoth feature with that in mind the sequel features more of tohos classic monsters such as mothra rodan and the threeheaded king ghidorah setting the stage for the most epic battle in legendarys monsterverse it promises highpaced action however it falls spectacularly short ranging from kyle chandlers embittered father and bradley whitmores unfunny cryptomonographer to godzilla returnees ken watanabe and sally hawkins the extensive list of characters dont do much other than bicker about monarchs poorly maintained secrecy or argue about whether to help or kill the monsters it is evident that each character has their own opinion about the titans but the predictable narrative restricts them to being onedimensional when certain characters try and offer a serious spin on their motives vera farmigas emma russell being a notable example they just come across as laughable in addition the film isnt helped by doughtery and shields poor script containing a mashup of overdramatic lines and needlessly long and ludicrous explanations the dialogue strays into cliché territory needless to say the already limited character development is abandoned as soon as the titans take to the sky  considering that they are the real stars of godzilla god of the monsters not even they can help enhance the quality of the film imposing onscreen and chaotically animated audiences dont have the time to revel in the majesty of the titans amid the melee of sky battles going on  although godzilla and mothra do look quite astounding the overall lacklustre quality downscales the thrill factor of this supposedly highpaced action feature due to these poorly developed elements godzilla god of the monsters fails to deliver on the promise of an epic monster film long gone is the thrill of seeing two formidable opponents faceoff on screen  thanks to the machinations of its human characters it ends up being another boring blockbuster that is not as good as the original 
Oct 14 2019,negative, its a royal rumble of titanic monsters as the iconic japanese sea creature godzilla confronts a slew of giant prehistoric foes and some very confused humans theres a degree of spectacle but its a misshapen movie writes critic craig mathieson several times in this monster mashup the film will cut to a medium closeup of godzilla fixing on the oversized sea creature as he takes a break from his latest rumble with another of mythic titans that have returned to life to topple skyscrapers and crush civilisation the digital creature has a steady blank gaze  obviously hes seen a few things  but theres no real innerlife to him outside the destruction he causes or sometimes counters thats a problem for michael doughertys scaly blockbuster because it keeps trying to assign motivation values and even beliefs to the radiationripped beast hes a blank slate nothing permanent can be written on with 2014s hollywood reboot godzilla gareth edwards skilfully exploited that unknowable distance the scale was human  the characters ran and dodged in the debris and dusty surrounds of godzilla and his eventual adversaries  and when the monsters were revealed after an admirable period of menacing restraint their otherworldly scale rendered humanity and its toys insignificant the sequel has many more monsters and many more battles like an old 16bit fighting game dougherty shoots godzilla and his latest opponent in citywide profile you half expect them touch claws before they come out punching having saved  ie devastated  san francisco from a pair of massive unidentified terrestrial organisms five years prior godzilla is a source of hope and a transformative figure in the new films as more titans are revealed theyre set free by ecoterrorists led by a former british soldier alan jonah charles dance himself a giant of scenery chewing who believe that the titans will save a dying planet by reducing the plague of humanity and sparking regrowth through their radiationfuelled bodies that is a step short of worshipping these monsters whose selections such as king ghidorah will delight longtime godzilla fans and theres a wild mix of paganism and nihilistic abdication lurking here that the movie not unsurprisingly doesnt want to get into instead the framework is a divided family with jonah kidnapping one scientist whos been helping the international agency monarch study the dormant titans dr emma russell vera farmiga along with her teenage daughter madison millie bobby brown that necessitates madisons father emmas exhusband and former monarch scientist mark russell kyle chandler returning to the fold growing increasingly more angry chandler has such an expressive jaw as the extent of the titans becomes destructively clear everyone including the characters played by ken watanabe and sally hawkins in the first film race around the globe from one clash to the next complete with a macguffinlike box thats super crucial and thus easily stolen by an angry teenager yet its all strangely ineffectual  theres no physicality to the fighting and no wonder to the creatures rise dougherty signals as much by repeatedly cutting away to scrambling humans or deeply ineffectual jet fighters that are mere mosquitoes the film even has two comic relief archetypes bradley whitford as the freakedout white scientist and oshea jackson jr as the phlegmatic black soldier both actors are better than those roles require but then everyone  and everything  in this film is reduced to their basic tenets that look of furious focus millie bobby brown trademarked in stranger things is showcased here you need to see this one bit player after another urges the main characters but the reveals in godzilla ii king of the monsters never really linger let alone inspire a blank slate is nothing until its filled in

Sep 27 2019,positive, godzilla may be king of the monsters but this sequel to the 2014 american reboot of the legendary japanese franchise is king of the monster movies that does not mean the best when i say king i mean more in the context of a kingsized meal or bed despite having the blandest lead characters in mainstream blockbuster history the 2014 godzilla delivered the goods of a kaiju movie  that is brutal giant monster and giant monster action while the titular character was used sparingly when he did appear there was a real sense of weight the camera shot godzilla from below you felt the sublime awe of those cowering under him and could witness the buildings around him buckle from director michael dougherty who helmed underrated creature flick krampus godzilla king of the monsters improves on some of the issues fans had with its predecessor theres a more gripping human story and more godzilla as well as ghidorah mothra and rodan for your buck kyle chandler and vera farmiga star as dr mark and emma russell one of their two kids the other being stranger things millie bobby brown died during the events of 2014s godzilla the two are now split up mark has become an alcoholic meanwhile emma works with ken watanabe and sally hawkins scientists from the last movie to try capture and study godzilla and other giant creatures like him this is to try find a way to discover how monsters and humans could exist symbiotically when emma and her daughter are kidnapped by a group of radical environmentalists led by charles dance mark is brought out of exile to help find his exwife her captors are travelling around the world freeing skyscraper sized monsters as they believe the destruction they wreak is the only thing to save earth from being destroyed by human hand the dark universe with movies like dracula untold and tom cruises show me the mummy struggled to build a shared mcu like universe based around properties acclaimed for their villains no one wants to watch a heroic sexy prince of darkness or tom cruise becoming a kindhearted version of an egyptian boogeyman legendarys monsterverse of which this is the third entry after kong skull island has fared a lot better this is by realising all thats needed is a series of movies loosely connected by their central monsters doing what they are famous for all while a set of different each time human characters deal with their own issues tied to the creatures emma and marks story is not exactly deep plus it falls to the wayside along with any commentary on environmentalism as soon as the monsters take over however it provides just enough of an emotional spine in between kaiju fights to keep audiences invested here you have two parents dealing with grief in radically different ways and the daughter caught between them theres a tragedy there that is hard not to sympathise with all that said the real reason to see godzilla king of the monsters is its gargantuan monster brawls   the biggest put on screen maybe ever while the worry is during these sequences the movie will descend into cgi mush here what they resemble is rembrandt tableaus or at least those on steroids  depicting giant gods dueling for the fate of the world in the midst of bright heavenly lights the latter the effect of either an oxygen bomb designed to kill the monsters the lightning that gathers any time ghidorah is present or the radiation used by godzilla to get increasingly jacked you watch these fights and forget you are seeing a movie they transcend the medium becoming almost abstract art its because of them you ignore the many flaws of godzilla king of the monsters i say bring on godzilla vs kong stephen is a film writer journalist and podcaster formerly coeditor of the film section of headstuff he is now a writer at joeie he has also had work published in hot press the times ireland edition the irish sun and film ireland and cohosts the headstuff film podcast i know that face he graduated with a ba in english and film from ucd and an ma in journalism at dcu headstufforg is a collaborative hub for the creative and the curious we all spend so much of our time clicking through reams of content and sometimes not reading anything of interest at all headstuff is all about putting buckets of interesting stuff in one place so its easy for you to find and enjoy high quality content from our wonderful contributors we get up every morning to make your daily journey through the internet more interesting and productive were all about the quality and support good writing and reading 
Sep 27 2019,negative,  going into godzilla king of the monsters i expected offthecharts monster clashes and not a lot else instead of posters littered with human characters weve got a spotlight on the sort of cast audiences have longed for since 2014s relatively kaijuless godzilla godzilla mothra rodan king ghidorah  and really what else do you need for less than half the movies run time my wish was fulfilled either by witnessing the slow reveal of each monster or watching them engage in fullon combat for the other morethanhalfish though i was engaged in an internal battle of my own how much does the good outweigh the bad the joy you get out of godzilla king of the monsters may depend largely on how much goodwill it earns from you with the kaiju clashes whats the exchange rate for boring human drama to nostalgic monster fights is every 1 minute of mothra worth 5 minutes of kyle chandler frantically yelling about his daughter how about 10 the value of that kind of currency will vary from one person to the next but the answer to these kinds of questions is a basic litmus test for whether this film really works godzilla king of the monsters employs a sort of nesting doll approach to conflict the largest in scale and easily the most engaging is the battle of the kaiju pitting mothra and godzilla against rodan and ghidorah move down a layer and youll find the least interesting most convoluted plot that of various government entities including monarch a special unit researching the titans eg monsters and even environmental terrorist organizations each has a different opinion and approach in how to best handle the potential threat from the titans this piece of the story somehow almost impossibly involves both the most exposition and the least amount of clarity its a major but mostly needless obstacle to telling this story filled with boring mcguffin chasing at best and complete nonsense at worst in the final layer we have the the drama surrounding a family torn apart by tragedy and well godzilla this is the part of the movie that could have worked in different circumstances kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobby brown do their best to make us care about this family but the effort falls flat as it gets trapped in the underpinnings of that second layer of plot previously mentioned but like i said its not all bad because then you have the kaiju in 2014s godzilla the lack of appearance from the titular character was the main complaint i heard from people who were unsatisfied with the film this is fortunately not a problem here monarch spends most of the films running time tracking and chasing godzilla and this time we even see enough of him to see glimmers of personality mothra is also wellserved by this movie getting moments in battle that are pronounced enough to almost make her feel more human than the films leads on the other side ghidorah and rodan are mostly served up as pure monster menace with an even elaborate bit of ghidorahs backstory woven into the central plot its clear that director mike dougherty is a fan of these creatures and he does them justice i also thought the visual effects looked good here though i could understand complaints that theyre a little murky the film uses lots of earth tones for the titans and the biggest fight scene is portrayed in the dark and in the rain not unlike pacific rim but i thought those choices helped the film light up more drastically when special powers or brighter colors were used and everything was still crisp and clear small snapshots within the film were artful enough that you could see how gorgeous each moment would look as a still the music only adds to the nostalgia factor and fans of the older movies will recognize some of the themes of bear mccrearys score i would add that if youre interested in seeing this i expect the bigscreen experience would be vastly more rewarding than waiting to catch it at home godzilla king of the monsters poses several questions about humanity and the burden we put on the earth and our environment do we deserve to reign over this earth if we will destroy it in the process im not sure it was the intent but i walked away from the film with a clear feeling we really dont need the humans after all just bring on the kaiju shin godzilla is amazing im sad that well never see a sequel to that but then again its a miracle that first one exists at all ill admit the 2014 godzilla has its moments its better than the 98 misfire with matthew broderick most things are still any movie that makes elizabeth olsen uninteresting has some problems

Aug 28 2019,negative,  look who are we fooling here does anyone go to a godzilla movie for the plot or the human actors for years ive been agitating for a disaster movie that is all disaster or a giantmonster movie that is all giantmonster destruction and to hell with the pallid subplots about parents trying to track down their kids in the midst of the maelstrom or whatever such a movie would be a purecinema mammoth with no dialogue and no stars except the disaster or the monsters name me one moviegoer who said lets go see that new kyle chandler monster movie ill wait  i shouldve known godzilla king of the monsters despite its promising title would not be the answer to my demands but really godzillas amount of screen time has traditionally always been scant in the original 1954 gojira the big guy only showed up for less than nine minutes out of a 96minute running time but by now the footage of humans staring at screens or discussing what to do about the kaiju or having moral debates while cities burn is so fucking dull i appreciate that theyve tried to get terrific actors like chandler and vera farmiga playing a divorced scientist couple and millie bobby brown as their daughter and theres some comic relief from a sardonic bradley whitford but theres so much pressure on a big expensive thing like this  from warner bros from toho from its own fan base  that it cant truly be surprising or inventive  the suspicion is that the oldschool godzilla movies play better in nostalgic memory than they do in actuality and at least the old maninsuit throwdowns between godzilla and say ghidorah  his big nemesis here  were fun in a goofball way and easier on the eyes and ears in godzilla king of the monsters directed by michael dougherty trick r treat the fight scenes between kaiju are always shot at night or during terrible rain or snow storms the better to hide the cg seams and the design of the creatures is dark grim gritty ugly lacking the charm of the old critters and when they fight they take down skyscrapers by the dozen and even though the movie takes pains to establish mass evacuation so what these are not real buildings with real people inside the assumption that we care about loss of human life in these movies is hypocrisy of course we dont the height of true sadness here comes when godzilla appears to be dead  the trailers for these things are always electrifying when the trailer for this film landed and we first saw godzilla and ghidorah racing at each other in the middle of a city we shuddered and laughed and swore to catch it on an imax screen  i did anyway im sort of glad i didnt bother theres godzilla and ghidorah and mothra and rodan and a few other beasties named scylla or behemoth or baphomet or dennis and theres forever the problem of showing action between really tall creatures on a really wide screen  either you have to pull way back or go so close in you might as well be watching leather suitcases bashing into each other the og gojira occupied the squarish 1371 aspect ratio godzilla started out in blackandwhite movies and for all intents and purposes has circled back there the look of this film is gray with the occasional blast of colorful radioactive breath the sound is bassheavy headacheinducing its not a good time or aesthetically pleasing or even very exciting there are two or three fantastic apocalyptic images see above but thats about it  at this point i prefer offthebeatenpath bigmonster stuff like big man japan or the host or even colossal they dont have the big guys name recognition or the giddy buzz which soon dies when you see the actual thing of going to a godzilla flick but they have more interesting things to say and therefore better things occupying our brains between kaiju rampages this movie tells us that the monsters are vital to the survival of the human race because they maintain balance even though they tend to destroy cities boston gets turned into an ashtray here their destructiveness holds our destructiveness in check this is a bitter pill to swallow when were watching the amazon rain forest die in real time and our childrens future with it save us godzilla but he wont no one will and movies like this add to the delusion that theres hope to be found in the rubble
Aug 27 2019,neutral, godzilla king of the monsters is rated pg13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction and for some language the running time is 2 hours and 12 minutes
Aug 27 2019,negative, over the course of 65 years the godzilla franchise has certainly seen its ups and downs the original 1954 film is a decent monster flick kaiju that while somewhat cheesy in this day and age still holds up as a classic with the multitude of films that followed ie godzilla vs having a solid fanbase however in more recent years the films have taken an obvious turn for the worse the 1998 godzilla is constantly criticized as being a big mistake while the less said about the disastrous 2014 reboot the better with this in mind you would think a sequel to the 2014 film would be another big mistake for the franchise but because it made some money you knew it was inevitable so now were faced with godzilla king of the monsters a followup that attempts to up the kaiju action considerably would the sequel finally be the one to get the series back on course or were audiences simply in for an even bigger disaster than before taking place five years after the previous film we begin by following dr emma russell vera farmiga a member of monarch a group that seeks out and studies monsters akin to godzilla while she is researching a recently born creature known as mothra her group is attacked by ecoterrorists led by alan jonah charles dance who kidnaps both emma and her daughter madison millie bobby brown in addition to stealing a piece of machinery known as the orca which can influence the behavior of the monsters known as titans monarch approaches emmas exhusband mark russell kyle chandler to help get them back and while he eventually agrees the situation only becomes more complicated when it is discovered that emma is actually working with the terrorists to help free more titans believing that they are needed to help heal the earth from damage caused by humans with the terrorists waking more and more titans around the world monarch must pin their hopes on godzilla and his allies in hopes that they can bring the other monsters to heel with a film like godzilla king of the monsters theres really no beating around the bush there are several things that can be said about it but unfortunately none of them are good the film is simply one of the biggest noisiest messes you will see in this or any other year when the previous film was criticized for having a very noticeable lack of godzilla until near its conclusion apparently the folks behind the followup took that to mean that the next film should be as overloaded with monsters as possible even to the detriment of the characters and plot granted no one really goes to see a film like this expecting to see anything near a wellrounded human character but for this sequel it feels as though they put in even less effort than before for those watching the film just hoping for a good bit of mindless kaiju action theres certainly plenty of that unfortunately the rest of the audience will be bored silly by the flat characters nonsensical plotting and the mindnumbing action whats even more frustrating though is that it wastes an incredibly talented cast in the process including sally hawkins charles dance bradley whitford millie bobby brown vera farmiga kyle chandler david strathairn ken watanabe and ziyi zhang alas even such a remarkable ensemble as this would never be able to breathe life into michael dougherty and zach shields insipid screenplay which ultimately ends up being the glaring source of the films multiple problems its really rare to find a film like this that has no redeeming qualities about it the direction is sloppy the action is dull the characters are lifeless and the plot never becomes compelling or even slightly interesting its a twohour mishmash of monsters fighting and onedimensional human characters running around trying to do something about it when all is said and done its rather easy to label it the worst film of the year and its quite inconceivable that anything would be able to take the title away in that sense and in that sense alone this godzilla truly is king godzilla king of the monsters comes to bluray in a 241 1080p high definition transfer of outstanding quality this is a very dark and special effectsheavy film but the picture remains perfectly sharp and clear throughout its 132minute runtime the dolby atmostruehd audio is equally impressive giving you all of the dialogue score and the extensive sound effects in excellent quality overall the kaiju fans in the audience will no doubt be thrilled with the wonderful treatment that the film has received with its mindnumbingly dull action flat characters and nonsensical plot its rather difficult to find a single redeeming quality in the entirety of the twohour tedious mess that is godzilla king of the monsters also going so far as to waste a great cast consisting of multiple oscar and emmy nominees it easily makes a case for being the worst film of 2019 will anyone dare challenge the king for the title it seems very much doubtful
Aug 12 2019,positive, arguably a great case of be careful what you wish for the new godzilla king of the monsters represents a hard turn away from the more elegant lessismore approach of 2014s reboot which left many hardcore fans unsatisfied by its lack of gratuitous giant monster mayhemporn king of the monsters makes up for that shortcoming and then some on the downside it veers so far in the other direction that it overcompensates that said its probably the most kaijuesque godzilla movie since godzilla final wars sent the lovable lizard into hibernation in 2004 sadly its kitschy melodramatics and pulp scifi elements will likely be misread by casual viewers  cowritten and directed by michael dougherty krampus the movie picks up directly after godzilla and expands on elements depicted in it and kong skull island by establishing godzilla kong and several newly discovered titans mothra rodan and ghidorah as relic species of an ancient world that are rising again as a result of mankinds dicking around with the environment while the monarch organization led by dr ishiro serizawa ken watanabe works to study the creatures and seek a symbiotic relationship with them extremist colonel alan jonah charles danse wants to weaponize and release them in order to save the world by thinning out the human herd caught in the middle are scientist dr emma russell vera farmiga who has invented a rudimentary means of communication with the titans her exhusband dr mark russell kyle chandler whod rather see them all destroyed as payback for the death of his son and their daughter madison millie bobby brown it falls upon the more levelheaded humans to assist godzilla when his ancient rivalry with threeheaded lightningbreathing ghidorah turns into a multimonster brawl with the potential to level human civilization like many godzilla flicks this one has a degree of social commentary big g debuted as a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power here hes climate change on legs dougherty and cowriter zach shields arent subtle it but they dont get preachy either they also arent subtle when it comes to the wholly predictable plot specifically when it comes to the fleshandblood human characters their arcs become clear about 3040 minutes in including what should be a major twist the actors give solid performances including oscarnominee sally hawkins thomas middleditch zhang ziyi and bradley whitford but they are often hamstrung by clunky exposition and lame wisecracks in all fairness few come to a godzilla movie looking for dramatic depth its all about giant monsters slapping the bejeezus out of each other and the massive property damage that entails in that regard king of the monsters delivers in full whole cities are demolished over the course of its 130 minutes with boston getting the worst of it its safe to assume that ghidorah is not a red sox fan the effects live up to expectations and the designers have imbued each creature with distinct personalities that come through clearer than those of some of the human characters for better or worse king of the monsters does setup some tantalizing details for future installments some of which are callbacks to classic cheesy elements of the toho films pay close attention during the closing credits  it doesnt come as close to transcending the genre as the previous entry did and its doubtful next years godzilla vs kong crossover will either but theres enough here to keep kaiju fans hooked for at least one more outing
Aug 8 2019,neutral,nevertheless i mostly enjoyed myself though this installment definitely lacks for personality
Aug 5 2019,positive, previous director gareth edwards has been replaced by michael dougherty best known for his horror efforts like the halloween anthology film trick r treat and the christmas movie krampus with an allstar cast of acclaimed thespians rising talents and franchise returnees and free reign to utilize other monsters in the franchise will the film be as fun as the premise promises there really feels no need for a synopsis with a film such like this especially since the marketing materials make it clear were only here for the monsters and those monsters certainly make their presence felt and the film crew do their darnedest to make their action scenes as vast and impactful as possible especially in terms of scale that said the simplistic story is a fitting continuation from the 2014 film following on from the disastrous events in san francisco although the film fulfills its promise to show monsters duking it out the story is still quite effective thanks to the inclusion of an interesting moral dilemma that both pays tribute to the social commentary of the classic films and offers food for thought without sharing any spoilers godzilla king of the monsters leaves humanity questioning whether the monsters are a positive or negative step in the natural order and this compliments the characters quite well making their questionable though honourable motivations convincing and even empathetic action scenes take place in varied settings ranging from antarctica to cities like boston and islands like mexicos isla de mara all captured vividly from both human and monster perspective by cinematographer lawrence sher editors roger barton richard pearson and bob duscay manage to shift perspectives between action scenes briskly and the grand musical score from bear mccreary whose prior work included cult monster dramedy colossal compliments the film beautifully as mccreary adapts original composer akira ifukubes score and brings his own touch to proceedings using both to great effect the monsters are coded with a certain colour hinting at their allegiances and plenty of respect is paid to their original appearances their movements bring to mind actual animal behaviour which lends them a stronger and more believable presence such as how king ghidorah attacks in a manner of a king cobra godzilla king of the monsters is led by a topnotch cast whom all bring credibility and approachable presences that makes it easy for us to sympathize with kyle chandler brings his saltoftheearth average joe charisma to the character of dr mark russell vera farmiga is convincingly conflicted and forceful as dr emma russell and millie bobby brown does well as the moral center bringing tenacity wonder and initiative to the character of madison russell the supporting characters are all colourful and add to the fun bradley whitford thomas middleditch and oshea jackson jr all amuse in their parts while charles dance aisha hinds and zhang ziyi lend authoritative presence to their roles franchise returnees including sally hawkins david strathairn and ken watanabe are given more to do particularly watanabe and really make the most out of their parts no one in the cast act like they are above the material and look like they are actually having fun which makes a positively huge difference also adding to the fun experience are the numerous callbacks to the franchise it is quite clear that director dougherty and cowriters max borenstein and zach shields are big fans of godzilla peppering many witty references throughout the film including a certain plot device from the 1954 original film a callback to certain characters relating to the origin of mothra and a clever role reversal that calls to mind a major moment in the 1954 film it is moments like these that franchise devotees will truly appreciate overall godzilla king of the monsters is an incredibly fun continuation of the franchise and one that respects and honours its roots thanks to solid direction and a committed ensemble cast the film provides the extravagant action that franchise devotees will salivate for while providing a story that brings forth an interesting moral dilemma that calls to mind the environmental messages of prior installments
Jul 12 2019,negative,  godzilla films are rarely balanced affairs between their kaiju stars and human counterparts the vast majority of big g movies excluding the original 1954 entry 2016s shin godzilla and maybe a couple of others have scant amounts of monster action in between long stretches of inane human drama populated by characters that no one really cares about the human element is a necessary one for these giant monster stories for scale purposesit lets audiences know how big and powerful the creatures are while also putting some semblance of emotional faces and weights to the destruction being caused throughout the godzilla films there have been attempts to make the human components at least as close as interesting as the kaiju brawls this leads to intrigue with spies and assassins space aliens that look like planet of the apes castaways terrible matrix ripoffs and a bunch of labyrinthine plots that are so far removed from making sense that the light from making sense wont hit them for another seven years or there are attempts to make the human element compelling through drama  godzilla vs biollantes ghost daughter plot for example or all of that terrible schtick from 1998s godzilla  but they rarely work the human element in godzilla films remains a formula to which most filmmakers dont have a solution godzilla king of monsters doubles down on that by not only giving the people a lot more screen time but trying out melodrama and action as a means to make the films bloated run time interesting as well it doesnt work and its only one problem with the film in a sea of many issues following 2014s godzilla the world is now fully aware of these titans that exist on this planet godzilla hasnt been seen in five years while the government debates between ordering the military to wipe out all of the titans or continuing to let the monarch organization headed by ken watanabe sally hawkins and thomas middleditch continue to monitor and study the colossal beasts with this backdrop monarch scientist dr emma russell vera farmiga has just created a means of communicating with the titans by issuing specific noises that imitate predators friends etc when she and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are abducted by ecoterrorist jonah allen charles dance estranged husbandfather mark russell kyle chandler is brought in with monarch to find her and not let the communication device be used to manipulate other titans across the globe calamity ensues 2014s godzilla is a flawed movie whether its the wasted use of elizabeth olsen in a meaningless storyline or drab aaron taylorjohnson appearing at every meaningful moment in the story like a kaiju version of band of brothers or how long it takes to introduce godzilla into a movie with his own name on it  issues abound with it however to its credit there is very little unnecessary melodrama when the monsters arent around and the action is usually caused by or a symptom of the carnage the giant creatures are causing and when godzilla does show up its for a savage fight that feels choreographed but brutal and all of it is beautifully captured on frame godzilla king of monsters as directed by michael dougherty krampus trick r treat from a script by dougherty along with zach shields krampus doesnt have those positives not only is the human story so invasive and poorly done but it is also badly captured in an incredibly inept way for the first five scenes that mark is introduced there are constant shots of pictures with him and his daughter or it cuts to his face when his wife and daughter are mentioned to underscore that this man is related to these people  a fact that has actually already been established previously in the movie thanks to yes more photos and then mark shows up and becomes captain amazing for the rest of the movie  he knows strategy better than the military can outflank an armed team of mercenaries better than soldiers knows the science in all sorts of specialties better than everyone else in the room and constantly has the crazy idea that just might work that every qualified leader is only too happy to listen to and obey if internet fanboys were honest in looking for unearned abilities and sudden talents outshining the rest of the cast in their fictional characters mark russell in godzilla king of monsters is an incredible example the plot keeps trying to be action packed for the humans and also full of melodrama involving betrayals and the russell familys issues and it just doesnt work if the filmmakers leaned into it more elevated it to camp with all sorts of nonsense and mustachetwirling villainy  while cutting the screen time way downthen maybe this could have been something so that just leaves the monsters  or the reason people are coming to this movie sorry david straitharn stans they are okay every godzilla entrance is badass and fun and makes viewers feel excited about whats about to happen hes shown off early in the film and there are more scenes of him and the other kaiju than 2014s movie but there is just so much more time devoted to the awful human plot that it becomes a moving ratio there are some great moments in the fighting and cool elements that deliver on promises of imagining what a godzilla vs king ghidorah fight would look like in the 21st century unfortunately there is also a lot of awkward shots and cutting away it is the only time in any godzilla movie except maybe 1998 where i couldnt figure out the geography of the action buildings would suddenly pop up to be destroyed but then it would look like a leveled city again and it was hard to figure out exactly where each creature was at points godzilla king of the monsters isnt without its charms of course the titular monster as i said looks great and has real personality  its just a shame hes not used as much as people would like charles dance is very catty as the ecoterrorist unleashing apocalypse which makes his scenes very fun middleditch watanabe and ziyi zhang are good in their roles and effectively sell their thin characters bear mccrearys score is a great adaptation and update of classic themes from past toho films but with newly added percussion and choruses that make it very engaging and pulsepounding the fx are fairly well done when the poor editing and action cinematography isnt getting in the way its a hard problem to solve the humangodzilla balance maybe humans arent needed maybe we as a people have seen enough disasters natural and manmade in just the past two decades to get the suffering and grief and empathy we should be feeling or maybe filmmakers need to figure out what type of movie they are telling with their giant lizard monster in a central location and build the tone around that is it a sober warning about climate change or impending wars is it a popcorn bit of entertainment with brawling titans godzilla king of the monsters never knows and tries throwing all sorts of deadend plot threads and ineffective emotional beats at the audience onto godzilla vs kong next i guess good luck adam wingard our nerddom turns its geeky eyes to you sign up for our 100 free daily grindhouse

Jul 10 2019,negative, you can tell a lot about a country by the way it writes about godzilla godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb explained the original films producer tomoyuki tanaka he is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul meanwhile gareth edwards lauded and commercially successful godzilla in 2014 was critiqued for a lack of nuance when it came to the atomic age rather than offering caution about nuclear energy summised godzilla expert ed godziszewski the new film almost gives you the idea that nuclear weapons are actually the answer to everything if the wests last godzilla outing seemed to have an intriguing take on warheads then king of the monsters feels like it almost lusts for nuclear conflict it is astonishing to see a movie series that was once focused on assessing nuclear technologys vices now suggesting that nuclear holocausts are necessary and beautiful and  more times than is safe to count  relying on atomic weapons to save the day this might sound very confusing and you are correct to think that the thing about king of the monsters is it makes absolutely no sense not in a fun campy way either i could chart every scene of the movie for you but why any of them happen is absolutely beyond me crucial character work happens off stage all the time charles dance in a atrocity of a role reveals in passing that he has been working with vera farmiga who up until this point we thought was his hostage and this is not lingered on or explored this is i cannot stress enough one of the most crucial pieces of information in the whole movie another character dies in such a turgid fight sequence that it took me 20 minutes to realise she wasnt just off screen nobody even mourns her passing this is because in king of the monsters  part of a series literally built on exploring the consequences of human powerlust through the heightened lens of science fiction  there are absolutely no consequences to anything it pays lip service to the idea of consequence the way all epic cinema does in the postavengers age it suggests all extras in its decimated townscapes are evacuated though never really lingers on how but we are never left with any idea of the damage being done by the monsters that roam throughout this movie we do not see if the few civilians given screen time are saved or killed or what impact battles have on those who survive yet its a movie based on characters who made it through the conflict of the first film but even their ptsd is unclear do they love godzilla fear him hate him everyone seems to just change their opinion on him depending on what the movie requires there are moments when the film almost dares to pause and think not many mind  at one point ken watanabe says theres no time for debate which is actually the one time in the film i would have killed for one  but sometimes it manages to take a moment to provide us with a slow moment of terribly written dialogue in one ziyi zhang  in a welcome return to western blockbusters because she knows how to present the spectacular with poise  explains to kyle chandlers dr mark russell that slaying dragons is a western concept while in the east they are seen as messianic this concept is not really expanded on much or it is i suppose but not by her character and not in any sort of order other characters praise godzilla and the monsters as ways of saving humanity but who says it again just depends on who is needed to say it rather than who has any reason to think it every character has something akin to motives and every character does things these two factors however rarely come together to affect each other on the note of ziyi zhang at one point in the movie she appears in a completely different location intrigued by mothra and then in the next scene she is back with the main cast it turns out according to wikipedia that this is because she is playing twins this twin literally only appears in this one tiny vignette doesnt say any lines and could honestly be the same character when did it fall back to imdb to explain plot points to me its also a movie that falls back on so many lazy lazy tropes it staggers me this is godzilla  the ultimate trope  its allowed to fall back on the archetype it comes from but wider cinematic clichés for example this character died off screen so are they really dead or this character says im coming which everyone believes but actually theyre sacrificing themselves are so bored so overused that they dont feel like homage but fromage all of this adds to a movie that seems to like godzilla and the other monsters simply because theyre just cool to look at this is fair the cgi is great most of the time ghidorah is tough to watch in a postdrogon world but it defeats the point of a movie about nuclear weapons a film in which the drive is to see all these allegories for thermonuclear devices is aesthetically staggering but it doesnt entirely match up to the truth and the power of the cold war as a storytelling device which is nobody actually wants to see them the greatest threat is just knowing theyre latent gareth edwards got that this film absolutely doesnt godzilla 2014 was a huge turning point for the franchise japan even went back to it leaving behind the kaiju traditions of men dressed in lizard suits to bring in some cgi they got the exceptional hideki anno  a man whose opus neon genesis evangelion practically gets off on the true depths of human trauma  to direct and write its a movie that overwhelms that is filled with banality that presents godzilla as a diplomatic and bureaucratic nightmare as much as a deity it is also fascinated to go into the wider implications of every part of its mythos down to exactly how dangerous the half life of his atomic breath might be its not a perfect film but it got a lot of love for the right reasons it told a compact story well godzilla king of the monsters tells a big story very very poorly by the third act i did not care who lived or died in part because i no longer really knew who lived or died it has a diverse and wideranging cast but it is not charming or particularly representative theres a short haired woman of colour who i think shes a pilot shes trotted out the same way my overwhelmingly white secondary school kept putting my one black friend on every prospectus cover to suggest that her being there is as relevant as giving her something to do this kind of surface level inclusion means the film is more interested in ticking boxes than in giving life to the ensemble it gathers together meaning i just dont care about their personal stakes then again neither does the script in the third act the cast of burgeoning famous actors are all sent on separate missions which have no real reasoning behind them and which just happen on rails as if to give everyone a little bit of screen time theres one moment where a mission in a submarine aims to shoot nuclear missiles at godzilla underwater i just i cant and then this is scuppered by a vaguely familiar background actor saying sorry but the missile launching facilities were destroyed in the crash or something similar what is the crash i couldnt tell you because this is a movie of collision after collision the characters decisions from that point on then are not the product of a logical sequence of decisions that impact on each other but caused by completely inexplicable external parties forcing characters this way or that this is the films constant way of suggesting characters act the way they do they have no choice people tell us no medea had no choice hedda gabler had no choice these people never present or explore the many avenues they can no longer go down to get to no choice it is almost impossible to pick apart all the reasons i found to loathe godzilla king of the monsters without sitting you down to watch it and pausing every five minutes to decode but that would involve us buying tickets for a movie that should be killed off faster than most nuclear programs and this is part of a cinematic universe a universe one that they will not stop reminding you of all film so many references to king kong just so they can weave these two beasts together for another dreary cash cow in 2020 the constant reminders that this isnt the end made me wish i was about to be wiped out like something out of the bbcs threads we have seen grandeur enough times on the big screen now to know it can be clear intelligent and as driven by characters as it is by plot everything from the incredibles to captain america civil war to game of thrones proves in its own way these can be done godzilla king of the monsters wants to cash in on these successes but puts in none of the work avoid it like a nuclear bomb site this is the sort of film thatll make you think cinema is dead
Jul 8 2019,positive,this is a film that fixes some of the previously problems in this universe but it also makes some new mistakes but i was never bored and it absolutely delivers the action mayhem and destruction you want from the genre
Jul 3 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters doesnt hold back on the big monster fights and its definitely the best godzilla film to date from hollywood
Jul 3 2019,negative, for a film series that has long since outstayed its welcome the latest in the very first superhero saga  xmen dark phoenix dir simon kinberg rated m  seems to be in an awful hurry to wrap things up the culmination and likely finale of the film series that began long ago with xmen in 2000 and has seen actors and storylines come and go with the occasional timetravel retcon here and there is a zippy little thing that nevertheless seems bursting at the seams and sagging with the weight of a series that just cant seem to end already returning to ground covered in the muchmaligned xmen the last stand this film follows the xmen as they face one of their own jean grey sophie turner who does well to hold the whole thing together in a cast of sleepwalkers when exposure to cosmic rays gives her immense uncontrollable powers one gets the impression from dark phoenix that the filmmakers are trying to make up for the sins of that previous film but this one commits too many of its own in trying to play it safe to fare any better packed with actors who seem desperate to simply run out their contracts particularly jennifer lawrence as mystique and evan peters as quicksilver whose brief appearances here may as well have featured them picking up their paychecks the action itself is at least solidly entertaining and occasionally even thrilling indeed there are moments of inspired genre filmmaking that occasionally elevate the whole operation boosted by a reliably bombastic hans zimmer score the inclusion of a nonsensical and unnecessary alien subplot slows things down enormously and there is little in the way of catharsis or a sense of an ending here  if it is to be the end of this iteration of professor x magneto cyclops and the like theyve gone out less with a bang than a whimper rating twoandahalf stars the problem with the fledgling megamonsters series that began with 2014s godzilla followed by kong skull island and now the woebegone godzilla ii king of the monsters dir michael dougherty rated m has never been the monsters themselves the series has always had the ability to deliver agreeably epic visuals of titanic monsters ripping into each other in giant tableaus like something out of a bosch painting no the problem with this series has always been the characters running around the monsters  the human element that somehow takes up so much of the filmmakers concern and yet remains so very boring godzilla ii picks up sometime after the first appearance of everyones favourite rotund superlizard and largely follows an estranged family kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobby brown as the actions of an ecoterrorist cell revive a coterie of longdormant giant monsters hiding beneath the earth globetrotting without feeling like it gets anywhere packed with quips without being funny and featuring muddy messy action devoid of excitement godzilla ii is a mostly pointless inbetween instalment before the inevitable king konggodzilla showdown to come rating two stars
Jul 3 2019,positive,maybe its time to include godzilla in the discussion of our richest cinematic franchises
Jun 27 2019,negative, its really hard to tell what kind of movie godzilla king of the monsters wants to be the predecessor to this garish nonsensical monster mash 2014s godzilla was a moody take on the famous kaiju sparing in its depiction of scaly flesh while some  including yours truly  found it dull it also amassed a vocal critical fanbase the followup seems to nod halfheartedly to artistry but its more interested in the brainless crashbang of a bunch of cgi creatures duking it out the cast is stacked with otherwise brilliant actors stuck in a borderline incomprehensible plot and forced to play second fiddle to monsters whose powers of wonder wear off fast this is franchise filmmaking at its most unnecessary a last gasp to salvage a series that seems to have little chance at survival because yes this is supposed to be part of a bigger monsterverse all leading up to a showdown between godzilla and king kong the latter of whom was featured in 2017s kong skull island those two dont go at it in king of the monsters directed by michael dougherty though there are some offhand mentions of the large ape instead this installment features some more wheelspinning and tedious exposition involving monarch the monster research organization thats this franchises version of marvels shield king of monsters focuses primarily on the russells a family that was caught in the rampage that made up the finale of gareth edwards earlier movie in which godzilla battled some mutos and saved san francisco but created a big mess in the process the stomping beasts killed mark and emma russells son and in their grief the couple split she vera farmiga went to live on a monarch research base with their daughter madison stranger things millie bobby brown emma has been building a sonic device that can control and subdue the monsters called titans meanwhile mark kyle chandler has dedicated his life to photographing wolves hes eventually brought back into the fold when emma and madison are kidnapped by ecoterrorists led by a scowling leader named jonah alan played by tywin lannister aka charles dance except  in a headacheinducing twist  that was part of emmas plan shes teaming with jonah against monarch because she misguidedly thinks she can save the planet by letting the titans roam free thinning humanity and its pollution like thanos before her emmas ostensibly noble intentions cause a litany of issues issues when it turns out that one of the ancient giants that monarch has been monitoring the threeheaded king ghidorah is especially cruel and powerful and not willing to submit to godzillas more benevolent impulses if this sounds needlessly confusing well it gets worse when you factor in that the script seems cobbled together from various unfinished drafts it casually drops references to characters and scenarios in a way that assumes the audience has a bigger investment in the narrative the film ever earns perhaps the most baffling moment is when its revealed with little to no explanation that ziyi zhang plays identical scientists on different sides of the world who may or may not be twins speaking of the cast its filled to the brim with otherwise excellent performers most of them either slogging their way through perfunctory technical dialogue or taking the whole mishegoss way too seriously the only one who seems to know what movie hes in bradley whitford who at least thinks all the nonsense is funny at times dougherty manages to create some arresting images of wings emerging from clouds theres a big brawl that ends in boston of all places  a dunkin sign tragically falls in the fight godzilla remains king mothras the queen and there are a few human casualties its not a conclusion that elicits many further questions but that doesnt mean the studio has skimped on the frustratingly obligatory postcredits scene in the tag dances jonah sets out to purchase one of the ghidorahs heads implying that it may return for the next round when presumably kong will get involved like it or not there will be another film in the godzilla universe but at that point  if youve even made it through the credits  youll probably have the same reaction i did who cares king of the monsters does nothing to prove that the monsterverse should continue when you cant get a crowd excited for kaiju fighting one another whats the point sign up here for our daily thrillist email get streamail for more entertainment and subscribe here for our youtube channel to get your fix of the best in fooddrinkfun
Jun 27 2019,neutral,its not very pleasant to look at it invests way too much in the character arcs of its blank cast and it still does the thing the 2014 film got dinged for
Jun 25 2019,positive,maintains the sagas general good standard which is forgotten with the same ease with which it is enjoyed full review in spanish
Jun 21 2019,positive,sometimes you have to be honest about the movie you really are  smashy smash if you can reconcile that then its not so awful
Jun 18 2019,positive, lets get this out of the way first in a movie that includes a triheaded dragon and a nakatomi plazasized spider mark kyle chandler is easily the most grotesque monstrosity this dude is introduced to us while hes shooting broll wolf footage for a knockoff planet earth yet somehow within minutes hes bossing around the entire global military on armageddon eve mothra vomits sticky webs but marks mansplaining is the vilest thing to come out of any mouth in the entirety of godzilla king of the monsters which is otherwise a damn good monsterstravaganza ever see what youre convinced is a terrifying murderer in your home only to realize that its nothing more than an article of recklessly discarded clothing disguised by poor lighting thats what screenwriter zach shields and writerdirector michael dougherty have done with the plot here wisely there isnt one oh sure it looks like theres a plot there just isnt bad ecoterrorists reawaken longdormant monsters hiding around the world to restore balance to the planet godzilla fights those monsters while being alternatingly helped and hindered by humans and mothra colorreflectionscom  thats not a plot thats nothing more than setup for longoverdue glorious kaiju fetishization hooray when it comes to intricately detailed toys imagination should ideally spark just as vibrantly when posing them as when smashing them into one another dougherty and company get that they spend significant time having rodan king ghidorah mothra and the titular gman preen and flex in atmospheric lighting it is somehow both beautiful and blissfully cheesy the creature design for ghidorah resembles early harryhausen stopmotion designs mothra is somehow equally endearing and terrifying rodan murders planes like hes being controlled by a malevolent giant invisible toddler godzilla has an atomic seizure admittedly they only fight each other a few times but the film never strays its gaze too far from them remember you can only blow your action figures up with firecrackers once a legion of typically insightful detractors have somehow surprisingly blasted godzilla king of the monsters for leaning too hard into the humans and away from the creatures maybe it felt that way to some but its literally just untrue the film doesnt go 10 consecutive minutesmost often less than 5without a monster on screen from the opening sequence to the final frames it is chockablock with kaiju juju the job of the humans is to give the camera a ride to the next monster sequence in its understandable obsession to prioritize the monster squad godzilla king of the monsters admittedly fails to synthesize a thesis worthy of the franchise its entirely possible that the american psyche simply does not easily permit the kind of condemnations of hubris and militarization that are trademarks of the best works in the series likewise making villains out of those who legitimately fear for the planets extinction may be a misguided narrative tactic at a moment when the united states is ghosting the global movement against the climate crisis however what dougherty and company have done here is fairly stunning not since the original jurassic park have massive cgi creatures felt this majestic and menacing long after memories of marks whining and interrupting have faded the sound of godzilla firing up his electrical barf will remain please note if one annoying character is able to ruin everything for you youre going to have a very exhausting road to november 2020
Jun 17 2019,neutral, since franchises and universes are the rage in hollywood this is legendary entertainments attempt to get in on the action  godzilla ii king of the monsters marks the third film in the series following on from two reboots godzilla 2014 and kong skull island 2017  if youre wondering where it goes next prepare yourself for godzilla vs kong which is slated for release in march 2020 as for this film it picks things up about 5 years after the original  the world now knows that monsters are real and the political fallout has been huge  thats particularly evident within a governmentrun organisation known as monarch  it was originally established to locate and destroy monsters to ensure mankind remains the dominant species  theres now a differing view held by some within monarch that the monsters or most of them are friendly and to kill them would disrupt the worlds natural order it turns out there are roughly 17 monsters on the planet including godzilla and a team of scientists have been studying their genetic composition  it may sound ridiculously dangerous but the monsters are in a hibernating state  a catalyst is required to create drama and it comes in the form of an ecoterrorist dance with confusing motives  on one hand he wants to make money by trading monster dna but that seems counterproductive considering he wants to kill most living things on the planet in the same vein as the 2014 film id argue that the human characters in this movie have the charisma of a wet sponge  theyre a dull boring group of people who between them magically have the answer for every problem  its part of the reason why theres so little tension in the movie  these characters should have died countless times but help andor good fortune always arrives at the last possible moment  the only actor worthy of a mention is bradley whitford the west wing who adds a splash of comedy to break up the tedium its the monsters who should have provided all the excitement but writerdirector michael dougherty struggles to creating something meaningful amongst the chaos  we can see a myriad of monsters duking it out the threeheaded dragon looked cool but its largely the same stuff from scenetoscene  i wish id kept count of how many buildings were destroyed  im sure there were humans in them but its best not to think about that
Jun 15 2019,negative, of the nine films currently showing in local cinemas six of them are either giant studioremakes or sequels its typical of the last few months where trips to the cinemas may have triggered feelings of déjà vu with some equation of superherosequel or disney sequelremake or monster remake commanding the majority of screens this week two continuing releases continue to thrive at the local boxoffice dark phoenix the seventh film in foxs main xmen series is in its second week of release against godzilla king of the monsters a quasisequel to the 2014 godzilla which is part of another newly extended universe that will see godzilla battling with king kong in the near future in 2014 director gareth edwards sombre godzilla was antithetical to the immediate spectacle of the franchise as it opted instead for a muted aesthetic it worked to good effect for me despite the criticisms of too little time with the titular monster michael doughertys direction in king of the monsters seems intent on coursecorrecting this sombre predecessor and not for the better this new film picks up five years after the first in a world where godzilla and titans like him are known and studied the mostly new cast of characters are dealing with the fallout and ramifications of living alongside these ancient monsters whose powers have been reignited and exacerbated by human interference its a thoughtful if familiar sciencefiction plotpoint  human folly precipitating apocalypse and in its way its a hook that announces king of the monsters as vaguely conscious of the role of humanity in a world of fantasy humanity as both destroyers and saviours of the world except despite this marginally thoughtful hook plot and ideas are negligible in king of the monsters the film ostensibly surrounds paleobioligist emma russell whose research and skill has been able to lead to the construction of a device that communicates with the titans although the film nods to a plot in dr russell having lost a child in the battle that ended the 2014 film king of the monsters is all about the monsters we meet our first titan ten minutes into the film and it keeps launching news ones at us until the final battle sequence that sees godzilla in a gargantuan face off with ghidorah an alien monster  that final battle is a brawl that gives you all the highenergy thrills you could want from such a thing it offers exactly the promised cgicentred spectacle one expects from the franchise but the deployment of the battle also feels perfunctory and oddly dull in ways that represent king of the monsters strange inability to sustain tension over the course of its runtime  this issue is exacerbated when the human story takes over with the majority of characters teetering between rote existences and preening tedium their incapacity to ground the large amounts of the film when they are the focus kills the momentum but it is also doesnt help that the consistent focus on the monsters makes the final battle lose some of the thrill of discovery since weve already seen them do so much by the time we reach the wouldbe climactic end we feel exhausted and just want it to be over within the films unsatisfying trajectory the real titan is vera farmiga who harnesses her acting prowess to superheroic heights in the role of dr russell to force some sort of emotional resonance and sense into this thing her final lines in the film make a valiant attempt to make this all worth it she does not succeed but her attempts are valiant and compelling enough to make the film around her more credible luckily dark phoenix fares better even if critical response has been unkind in this final film of the xmen series jean grey earns her own film as she must deal with her growing powers after a space mission goes awry at first dark phoenix seems like it may be biting off more than it can chew the films opening which perhaps inadvertently mimics the opening of the enjoyable shazam from earlier this year gave me pause it has to work as a story of jean grey while functioning as an xmen film and that seems like a whole lot for a film like this to cover and the opening scenes struggle a bit at building the world  jean greys ambivalence the teams ennui and professor xaviers pride at making mutants accepted tipping over into carelessness but by the time the film creates its first crisis  a solar flare envelopes grey making her inexplicably stronger  things get better dark phoenix is able to satisfy both sides of desire it is compelling as an examination of that familiar superheroic ambivalence weve seen a lot of lately but also thoughtful in its examination of the isolation of being a hero and the value of found families and yes the value of love certainly the central thesis here is overly familiar we know this story and in this way dark phoenix is not doing something particularly new for superhero stories or stories of families the expectation for the series to end on something explicitly unique may make what it is doing seem banal what it is doing is crafting a narrative that depends emphatically on emotion and sensitivity thats buoyed by spectacles that complement its story the film is aided by a stunning sound design that cultivates the sounds of fury and rage with stunning effect sophie turner of game of thrones fame is in some ways riffing on her familiar performance as sansa stark there is much of sansa stark in greys own emotional journey and even as the protagonist jean is not the most dynamic player in her story but its that earnest sincerity that dark phoenix has going for it the film may seem to tremble at the umpteenth scene of xavier extolling the allconquering power of love to his team and even though he and director simon kinberg seem to believe that the dark phoenix is nuanced enough to recognise that love is always complicated and sometimes unsatisfying in this way this sort of humble focus may seem muted for the end of a franchise especially in the wake of the way the recent endgame ended with pomp and ceremony jean grey is not necessarily a character one would extract as central to the series and dark phoenix exacerbates that potential issue by pairing her with a villain who is more schematic and illusory than one would hope but its all towards an endresult that privileges the smallscale ragtag camaraderie of the series and these group of characters dark phoenix feels thoughtful and meditative in a way that surprised and left me surprisingly moved when the credits rolled
Jun 15 2019,negative, somehow legendary pictures found a way to totally muck up the greatest godzilla premise ever with godzilla king of the monsters a movie that is all things great and terrible at the same time this movie has some terrific monster battles in it and the special effects are mindbogglingly good godzilla squares off against such legendary foes as multiheaded monster zero and rodan while getting some much needed assistance from the great mothra all of these monsters including the title character are wonders to behold when on screen as for the internet bitching about the movies appearance being dark and murky i think the darkness was fitting made things scarier and didnt diminish the effects but and this is a big but i cannot endorse this movie overall the human stuff in between and during the fighting is dreadful homo sapiens get too much screen time the writing and staging for that screen time is so bad that the film derails every time it goes to military types in a war room the plot has the world in a state of disarray after the 2014 attacks on san francisco and las vegas depicted in the last godzilla movie ok thats kind of cool how do we dust ourselves off and find a way to coexist with the likes of godzilla and big monster moth things after the decimation of the bay area apparently according to writerdirector michael dougherty krampus we deliver inane dialogue real slowlike and inexplicably play with a sonar gadget that supposedly calls out to the monsters in a manner that either chills them out or fires them up that gadget is created by dr emma russell vera farmiga who lost a child in the san francisco attack and is attempting to talk to the monsters with her daughter millie bobby brown while dr russells husband mark kyle chandler is off taking pictures on safari once the gadget thing sends out a call that basically kicks off the monster apocalypse the action goes from nicely staged monster battles featuring beautiful close ups and battered landscapes to a bunch of lost actors sitting around in a situation room observing and commenting bradley whitford basically gets the jake johnsoninjurassic world role that is hes the nerdy guy cracking wise from afar while monsters eat people and military folks scratch their heads while johnson had crack line delivery and some honestly funny moments whitford looks like the victim of a director who said hey bradley say some funny shit about monsters and whitford had nothing brown is ok here but theres not much one can do with material so bad she has the movies dopiest moment when fleeing monster zero as its destroying fenway park godzilla comes up behind her and she turns and posts a calm satisfied smile no paralyzing fear no screaming in terror at being in between two massive charging monsters just one calm movie star smile because godzilla might be her friend or some shit like that give me a break brown has already completed her shots for godzilla vs kong due out next year so shes not escaping this franchise dougherty who messed this movie up had low grade ok horror films krampus trick r treat on his resume the next films director adam wingard is also a director of horror films youre next and the awful blair witch reboot also dougherty who cowrote this messy movie contributes on the next film as well not good signs perhaps legendary should stop putting large blockbusters such as this into the hands of relatively new and mediocre horror film directors they got it right with gareth edwards on godzilla 2014 they blew it with dougherty and i fear for the future if you are uninitiated as i was this movie will come off as a useless blur if you love you some pokémon perhaps you wont hate it
Jun 15 2019,neutral,it is all one monster mash with humans running around hysterically while spouting lines in no discernible plot how in the world did kyle chandler vera farmiga and millie bobby brown end up in this mess
Jun 14 2019,positive,godzilla king of the monsters has plenty of flaws but it delivers where it counts thanks to stunning creature designs and spectacular fight sequences
Jun 14 2019,negative,somewhat predictably that message has been diluted over the decades  to the point that here the use of nuclear weapons is celebrated as a good thing with nary a hint of subtlety or solemnity about their repercussions
Jun 11 2019,negative,seems not even a giant radioactive reptile can carry a creature feature on his own any more
Jun 10 2019,positive, while not as thematically rich as its predecessor godzilla king of the monsters dials up the kaiju action as it delivers stunning visual action sequences and awe inspiring godzilla moments that will please most fans  godzilla king of the monsters stars kyle chandler as mark russell  vera farmiga as dr emma russell millie bobby brown as madison russell and ken watanabe as dr ishiro serizawa directed by michael dougherty and distributed by warner bros godzilla king of the monsters is the direct sequel to 2014s godzilla and the followup to 2017s kong skull island part of the wider monsterverse godzilla king of the monsters tells the story of the fallout of 2014s godzilla and how characters have changed due to the climactic event how the world reacts to titans and the wider implications of godzillas place on the earth  one of the reasons why 2014s godzilla was praised was gareth edwards commitment to showing godzilla from a human perspective making his presence feel larger than life and only using him a limited amount was effective but left more to be desired from longtime kaiju fans godzilla king of the monsters takes the opposite approach to this instead of focusing on the human element and the interaction between man and godzilla this time the titans have motivations of their own as they battle for control of the earth to either protect it or destroy it while the human characters end up suffering because of this fans of godzilla wont care much as the titans are firmly put in the forefront to the story and the action superseded the plot  the true king of godzilla king of the monsters are the titans themselves godzilla mothra ghidorah and rodan all shine and have stunning moments accompanied with a strong score and almost impeccable vfx work from the icy terrain of the arctic rain soaked battles in boston godzilla king of the monsters lets the titans roam free and in turn provide a stunning backdrop for the titians to do what they do best destruct the chief battle of the film is between the apex predators of godzilla and king ghidorah ghidorah who can command the other titans of earth to destroy while godzilla commands them to save the earth causes a strong sense of tension and drama between these mythic beasts pleasant surprises of the film included mothra whose wonder woman like entrances and moments highlight some of the best moments of the film godzilla king of the monsters is firmly rooted in a larger cinematic world involving these titans the third film in what looks to be a 4 film story godzilla king of the monsters sets up a lot of seeds for the franchises future namely for 2020s godzilla vs kong while it does succeed in planting the threads to which the future films will spin off of one can hope that the future films will keep the human plot threads to an even greater minimum and just let kong and godzilla run the show in the imax spectacle it is meant to be  overall godzilla king of the monsters is a solid summer blockbuster experience in a world where superhero franchises are king and other blockbusters have trouble finding their footing godzilla king of the monsters has the potential to possibly add another player to the battle for king of the blockbusters
Jun 10 2019,positive, godzilla king of the monsters will satisfy those  looking for a giantsized monster bash yet its the human element that weighs  down this colossal titan from becoming king of the monster movie the relationship between man and beast has always been  vital in the giant monster movie genre one cannot think of king kong without fay wray coming to mind as well the reason is obvious these colossal  creatures  although intimidating and aweinspiring  do not drive a story or give  it any depth they are the superstar player on the champion winning team yet  that team goes nowhere without those role players putting in the grunt work there  is no terror if the stakes  primal emotional human  are not in play for godzilla  king of the monsters those stakes are minimal at best  that is not to say that a good show cannot be presented  directed by michael dougherty krampus this second instalment in  legendary films godzilla reboot franchise is as spectacularly big and loud  as they come a blockbuster in name and size that features our favourite  rampaging titans throwing down with wild abandon setting up a shared universe  with a promise of godzilla v king kong down the road but then the humans start talking yes there is nothing like  the domestic first world problems of an incredibly dysfunctional family to put  a damper on the glory of watching a nuclear fuelled lizard monster take on a  three headed dragon alien giant this human element is like a pesky infection  attacking its host the personification of this is found in the russell family  consisting of shouty angry scientist dad mark kyle chandler quiet yet  manipulative scientist mum emma vera farmiga and emotionally confused  teenage wannabe scientist madison milly bobby brown their squabble is over  an invention that can control the mind and mood of these colossal creatures  battling for dominion of the earth which is in the hands of ecoterrorist  jonah alan charles dance in automatic villain mode rounding out the human  cast is ken wattanabe as kaigu expertgroupie ishiro david strathairn and his cement  faced scowl and a blink and you will miss her sally hawkins  the human drama subplot is not only forgettable but annoying  in its distraction from the real show on offer superduper giant monsters laying  waste to one another and the world it is here that godzilla king of the  monsters is a success doughtery along with the vfx wizards from the moving  picture company among others and an excellent sound team deliver giantsized  action set pieces that will rattlebones and make mouths agap godzilla has never  looked as ferocious and a plethora of iconic monster characters including mothra  and king ghidorah all make an impact both frightful and stunning a shared universe is in place here and there is much potential  for it to be good all is needed is for those pesky humans to sit a few rounds  out and let these titans do what they do 
Jun 9 2019,negative, clarification this godzilla bears little resemblance to the iconic scifi creature called gojira that ishiro honda and his japanese collaborators created in 1954 as a warning against nuclear proliferation after the horrific wwii bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki now a cgi godzilla and a number of other titans emerge from the briny deep as a result of climate change while were causing our own ecological extinction these prehistoric creatures hiding in remote spots around the world might just the earths only hope for restoring balance  whatever that means these sites are guarded by monarch a wellfunded scientific organization testifying before a congressional committee cryptozoologist ishiro serizawa ken watanabe insists that these creatures have existed on earth longer than humans and they are perhaps the rightful rulers of the planet his view is supported by scientist emma russell vera farmiga whose husband mark kyle chandler became an alcoholic after their son was killed during godzillas san francisco rampage retaining custody of their daughter madison millie bobby brown emma has built the orca a sonic device that can lure titans by imitating their audible calls as soon as it effectively awakens larval queen mothra from her cocoon the machine is stolen by sneering ecoterrorists led by jonah alan charles dance who kidnaps emma and maddy coming to his senses leaving a colorado wolf preserve mark is now even more determined to kill godzilla et al relentless chaos reigns as godzilla proves hes a friend to mankind ultimately battling king ghidora a ferocious threeheaded dragon part of an invasive species from beyond our galaxy on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 godzilla king of the monsters stomps in with a fiery fearsome 4  monsterverse franchise fodder heading toward godzillas confrontation with skull islands giant gorilla king kong
Jun 9 2019,positive,  film review  godzilla king of the monsters with kyle chandler vera farmiga millie bobby brown bradley whitford charles dance written by michael dougherty  zach shields directed by michael dougherty rated pg13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction and for some language 131 minutes  there are some interesting ideas and strong actors playing around in godzilla king of the monsters but theyre doomed trying to compete against godzilla just like the kaiju alumni he battles kaiju is the name for the japanese genre of giant monster movies the result is a movie that probably could have been much shorter since were really only there for the special effects dr emma russell vera farmiga is a scientist working on a project dealing with the giant monsters whom she believes are an important part of earths ecosystem at the start of the film she and her daughter madison millie bobby brown of stranger things are kidnapped by a mysterious terrorist group led by jonah allen charles dance the government turns to her exhusband mark kyle chandler who had abandoned the project shes continued to help find her hes more concerned with rescuing his daughter it turns out the terrorists are looking to unleash mothra rodan and the threeheaded king ghidora to lay waste to civilization who can battle such creatures why its godzilla who has appeared in various forms in japanese cinema  many of which have made it to the us although the original gojira 1954 was reedited with added scenes featuring american actors the film plays with environmental issues and family psychodrama and even has some wellknown characters actors in small roles like bradley whitford joe morton cch pounder sally hawkins and david strathairn none of it really matters the thin script ties up most of the loose ends while leaving a few threads for a sequel including the promised showdown with king kong which is teased here as it was at the end of kong skull island 2017 the problem is that the appearance of four giant monsters leaves less time for plot and character development which gave skull its flavor here you just want to sit back and enjoy the monsters there are nods to the earlier films  such as the twins associated with mothra  but its all just marking time until the main event which is godzilla battling king ghidorah at fenway park yes thats right dr russells home base is boston and the device used to lure the monsters is broadcast over the public address system at the stadium using the openair park as a giant transmitting dish some effort went into making fenway look like the real thing but once the monsters start trashing boston it looks more like a generic city than any specific location daniel m kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of filmrelated books his latest novel is father of the bride of frankenstein he is the 2018 recipient of the skylark award given by the new england science fiction association he lives in somerville massachusetts
Jun 8 2019,negative, gareth edwards 2014 godzilla was pretty good it wasnt bad not excellent but better than matthew broderick in the rain it caught some flak for holding back on the titular beast and instead opting for a human story  and killing bryan cranston off pretty quickly too now trick r treat director michael dougherty takes the chair for this follow up in the monsterverse that boasted a stunning marketing campaign and the promise of more monsters the trailers depicted this visually outstanding epic  honestly some of the trailer shots looked like pure paintings  and godzilla king of the monsters rocketed up peoples hype lists also piggybacking off of the success of peer kong skull island unfortunately for zilla fans and for michael dougherty  godzilla kotm is awful its really not good which is a massive shame as i was one of those who was amped for this a lack of godzilla itself is a claim that cannot be levelled at this movie  hes everywhere  shooting that blue flame stuff at anything that gets in his way  and his massive monster friends and foes are along for the ride  king ghidorah a threeheaded dragon beast rodan a flying beast and mothra a giantmoth the beasties themselves look great and unsurprisingly deliver the highlights of the movie with their titanic battles  ghidorah especially was ace  the problem is this time the humans are sidelined completely and become simple plot devices everyone is underdeveloped or stereotyped and to be honest i wasnt bothered if they got chomped or not kyle chandler is the limpest hero committed to screen in a long time vera farmiga had dollar signs in her eyes and millie bobby brown became more annoying as the movie rolled on that facial overacting was something else the company behind it all monarch they track own all the titans and have done since 2014s godzilla now just seem like a collection of austin powers baddies in their lair and are on jurassic worldlevels of uninteresting villains and corporations with all of that i doubt itll come as a surprise to know that the writing throughout is atrocious  to the point where the characters literally spell out what is happening its mindnumbing even for a movie like this one of the soldiers delivered the line what the f is that upon ghidorahs intro and it was probably the best actingdelivery in the movie when the subpar dialogue is mixed with overlylong cgi fights things get very tedious very quickly the majority of the action is just fine but by the end it stretched out for too long and became almost boring whilst the score was good godzilla kotm is a prominent case of style over substance things look great but theres nothing to cling to behind the visuals three movies into this monsterverse and were at an impasse godzilla was decent kong skull island too was decent and this was awful so next up godzilla vs kong in 2020 despite godzilla kotm being a toilet blocker its hard not to get just a wee bit excited at that title however can they balance the human drama with the allout action well see and adam wingard is tasked with the job eek surely it cant be any worse than this massive let down bigger isnt always better and thats absolutely the case with this monstrous disappointment
Jun 8 2019,negative, when it comes to the cinema of the 2010s the 2014 godzilla is the manchurian candidate of my moviegoing experience i know i saw it  i have the review right here in front of me  but damn if i can recall any of the particulars in the immortal words of that esteemed 20th century philosopher curly howard im trying to think but nothing happens yet if i scrunch my brain really hard i vaguely recall aaron taylorjohnson as a particularly boring hero bryan cranston as his grumpy dad and a godzilla whose pot belly suggested he had spent the past few years guzzling kirin ichiban or sapporo draft while lounging on the ocean floor nothing else surfaces beyond that although i do remember it being superior to 1998s terrible godzilla vs ferris bueller in which the oversized lizard was no match for matthew brodericks incessant schtick indeed glancing over my review of the 14 model it appears i mildly enjoyed it but found no compelling reason to see it again i expect to hold a similar reaction to godzilla king of the monsters the latest in the monsterverse christ what a daft name franchise that began with the 2014 godzilla and continued with 2017s kong skull island its fairly engaging in the moment but theres absolutely no reason to ever want to revisit it like all films of this nature the real battle isnt between the monsters duking it out with each other but between the excitement of the creaturefeature scenes and the banality of the copious sequences focusing on the human protagonists it isnt always a losing battle in the 1954 classic gojira the original japanese version not the depoliticized 1956 american edit released as godzilla king of the monsters the segments centering on the humans were charged with the pictures overriding theme of nuclear devastation lending urgency to the plight of a people coping with the aftermath of hiroshima and nagasaki less than 10 years removed from the bombing godzilla would morph from villain to hero in later series installments  heck he would even sire a baby boy named minilla not to be confused with the equally nauseating milli vanilli  but here in gojira the title behemoth is collectively fat man and little boy and his towering presence over tokyo triggers a queasy flashback for the citys citizens with the 2014 godzilla and now godzilla king of the monsters theres an effort to add import to the human sequences by invoking global warming overpopulation and other manmade disasters at every turn but it never sticks the landing as effectively as the nuclear angle in the original largely because the filmmakers spend too much time on personal relationships that arent very compelling in 2014 it was taylorjohnsons soldier and cranstons activist now its kyle chandlers mark russell and vera farmigas emma russell a divorced couple whose marriage was destroyed following the death of their young son during the monsters rampage five years ago mark has gone off grid while emma looks after their daughter madison millie bobby brown even as she works on a device that she hopes will allow humans to control the titans ie godzilla and the planets other ancient gods employed by the monsterwatch outfit monarch emma is kidnapped by ecoterrorist alan jonah charles dance which leads monarch scientists ishiro serizawa and vivienne grahame returning actors ken watanabe and sally hawkins to contact mark in order to fashion a rescue attempt what happens next is a betrayal so ludicrous that when one character yells at the turncoat youre out of your mind they should instead be yelling youre an absolute imbecile since the plan thats put into motion and the reasons behind it is beyond moronic nevertheless this plot pirouette largely triggers the critter skirmishes that involve godzilla and other kaiju such as mothra rodan and the allpowerful king ghidorah ever since my youth when i first caught him in the 1968 allstar creature romp destroy all monsters the threeheaded ghidorah always struck me as the most dynamic of all toho grotesqueries his appearance in godzilla king of the monsters does not disappoint and he remains a terrifying entity the cgi work on display in this picture is particularly robust with all of the marquee monsters rendered in stunning fashion and when they get ready to rumble theres enough bodyslamming headbiting and limbtwisting to satisfy all kaiju groupies and presumably wrestling devotees as well indeed fans of godzilla king of the monsters will praise the picture for its monsteronmonster action and theyll be correct but detractors will condemn it for its human interludes and theyll be equally right a bingo card of clichés would quickly be filled with such soggy lines as we opened pandoras box and theres no way to shut it and it sounds like you admire these monsters and drab characters like a stammering scientist thomas middleditch and a wisecracking scientist bradley whitford add nothing to the proceedings when it focuses on the marquee attractions godzilla king of the monsters roars to life at all other times its merely godzilla with a zzzz

Jun 7 2019,neutral,godzilla itself looked incrediblebut too much humans
Jun 7 2019,negative, making a serious godzilla film must be a difficult task the lumbering nuclearpowered monster works better as an icon and  ironically  in small bites it does not help that while you get a lot more monster action than before the key lesson from five years ago has yet to sink in we do not care about the human drama we want godzilla versus ghidorah not godzilla versus kramer versus kramer aside from poor scripting it also doesnt help that there are too many human characters then there are many dangling plot threads such as zhang ziyi suddenly having a twin only for it to never be mentioned again it is a simple premise where lifelong friends fall out after their first time only to reunite years later when their lives are going in different directions and yet this feels like a fresh take on the genre while the finale is a tad too cheesetinged overall this is warm funny and hits the note every netflix film should strive for why didnt this get a theatrical release
Jun 7 2019,negative, for more than six decades almost every godzilla film has ended pretty much the same way but at least the original japanese efforts conveyed a campy rudimentary charm that made them distinct the latest incarnation of the franchise which began five years ago and continues with godzilla king of the monsters is merely a derivative example of spectacle trumping substance filling the screen with incoherent mayhem while taking itself way too seriously in the story people take a backseat to the massive monsters headed by godzilla who emerged as an ally for humanity in the prior film he fills the same role here thanks to the hubris of a collection of scientists known as monarch an organization tasked with keeping earth safe from titans among them are a paleobiologist vera farmiga and her preteen daughter millie bobby brown whose efforts to spawn a new titan larva named mothra are interrupted by an ecoterrorist charles dance with sinister plans soon afterward ancient predatory beasts are awakened from the ocean floor including the threeheaded firebreathing adversary ghidorah leading to failed military efforts to contain them as the hapless humans flail away by land sea and air with weaponry large and small godzilla emerges as the only hope for restoring peace as youd expect king of the monsters contains some impressive action set pieces and some imaginative creature renderings however like its predecessor this godzilla movie needs a rooting interest either in the resilient humans or in the beasts trying to wreak havoc instead the screenplay by zach shields and director michael dougherty krampus offers little incentive for emotional engagement opting instead to repeatedly flaunt its technical prowess and bigbudget effects  masking its lack of narrative integrity and scientific logic with constant chaos only a few of the actors from the first films multicultural ensemble are back on the payroll here with the understanding that humankinds collective brains and brawn is feeble as the oversized reptiles unleash their obligatory pattern of destruction with the future of the planet in the balance of course theres little creative justification for this followup which hardly advances the godzilla mythology in any meaningful way aside from boxoffice aspirations the intent is to set the stage for the next preplanned franchise tentpole in two years during which our amphibious hero will again prove indestructible
Jun 7 2019,negative,jarringly choppy underdeveloped and relentlessly cliched the material underserves its fine cast of actors and never creates anything terribly meaningful from its titanic lineup of creatures
Jun 7 2019,neutral, five years after godzilla levelled half of san francisco an outpost for the global monstermonitoring outfit monarch is attacked scientist emma russell vera farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are kidnapped along with russells experimental device orca which can communicate and even influence giant monsters once this technology is used to awaken the threeheaded dragon ghidorah it sparks off a rise of multiple titans including the volcanic bird rodan the giant insect mothra and the return of godzilla himself 2014s giant monster remake godzilla finally gets a sequel in writerdirector michael doughertys explosive messy and effectsdriven effort godzilla king of the monsters proving that sometimes more actually is more this faulty and uneven effort does benefit from the increase in named kaiju in terms of upping the action and improving the allround quality of the film it still does not manage to successfully develop a mustsee summer blockbuster but it does at least pick up the pace compared to gareth edwards pedestrian effort the same overall problems do remain however just in a less egregious fashion writing remains the achilles heel with a relatively silly narrative and risible dialogue interspersed between the expected scenes of giant monster mayhem doherty and zach shields script shifts the human focus from a separated family to well okay to another separated family but this time they do come better framed within an ensemble of monarch employees racing to contain a worldwide crisis plotwise the film takes itself much less seriously than its predecessor which is a positive sign but what replaces that dour take is still badly undermotivated and poorly expressed charles dance plays a radical ecoterrorist we know this because other characters say he is and he is given no real opportunity to demonstrate this or suitably reveal his motives other characters are saddled with the most stereotypical of motivations a surprise development at the end of the first act sees one trusted character be revealed as a villain this is a bold move but said character spends the first 30 minutes as an audience viewpoint and as a result the twist jars badly other characters undertake numerous actions to push the plot forward but there is no internal motivation that quite makes sense the result is a terribly messy story that collapses under scrutiny there should be a question asked every time a scene of the human characters is written is this scene more interesting than godzilla punching a giant monster in the face if the answer is no then the scene really should be replaced with a better one  or it needs to step out of the way and let the monster fight take control there are essentially three key scenes of monsters fighting here which feels like more than in the 2014 godzilla  indeed more than several other godzilla films  yet the paucity of strong human scenes still make it feel like are being underserved fans of giant monster movies will not have come to the film for a human story of course dougherty frames his four monster protagonists brilliantly tom woodruffs revised designs for each are exceptionally good and they are captured in atmospheric and dynamic ways from scene to scene the sound design is particularly brilliant returning godzillas own roars to the 1954 japanese original and finding freshened takes on rodan ghidorah and mothra at the same time the films main draws  devastating battles between the titans  are distinctive and inventive dougherty has been given an almost unfair task in taking the deliberately fantastical and ridiculous set of monster characters and giving them a sense of realism and weight i am a particularly keen fan of mothra and had doubted any directors ability to faithfully reconcile the more serious tone of american cinema with a rainbowcoloured giant moth but dougherty marvellously succeeds the same goes with ghidorah a threeheaded gold alien dragon that has never seemed so terrifying they are shot from dynamic powerful angles and they have a palpable weight and power to them here is the ultimate problem though and it addresses not only the bad screenplay but also the films commercially disappointing performance in cinemas all three american attempts to develop a godzilla feature 1998 2014 and 2019 have suffered from being mainstream tentpole releases godzilla is iconic but the characters actual films are comparatively niche they do boast a healthy dedicated audience of fans in japan but they have never been what hollywood professionals describe as fourquadrant hits  films appealing to men and women both young and old godzilla final wars 2004 was only the 44th highest grossing film of its year in japan shin godzilla 2016 fared much better only topped by the anime your name and grossing us75 million in japanese cinemas but it was also the first homegrown godzilla picture in 12 years and brought a resonant element of social satire with it conversely the american godzilla films are bankrolled to the equivalent of star wars and the avengers they are structured and financed as fourquadrant blockbusters yet broadly retain the same style and narrative conventions of their japanese cousins they are being advertised as big screen epics without epic storylines put simply warner bros is spending too much money budgeted at 60 million and the story quirks and weak characters would not stand out so visibly budgeted at three times that and the studio is simply setting itself up for failure godzilla king of the monsters is definitely a disappointing film but it is not about what was delivered which is simply a particularly pretty replica of a japanese equivalent but what the studio continues to promise what is needed here is not reproduction but rather reinvention an americantargeted godzilla film rebuilt from the ground up we tried that already it did not go well in fact it went so poorly toho bought the rights to it just so they could have godzilla absolutely trash it in final wars
Jun 6 2019,positive,the actual battles are highly satisfactory even if no one gets to shout destroy all monsters
Jun 6 2019,positive, 2014s godzilla was a bit of a mess it was often grainy and unintelligible to watch and with the exception of a couple of notable supporting actors ken watanabe sally hawkins and juliette binoche it had a largely unexciting cast that never really captured audiences it also somewhat shockingly had surprisingly little actual godzilla in it  by most estimates there were no more than nine minutes of the monster shown in the entire 123minute runtime its a film i enjoyed watching because its a godzilla movie though not necessarily because its a good movie since then weve had a rousing exciting king kong movie in kong skull island that seemed to promise a broader more monsterheavy future for the franchise now in the hands of legendary pictures and titled the monsterverse it took a little bit but now theyre back with godzilla king of the monsters and theyve clearly taken some of those criticisms to heart the new film despite being a good deal more apocalyptic than its predecessor is also a good bit more fun this is no surprise considering that director and cowriter michael dougherty cut his teeth with the sublime trick r treat and it made the film significantly more enjoyable but theres also a feeling of desperation to the production as if they wanted to overload on everything to try to compensate for the weaknesses of its predecessors unlikable leads weve got that covered we brought in everyone  kyle chandler vera farmiga bradley whitford millie bobby brown tywin lannister thomas middleditch oshea jackson jr zhang ziyi aisha hinds in addition to the returning watanabe hawkins and david strathairn the film is packed with characters and given its nonstop action this has the unfortunate side effect of the audience never really getting to know any of them yes you learn about the family dynamic between divorced scientists mark and emma russell chandler and farmiga and their daughter maddie brown who is terrific here but everyone else is essentially defined by a few lines of clever dialogue which is a shame when you have that strong a set of actors to play with thats not to knock the action which is constant and almost exhausting but it does almost feel like overcorrection there was a certain degree of nuance to the first film a more contemplative style that was wellused by its director gareth edwards monsters rogue one this one hell no its a cacophonous horse race from the getgo and at 132 minutes that sometimes feels like a longass race the plot is a wild one featuring the reappearance of the shadowy monsterseeking organization monarch government interference murderous ecoterrorists weird technology that relies on bioaccoustics and everything else inbetween the long and short of it is that the various titans of the world have been long dormant but are either waking up or being woken up these monsters respond to an alpha and the problem that humanity faces is which alpha will they follow  the benevolentifterrifying godzilla or the malevolent more terrifying ghidorah a threeheaded twotailed behemoth that seems determined to reduce the world to ashes what follows is a series of harrowing scenes of devastation as the monsters rampage across the world and trash everything in their path entire cities are laid to waste while the agents of monarch try desperately to figure out how to stop them leading them to inevitably try to team up with godzilla theres a lot happening storywise and unfortunately a good bit of it is either superfluous or needlessly complex theres a maguffin of a suitcase that holds the key to everything and its chased around the globe alongside the monsters themselves but despite all this chaos and mayhem king of the monsters manages to be surprisingly fun kudos to whitford middleditch and jackson for keeping things occasionally light a nice compliment to the relentless and often overwrought seriousness that chandler brings to the table  they make things fun even if you never really get to know them but more importantly the film feels like more of a loving throwback to the toho classics than the first film as if a bit more of that spirit was present if it sounds contradictory  this juxtaposition of global apocalypse with enjoyable romp  it is and it is at times difficult to reconcile the fact is that over the course of the film literal millions probably die and its hard to think of that as fun but at the same time its also  giant monsters like giant monsters and theyre beautifully rendered and animated with stunning sounds and fluid movements engaged in wellchoreographed battles that feel real the film is absolutely gorgeous using far more color this time around and not filmed exclusively on rainy nights and all of this keeps it engaging and at times even enthralling yet at the end i feel i must repeat  sort of  what i said earlier about the first film i think theres joy to be found in godzilla king of the monsters because its a very good godzilla film and definitely superior to the 2014 film yet im not certain how much love it will garner for those who arent fans of the big greenie its exciting and theres a strange loveliness to be found amidst all the bedlam that these monsters wreak but it also feels quite bleak at times and itll be up to the individual viewer to reconcile those things those of you who grew up with creature double features who yearn to see these new incarnations of godzilla mothra ghidora and their ilk back on the screen i think youll be pleasantly surprised 
Jun 6 2019,positive, five years after godzilla defeated the mutos in san francisco and reduced a sizable portion of the city to rubble cryptozoological agency monarch is on the verge of being put under united states military control but before that can happen scientist dr emma russell vera farmiga and her teenage daughter madison millie bobby brown have been kidnapped by the unscrupulous jonah alan charles dance and his band of mercenaries their goal is to awaken the godlike monsters dubbed titans monarch has been studying around the globe from their slumber believing that the destruction and carnage these creatures leave in their wake will help the earth heal from centuries of misuse on the part of the human race but their list includes the mysterious monster zero also known as ghidorah a threeheaded behemoth who may not be of this world and instead of restoring the natural balance this vicious beasts goal might just be the complete eradication of all of humanity monarch scientist dr ishiro serizawa ken watanabe enlists dr russells estranged exhusband mark kyle chandler to assist him in the search for the kidnapped mother and daughter he understands her work better than anyone so the feeling of dr serizawa and his trusted fellow scientist dr vivienne graham sally hawkins is that he is their best option to stop to alan from awakening these titans but his resolute hatred of godzilla potentially the only creature capable of destroying ghidorah could prove to be a catastrophic roadblock for the monarch team mark blaming the kingly creature for the death of his son in san francisco five years prior i thoroughly enjoyed director michael doughertys godzilla king of the monsters it made me smile that does not mean i think it is as memorably great as gareth edwards 2014 hit godzilla which birthed this socalled monsterverse for warner bros or that it is as giddily enjoyable as jordan vogtroberts 2017 adventure kong skull island proved to be it also cannot hold a candle to ishirô hondas 1954 japanese classic that started this giant monster craze 65 years ago that magnificent motion picture standing the test of time something fierce but dougherty the mind behind inventive low budget horror gems krampus and trick r treat has an obvious affinity for the toho studios creatures and not just the titular star along with ghidorah both the usually benevolent mothra and the fiery rodan are also utilized here the director showcasing all four in action with consummate skill rodans entrance is particularly fantastic the pterodactyllike monster birthed from inside a mexican volcano and subsequently proceeds to lay waste to an entire village with blistering fury before finding itself in conflict with both godzilla and ghidorah out in the middle of the ocean its a stunning sequence one that is delivered in true late 1980s early 1990s toho godzilla sequel splendor the unabashed silliness of their clash juxtaposed with devastating respect for the might and muscle of the creatures thats suitably incredible at the same time also much like many of those japanese epics from the tail end of the 20th century the human component of this story grows increasingly asinine as events progress cowriting the script with krampus collaborator zach shields and working from a story the pair dreamt up with godzilla and kong skull island scribe max borenstein doughertys screenplay is unquestionably stupid alans plan never makes much sense and his indifference when he realizes that ghidorah isnt part of the natural order but instead an alien invader intent on domination is demonstrably absurd as for dr emma russell her motivational flipflops are impossible to keep track of let alone understand making it difficult to care whether or not she is going to be reconciled with mark let alone invest emotionally when shes inevitably forced into a fight for her own survival its also a tad strange just how quickly monarch has developed as a scientific defense force in the span of five years the organization has essentially become the monsterverses version of marvels shield complete with secret underwater headquarters where theyre able to monitor godzillas movements and a huge flying fortress that allows them to zip around the planet in no time flat granted theres a similar agency in the latter toho godzilla films so the fact monarch morphs into the earth defense force given that name in godzilla final wars or the global defense force as called in godzilla unleashed isnt a big surprise its just the speed in which they suddenly have all of this technology and equipment available to them thats hard to buy especially considering theres a major plot point regarding the us government wanting to put them under the control of the pentagon meaning theyre not a military organization still there are sequences of such staggering beauty not the least of which is a journey to godzillas underwater layer where dr serizawa gets a heartfelt close encounter or the birth of mothra from her cocoon beneath a central american waterfall and i really loved how much dougherty appreciated the size and scale of the various monsters i found the climactic showdown in boston to be well worth the wait and while id rather we stop staging these clashes shrouded in darkness and sheathed in rain that doesnt mean i could take my eyes off the screen for a single second of the ghidorahgodzilla smackdown its likely i was as close to being inthebag for this sequel as anything ill see and review this summer and i feel i need to admit that i adore doughertys previous films as already stated i love the most recent godzilla and had a heck of a good time watching kong skull island most importantly im as devoted to the japanese godzilla pictures as anyone and while id never say ive liked all of them even the ones i dont particularly care for id watch again at the drop of the hat if the opportunity to do so were to arise heck composer bear mccreary backcountry even manages to work in yûji kosekis mothras song and akira ifukubes iconic original godzilla theme into his magnificent score and its quite possible i might have shed a silent tear the first time the latters thunderous refrains splashed upon the soundtrack none of which means that i think godzilla king of the monsters is perfect or that everyone will enjoy it near as much as i did it does have flaws and its missteps are egregiously obvious but i was able to look past most of those as i let the joy of seeing mothra and rodan soar through the sky in mortal combat and the euphoria of ghidorah and godzilla locked in a lethal embrace sweep over me in continuous waves i had a blast watching doughertys take on these legendary creatures and it goes without saying ill be heading to the theatre again to see this sequel for a second time relatively soon we are dedicated to creating a distinguished user experience and a website rich in content

Jun 6 2019,positive, then war broke out in heaven godzilla and his angel mothra fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels called rodan and others fought back but he was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven the great dragon was hurled downthat ancient serpent called the devil or king ghidorah who leads the whole world astray he was hurled to the earth and his angels with him just look at that cross subtle is not how one would describe godzilla king of the monsters instead its awesome in every sense of the word inspiring a sense of genuine awe as well as being yknow pretty cool its also quite stupid the overall plot and the humans who inhabit it are either overstuffed or underbaked some characters are given far too much attention and narrative importance while others are vacuous avatars for various monster movie tropes nononsense military leader aisha hinds snarky soldier oshea jackson jr nonamerican ecoterrorist charles dance goofballbutbrilliant tech guy bradley whitford i dont recall any of these characters names and i dont have to the actors all seem like theyre having a good time embodying these stereotypes especially whitford who is totally hamming it up the basic plot centers around a family of scientists mark and emma russell kyle chandler and vera farmiga and their daughter maddie millie bobby brown there was a fourth russell a son and brother who died during the battles in san francisco from the 2014 godzilla film a plot detail intended to ground the characters decisions as motivated by grief but often feels like attempting to add pathos to a film that doesnt ask for it since that tragedyand somehow in connection with kong skull island a film i havent seenthe russells have been part of monarch a covert research group with a mission of studying the notsodormant titans thats what they call the big beasties they have developed an audio device macguffin the orca which is used to somehow control or speak to the titans when emma maddie and the orca end up in the hands of ecoterrorists trying to set the titans free it prompts mark to rejoin monarch which is being led by godzillas ishiro serizawa ken let them fight watanabe and vivienne graham sally hawkins much like director gareth edwards approach with the 2014 film godzilla king of the monsters is at its best when the titans are shown to full scale in all their glory with the puny humans staring up at them in fearful wonder there are some marvelous images generated herei would dare to call some of mothras moments beautiful its what makes the original trailer so frissoninducing and transcendent when the characters spout off silly lines or unfunny jokes it distracts from the films purpose very much akin to a priest or minister attempting humor in a sermon while preaching in a vast and lofty cathedral were not here for your jokes pastor just let us gaze at the light shining through the stained glass feel the weight of the hymns and organ joyfully partake in the eucharist to find the glory thank you malick as godzilla is portrayed as the rightful and good king over the titansindeed he is the king of kings and lord of lordsthe connections here between godzilla and his divine namesake shouldnt be dismissed as superfluous even within a silly summer blockbuster of giant cgi monsters duking it out in various global locations such an aweinspiring religious spectacle which is also about humilityabout when not to attack but to simply beis unique and praiseworthy in our cultural ethos when the prophet isaiah saw the glory of god in isaiah chapter 6 his response is to cry out woe is me for i am undonefor mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts its an appropriate response to coming facetoface with a god or a godzilla
Jun 6 2019,neutral,a noisy movie with a couple of exciting or visually arresting moments but also with a lot of filler and gratuitous content full review in spanish
Jun 6 2019,neutral,it must have been tough saying lines that make no sense in a story that is incomprehensible i imagine them all  dance hawkins watanabe  at the bar each night trading bonkers lines of dialogue theyd had to say that day as a kind of drinking game
Jun 5 2019,neutral,despite the talent from brown farmiga and chandler the story is a simple succession of cheesy events full review in spanish
Jun 5 2019,negative, the new story follows the heroic efforts of the cryptozoological agency monarch as its members face off against a battery of godsized monsters including the mighty godzilla who collides with mothra rodan and his ultimate nemesis the threeheaded king ghidorah when these ancient superspeciesthought to be mere mythsrise again they all vie for supremacy leaving humanitys very existence hanging in the balance first and foremost this film did not waste any time when it came to showcasing godzilla or the other monsters that in itself is a huge major win for this film seeing as though the previous godzilla 2014 took practically an entire hour before they showed the creature at all moreover this sequel starts off with the aftermath of the previous film to help continue the story in terms of the narrative it was nice to see the stories connect and address the gravity of the situation when giant monsters have destroyed an entire city in addition to this the level of destruction in this film was really on par with what we could expect from giant monsters fighting speaking of monsters we get a whole lot more in king of the monsters it would appear that any criticism the previous godzilla movie received for having a lack of monsters had been heard loud and clear by the movie studios the inclusion of multiple monsters was probably this movies strongest asset there was a nice variety of monsters that casual godzilla fans may not be acquainted with however the initial draw will come from the more classic monsters that have been advertised like mothra ghidorah and more when it came to the more wellknown monsters they thankfully didnt remain onedimensional during the movie  many of them were given a combination of various attack moves or powerups to help make their battles more interesting while im on the subject the monster battles are exactly what people expect and king of the monsters does mostly deliver in that regard many of the fights were constructed in a manner that almost felt like a professional wrestling match there were many moments in the film where the drama and suspense would build up and youd find yourself practically cheering for this or that monster at any given time besides the monsters most of the actors handled their roles just fine  i just want to highlight the one actor that felt the most compelling and that was ken watanabe he had a certain presence in the movie that just made you want to pay attention and listen to him as the voice of reason it was refreshing to see his role expanded much more this time around one element that was also essential and nicely done in this film was the inclusion and growth of the monarch company the benefit of this organization is that it becomes a practical medium for the audience to obtain information in a reasonable way the positive with monarchs role is that the film is able to provide a lot of additional mythological lore about the monsters which just so happen to also be homage to the much older japanese godzilla films starting with the minor issues first i think that the random bits of humor in the movie were hit or miss in a vacuum the jokes or humorous moments were chuckleworthy at best but when you think about the movie as a whole the humor really didnt serve any beneficial function it unnecessarily broke the tension or the sense of urgency that the monsters posed between this sequel and godzilla 2014 film the tonal shift became much lighter and i dont think that was a good direction to take again its minor issue but in hindsight it became rather noticeable how unnecessary it was for the film another minor issue in the film was some of the cinematography that was utilized during the monster battles the reason why this was a minor issue is because it wasnt a frequent occurrence but it was unfortunate that it would happen during some of the monster battles basically what would happen is the camera shots would be too tightly zoomed in during the fights and this would happen while the scenery was poorly lit it made some of the actions scenes hard to make out as for the last minor issue with this film youll be able to tell pretty early on that this movie is rather predictable unfortunately this film doesnt take very many risks with its characters or monsters so that basically leaves you to easily guess the outcome of most situations you might start to notice that the film will telegraph situations during a really intense moment and after the fourth time or so the build up of anticipation starts to wear thin with those minor issues out of the way now we can talk about one of the major issues unfortunately while it was a commendable effort to include more monsters in the movie many of them were just wasted while the initial setup and promise of the film feels like there will be a major freeforall we just have a bunch of monsters become background noise to top that all off even one of the primary monsters in the film was a complete and utter letdown this particular monster gets hyped up so much and even has some pretty interesting moments in the film however when its all said and done their entire existence was for nothing as for the biggest problem in king of the monsters that prize goes to the all of the humans in the movie except for ken watanabes character and their personal drama while the movie studio clearly heard the criticism of not having enough monsters they apparently missed the memo that the human drama is not needed at all the motivations for some of the main characters are pretty dumb and almost straight from a comic book villains story for a monster movie taking time away to focus on the human characters personal drama was a huge distraction  as a matter of fact king of the monsters is 2hrs and 11 mins long and it most definitely wouldve been better served to remove the family drama elements to save a solid 20 mins of time to make matters worse many of these irrelevant issues would come up right in the middle of the climatic monster fights all of that rising action and tension gets broken every time we take time away from the monster fights to focus on a characters personal issue i dont know how anyone wouldve thought that would be a good idea at all but one of the best monster fights in the movie has to take a break just to show us an update on how some family is doing in the midst of the fight godzilla king of the monsters is a monster movie that feels like a restaurant that just cant get your order right its like when you ordering a hamburger with extra ketchup and no pickles when you finally get your burger they give you the ketchup packets on the side which is fine but you still find two strangely pickles hiding under the bun so let me address this human problem with a bit more clarity because i dont want there to be any confusion with my criticism right now godzilla king of the monsters is falling into a similar trap that the michael bay movies would succumb to itll give you a lot of the good stuff you wanted the transformers but it wont take the time to filter out the unnecessary things either human drama there simply needs to be a better balance when it comes to the monsters and the human drama in these films i say that because i believe there is a built up expectation for audiences to come and see monsters fight the monsters should be the lead characters in the film and receive the most screen time besides that the humans should be complimentary or secondary characters rather than trying to fight for the audiences attention in other words the only human drama that is necessary in these films should be any drama that is directly related to the monsters themselves the moments in the movie that show the humans trying to deal with the monster problem are great the moments when theyre trying to deal with their family marriage or whatever else is not so great im sorry no im not but i dont care about a familys personal issues while a group of large monsters are destroying the world right outside the humans in these movies can serve the purpose of  informing us about the monsters be affected by the aftermath of the monsters and even have some relationships with the monsters since many of the humans in this movie have a weird inclination to want to touch the monsters faces regardless the moment the focus goes away from the monsters and onto the humans and their personal issues the film has betrayed its primary purpose which is to be a movie about monsters  with all that being said yes this movie did some great things with the monsters yes it does have some great action and id say it had some entertaining moments its ultimately an ideal popcorn flick that is worth seeing in theaters if you youre willing to ignore the parts of the movie that have nothing to do with the monsters the story is nonsensical but they give you so many monsters to distract you youll probably be more forgiving about it as a fan of monster movies myself and despite the many issues i had with this movie id recommend to check this out be sure to stay until the end of the credits for a bonus post credit scene too godzilla king

Jun 5 2019,negative, the third film in legendary pictures monarch cinematic universe after gareth edwards 2014 godzilla and jordan vogtroberts kong skull island godzilla king of the monsters coursecorrects the lack of the titular beast in the first movie but also expands on the elements that werent so popular theres a glut of unnecessary dull dumb human characters and while the monster fights are frequent they often look murky and lack visual dynamism unfortunately this movie misses the gorgeous cinematography of guillermo navarro who conjured the awesome aesthetic of pacific rim or larry fongs striking visual palette in kong skull island watching both godzillas im left wondering if well ever see the king titan clash under clear skies the excitement of seeing this beastly royalty on screen is dampened by the restrictive storm of dusty smoky greys and browns its a visual dirge that made me ache for the breathtaking halo jump from the 2014 movie or practically any monster shot from skull island honestly check my earlier review i took a lot of flak for unashamedly loving that movie seeing the sheer number of iconic beasts and the loving fanservice liberally slathered on screen should have been a joyous thing but sadly theyre competing for screentime with a phalanx of hollow grating human characters its bad enough director michael dougherty squanders the scenerychewing charles dance we also have to endure the human slice of dry white crustless bread that is kyle chandler  vera farmigas character motivations are astoundingly stupid and cliched bradley whitford delivers naff quips zhang ziyi espouses vaguely asian mysticism and ken watanabe returns to intone superseriously millie bobby brown gets a little more to do than most but the family dynamic between her character chandler and farmigas is illdefined and has no satisfactory resolution oh and theres an utterly wasted sally hawkins thomas middleditch aisha hinds avid stathairn joe morton anthony ramos and oshea jackson jr to name a few theres simply too many human characters that whenever we lose sight of the titans the movie becomes a trudge in that regard godzilla king of the monsters suffers from the same issue the transformers movies had where the spend way too much time with an inordinate number of unlikeable characters delivering terrible dialogue and doing idiotic things what could have been a lean mean clash of creatures ends up a monotonous meander between muddylooking incomprehensible battles that aside the bear mccreary score is aces and theres a couple of unintentionally hilarious moments that helped me through this overstuffed undercooked pretender to the crown if youre a fan of the 2014 movie you may enjoy king of the monsters at facevalue there are plenty of callbacks to the rich history of godzilla and the promise of more gargantuan tussles in future but as a casual fan i was bored heres hoping adam wingard can right the ship with next years beastly battle royale we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese regular type person by day film vigilante by night  spent years as a 35mm projectionist he got taller and now he gets to watch and wax lyrical about all manner of motion pictures  daryl has got a soft spot for naff horror and hed consider anime to be his kryptonite
Jun 5 2019,positive, most disasterstyle movies follow a basic structure they open with a tease then they let you meet the characters then they lay out the stakes then they kill off a character then they let the remaining characters mobilize and formulate a plan then they unleash hell for a chaotic climax in the third act godzilla king of the monsters hits many of those same beats but the unleashing hell parts happens almost constantly throughout the whole movie in fact the pacing is so strange that after about the twenty minutemark i had no concept whatsoever of how far into the films runtime we were im usually pretty good at timing out a movie in my head and estimating what percentage weve completed not here not even close theres no slow burn or escalating momentum the whole movie is in the deep end godzilla king of the monsters is just a relentless haze of destruction throughout a creative decision that obviously brings with it an enormous amount of pros and cons the pros are of course we get to see a ton of amazing visuals the special effects work is consistently wonderful throughout and some of the set locations in major cities are a sight to behold whether youre emotionally invested or not its riveting to watch major landmarks get wrecked by gigantic prehistoric leviathans the cons are there is so much destruction its hard to focus on anything else and be particularly moved by any single moment were given human characters there are a few attempts to make us feel something for them but because godzilla king of the monsters clearly cares about the fight scenes more than anything else that emotional connection is never established theres just not enough time and not enough moments without frenetic urgency they say you learn a lot about people during a crisis but that only works if you know their personalities and can guess at how they would seemingly react those human characters have names and some of them have minor backstories but im not sure any of that really matters for the sake of being thorough theres a woman vera farmiga her exhusband kyle chandler their kid millie bobby brown some scientists and a lot of monsters theres also a villain played by charles dance who is always a delight some of the characters want to use a sound frequency machine to control the monsters or titans as theyre called here others just want them to go away the beasts are eventually set free and go on a rampage that makes the carnage in man of steel look like a slap fight between two little kids its all a lot in the best and worst ways despite existing in the same universe as kong skull island godzilla king of the monsters shares almost nothing in common with that movie at least when it comes to tone there are some light jokes from bradley whitford and thomas middleditch that are worth a smile here or there but basically its all monster fights all the time with intense brooding and emotional undercurrents bubbling beneath the surface if youre the type of person that gets excited about the idea of numerous prehistoric beasts invading major cities and leaving them in utter ruin this is a great movie for you youre going to absolutely love it if youre the type of person who cares about the story first and the visuals second this probably wont be one you feel the need to see a second time still its hard not to at least mildly enjoy godzilla king of the monsters with some of the best visual effects youll see this year solid enough acting performances and big scary unnatural animals wandering about and breaking everything near them the end product does enough to justify its two hour plus runtime and perhaps justify the cost of a ticket mack rawden is the editorinchief of cinemablend he first started working at the publication as a writer back in 2007 and has held various jobs at the site in the time since including managing editor pop culture editor and staff writer he now splits his time between working on cinemablends user experience helping to plan the sites editorial direction and writing passionate articles about niche entertainment topics hes into he graduated from indiana university with a degree in english go hoosiers and has been interviewed and quoted in a variety of publications including digiday enthusiastic about clue caseoftheweek mysteries a great wrestling promo and cookies at disney world less enthusiastic about the pricing structure of cable loud noises and tuesdays 
Jun 5 2019,negative,       they made the first one in 2014 and you asked why and then they went ahead and made another one and itll make you scream why  godzilla king of the monsters comes with the unoriginal tag line one king to rule them all a lazy and forcefitted hattip to lord of the rings    michael doughertys scifi action adventure is a breathless series of action pieces and elaborate special effects building up to a possible apocalypse the story opens a few years after the earlier film emma vera farmiga and mark kyle chandler are estranged dealing with the loss of their son andrew in the last movie caught somewhere between their angst is their daughter madison millie bobby brown emma works for monarch a corporation that monitors and protects godzilla and the other titans to this end emma has developed a machine that is able to control their behaviour through bioacoustics    but ecowarrior jonah alan charles dance has his own greater plan and thats when things begin to go terribly bad emma and madison are captured and mark is enlisted to help track them down    eventually a whole lot of monsters are stomping around earth reducing it to rubble a threeheaded creature is commandeering the dormant titans monsters but can he outwit godzilla aka gojira or will godzilla show that coexistence is possible and save the planet from annihilation the wwe of monsters is almost fun but then the humans with their trite lines spoil the limited drama    ken watanabe sally hawkins and zhang ziyi also appear a third part is inevitable as godzilla goes headtohead with king kong in godzilla vs kong godzilla 2 might have worked as a bgrade creature feature or a contemporary comic homage to such films but it is neither its just a bigbudget waste of resources that weakly attempts some ecowarrior gibberish and leans heavily on disaster movie clichés unlock a world of benefits from insightful newsletters to realtime stock tracking breaking news and a personalized newsfeed  its all here just a click away login now 
Jun 5 2019,neutral, i am not here to disparage your work on the contrary i have a huge amount of respect for visual artists who work in cg and you deliver stunning images that are truly the definition of movie magic this is especially impressive to someone like me who has a technical aptitude of approximately zero i am in awe of your craft unfortunately im significantly less in awe of godzilla king of monsters godzilla has been around since the 1950s which means hes pushing seventy and probably starting to lose his eyesight i am a little more than half his age and about twenty minutes into godzilla king of monsters i worried that i might need to see my optometrist this film is so murky i began to wonder if my corneas were malfunctioning but i soon realized it wasnt me it was you  to be fair ill assume this murkiness was a conscious decision made by director michael dougherty who decided to shroud this narrative in logical darkness too this second installment in the godzilla portion of the legendarywb monsterverse franchise falls into the trap that many middlechapter films do its a placeholder a forgettable episode in a whoknowshowlong saga the godzilla mythology is vast and godzilla king of monsters introduces other monsters aka titans for the titular mutant to reign over  mothra rodan and king ghidora  setting fans up for an epic kaiju showdown this setup pays off but only barely and only after slogging through too many scenes of a putupon cast sputtering rote exposition stuffed between the monster fights is a fingerwagging ecological conundrum a globespanning chase and a kitchen sink family drama all of which are as tedious as they sound if spectacularly rendered monsters are what audiences are after then theyll have to work for them here despite a few notable exceptions their screen time is mostly frustrating rodans appearance atop a volcano mothras technicolour splendor and the final battle between the threeheaded ghidora and godzilla in bostons fenway park are scenes that stun and delight the way a film of this scope demands when your work is discernible marcello it complements the grandeur of these beasts highlighting rough dermis and glinting eyeballs and showing just how enormous and formidable they are by scaling them against the crumbled cityscapes but the rest of their antics are bathed in a smoky patina their majestic details obscured by rain and cloud  perhaps the worst part is that the film was too dark for me to check my watch which i attempted to do many many times not simply because i wanted to know how much longer this film would hold me hostage but because looking away from the screen was a respite however brief from the convoluted interminable human narrative this all takes place five years after san francisco was levelled in the first godzilla movie we meet an estranged couple both scientists who lost a child in the disaster they are swept up along with their teen daughter in separate plans to either help or hinder the apocalypse among them project monarchs attempts to track the titans and ecoterrorists hellbent on destroying them vera farmiga kyle chandler and millie bobby brown in her feature debut are joined by sally hawkins ken watanabe charles dance zhang ziyi oshea jackson and others in their quest to make a silk purse out of this sows ear of a script the comic relief such as it is is played out between bradley whitford and thomas middleditch as a game of duelling sarcastic guys who along with the rest of the cast seem determined to spout their dialogue as quickly as possible so they can put this whole monster mess behind them that they conduct their business in barelylit control rooms and underground bunkers should be no surprise as godzilla king of monsters seems to have mistaken darkness for depth it takes itself so seriously that it would be almost laughable if it werent all so exhausting all of this of course is just a bloated premise for the main event which will see godzilla take on king kong in 2020s godzilla vs kong i was firmly team kong if for no other reason than 2017s kong skull island has everything a neoclassic monster movie should have a compelling but easy to follow plot a steady and consistent upping of the stakes clever worldbuilding and most importantly an engaging cast who knew exactly what kind of ridiculous film they were making kong skull island proved that you can have cgi creatures stalk and terrorize in the daylight without sacrificing tension or awe but with that films director jordan vogtroberts prepping a new film for sony after almost being killed by vietnamese gangsters yup that happened and none of kong skull islands writers returning for godzilla vs kong and michael dougherty and co returning insteadwell lets just say my anticipation has dimmed considerably
Jun 5 2019,negative, the sequel to gareth edwards 2014 reboot of the ubiquitous godzilla franchise could well be the first truly abysmal big budget production of the summer directed and cowritten by michael dougherty krampus godzilla king of the monsters presents such a preposterous and idiotic plot that even those with expert knowledge of the franchise might find it impossible to follow set five years after the end of the first instalment and starring vera farmiga the departed up in the air and kyle chandler friday night lights manchester by the sea the story follows the cryptozoological agency monarch as its scientists face off against more giant monsters as well as reacquainting audiences with the mighty lizard king godzilla this new chapter introduces some new adversaries including the powerful threeheaded behemoth ghidorah after suffering a great loss five years earlier in the first attacks dr emma russell farmiga has dedicated her life to attempting to understand the nature of the monster who killed her son on the other side of the world her husband mark chandler is finding it equally impossible to come to terms with the events which went on to destroy his marriage and kept him away from the couples teenage daughter madison played beautifully by stranger things teen star millie bobby brown when both emma and madison are taken hostage by a group of ecoterrorists headed by jonah alan a suitably sinister charles dance mark must locate his family and retrieve the orca a scientific gadget created by emma and which could help stop armageddon even if one is willing to forgive its ludicrously complicated and drawnout plot theres no ignoring the fact that godzilla king of the monsters is simply not a very good movie michael dougherty presents a poorly written screenplay and a story so devoid of any coherence that it seems unable to decide what to do with its protagonists squandering the bulk of an undoubtedly huge budget on some dimly lit and poorly thoughtout action set pieces the film fails to bring anything new to a franchise which impressively is on its 35th instalment elsewhere the usually excellent and hugely funny oshea jackson jr straight outta compton ingrid goes west is wasted in a role which barely sees him uttering more than a couple of sentences throughout the immeasurable talent of sally hawkins is squandered on a blink and youll miss it appearance
Jun 5 2019,negative, there is such a clear disdain for the human element in godzilla king of the monsters one wonders if there wasnt a way to make this sequel with monsters alone cowritten with zach shields and directed by michael dougherty this film picks up five years after the wreckage of the first the loss of life was devastating for many the russell family included after the death of their son mark kyle chandler fell into a bottle and ran away while emma vera farmiga fell into her work for monarch the agency devoted to discovering and protectingdestroying these mammoth creatures which they call titans while mark and emmas daughter millie bobbie brown tries to keep the relative peace between her parents emma perfects a device that allows humans to communicate and pseudocontrol these beasts since mark was one of the initial creators of this device hes forced back into the fold unfortunately nefarious motivations prevent things from going smoothly a straightforward villain played by charles dance is just the tip of iceberg in a script that lives for its twists logic be damned credit where its due dougherty does sometimes deliver on the promise of his films subtitle there are plenty of monsters and godzilla does appear to be the king when they fight there are glimmers of the bmovie banger that was promised there are also however cutaways to a slew of supporting characters quipping incessantly at the action bradley whitford and thomas middleditch chief among them gareth edwards outing got a lot of credit for holding its proverbial cards back and ramping up tension throughout filling out the world in which godzilla was emerging and while this writer was not as enamored with that strategy and execution as others king of the monsters serves as a reminder at the difficulty in making one of these movies there is not a single human character in this picture worth investing in furthermore much of the narrative is formed from rationalizations that feel devoid of real thought or consideration most of these people are scientists and military higherups making the lack of intelligence hard to swallow ken watanabe david strathairn and sally hawkins all return and are given markedly less to do and though aisha hinds and oshea jackson jr are welcome additions they are left with scraps in a screenplay painstakingly devoted to introducing monsters and reacting to their glory there has always been a lack of logic to these movies but all pretense slips away here within minutes mark offers the most logical answer to the problem of we found huge creatures underground whose existence will surely kill us hes quickly ignored meanwhile other far more problematic stopgaps are put into motion throughout that result quite literally in the destruction of the planet who knows how many actual human beings are left at the end of godzilla king of the monsters but after the lizards forthcoming bout with king kong lets hope theyre not forced to endure much more dan mecca is the cofounder and managing editor of the film stage he is a producer and filmmaker living in pittsburgh he watches a lot of movies and tracks them on letterboxd
Jun 5 2019,positive, for the sake of simplicity im going to say there are two kinds of godzilla fans the first kind of fan adores the thematic ideas behind godzilla films like ishirō hondas original classic gareth edwards godzilla and hideaki annos shin godzilla explore the fallout of humanity toying with nuclear power and nature they are not really monster movies so much as allegories of mankinds nature for selfannihilation the second kind of godzilla fan enjoys watching godzilla beating the everlasting crap out of other monsters the circumstances of how godzilla faces king ghidorah are not important the important part is the fight itselfi strive to be both kinds of fans i believe honda edwards and anno made the three best godzilla films in the franchises 65year long history but im also a big fan of epic cheese like godzilla vs king ghidorah 1991 mothra vs godzilla 1964 and invasion of astromonster 1965 these are movies with time travel aliens and victory dances as plot points part of what makes godzilla such a fascinating franchise is it consists of a wide variety of genres tropes and stylesdirector michael dougherty aims to make godzilla king of the monsters a gigantic callback to epic cheese specifically to the heisei and millennium era of godzilla movies what i got was something admirable beautiful bombastic but in the way of itself too many timesa properly nonsensical plotlike a proper godzilla action movie the plot of king of the monsters is so nonsensical and complicated that its not worth writing out completely essentially what we have is monarch scientist dr emma russell vera farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are kidnapped by a group of ecoterrorists  interested in using a sonar device she invented to awaken all the monsters aka titans across the globe among the titans are mothra rodan king ghidorah and of course godzilla himselfsource warner bros pictureswith titans bringing utter destruction upon the earth its up to madisons estranged father dr mark russell kyle chandler to work with a group of monarch scientists to retrieve the device and potentially help godzilla defeat the other titansfans of the heisei and millennium era will find it easy to forgive the plot and characterization in this movie really the plot is an elaborate connectthedots game where it finds the perfect excuse to awaken each monster i couldnt care less how king ghidorah gets awakened i just want to see him awaken and roar in his full glory on the big screen in that sense the plot manages to string everything together without ever falling apartsure none of it makes any logical or practical sense and the movie never gives the audience a chance to reflect how stupid the ecoterrorists motivations are but this is a franchise where weve had manmade black hole generators as part of the plot im not kidding its from godzilla vs megaguirus when graded on a curve king of the monsters is pretty standardhuman characters rightfully heiseimillenniumif youre one to forgive the plot youd likely forgive the human characters too chandler and brown show their full commitment throughout the film giving natural performances to elevate their onedimensional personalities the triangular relationship among the father mother and daughter is one of the better explorations of character in the godzilla franchise the typical godzilla movie makes little to no effort to help you care about the human characters here at least we have solid performances to give them some sort of emotional weightsource warner bros picturesthe side characters on the other hand are reduced to your typical oneliners and expositional dialogue almost every scene with the humans is someone using pictures maps and diagrams to explain the plot to the audience hilariously most of the explanations come from chandlers character who essentially knows the answer to everything the humans need to know at the moment either that or he figures it out in seconds not only does the script explain the current situation but it also feels obligated to explain all the mythology to the audience as well as if dougherty is trying to convert new fans to join the club anyone unfamiliar with the mythology would find the storyline to be a clunky hodgepodge of biology and fantasy lingoken watanabe and sally hawkins return as their respective characters from the 2014 film the former to my surprise is given a beautiful reverserole callback that honors the 1954 classic while the latter is frustratingly wasted in the blink of an eye then you have charles dance using his british voice to intimidate people bradley whitford dropping hilariously bad oneliners the oh my godzilla line is in the final cut thomas middleditch being the unfunny comic relief and zhang ziyi providing one of the best reveals in the filmfor an average hollywood blockbuster there are obviously too many human characters and almost none of them serve any purpose in the grand scheme of things however the godzilla completionists are not going to care and i dont blame themexquisite monster sound and music designif theres one reason to see godzilla king of the monsters its to see how dougherty honors the original source material through the monster sound and music design this is the first time mothra rodan and king ghidorah have been on the big screen since 2004 and man all three of them look amazing not only does the film stay in line with the personalities of all three monsters it does not hesitate in giving king ghidorah more screen time than godzilla himself certainly the

you might find yourself grinning through a lot of the third actoverexposure iffy camerawork and very busy directingthe most heartbreaking thing about king of the monsters is how the monster action gets staged as much as i can tell dougherty loves godzilla he directs the action like a cross between the 1998 roland emmerich godzilla where its raining all the goddamn time and zack snyders batman v superman dawn of justice where the exposure contrast and saturation is so high that it makes your eyes soresource warner bros picturesseeing godzilla grab one of ghidorahs heads may be satisfying but when the shot is obstructed by rubble rain smoke and regular darkness its hard to make out all the images its even worse when the shot is framed as a closeup or a medium shot often times a wide establishing shot is still the best choicepast filmmakers like anno edwards and even guillermo del toro for his pacific rim master the way we gaze at monsters almost all the shots in their films are done from a human perspective where a tangible object is in the same frame as the monsters to help get a sense of how enormous they are anno would have the camera look up and let buildings streets and telephone lines obstruct part of godzillas body edwards would sneak in birds flying around godzilla or even look at a monster through a bus office window or from a buildings roof del toro would use cargo ships and freight transports as obstacles or weapons during a fightthese subtle artistic sensibilities are sorely lacking in king of the monsters occasionally godzilla rams king ghidorah through a building in a glorious wide shot or rodan and ghidorah tackle each other in the sky like something out of a gorgeous painting when once the overabundance of closeups come in the lack of tangible objects and clever framing strips the monsters of their scale and majesty its still awesome to watch but theres definitely something missing this timesource warner bros picturesin terms of how the action is filmed on a technical level im still a bigger fan of edwards godzilla and jordan vogtroberts kong skull island the fact that i still enjoyed king of the monsters says a lot about my love and doughertys love for mothra rodan and king ghidorahking of the monsters a mess made with lovegodzilla king of the monsters from start to finish is evidence that dougherty loves godzilla a dedicated fan who has supported every stupid idea in every era of the franchise the callbacks in this film can only be done by someone who knows what hes doing unfortunately i wish he had a better artistic sensibility in how he stages the action the context of whats going on is jawdropping and entertaining but whats literally shown on screen on a technical level is short of perfectionthat being said as a dedicated fan myself i still support the film and legendary pictures efforts in building the monsterverse next year we are getting godzilla vs kong for the average moviegoer it may sound like yet another crossover where studios are following what marvel studios have been excelling at for over a decade for godzilla completionists however were getting a remake for a 58year old movie this is a

likeminded readers who are passionate about cinema  get access to our private members network give back to independent filmmakers and morejoin now i strive to be both kinds of fans i believe honda edwards and anno made the three best godzilla films in the franchises 65year long history but im also a big fan of epic cheese like godzilla vs king ghidorah 1991 mothra vs godzilla 1964 and invasion of astromonster 1965 these are movies with time travel aliens and victory dances as plot points part of what makes godzilla such a fascinating franchise is it consists of a wide variety of genres tropes and styles director michael dougherty aims to make godzilla king of the monsters a gigantic callback to epic cheese specifically to the heisei and millennium era of godzilla movies what i got was something admirable beautiful bombastic but in the way of itself too many timesa properly nonsensical plotlike a proper godzilla action movie the plot of king of the monsters is so nonsensical and complicated that its not worth writing out completely essentially what we have is monarch scientist dr emma russell vera farmiga and her daughter madison millie bobby brown are kidnapped by a group of ecoterrorists  interested in using a sonar device she invented to awaken all the monsters aka titans across the globe among the titans are mothra rodan king ghidorah and of course godzilla himselfsource warner bros pictureswith titans bringing utter destruction upon the earth its up to madisons estranged father dr mark russell kyle chandler to work with a group of monarch scientists to retrieve the device and potentially help godzilla defeat the other titansfans of the heisei and millennium era will find it easy to forgive the plot and characterization in this movie really the plot is an elaborate connectthedots game where it finds the perfect excuse to awaken each monster i couldnt care less how king ghidorah gets awakened i just want to see him awaken and roar in his full glory on the big screen in that sense the plot manages to string everything together without ever falling apartsure none of it makes any logical or practical sense and the movie never gives the audience a chance to reflect how stupid the ecoterrorists motivations are but this is a franchise where weve had manmade black hole generators as part of the plot im not kidding its from godzilla vs megaguirus when graded on a curve king of the monsters is pretty standardhuman characters rightfully heiseimillenniumif youre one to forgive the plot youd likely forgive the human characters too chandler and brown show their full commitment throughout the film giving natural performances to elevate their onedimensional personalities the triangular relationship among the father mother and daughter is one of the better explorations of character in the godzilla franchise the typical godzilla movie makes little to no effort to help you care about the human characters here at least we have solid performances to give them some sort of emotional weightsource warner bros picturesthe side characters on the other hand are reduced to your typical oneliners and expositional dialogue almost every scene with the humans is someone using pictures maps and diagrams to explain the plot to the audience hilariously most of the explanations come from chandlers character who essentially knows the answer to everything the humans need to know at the moment either that or he figures it out in seconds not only does the script explain the current situation but it also feels obligated to explain all the mythology to the audience as well as if dougherty is trying to convert new fans to join the club anyone unfamiliar with the mythology would find the storyline to be a clunky hodgepodge of biology and fantasy lingoken watanabe and sally hawkins return as their respective characters from the 2014 film the former to my surprise is given a beautiful reverserole callback that honors the 1954 classic while the latter is frustratingly wasted in the blink of an eye then you have charles dance using his british voice to intimidate people bradley whitford dropping hilariously bad oneliners the oh my godzilla line is in the final cut thomas middleditch being the unfunny comic relief and zhang ziyi providing one of the best reveals in the filmfor an average hollywood blockbuster there are obviously too many human characters and almost none of them serve any purpose in the grand scheme of things however the godzilla completionists are not going to care and i dont blame themexquisite monster sound and music designif theres one reason to see godzilla king of the monsters its to see how dougherty honors the original source material through the monster sound and music design this is the first time mothra rodan and king ghidorah have been on the big screen since 2004 and man all three of them look amazing not only does the film stay in line with the personalities of all three monsters it does not hesitate in giving king ghidorah more screen time than godzilla himself certainly the film gives ghidorah a chance to earn that bad guy titlesource warner bros picturesfrom the

to elevate their onedimensional personalities the triangular relationship among the father mother and daughter is one of the better explorations of character in the godzilla franchise the typical godzilla movie makes little to no effort to help you care about the human characters here at least we have solid performances to give them some sort of emotional weight the side characters on the other hand are reduced to your typical oneliners and expositional dialogue almost every scene with the humans is someone using pictures maps and diagrams to explain the plot to the audience hilariously most of the explanations come from chandlers character who essentially knows the answer to everything the humans need to know at the moment either that or he figures it out in seconds not only does the script explain the current situation but it also feels obligated to explain all the mythology to the audience as well as if dougherty is trying to convert new fans to join the club anyone unfamiliar with the mythology would find the storyline to be a clunky hodgepodge of biology and fantasy lingo ken watanabe and sally hawkins return as their respective characters from the 2014 film the former to my surprise is given a beautiful reverserole callback that honors the 1954 classic while the latter is frustratingly wasted in the blink of an eye then you have charles dance using his british voice to intimidate people bradley whitford dropping hilariously bad oneliners the oh my godzilla line is in the final cut thomas middleditch being the unfunny comic relief and zhang ziyi providing one of the best reveals in the filmfor an average hollywood blockbuster there are obviously too many human characters and almost none of them serve any purpose in the grand scheme of things however the godzilla completionists are not going to care and i dont blame themexquisite monster sound and music designif theres one reason to see godzilla king of the monsters its to see how dougherty honors the original source material through the monster sound and music design this is the first time mothra rodan and king ghidorah have been on the big screen since 2004 and man all three of them look amazing not only does the film stay in line with the personalities of all three monsters it does not hesitate in giving king ghidorah more screen time than godzilla himself certainly the film gives ghidorah a chance to earn that bad guy titlesource warner bros picturesfrom the middle head being the alpha to the roar clearly resembling how he sounded during the shōwa era king ghidorah is fully realized in doughertys vision and easily worth the wait the same can be said for mothra who literally looks like her 1962 incarnation writ large on a 200 million budget the monsters all look and sound amazingand if thats not enough music composer bear mccreary bombards us with a loud operatic score from the original mothras song by yuji koseki to the classic 1954 godzilla theme by akira ifukube mccreary brings all the classic tunes back to life in full force most of all dougherty knows the perfect time to queue those melodies in the film if youre familiar with these tunes like i am you might find yourself grinning through a lot of the third actoverexposure iffy camerawork and very busy directingthe most heartbreaking thing about king of the monsters is how the monster action gets staged as much as i can tell dougherty loves godzilla he directs the action like a cross between the 1998 roland emmerich godzilla where its raining all the goddamn time and zack snyders batman v superman dawn of justice where the exposure contrast and saturation is so high that it makes your eyes soresource warner bros picturesseeing godzilla grab one of ghidorahs heads may be satisfying but when the shot is obstructed by rubble rain smoke and regular darkness its hard to make out all the images its even worse when the shot is framed as a closeup or a medium shot often times a wide establishing shot is still the best choicepast filmmakers like anno edwards and even guillermo del toro for his pacific rim master the way we gaze at monsters almost all the shots in their films are done from a human perspective where a tangible object is in the same frame as the monsters to help get a sense of how enormous they are anno would have the camera look up and let buildings streets and telephone lines obstruct part of godzillas body edwards would sneak in birds flying around godzilla or even look at a monster through a bus office window or from a buildings roof del toro would use cargo ships and freight transports as obstacles or weapons during a fightthese subtle artistic sensibilities are sorely lacking in king of the monsters occasionally godzilla rams king ghidorah through a building in a glorious wide shot or rodan and ghidorah tackle each other in the sky like something out of a gorgeous painting when once the overabundance of closeups come in the lack of tangible objects and clever framing strips the monsters of their scale and majesty its still awesome to watch but theres definitely something missing this timesource warner bros picturesin terms of how the action is filmed on a technical level im still a bigger fan of edwards godzilla and jordan vogtroberts kong skull island the fact that i still enjoyed king of the monsters says a lot about my love and doughertys love for mothra rodan and king ghidorahking of the monsters a mess made with lovegodzilla king of the monsters from start to finish is evidence that dougherty loves godzilla a dedicated fan who has supported every stupid idea in every era of the franchise the callbacks in this film can only be done by someone who knows what hes doing unfortunately i wish he had a better artistic

Jun 5 2019,positive, its yet another kaiju movie kaiju in japanese means strange creature but in english is has come to have a meaning more like monster generally kaiju movies involve military action fight scenes and social commentary  and this features all of the above this takes place after the 2014 godzilla reboot continuing the idea that monster such as godzilla and mothra which are called the titans are ancient creatures that once ruled the world in the 2014 film and the 1954 original too godzilla awakens because humans misuse technology in this one dr mark russell kyle chandler manchester by the sea and his exwife dr emma russell vera farmiga the conjuring along with their daughter madison millie bobby brown televisions stranger things take center stage it doesnt really matter how it happens suffice it to say that several monsters begin to threaten each other and humankind there is talk about how people are destroying the planet and how the titans have returned to take over the monsters or at least some of them may want to maintain the balance that humans are ruined russell has created a sonic device called the orca which she uses to great effect when a giant larva hatches the orca manages to calm what comes out of the egg  at least temporarily someone else wants the gizmo and soon emma and madison are kidnapped ghidorah a threeheaded monster arrives along with rodan and mothra are they forming an alliance is there hope for the human race i grew up watching these monsters and i think a lot of other people  viewers of all ages  did too i loved the references to the early films and i wanted to see the battles and upclose action with the critters i wasnt disappointed i love the way rodan rises out of an active volcano for example and how godzilla at times gets close enough to really look at a single human bear mccrearys score is incredible  its as big and impressive as the monsters with a symphony japanese buddhist monks chants throbbing percussion and a gorgeous chorus the credits are pretty cool too not only do they claim each monster is played by itself  this cracked me up  but theres a touching dedication to godzilla veterans producer yoshimitsu banno and the late actor haruo nakajima who so often wore the godzilla suit in the early movies
Jun 4 2019,neutral,godzilla king of the monsters ultimately collapses under its own weight the result of trying to do too much all at once itll scratch your giantmonsterfighting itch but dont expect much else
Jun 4 2019,negative, the new american film godzilla king of the monsters honors a tradition that has won millions of fans over sixty years the japanese kaiju or giant monster movie struck it big in america back in 1956 with the american release godzilla king of the monsters that alternate version of the 1954 japanese picture gojira aka godzilla tacked on scenes with american star raymond burr but these days godzilla movies are made in america to begin with what a world godzilla enthusiasts came out to support the big guys return in 2014s godzilla but while gareth edwards reboot was wellreceived fans have impatiently awaited a movie like its sequel godzilla king of the monsters thats because the sequel directed and cowritten by michael dougherty dusts off other iconic creatures from the godzilla family giantmoththing mothra pteranodonesque rodan and threeheaded monster king ghidorah the promise of monsteronmonster actionin various combinationsis all the true believers need to get their butts in seats but for everyone else godzilla king of the monsters has a higher bar to pass aside from godzilla and fellow monsterverse entry kong skull island the cgi blockbuster era has spat out the cloverfield movies the pacific rim movies rampage and more including earlier stabs at both godzilla and kong doughertys take then emphasizes its plethora of monsters but it also gathers a cast of character actors in an attempt to create a humaninterest story on which to hang the action the biggest human star here oddly enough is teenager millie bobby brown making her bigscreen debut on the strength of her netflix sensation stranger things another scifi monster tale brown plays madison russell whose estranged parents are kaiju experts paleobiologist dr emma russell vera farmiga and anthrozoologist dr mark russell kyle chandler couldnt keep their marriage together after the loss of their son in a monster attack when kaiju start making havoc again and emma and madison get lost in the shuffle monstermanaging organization monarch brings a reluctant mark back into the fold from there its a lot of character actors gathered around consoles in dark laboratories under big radar maps that track the monsters movements ken watanabe and sally hawkins reprise their roles from the 2014 film and were introduced to new scientists played by bradley whitford thomas middleditch and zhang ziyi dougherty makes every night dark and stormy and every interior shadowy making for a night at the movies that sometimes feels more like a patiencetesting blackout at home 3d only enhances that impression we spend too little quality time with godzilla for him to register as a character its a tough trick to give a creature personality but hardly impossible and the human characters prove onenote mostly because theres no time to discuss anything but monsters the screenplay mostly consists of debates over monster policy while every plot twist is explained that doesnt mean every plot twist is believable and the russells are so grumpy andor kooky that theres no rooting interest in bringing them back together the cgi creatures impressa star is reborn in mothraand their battles though dark and often too tightly framed basically deliver the firebreathing goods its just unfortunate that in the process of giving fans more of what they want the filmmakers squander the tastefulness of edwards franchise launcher and significantly dumb down the proceedings as a result the picture as a whole lumbers a lot like its fortystory star
Jun 4 2019,positive, godzilla returns to the big screen after a 5year hiatus this time hes prepping to take on king kong by fighting a 3headed dragon and a giant moth batman shane pinchhits for richard as we try to make sense of godzilla king of the monsters and discuss some news coming out of netflix
