"Apr 14, 2024",negative,"The thing that's definitely true of Madame Web is that it was absolutely butchered, just hacked apart by a screaming maniac with a cleaver, in post-production."
"Apr 8, 2024",negative," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, a web-slinging franchise already tainted by misfires, has (hopefully) hit rock bottom with its time-jumping thriller Madame Web. You can see the yucky studio fingerprints all over this overproduced origin story, from choppy-as-hell pacing to the insistence on hitting certain formulaic MCU-type beats. Initial trailers tease eerie premonition horrors à la Final Destination that are barely in the final product, which has more in common with the first Dr. Strange (not even the spooky Multiverse of Madness sequel). If Madame Web were Final Destination: Superhero Edition, this would probably be a much more enthusiastic review — but it’s not. Madame Web is instead a flat-as-hell found family remix and awful bad superhero introduction that’ll test your SSU patience in record time. Dakota Johnson projects ambivalence and boredom as Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, who we meet as an emotionless thirty-something loner working as a paramedic in New York City. We already know she’s the daughter of deceased researcher Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé), betrayed by her expedition partner in Peru’s Amazonian rainforest while researching spiders. Cassie isn’t aware of the powers bestowed upon her during birth by a lifesaving arachnid bite, nor that Bruce Wayne wannabe Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) left her mother with a fatal gunshot wound. Cassie just wants to avoid death and watch American Idol like the average American during the early 2000s, not visualize the brutal killing of innocent girls who she then has to babysit thanks to the emergence of “time web” abilities that have her mind in a paradoxical blender. At its core, Madame Web is a comic book adaptation that fights against being a superhero movie. It’s written into Cassie’s personality — she doesn’t ask for the burden of playing foster parent to her eventual minions. Cassie is a complicated protagonist written to conceal any excitement or ownership of her superpowers, which lands like a thud throughout Johnson’s performance. She's as cardboard-flavored as the refrigerator drawing Cassie heartlessly declines from a grateful child. It’s hard to blame an actress when the material is so humdrum and uninspired, but still, what Johnson translates to the screen is like administered anesthesia. Cassie Webb is forgettably played in monotone, whether fighting Evil Spider-Man, learning Las Arañas lore, or floating through time-web-space like Johnson is trying to locate a reality before she signed on to Madame Web. Enter Cassie’s someday Spider-Women trio — who we only see as Spider-Women for, like, a collective two minutes (if even). Sydney Sweeney as good-girl-in-glasses Julia Cornwall, Isabela Merced as the fiery independent Anya Corazon, and Celeste O'Connor as rich-kid rebel Mattie Franklin. They are your prototype “found family” who dance on New Jersey diner tables to impress boys and make ill-advised choices because, if not, Ezekiel can’t locate his future murderers. It’s a numbing cycle of Cassie giving clear instructions for survival, Mattie disregarding the rules, and Ezekiel finding their location that falls into the same recycled staleness cemented by Cassie’s anchoring presence (or lack thereof). At least Johnson’s young castmates are allowed a tad more personality (which the film desperately needs). O'Connor’s brattiness as a skateboarding Spider-Punk in training or Merced’s stern insistence to obey orders allows for real character development — Sweeny less so, more of an American Girl doll for O’Connor’s troublemaker to corrupt. The film’s avalanche of problems ripples from here. Heralded Morbius writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless claimed scripting duties after Kerem Sanga took a crack. Claire Parker also notches a screenplay credit, as does director S. J. Clarkson, so we can assume revision rounds took place — to highlight how many hands were in the cookie jar. Four talents trying to homogenize their styles into one voice. You’re right to assume the blending process is a failure. Madame Web feels like a Frankenstein of spare Spider-Parts dissected and rebuilt by the studio machine. No role represents this sentiment more than antagonist Ezekiel Sims, who might be one of the worst supervillains in any comic book adaptation (SSU, MCU, DCU, the lot). Tahar Rahim’s performance is a blank stare and inconsistent accents; a millionaire (?), billionaire (?), who goes from shooting Constance Webb point blank and stealing her magic spider for personal use to living in New York City’s finest penthouse thirty years later, complete with his own NSA-stolen surveillance technology and tech wiz sidekick Amaria (Zosia Mamet deserves better). Sims isn’t the lead or focus of Madame Web, that’s Cassie Webb, but the screenplay so ineptly builds his nonexistent mythology no further than “bad guy in dark Spider-Man suit.” Not to mention his ADR work, in particular, is egregiously noticeable and quite horrendous for a Hollywood film with substantial budgeting and resources. Sims is a Mad Libs evildoer with an important arc about not obsessing over your future lest you doom your present, but producers clearly don’t care about the final cut version of Sims, which makes it hard for us to care in return. Madame Web plays as insincere, forces characters through obvious motions, and commits the ultimate sin for any superhero origin — is always looking toward future installments. I haven’t mentioned director S. J. Clarkson all that much because the film lacks identity, and I hope that’s a byproduct of wretched studio tampering. Sony’s inability to reconcile with the SSU's past and not let the future weigh down its present anxieties is in parallel with Cassie’s arc — and they can’t even tell that substory right. Madame Web is essentially promotional material for identities and superheroes you were sold this time around, with no real guarantee that any of these Spider-Women will appear down the road given the current SSU's disastrous status."
"Apr 4, 2024",negative," Late last year, May December sparked a spirited online debate about the definition of stylistic camp. While Susan Sontag purists were quick to insist that the outrageous tone of the film is to be strictly defined as comedy, many others were happy to shrug off this traditional definition and evolve the scope of camp into something weaponizable. And then we have Madame Web — one of the worst films in recent memory, which doesn't spin its camp with any sense of understanding or autonomy. It's an outrageous, sometimes entertaining mess that will hopefully supply audiences with enough disastrous creative choices and laughable nonsense to make its two-hour runtime somewhat ironically enjoyable. In Madame Web, a young New York City paramedic named Cassandra Web (played by a half-awake Dakota Johnson) has her dormant clairvoyant and precognitive mutant abilities ignited after an almost-fatal accident. Now able to see glimpses into the near future, Cassandra discovers that she can make drastic changes to help and ultimately save those around her. This gift was passed on to her from her long-dead mother, who had been studying spiders in the Amazon right before she died. When another mutant (Tahar Rahim) hunts down three seemingly average teenage girls on the subway, Cassandra uses her newfound abilities to save their lives, and the four young women find themselves on the run from a deadly, ruthless foe.  The story is impossibly bloated, with a meaningless plot — a fate foreshadowed by the ""Amazon spider"" dialogue made viral by the film's outrageous, campy trailer. None of it makes sense, and the characters often look at each other like they are unsure of whose line is coming next or which ping-pong ball they need to be running from. It's all just one long and ongoing disaster that's occasionally fun to watch but has too much filler to avoid a painfully boring third act.  Part of what confused me most about this confounding cinematic experience was the quality of its performances. Dakota Johnson has been on a tear lately with her press tour for the film. From eating up journalists who clumsily pestered her about the meme-ification of the film’s trailer to a comedic earthquake survival, Johnson is always a fun personality to witness in real-time. Her nonchalant eccentricity even translates onto the screen here — but instead of laughing with the movie, her performance seems to be constantly self-aware of the mess surrounding her. I can't speak to her internal monologue, but I couldn't help but feel like Johnson as Cassie was in as much awe of the film's spectacular ongoing failure as the rest of us. Then we have the unfortunate misuse of the film's young leads. Rising superstars Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor and Isabela Merced play three teenage girls who will one day become mutant heroes but currently require protection from Cassandra. With these three performances, the film goes into truly unforgivable territory. We get short visions of what their future superhero alter-egos look like, and it’s fairly glorious. But these are clearly promises of a cinematic tomorrow we will undoubtedly never see, as the quality of Madame Web is so wretched that any continuation feels all but dead on arrival. The wasted potential of a film led by these Spider-Women, instead of a cardboard cutout of Madame Web, was a grotesque tease.  While there are more than a handful of moments so terrible that they were an ironic joy to witness, the film is so long and confusing that its ironic value is slaughtered by its third act. Campy, yes — but also terrible."

"Mar 18, 2024",negative," The Gist: THE PERUVIAN AMAZON, 1973: Madame Web’s mom (Kerry Bishe) finally, finally finds the spider she’s been searching for – a spider that has some truly amazing peptides, the type of venom-derived peptides that, the script tells us, can supercharge cellular structure. Let’s hear it for peptides that supercharge cellular structure! Hooray for the peptides. She’s also pregnant, but that doesn’t stop Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) from shooting her and stealing the spider and leaving her for dead so some Peruvian spider-people known as Las Aranas can rescue her and take her to a magic cave for a magic bath so she can be bitten by one of the special spiders in the hopes that those peptides can save her. It doesn’t work and she dies but the baby doesn’t. Don’t you HATE it when that HAPPENS? Now we jump to 2003, where we meet that baby of destiny, all growed up: Cassandra Webb (Johnson), surely voted Best Bangs on an NYC EMT several years running. She’s a lonely sort with a cat, and to show us that she’s a lonely sort, she talks to the cat a lot and sadly thumbs through old photos of her mom. Her best bud-slash-ambulance partner is a guy named – hold onto yer hats true believers! – Ben Parker (Adam Scott), which has implications, my friends, major effing implications. One day, as she attends – put your hats back on so you can hold onto them again – Mary Parker’s (Emma Roberts) baby shower – who could possibly be in her tum-tum? – and drinks an ice-cold can of Pepsi-Cola, she and Ben are summoned to a rescue scene that goes sideways and nearly ends her. While she’s dead for a few minutes, she finds herself in an ugly and shitty special effect, and after Ben resuscitates her, she immediately says “I just wanna go home and watch Idol,” because it’s 2003, yo.  The ugly shitty special effect wasn’t nothing, of course. Cassie starts seeing glimpses into the future via confusing flash-forwards. This doesn’t happen all the time, only when very important things are going to happen, so yes, that means it happens precisely when the plot needs it. At this point the plot reintroduces us to Ezekiel as he beds a pretty lady, has a nightmare and engages in the worst pillow talk ever: “It’s not a dream. I’m gonna be murdered one day,” he says. His visions are clear: Three Spider-Women will take him out, so he goes about trying to find those women and take them out first, using computer composites and advanced surveillance tech that’s so complex and impossible, the movie doesn’t explain it, because it’d be way too difficult to do so convincingly. So we just move on. Who are those Spider-Women, you ask? Well, they’re not Spider-Women yet, just average teenagers: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). One day all three of these young women who don’t know each other end up on the same train as Cassie, who envisumalizes what’s about to happen, somehow convinces them that her envisumalization isn’t the ravings of a lunatic, and saves them from an attack by Ezekiel, who wears a black Spider-Mannish costume. Destiny, it seems, is really stinking afoot here. And destiny will lead our heroines to a thoroughly inscrutable finish at an Itchy and Scratchy fireworks factory topped by a giant Pepsi-Cola sign, as it damn well should, since being a shameless advertisement is the only thing this movie successfully achieves.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Deep breath: You’ve got Green Lantern, Elektra, Fantastic Four (2015), Fantastic Four (2005), Suicide Squad (2016)… time hasn’t vindicated any of these losers. Time to add a new one to this hall-of-shame list.  Performance Worth Watching: Johnson’s really it’s-a-living her way through this thing. She’s been through it before, in the 50 Shadeses, so by now she should be a pro at gutting it out. As an unapologetic DK fanboy, I just want to send her flowers and a nice card after this one. I can’t help but contemplate critic Gene Siskel’s famous criteria for judging a film: “Is the movie more interesting than the same actors having lunch?” In this case, I’d specifically amend that to put Johnson and Sweeney across from each other in a cozy diner booth having a sad-eyes staring contest over a slice of pie – first one to cry loses. That would be way more watchable than Madame Web.  Memorable Dialogue: My fave doozy in a script full of ’em: “There’s not enough frictional force in the bare human foot to overcome gravity and keep him stuck to the wall, much less the ceiling!” says Anya Corazon, like anyone would breathlessly blurt as they’re trying to escape being killed by a spider-madman. Our Take: A few sudden bursts of unintentional hilarity don’t save Madame Web from being unwatchable – unwatchable like a fox. The screenplay is a series of exponentially escalating incomprehensible storytelling decisions resulting in a bona-fide NONSENSE FUGUE. There’s a scene in which Cassie tells her teenage proteges, “Don’t do anything dumb,” immediately followed by a reiteration: “Seriously, don’t do dumb things.” Has she read this screenplay? It consists entirely of dumb things! They have no choice! One wonders if Johnson read it either, before hopefully being paid very well for this. (Note: She surely did read it. In a recent interview she essentially said this was one of those movies that looked like one thing when she signed on and became something entirely different after. She knew it was a disaster. She knew The Discourse was coming. Here’s another fistful of daisies, Dakota.) Our Call: I wanted to like this movie. Scratch that – I wanted to like disliking this movie. Just back the FTD delivery truck into Dakota’s driveway and SKIP IT."

"Mar 15, 2024",negative," Early on in Madame Web — the latest superhero film to be based on a Spider-Man-adjacent comic series — Dakota Johnson’s Cassie Web rejects a thank-you gift from the child of a woman whose life she just saved. From this, you can probably surmise that firstly, she’s awkward around kids, and secondly, she will eventually end up having to protect some kids. Like many heavily telegraphed moments in this film, you won’t need psychic powers to figure that one out — even if Cassie herself does, in fact, shortly develop such powers. But if you did have psychic powers, you might have wanted to use them to gently warn the cast away from this film, which manages to be both over-written and underwritten at the same time. Most of the actors here are wonderfully talented, but there’s only so much they can do with the material. A Prophet’s Tahar Rahim, so often a blistering presence, is left to thankless grumpy villain duties here; Adam Scott, fresh off his unimprovable turn in Severance, takes on a curious incarnation of Spidey’s Uncle Ben; Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor, as Spider-Women, have very little to do here. There is, perhaps, a bit less digital mulch sloshing around in Madame Web than in some recent superhero films. This is the result of a smaller and more self-contained story, involving the kind of nifty time-loop dilemmas familiar from small-screen sci-fi. But where the dialogue needed wit and spark, it has the kind of will-this-do one-liners (“Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom!”) and tired backstories you get when the characters are too flat to flesh out with rounded personalities. (Some unconvincing ADR smacks of a last-minute attempt to fix things in the edit.) Like the last remnants of a lost civilisation poking through the wreckage of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, hints of classical storytelling survive. The fateful legacy of a birthright inherited from a dead parent gives Cassie’s arc a Freudian motif, while the villain attempting to wipe out the next generation due to a premonition that they will cause his own downfall is a more interesting and personal motivation — at least on the page — than another bad guy wanting to destroy the universe. And instead of Chekhov’s gun, we get a new twist on an old favourite in the form of ‘Chekhov’s CPR’. It’s not enough to offset the creeping sense that, when it comes to the franchise sometimes known as the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC), the word ‘Marvel’ is synonymous less with a sense of awe than with a shrug."
"Mar 15, 2024",negative," We're starting off 2024 really weak or really strong, depending on your perspective. This week it's MADAME WEB and all the lunacy it provided. Let's talk about WHY it flopped, WHO is to blame, and PEPSI, of course."
"Mar 11, 2024",negative," Geraldine Viswanathan as Marian and Margaret Qualley as Jamie in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) As film bros and Joe Moviegoer alike await the release of “Dune: Part Two” with bated breath, they have largely given the cold shoulder to a spattering of other movies trying in vain to find audiences in the first two months of 2024. They run the gamut from acclaimed Oscar rejects (Ava DuVernay's gripping “Origin”) to costly debacles plagued by bad press and a cloud of let's-not-even-hate-watch contempt (more on that below). The Jason Statham-fronted thriller “The Beekeeper” (better than it looks) and “Bob Marley: One Love,” a new biopic about the reggae icon (unseen by me as of this writing), stand out as rare profitable exceptions in what is otherwise a concerning no-man's-land. Two February releases tell genre-driven tales that put women in the driver's seat of narratives all too often spearheaded by male protagonists. One is a buddy road movie with two lesbian friends seizing the spotlight. The other is the latest attempt by Sony to kickstart its own coterie of Marvel , away from the greedy Mouse, an origin story with shades of Bryan Singer's “X-Men” movies. Did either of them deserve their grim box office fate? Let's find out. “Drive-Away Dolls”: Jamie and Marian need a change, so they hit the road. Naughty, raunchy and kooky shenanigans ensue. That, in a nutshell, sums up the story of two sapphic besties dealing with the violent patriarchy (cops and criminals alike), horny athletes, an abrasive ex-girlfriend and a crooked politician with a hilarious secret. But it doesn't reflect the easygoing retro vibe that makes this live-action cartoon go down like honey. Our protagonists, living in Philly circa 1999, are polar opposites that somehow complement each other. Jamie (Margaret Qualley) lets her libido make her decisions, and her latest conquest is too much for her girlfriend Sukie (Beanie Feldstein), a police officer with a chip on her shoulder, to take. Straitlaced, tightly wound Marian (“Blockers'” Geraldine Viswanathan), is tired of her annoying (straight male) co-workers at her office job and dissatisfied with life in general, so she decides to rent a car using a drive-away service in order to visit her aunt in Tallahassee. The freshly dumped Jamie abruptly inserts herself into her solo trip. C.J. Wilson as Flint, Colman Domingo as The Chief and Joey Slotnick as Arliss in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) Away they go, unaware that the rather inept owner of the rental service (the ubiquitous Bill Camp) has given them the boxy Dodge Aries meant for a couple of goons (Joey Slotnick and C.J. Wilson) tasked with transporting a briefcase filled with unspecified contraband, also to Florida's capital. It's a case of mistaken identities that plays more like screwball comedy fodder than blood-soaked mayhem, through there's some of that, too.  Jamie, her confident swagger bolstered by a heavy Texas drawl, favors frequent detours to explore lesbian bar culture along the way, against the wishes of Marian, who'd much rather curl up with a Henry James novel than socialize. Once they realize they're carrying stolen goods, the two team up to deal with their ballooning underworld dilemma, as a suave gangster played by current Oscar nominee Colman Domingo deals with the incompetence of his jaw-droppingly stoopid henchmen. “Drive-Away Dolls” mixes two popular nineties subgenres that used to move B-movies off video store shelves: the down-and-dirty crime thriller and the exuberant queer indie. It's in this dual playpen that writer-director Ethan Coen and co-screenwriter Tricia Cooke, his partner in art and in life, jump in with gusto, wielding a budget and even a handful of A-listers that the movies that inspired them could only dream of. Cooke, who identifies as queer, infuses her more grounded (and yes, very queer) sensibility into Coen's goofy, occasionally gruesome sense of humor. Like the mismatched duo piloting this wild ride, the blend should not work yet somehow does. The results suggest what the Wachowskis' “Bound” would have been like as a farce. Geraldine Viswanathan as Marian and Margaret Qualley as Jamie in a scene from ""Drive-Away Dolls."" (Photo credit: Wilson Webb / Working Title / Focus Features.) Coen, directing his first feature without filmmaking partner and sibling Joel, is not afraid to dip his toe in over-the-top gore that recalls Sam Raimi in the eighties and, to a lesser extent, the Coens' own debut feature “Blood Simple.” But there's a distinct laid-back appeal here. It's in the film's playful, gleefully racy sex scenes with undeniable shades of Russ Meyer; it's in the lava-lamp imagery of the segueways between some scenes; and it's in the twinkle in the eye of a front desk employee at a Tallahassee hotel who appears to have walked in from an early Alexander Payne movie. They indicate this isn't your typical B-movie homage. Amidst the broad odd-couple hijinks, a tender depiction of Jamie and Marian's friendship blooms. When it comes to the young women's personal lives, they begin to stealthily influence each other's behavior, navigating their deepening bond with a nuance and sensitivity that anchors the clever genre-hopping and even injects a political subtext without interrupting the bawdy fun. The fact that Coen and Cooke milk considerable mileage from Linda Ronstadt's “Blue Bayou” cover should tell you all you need to know. Well, that and the film's original title, which had another word for “Dolls” that's either pejorative or empowering depending on who you ask. (Yes, it's exactly the “d” word you're thinking of, and no, the contents of that mysterious briefcase are decidedly not what you're thinking of.) “Drive-Away Dolls” wallows in the muck yet always feels wholesome despite its “hard R” trappings. Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal pop in, and while it's fun to see the stars in lighthearted cameos, the movie doesn't need their wattage. Coen and Cooke elevate the scuzzy appeal of their disreputable building blocks while still paying tribute to grindhouse fare of past generations, clocking in at just 84 minutes. They've made a romp that's tough on the outside but squishy in the middle. This is primo trash and proud of it, not only great fun, but a great hangout flick and a winning buddy picture. It promises a rowdy time and delivers the goods before it slams on the brakes. “Madame Web”: Do you know what movie was in dire need of some of “Drive-Away Dolls'” lively energy and generosity of spirit? This somnanbulant excuse for a comic book adventure. Should I rip the Band-Aid? I'm going to rip off the Band-Aid. The story of how a sullen, disenchanted New York City paramedic discovers she can foresee future events is a washout, a non-starter, aggressively boring when it's not being conspicuously awful. The social media dust storm that this misbegotten dumpster fire kicked up has begun to settle, but I fear its ripple effects will be felt for a long time to come. At the center of this funnel cloud of good intentions and poor execution is a phoned-in performance by Dakota Johnson playing the aforementioned first responder, Cassandra Webb. (See? Studying Greek mythology was good for something, after all.) Cassie's mother was researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon before she was double-crossed by her handsome, power-hungry research partner, Ezekiel Sims (“A Prophet's” Tahar Rahim, picking up a paycheck), circa 1973. Mommie Dearest kicks the bucket moments after childbirth in a scene that feels ripped off from “Avatar.” Flash forward 30 years, and Cassie has a near-death experience of her own while responding to a crash. She gradually realizes that she can see things before they happen. A neat concept, and if someone with the panache of, say, Sam Raimi was the filmmaker calling the shots, we'd have a real humdinger that would keep audiences on their toes. Sadly, we have to settle for S.J. Clarkson in the director's chair, and the TV vet gives Cassie's visions the most earthbound treatment imaginable, leeching the thrill of disorientation that would have given these scenes their kick. Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon, Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall and Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin in a scene from ""Madame Web."" (Photo courtesy of Marvel / Sony Pictures.) Cassie discovers she's fated to cross paths with and protect three teenage girls: shy and awkward Julia Cornwall (the radiant Sydney Sweeney), the standoffish Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and skateboarding trust fund baby Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). Protect from who, you ask? You already know the answer: Ezekiel, older but still rather hunky, and yet the sex appeal still yields a charisma void. He's convinced the Indigenous people of the Amazon cursed him with knowledge of how he's going to die: at the hands of this teen trio with abandonment issues, at some unspecified future date. (It goes without saying that Sweeney, Merced and O'Connor are all in their twenties and as convincing as you'd expect playing teens, which is not very.) But revealing this information early in the game saps the life force out of “Madame Web.” The rest of the movie unfolds as one narrow escape after another, with perfunctory action scenes that fail to quicken the pulse, schintzy CGI and automated dialogue replacement, or ADR, so poorly synchronized you'd swear these actors have all been dubbed by other people. Only composer Johan Söderqvist appears to have understood the assignment, using Herrmannesque strings to generate an aura of a falsely accused person on the run from baddies and the law. (Think “North by Northwest,” but with bad visual effects and dialogue in the place of actual tension.) If the storyline gives you déjà vu, that's because “Madame Web” was released a few months after “The Marvels,” which brings together three superheroes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris). “Web” actually plays like a morose mirror image of “The Marvels,” but even though both productions were plagued with reported behind-the-scenes drama, “Marvels” director Nia DaCosta imbued her adventure with fleet-footed pacing, a colorful palette and a refreshingly featherweight tone. By contrast, Clarkson has crafted the movie that “The Marvels” and, while we're at it, the underappreciated “Wonder Woman 1984” were accused of being. Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin, Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon and Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall in a scene from ""Madame Web."" (Photo courtesy of Marvel / Sony Pictures.) “Madame Web” lumbers from setpiece to setpiece, with a perpetually irritated Johnson acting as she'd rather be anywhere but here. She's an undefatigable guardian who approaches death-defying situations with the energy of a janitor tasked with cleaning up a big mess. (“Really? Another spill to mop up?”) In the face of danger, you get the feeling she's about to ask for the manager but keeps getting interrupted. This underachiever should have been titled “Super Karen.” Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, has gotten a bad rap due to the “Fifty Shades” trilogy (I was underwhelmed by the first one but rather enjoyed Parts 2 and 3; shhh, don't tell anyone). It needs to be pointed out that she's been good in a number of films, including Luca Guadagnino's “A Bigger Splash” and “Suspiria,” as well as the indie sleeper ""The Peanut Butter Falcon."" Here, alas, she's checked out from the get-go, and even though Clarkson keeps “Madame Web” just under the two-hour mark, you feel like you've been robbed of more time than that. Much like its vexed vortex of a protagonist, you come away feeling like you've had to pay to babysit a bunch of ungrateful and unruly brats. This sorry Spidey off-shoot has already pegged as an expensive flop, and you can't blame the mall crowds for staying away. It drives you up the wall, and not in a nifty, gravity-defying way. “Drive-Away Dolls” and Madame Web” are now playing in wide release across South Florida, including Regal South Beach, AMC Aventura, AMC Sunset Place, CMX Brickell City Centre and the Silverspot Cinema in downtown Miami.

"Mar 8, 2024",neutral," *** The first act of Drive-Away Dolls, Ethan Coen’s pre-Y2K lesbian screwball comedy, is pure cringe. It’s 1999 and two friends, Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) and Jamie (Margaret Qualley), are driving a rented sedan from Philadelphia to Tallahassee—and acting more like caricatures than characters. Marian is a bookish romantic; Jamie just wants to get laid, dude! The film is so dependent on stock characterizations that Ethan initially seems to be flailing without his filmmaker brother Joel (like Joel’s gorgeously austere The Tragedy of Macbeth, Drive-Away Dolls is a Coen brother movie, singular). Yet when Marian and Jamie get ensnared in a scheme involving a seething senator (Matt Damon) and a murdered dildo collector (Pedro Pascal), Drive-Away Dolls emerges as a cleverly comedic and romantic provocation. Despite being set after Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, the film imagines the ‘90s as an age when bigoted politicians were more ridiculous than dangerous and even Florida church ladies could be prevailed upon to support gay marriage. Kinky lovemaking abounds, but the evolution of Marian and Jamie’s bond—from friendship to far more—carries a whiff of Jane Austen, with Qualley playing a boisterous Elizabeth Bennet to Viswanathan’s disdainful Mr. Darcy. Is it any wonder that Coen wrote this jubilant lark of a movie with his wife, the film editor Tricia Cooke? The couple that plays together stays together. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

His neighbor’s sidewalk sweeping initiates the handsome 60-year-old’s daily consciousness, and a routine begins. Mustache trim, coveralls, canned coffee, cassette in the van stereo (Patti Smith or Lou Reed) as Hirayama commutes into Shibuya City to dutifully clean Tokyo’s public toilets. From what we can tell—because Hirayama says maybe five sentences in Perfect Days’ first half—the dirty job is just a job to him. The work remains in balance with Hirayama’s passion for music, his voracious reading, and his lunchtime nature photography. It’s no mystery why directing legend Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Wings of Desire) would be interested in rendering such a life. What 78-year-old, capital-A artist wouldn’t be? This is idealistic working-class poetry (à la Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson) about a man who accepts life as a series of days that can be pleasurable if porcelain scrubbing and creative ruminating are treated with equal care. As the Cannes jury decided when they gave him Best Actor in 2023, Yakusho makes all this mundanity incredibly watchable. The Japanese star’s shifting micro-expressions reveal a character who can be bashful, boyish or imposing when his constancy is interrupted by his co-worker, his niece, or a fateful stranger. We may wonder why Hirayama chooses solitude, but his ability to be present is as comforting as it is aspirational. Wenders taps into a precious cinematic paradox: We viewers escape our lives to be mindful inside someone else’s. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Cinema 21. **** Both lyrical and essayistic, the latest film by Ava DuVernay is, firstly, a feat of adaptation. Here, the Selma director interprets the 2020 nonfiction bestseller Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, which explores pancultural patterns of dehumanization throughout history. Yet Origin also foregrounds the research and writing of that book by Pulitzer Prize winner Isabel Wilkerson (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), turning this story into the cultural study meets memoir it never was on the page. It’s a bold choice, with DuVernay drenching the writer’s pursuit in historical flashbacks, as Wilkerson searches for the thesis of Caste across Germany, India, and the Deep South (where Audra McDonald, playing interview subject Miss Hale, delivers an astounding one-scene performance). With Kris Bowers’ orchestral score pulling the audience across borders and centuries, Ellis-Taylor embodies the quiet obsession of a writer who lives mostly in her head but is desperate to crack the code of man’s inhumanity to man. Sociologists and historians could rightly argue that Wilkerson’s premise—that racism is the result of deliberately constructed caste systems, not inherent biases—is flawed because capitalism, colonialism and genocide are expressed differently through American slavery, the Holocaust, and the subjugation of India’s Dalits. But that doesn’t matter when Origin is stretched to its full height. Akin to another rhetoric- and editing-centric piece of creative nonfiction, Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991), the ways in which theories hold water isn’t Origin’s reason for being. What matters is the deluge of anecdotal and emotional truth. PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. **** Astoria becomes an extension of a young woman’s soul in Sometimes I Think About Dying, an exquisitely restrained drama from director Rachel Lambert. Rey Skywalker herself, Daisy Ridley, plays Fran, a numb office worker who sits rigidly in her cubicle, silently terrified of being forced to engage in pleasantries. With eerie grace, Sometimes I Think About Dying peers into Fran’s suicidal visions—she imagines herself entombed in a tangle of driftwood on a desolate beach—but even as the film evokes the monotony of her depression, it gleams in moments of connection. An unexpected friendship with a hyperactive, pie-munching co-worker (Dave Merheje) leads Fran to a murder mystery party, where she delights the guests by flamboyantly miming death by acid. Fran is never more alive than when she yanks death from the darkened crevices of her mind and plays it as farce, an act that draws her more deeply into a city and its people. Sometimes I Think About Dying is unmistakably an Astorian movie—only in a close-knit community could a character give directions to their home by saying it’s behind “the purple house”—but its emotional reach goes beyond the sweep of the Columbia River, which to Fran seems both an empty void and an inviting canvas. Sometimes she thinks about living. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Fox Tower. *** Fans of macabre teen flicks like Edward Scissorhands and Warm Bodies should find enjoyment in Lisa Frankenstein, the latest quirky project written by Oscar-winner Diablo Cody (Juno). Kathryn Newton plays Lisa Swallows, a misfit growing up in 1989 who feels unmoored since the death of her mother…and finds her life taking a peculiar turn when a Victorian-era corpse (Cole Sprouse) rises from the dead and falls in love with her. Loaded with Cody’s usual acidic wit and oddball detours, Lisa Frankenstein goes heavy on neon lighting, voluminous hair, and malfunctioning tanning beds. Director Zelda Williams (the daughter of Robin Williams) channels early Tim Burton with her juxtaposition of gothic and suburban aesthetics, which gives the picture plenty of knowing style. Some of her and Cody’s choices fall flat (the film has at least two endings too many), but Newton and Sprouse are always there to provide spark, reveling in their excellent chemistry as they tread through the weirdness. Lisa Frankenstein won’t hit for all audiences, but it is easy to foresee it gaining a cult following, like the 2009 Cody-scripted feminist horror flick Jennifer’s Body. PG-13. DANIEL RESTER. Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Fox Tower, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Oak Grove, Pioneer Place, Studio One. ** “Sometimes,” Rita Marley (Lashawna Lynch) says to her husband Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), “the messenger must become the message.” Her affirmation illuminates the thesis of Bob Marley: One Love, that the reggae superstar must learn to accept the consequences and dangers that come with being an activist and not let them impede his mission. It’s a noble sentiment that makes for a compelling arc, but it is undercut by the screenplay’s version of Marley and his beliefs, which are sanitized to the point of sterility. The story—which kicks off with the attempted assassination of Marley in 1976, prompting an exile to London where he recovers from the trauma while writing his landmark ninth studio album, Exodus—rarely rises above artist-biopic cliches, despite occasional flashes of brilliance from director Reinaldo Marcus Greene (King Richard) and the compelling combo of Ben-Adir and Lynch (whose performance is a reminder that after supporting roles in No Time to Die and The Woman King, she’s overdue for a starring vehicle of her own). Perhaps One Love’s greatest disappointment is that it’s so thoroughly average; a man like Marley deserves a mightier film. Devotees may find some enjoyment in hearing hits from the singer’s back catalog in surround sound, but anyone hoping One Love will do justice to an icon will find that the cinematic message lacks the conviction of the messenger.

Studio One. ** After an unintentionally meme-worthy marketing campaign, a few critics have been quick to call Madame Web—a schlocky Spider-Man spinoff starring Dakota Johnson as clairvoyant paramedic Cassie Webb—the nadir of the superhero genre. It’s certainly not that. The film fails to hit the so-bad-it’s-good lows of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Steel (1997) or Batman & Robin (1997), outside of a few heinous moments toward the end (including a villain being vanquished by a Pepsi sign). That’s not to say it’s good. As Cassie defends a group of teenage girls (including Sydney Sweeney) hunted by the nefarious Ezekiel (Tahir Rahim), it becomes clear that director S.J. Clarkson’s film is mostly just another dull attempt by Sony to spotlight Spidey’s side characters. Johnson and Adam Scott (as the tellingly named Ben Parker) breathe a bit of life into the tale, as do a few clever set pieces (a subway sequence comes off best). But the clunky dialogue, lumbering pacing, and underdeveloped supporting characters reveal the desperation behind Johnson’s viral promotion of the film: “You’re gonna love it.” PG-13. DANIEL RESTER.

"Mar 6, 2024",negative," Cinematic disasters shouldn’t be this boring. Directed by S.J. Clarkson, “Madame Web” is a collection of misfires and missteps, awkward dialogue, weightless action, shoehorned-in references—all told without any sense of urgency at all. The idea of a villain relentlessly pursuing his prey seems like it should be a pressing matter, but the film takes a week off to get lost in a glut of expository dialogue (the whole movie’s default dialogue mode). The actors do their best, but the script is leaden and there’s no real visual splendor to behold—not even in the ironic, “look how awkward/cheap/phony this is” way that viewers can get from good bad movies. There are funny lines here and there, both intentionally comedic and not, but while audiences may want to find themselves tangled up in the story, they’ll be left adrift without anything reeling them in. Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a misanthropic, awkward EMT working in NYC in 2003. One day, while saving someone, she drowns and temporarily dies before being revived by her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Now Cassie gets glimpses of the possible future and is learning to navigate those visions when she happens upon a trio of teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor) who have become the target of Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a man with incredible spider super-powers connected to Cassie’s mom (who died in the Peruvian forest in the ‘70s searching for a very special spider). Now Cassie has to figure out what is going on and help protect the three women from this menace. The cinematographer for “Madame Web” is Mauro Fiore, who previously was DP for “Avatar,” “The Island,” and “Training Day,” amongst many others. While the film is competently shot, there is no visual style to anything except rotating the camera occasionally to match Sims’ spider-y moves on ceilings, which is surprising given Fiore’s pedigree. But the usual engrossing imagery is absent here, washed out like so much of “Madame Web.” There are jokes but they mostly land flat. There are charismatic actors, but they aren’t given much to do or substantive characters to inhabit. Johnson fares the best out of anyone in this cast (except maybe Scott), as she is allowed to be a sarcastic, aloof, and overwhelmed person in a sea of craziness…but that interesting characterization is drained away as time rolls on, eventually leaving a stilted husk of a person offering empty line readings. There are a couple of scenes where the three teens are allowed to just play off each other, but those are cut short and even then they aren’t particularly successful at being clever or that entertaining. But still they had promise! Director Clarkson has worked in the superhero genre before (on Marvel’s Netflix shows “Jessica Jones” and “The Defenders”), so should be well-versed in creating some dynamic scenes between interesting characters, or at least some sort of engaging action. Unfortunately, none of the fight scenes land with any sort of impact. It’s not because most of them are part of Cassie’s precognitive visions and therefore “don’t happen”—it’s because they are lifelessly executed and poorly edited without any sort of appealing nature to them. In general, fight scenes don’t have to be revolutionary to be interesting; they just have to have some visual flair or at least involve characters that we the audience are invested in. But seeing as how there’s no one in this film that feels like a real person or at least captivating enough to care about, all the action sequences and grandiose stunt set pieces fall horribly flat. “Madame Web” is incredibly awkward as well. It belabors the point of foreshadowing that Ben’s sister-in-law, May Parker (Emma Roberts) is pregnant with someone (massive wink), but to what end? What is the point of tying it into Peter Parker (without ever saying that name) so much? That’s not a fun Easter Egg but a pathetic attempt at making the events of the movie somehow interesting by proxy. It’s not just that shoehorning in of everyone’s favorite wall-crawler that is awkward. Sims is dubbed pretty terribly (possibly by Rahim, but certainly in a lot of ADR) to the point of sounding like a ‘90s DTV action villain. Which should be fun…if it were a stylistic choice and not just something clunky. Sims’ assistant (Zosia Mamet) is given an inordinate amount of screentime (and terrible, cliched hacker lingo) that never really pays off in any way. And the dialogue is just constantly full of awkward exposition or some other weird phrasing that tries to sell themes of power (and spiders!) in off-putting ways that make it all feel wrong. Comic book movies reinvigorated the post-credits scene— there’d be a little tease into the future, usually with something that seems awkward if thought about too long, but could be enticing enough to see what’s to come. Those scenes are rarely visually interesting, often peppered with some attempts at humor, and rely on audiences caring about what happened so as to be invested in what happens next. “Madame Web” doesn’t have any credits scenes because it is a post-credits scene writ large. And when ballooned up from three minutes to two hours, the strain is noticeable. Hollow jokes ring false, dialogue buckles underneath the burden of carrying that much plot and explanation, and there’s no arresting imagery to engross viewers. “Madame Web” isn’t the worst, but it’s lack of immediacy and heart make it a disastrous slog.

"Mar 6, 2024",negative,"The storytelling is... somewhere between pathetic and perfunctory. Largely perfunctory. 
"
"Mar 5, 2024",negative," We all know studios have some kind of say in the films that they distribute and release. Why wouldn't they? After all, they are ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into productions and feel that gives them a seat at the table behind the camera. When studios have as much of a say as Sony clearly did with Madame Web, it almost makes a review impossible, because this is a true mess of a film. Narratively, Madame Web is rudimentary but feels almost monolithic compared to the screenplay, but the horrifyingly bad editing and tonal shifts smack firmly of a film that was completed before being butchered by execs wanting to ride the wave of the superhero genre - and in doing so, have created the banalest, most generic, and pointless release the genre has seen in many, many years. The positives are few and far between sadly as the action and production design do nothing to lift the film from its basement, and the performances...well, sigh. Dakota Johnson must have a large cellular bill as she is phoning this in from the get-go, especially when having to participate in anything superhero-related. That said, I find Johnson to be gleefully watchable even in films such as this (her press tour performance was worth all the money, however). Sydney Sweeney, who I think is a very strong actress, is abysmal alongside O'Connor, and I don't recall Merced really doing anything, but special praise must go to Tahir Rahim who was handed a terrible role and simply had no idea what to do with it. Superhero film villains are often derided as weak and one-dimensional and nothing in Madame Web proves this to be wrong. I had hoped that Madame Web would at least be entertaining even if it was bad, but the film takes itself so seriously that even finding moments of levity feels like a bridge too far - though maybe the hamfisted references to Peter Parker count as comedy? Whatever the case from the beginning to its wholly unearned ending, Madame Web struggles against a studio that is desperate to create its own universe, but seemingly has no concept of how to do so. Making good films is a start, and Sony, with their live-action Spidey universe, is failing badly at that."
"Mar 5, 2024",neutral,A necessary back story but to what avail.
"Mar 4, 2024",negative,This is abysmal on every conceivable level. It's badly cast and the screenplay is atrocious in that this feels like a terrible first draft that somebody rushed out in the first week.
"Mar 2, 2024",negative," To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Mar 2, 2024",negative," That might explain why “Madame Web” — the inauspicious directorial debut of S.J. Clarkson — offers up a sophomoric, overwritten screenplay that constantly re-summarizes the plot and comments on the obvious. Madame Web began in 1980 as an unusual supporting superhero in Marvel’s Spider-Man comic books. Blind and elderly, she exercised clairvoyant powers while being connected to a life-support system resembling a spiderweb. In this stand-alone origin story, Cassandra Webb (Johnson) works as a New York paramedic alongside her bland buddy Ben (Adam Scott). She begins to inexplicably experience violent visions of the immediate near future. She does not know what we know, having seen how her researcher/explorer mother died in 1973 Peru while looking for a rare spider rumored to possess great healing powers. Her killer, a duplicitous guide (and dull, one-note villain) named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), uses the spider venom to transform into a wealthy, evil ninja with Spider-Man powers. He vows to find and kill three superhero-costumed females he foresees will assassinate him. Meanwhile, Cassie spots three familiar-looking teens in the subway: soft-spoken Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), street savvy Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and undocumented illegal immigrant Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Cassie sees Sims kill the girls in a futuristic vision. She quickly — and too easily — persuades them to follow her off the train. Five writers received credit for this Marvel mess and its collection of braindead bromides such as “No matter what happens, we need to work together!” and “Sometimes you must sacrifice yourself to save someone you love.” With his constantly roving cameras capturing incredible compositions, Oscar-winning cinematographer (and Palatine High School graduate) Mauro Fiore — assisted by the keen editing of Leigh “Fast & Furious” Folsom — elevates “Madame Web” to a watchable status."
"Mar 1, 2024",neutral," Even before it was released last week, the buzz was as negative as any movie in recent memory, with most of it aimed squarely at the film’s star, Dakota Johnson. The negativity continued after the film’s dismal performance at the box office on opening weekend, with some declaring it one of the worst films of all time. That’s why in one sense “Madame Web” proved to be a slightly pleasant surprise. It’s nowhere near as bad as the buzz might suggest (Hello, have you seen “Lisa Frankenstein?”). That’s not to say it’s good either. “Madame Web” is basically just a film that is there – it’s a passable way to kill two hours while watching something that is pretty average. “Madame Web” serves as an origin story with Johnson playing Cassie, a New York paramedic whose mother Constance (Kerry Bishé) died shortly after Cassie’s birth while searching for a mysterious spider in the jungles of Peru. Following a near-death experience, Cassie starts to have visions and the capability to see into the future. This leads her to cross paths with three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Conner) who are unknowingly the target of Constance’s former assistant Ezekiel (Tahir Rahim). His wrath is driven by visions that the three girls will eventually become superheroes and will be responsible for his death. “Madame Web” is an origin story with a lot of origin – way more exposition and set up for the future of these characters than perhaps any film in this genre. And there lies one of the biggest problems with the film – it’s hard to get invested in a superhero movie that is practically void of superheroes. First-time feature film director S.J. Clarkson does try to spice things up by playing with the time loop element and staging a couple of action sequences, but it all feels like it’s been taken from a film cliche assembly line and pieced together to create something resembling a comic book movie. The cast is going through the motions too, although Johnson continues to develop a low-key screen presence that makes her interesting to watch, even when it appears she’s bored with the material as well. The result is “Madame Web” isn’t really the disaster some have labeled it. It’s basically just a forgettable misfire that will be a cinematic afterthought within a few weeks."
"Mar 1, 2024",negative," Spider-Man is easily one of the most popular superheroes in existence. Among the many things that fans love about the revered webslinger is the amazing array of characters who fill out his world. Allies, villains, non-superpowered side characters – the list is long and diverse. Over the years many have found their ways onto the big screen and one thing has become abundantly clear, some characters have fared considerably better than others when it comes to Spidey movies. Adding to the list of those who haven’t fared well is Madame Web, a supporting character in the Spidey comics who now gets her own movie in Sony’s Spider-Man cinematic universe. Unfortunately what we get is an exercise in futility that stretches the Spider-Man brand beyond its limits. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and (somehow) written by a team of FOUR screenwriters, “Madame Web” is a hodgepodge of fair to downright terrible ideas, thrown together to form one of the more excruciating superhero movies to endure. Opening in 1973, deep in the Amazonian jungles of Peru, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) provides security for a science and research expedition led by Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé). There they discover a new species of spider with healing properties capable of curing all kinds of diseases. In true villain form, Ezekiel turns on Constance and their team, claiming the discovery for himself and leaving Constance for dead. A mysterious local tribe attempt to save Constance and her unborn baby using some kind of magical spider venom. But Constance dies while delivering her daughter, Cassie. From there we jump ahead to 2003 as what happened in the thirty years between is mostly left unanswered. Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a New York City paramedic working alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott). When an emergency call ends with Cassie having a near-death experience, she begins having strange and unexplainable visions. She first tries to dismiss them as simple déjà vu. But over time she realizes her visions are actually glimpses into the future. Meanwhile Ezekiel, who has premonition and physical powers all his own, has set his sights on three unconnected teenagers, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Carazon (Isabela Merced), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). Ezekiel has been haunted by visions of the future where these girls (somehow) gain their own spider-powers and use them to kill him. Determined to prevent his death, Ezekiel sets out to kill the girls first. But when Cassie’s newfound powers reveals Ezekiel’s plans, she’s compelled to save and protect the girls, all while trying to understand her strange abilities. As vague and poorly defined as it is, there are hints of an original and potentially interesting premise. But Clarkson and the team of writers never get beyond teasing those ideas. Instead their movie meanders to the point of tedium. The characters are dull and uninspired as is the action which is hampered by poor staging, choppy editing, and mediocre-to-bad CGI. The dreadful script doesn’t help things. It’s full of gaping holes, narrative shortcuts, and some astonishingly bad dialogue. The glaring oversights (and there are many of them) are especially funny. Take Cassie being wanted by police for kidnapping the girls she actually saved. Yet she drives all over New York City in a stolen cab, walks around in broad daylight, gets flights in and out of the country without the cops every getting wind. It’s as if the movie completely forgets the whole police angle. “Madame Web” is capped off with an unimaginative and utterly preposterous finale that leaves you scratching your head at how poorly its pieces come together. There’s no real stakes and as a result there’s no real suspense. Add to it our general lack of investment and you have a doomed ending with no real chance of offering up a satisfying conclusion. Its best quality is that it mercifully ends what is a flailing mess of a movie – one that seems perfectly content with riding Spider-Man’s coattails rather than trying for something smart, original, and coherent. “Madame Web” is in theaters now. Keith, I had a premonition that this would be garbage.  I do not like Dakota Johnson’s acting ability.  Too bad a superhero movie got wasted.  Did you notice in the pic above the Calvin Klein product placement? Keith, I’m both a big Marvel and Dakota Johnson fan. I found this awful. Just. Awful. Couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like AI wrote it. Marketing folks were more than “devious” when it came to the trailer – thought the girls were going to suit up and be way more active in the movie. Looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is set in, and maybe somehow the producers were actually reaching for a “retro” feel? And as for our star…Dakota is much better suited to Cha Cha Real Smooth and Peanut Butter Falcon-type roles. A superheroine…nope. Oh the whole thing with the girls in their superhero suits certainly teased something that was never delivered. I swear, I sat there wondering how something like that got made.  Exactly. It is so hard for me to believe there were any high-level executives of the studio in the screening room for the unspooling of the final product. I dreaded this as I’m sure this was a painful experience.  I feel bad for the people involved as Sony just doesn’t know how to create superhero films without getting in their own way.  I’ve only seen Venom in its entirely of these films and that was alright but I don’t have interest in anything else.  I’d like avoid Morbius as long as I live. Great review! Yes I skipped this one in theaters for multiple reasons. I’ve long lost faith in Marvel and stopped watching their films many years ago. The last Marvel movie that I actually enjoyed in theaters was “Endgame” about six years ago. I’ve never cared for any of Dakota Johnson’s work and the trailer for this gave me little hope. I might watch it on streaming some day if there’s nothing else on, but no plans to see it at all. I hate to be this blunt, but it’s astonishingly bad. Even when taking a surface-level approach to it, you can’t miss the many big holes and shortcuts."
"Feb 29, 2024",neutral," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  Making its area premiere at The Brattle Theatre is “Pictures of Ghosts” from acclaimed Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho, who caught audiences’ attention with his modern-day, llano-based spaghetti western “Bacurau” (2019). Filho’s current effort, a quieter, more personal one to be sure, is a love letter to cinema and the town of Recife, where he grew up. The poetic documentary follows the transformation of the city from its cultural heyday to the decline of its classic movie palaces. Of the many appearing in the film is countrywoman and “Bacurau” actor Sonia Braga. The film plays an extended run Friday through Tuesday. Later in the week is an olio of events, including the “Leap Day” film poll winners (from among films never screened at The Brattle) that yielded the beauty pageant road-trip-to-hell sojourn “Little Miss Sunshine” (2006), and the 1997 Japanese psychological horror flick “Perfect Blue,” in which the lines between reality and alter-reality blur for an aspiring singer. Grrl Haus Cinema sets up on Wednesday for a lineup of experimental shorts made by women, nonbinary, trans and genderqueer artists. On the free front, on Tuesday, the Independent Film Festival Boston swoops in for a screening of “Spaceman” directed by Johan Renck (of the “Chernobyl” series) and starring Adam Sandler as the first Czech astronaut (yup, you read that right) in space. The impressive ensemble includes Carey Mulligan (“Promising Young Woman), Paul Dano (“There Will Be Blood”), Lena Olin (“Chocolat”) and Isabella Rossellini (“Blue Velvet”). For the Monday Elements of Cinema screening it’s “Silent Running” (1972), one of two features directed by special-effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull (“Blade Runner”). One could argue it’s the original eco-terrorist film: The setting is a deep-space scow carrying Earth’s last vestige of flora, cared for by Bruce Dern as the gruff tree hugger taking a stand along with a trio of cute robots named Huey, Dewey and Louie. The post-screening conversation will be led by Matthew Nash, professor of visual arts at Lesley University. While both screenings are free, tickets are limited and go quickly. The New Hollywood Retro Replay Tuesday at the Landmark Kendall Square Theatre is the one that cemented Clint Eastwood as a box office mega force, “Dirty Harry” (1971), directed by Don Siegel (“Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “The Shootist”). Eastwood’s antiestablishment cop, dead set on putting bad guys away with his iconic .44 Magnum hand cannon, captured and cultivated the machismo of the era. He acts regardless of rules and regs in tracking down a serial killer known as Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), who taunts the San Francisco police with each bloody notch. Clint’s laconic nature and the cocky, take-no-shit one-liners made this maverick-cop thriller a fist full of dollars then and still packs a wow. Considering the fantastic cast and punchy setup, this is a bit of a toe stub for Ethan Coen in his second outing (his other being the 2022 rock-doc “Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind”) since splitting in 2019 with his brother Joel from a partnership that generated some of the most revered films of the recent cinematic past – “Fargo” (1996) and “No Country for Old Men” (2007) among them. These drive-away dolls are lesbians on a road trip to hell (well, Florida) to deliver a car and visit one’s nana. The car contains wanted cargo (a MacGuffin with shades of “Repo Man” that doesn’t have the greatest of payoffs) with a bunch of shady goons in hot pursuit. The lines between the sexually liberated Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and demure bestie Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) are drawn starkly in nearly every scene; along the way Jamie brings hookups back to their various motel rooms as the bookish Marian heads to the lobby to read Henry James during playtime. It’s a buddy movie with romantic possibilities – a soccer club spin-the-bottle makeout session forces the issue. Coen and his co-writer, wife Tricia Cooke, who edited projects such as “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” (2000) and “The Big Lebowski” (1998), borrow too much from their shared canon, namely C.J. Wilson and Joey Slotnick as idiosyncratic goons (and that is literally how the are referred to in the credits) whose opposite approaches to dealing with an escalating situation feel ripped slackly from “Fargo.” Qualley, so good in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” (2019) and last year’s “Sanctuary,” furthers her blossoming CV with an energetic, scene-pushing presence bolstered by an affable southern twang, and Viswanathan makes for a good offset. The chemistry between the two carries the uneven mishmash as it stumbles early and struggles to regain its quirky vibe. Also in the mix, in small raucous parts, are Matt Damon as a Florida Man, Colman Domingo as the goon handler, Pedro Pascal on ice, Beanie Feldstein (“Booksmart”) as Jamie’s brash law enforcement ex and Bill Camp as the car dispatcher no one listens to. At least this not-quite-fully-baked road comedy with a prize dildo set gone missing is a fast 84 minutes. (Tom Meek) At Somerville Theatre, 55 Davis Square, and AMC Assembly Row 12, 395 Artisan Way, Assembly Square, Somerville. After a near-death experience, paramedic Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson), starts experiencing déjà vu and other ESP strangeness. Set in 2003 Queens, Cassie has a vision of some guy named Ezekiel Sims, a muscular man who dons a black costume and kills three teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor), and at the premonition point intervenes and protects them. That inspires her to explore the source of her and Ezekiel’s powers, which predate the birth of Peter Parker, the Spider-Man most of us know. The Sony Spider Universe that “Madame Web” is a part of includes “Venom” (2018), “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” (2021) and “Morbius” (2022), and while it might not be the worst of the lot, it’s so low-energy, lackluster and middling that it may be the least memorable. Except for Adam Scott and Zosia Mamet in small, quirky parts, the cast has no chemistry and most line reads feel leaden and stiff. Director S.J. Clarkson, who has delivered strong visuals in television series that include Marvel’s “Jessica Jones” (2015-2019) and “The Defenders” (2017) on Netflix, resorts to regurgitating images from the X-Men franchise and the Ancient One of “Doctor Strange” (2016). The film does maintain one inscrutable, unsolved mystery: Sony’s reason to rehire “Morbius” co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to write another script (along with Claire Parker – no relation to Peter). The film’s only winning narrative asset is the tension of how without any physical superpowers, Cassie can trump Ezekiel’s daunting physical prowess. (Sarah G.

"Feb 26, 2024",negative," They’re just trolling us now. Hollywood. The entertainment-industrial complex. We gave them our geeky all: our money, our attention, our time. From 80s GenX kids *raises hand* who leaned hard into mega franchises — Star Wars, Back to the Future, and beyond — to the early Zoomers who came of cinematic age with the beginning of the MCU in the post 9/11 era… some of us even molded our entire personalities around the wonderfully engaging, smartly fantastical stories they told us. That was always going to be a bad idea, and now that bad idea is slapping all of us in the face: We gave them our hearts, and now they’re giving us garbage. Because they think they can get away with it. Because they took us for granted. Look: superhero fatigue might not have been a thing with audiences if the movies had just, you know, kept up. Not been junk. Yes, making movies is hard, but it’s not that hard, because cinemaniacs are always able to forgive a lack of resources. But a lack of authenticity? A lack of genuine enthusiasm? Not so much. These movies didn’t need to get bloated — bigger, ahem, isn’t always better — and they didn’t need to require homework, like watching all the ancillary streaming series. This isn’t how it had to be. They could have… just… given us good, honest stories. Madame Web? It’s almost impossible to see this travesty as a goodnatured mistake. This is a movie sprouted solely from the depths of corporate cynicism. From Sony attempting to glom onto the success for another studio of the MCU even though the company owned nothing of Marvel Comics except Spider-Man. And so in recent years we’ve gotten Spider-Man–adjacent flicks from Sony including Morbius and two Venom flicks. And now Madame Web. They’ve all been nothing but pop-culture jokes, and Sony doesn’t seem to grasp why. The movie’s Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson, bless: Bad Times at the El Royale, Fifty Shades Freed) is a paramedic in New York City in 2003. Why 2003? Is it to capitalize on the very solemn, very serious hangover from 9/11 in which the city was of course still wallowing a mere two years later? Especially for a paramedic, whom we might expect would have seen some traumatic shit that day? LOL, not at all. As far as I can determine, it’s so the movie can insert itself into the Tom Holland–as–Spider-Man timeline as established by the MCU. Because Cassie’s EMS partner is called Ben Parker (Adam Scott, the best thing here: The Disaster Artist, Fun Mom Dinner). Whose sister Mary (Emma Roberts: Palo Alto, We’re the Millers) is hugely pregnant and about to pop with a baby boy whose name she has not yet settled on. I’ll spell out the tease for those who don’t get it (though I’m not sure why you’d have any interest in reading a review of Madame Web if you didn’t): the blatant implication is that Mary is about to give birth to Peter Parker, who will become Spider-Man a decade and a half later, while he is being raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt Martha May. (There’s no Martha May here, but Ben does ominously drop the news that he’s just “met someone.” *groan*) [ETA: Martha? Why did I say that name? Why did I say that name?!] The desperation to ride the Spider-Man coattails is pathetic enough, but what are the odds that Ben Parker would happen to have two different unrelated people in his life who have acquired superpowers through a spider bite? Cassie’s spider wasn’t radioactive, just a naturally exotic denizen of the Amazonian rain forest — see, her mom (Kerry Bishé: The Fitzgerald Family Christmas, Argo) was researching these spiders while hugely pregnant, and was bitten just before giving birth and dying. And then, when Cassie, bizarrely, steps out of the 2003 action to take a side trip to Peru to investigate, she meets the local tribesman (José María Yazpik) who helped her mom and knows all about the spider bite, and gravely intones: “When you take on the responsibility, great power will come.” It’s like what Peter Parker learns about great power and great responsibility, but flipped, or something. Honestly, it’s exhausting trying to find ways to boil down all the convoluted, coincidence-laden nonsense of this movie in a way that doesn’t make me sound incoherent. Watching it all unfurl onscreen is kinda gobsmacking, yet also way duller than you’d imagine — it’s not even so bad it’s fun. And I’ve barely scratched the surface! Never mind Uncle Ben being knee-deep in spider-people — after the events of this movie, when Peter Parker’s Spider-Man comes along later, the people of New York shoulda been, like, What, more weirdoes in spider spandex? Cuz, like… Cassie ends up mentoring three teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced [Dora and the Lost City of Gold], and Celeste O’Connor) to become spider-themed crime fighters, and their origin story — which is also what this movie is about — involves battling wealthy businessman Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim [Mary Magdalene, Grand Central], shamefully wasted), who also has spider powers and spider spandex. The movie has no idea why Sims is evil or what he does in his spider spandex when he’s not trying to kill these girls. The movie doesn’t even know what sort of “business” he’s in. It’s all a bafflingly lazy stew of comic-book clichés. (One of the girls mentions, totally randomly, her “Uncle Jonah,” the only purpose of which is to make you think of J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper editor who will later employ Peter Parker as a photographer.) We can “blame” screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (who together wrote Gods of Egypt and Dracula Untold), Claire Parker, Kerem Sanga, and S.J. Clarkson. (Clarkson also directs, her feature debut after a long career as a TV director. This movie often has the small, cheap look of a 1990s cable show.) But they will have had little control over much of what we are subjected to here. It’s plain that Sony actually had little trust in fan interest in the Madame Web character as she is depicted in the comics: she is an elderly woman, disabled because of an autoimmune and neuromuscular disorder, with multiple psychic superpowers (none of this the result of a spider bite!). She could have been, onscreen, another Charles Xavier, X-Men’s Professor X. But that would have required casting a much older woman in a very different sort of story. The beginning of where this all went so disastrously wrong is right there: Sony didn’t really want to make an authentic Madame Web movie. It just wanted to wring whatever it could out of its sliver of Marvel Comics. Kerry Bishé gives one of the best TV performances of all time in Halt and Catch Fire, especially as the show leans into its final season. I really, really wish she was getting better work. Venom, I’ve never cared for personally, but is definitely the most popular Spider-Man villain who was introduced since Spidey’s classic era, and has carried several solo miniseries and ongoing series. It wasn’t crazy to think he might carry a movie or two. Even Morbius has had a long tradition of existence to Marvel Comics as well as the community at large. He too has been a headliner at times, albeit a B-lister at best. Not the craziest idea for a solo film among the Spider-characters Sony has available, though maybe 10-15 years late to ride the Twilight wave of vampire protagonists. Madame Web has had something like 50 appearances over 40-some years, all as a supporting character and (unsurprisingly for an elderly paralyzed woman in an action-dominated genre) never a fan favorite. The only thing that makes any sense to me is that they wanted to do a Birds of Prey knockoff with three minor Spider-ladies and Madame Web as “the woman in the chair” supporting them. Not too bad an idea, actually, but why they thought audiences would be excited about a non-viable prequel to the viable concept, I don’t understand. I guess it makes sense as the same sort of hubris that led to “Universal’s Dark Universe” and other attempts to artificially engineer the success of the MCU, but you’d think Sony would have gotten the message about such attempts by now. If I was in their shoes, I’d just make a Spider-Woman movie, using whichever one of the half-dozen or more examples strike their fancy. (You’re right about NYC having a plethora of Spider-people!) Spider-Gwen/Ghost Spider seems like a no-brainer to me, as she’s popular, including with kids, and has a great visual look that doesn’t seem like a total copy of Peter Parker’s suit. I’m a completionist. I tend to start series at the beginning rather than “when it got good”. Board game Kickstarter absolutely saw me coming with its exclusive add-ons. Left alone I’d probably have got enthusiastically into the MCU in spite of not being much of a superhero fan. But the more they said “and you have to watch this side series and read that comic”, and the more I tried to do that and saw those side series’s interesting ideas being sunk under the weight of Generic Superhero Stuff (done on a TV series budget), the less interested I became even in the core films. A reference can be a neat line that makes sense in context, which also gives a little dopamine hit to someone who knows where it came from; or it can be something which brings the film to a halt while your attention is forced onto it, so that you know you are Missing Out by not having watched More Superheroes Angsting and Occasionally Hitting Things Season 5. Go home and stream it now! What’s funny to me is that, at least in my perception* the most recent batch of MCU movies and TV shows have actually been much less interconnected. With The Marvels, for instance, I think audiences will totally get Kamala Khan’s deal whether they saw Ms. Marvel or not (though it should encourage them to go back and watch it.) And you might logically think Secret Invasion would be “required reading” for The Marvels, but it’s completely not, to the point that if you watched both, you’d be confused at how the show isn’t acknowledged in any way whatsoever. And I don’t think you need to know much more than “You know who the Hulk is, right, from the Avengers?  Works with Captain America?  Jen’s his cousin.” to fully enjoy She-Hulk."
"Feb 25, 2024",negative," But for an editorial swerve, Madame Web could have been Hamlet. By which I mean cursed with a line that has the audience on such tenterhooks waiting for it they almost miss the rest. In the end we don’t actually get to hear the much-mocked quote from the trailer – “Ezekiel Sims; he was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died” – though we do get to see mom with him in the Amazon while researching spiders right before she died.  Cassie Webb’s mum does then die in the Amazon, in 1973, after being bitten by a massive spider and then immediately giving birth to a baby. Oops I mean being bitten by a spider and then giving birth to a massive baby. 30 Years later, Cassie has grown into a grumpy paramedic with only one jacket, though this is 2003 before fast fashion really hits. She has a pet cat which is even bigger than she was as a baby, a sweet apartment no one more junior than a plastic surgeon could now afford, and excellent driving skills, which also seem to have fallen by the wayside in the intervening 20 years.  An unexpected dip in the river in a crashed car leaves her dead for several minutes, and, once reanimated, blessed/cursed with seeing the future; though her immediate superpower seems to be the ability to pop balloons remotely while eating a sausage on a stick. And, well, it’s not very cinematic but she could have made a fortune at kids’ birthday parties if she’d just stuck to that.  Yes Shark Exorcist, you retain your crown as worst film I have ever seen, demonic nuns and all. Madame Web is however bookended by scenes of such dreadful ridiculousness, and such appalling acting, that if you fell asleep into your popcorn in the middle you might indeed think it was a bona fide stinker. Even the middle bit, while not terrible, never reaches any great heights. Actually the whole film feels like a two hour pilot for a superhero series aimed at smallish children. Not much happens, and what does happen we tend to see twice, as a good chunk is Cassie seeing the future, then living through it in an attempt to stop it. (In Greek mythology Cassandra was cursed by Apollo to see the future, but for no one to believe her.) Taking some time out to recover from the weird stuff that starts happening to her, Cassie starts having premonitions on a train, soon realising they involve three disparate teenage girls she then has to save from the clutches of a scuttlesome Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim).  The dialogue is often awful, and the movie moves forward in fits, starts and jerks, like they suddenly realised they need to explain something or get us somewhere. Cassie’s trip to Peru to reconnect with her dead mum is embarrassing, like a wellness therapy mini-break sold to wealthy Guardian readers. Though it’s not as embarrassing as Ezekiel Sims, a villain who makes Greta Thunberg look like Thanos. Crawling along ceilings and down walls he reminded me of those tiny sticky rubber figures – so beloved of British mums when tasked with filling 30 party bags for under a quid each – that “walk” head over heels down the window. Still, while Dakota Johnson is miscast (her style of acting just doesn’t work when you have to believe in an alternate universe, which generally seem more sincere than our own) I came to quite enjoy her deadpan delivery of Cassie’s general indifference to the world, whether doing entirely normal things or literally saving someone’s life.  The three young women she’s trying to save from Ezekiel’s black-spidersuited baddie – Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) – all have an existing connection to Cassie, and are, like the best teenagers, both perfectly nice and also extremely annoying; in this case mainly because they order a massive meal in a diner, putting themselves in huge danger, then don’t bother to eat the food. Literally every woman I know could be dining on a sinking Titanic in 1912 or picnicking on the sides of Vesuvius in 79AD and would resolutely gobble up every last crumb before leaving, so even in the weird world of superheroes that’s jumping the shark (exorcist).

"Feb 25, 2024",negative,"Imagine if you will, a thriller without thrills. A sisterhood movie without any chemistry between the vulnerable girls. A comic book movie without laughs. A superhero movie without heroes."
"Feb 24, 2024",negative," Sony and Marvel’s latest entry in their shared Spider-Man cinematic universe has no better comparison than that of a rickety wooden coaster you’d find at a family-owned amusement park: brutal on the body and precariously constructed. Directed by S.J. Clarkson and cowritten by Claire Parker and screenwriting duo Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, Madame Web could only synthesize into its final state from the particular alchemy of sleepwalking producers, drastic script rewrites, and an obvious disinterest from the cast. Audiences are starting to feel belabored by the diminishing returns of superhero interconnected universes after a recent string of misfires and flops. Alas, the machine must stay fed, and Sony executives seem eager to bleed their properties despite clear creative fatigue and mismanagement. Set in 2003, the film follows Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson), an aloof Manhattan paramedic who develops clairvoyant powers after a near-death experience. Cassie seems to awaken to these visions and pulses of the future and learns she can connect to a sort of dimensional, interconnected Spider-World. Thirty years earlier, Cassie’s pregnant mother gets betrayed and left for dead on an Amazonian expedition by her bodyguard Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who claims a fabled spider with healing properties for his own.  Sims’s physical capabilities are enhanced by the spider venom, but he’s perpetually haunted by visions of three Spider-Women who are fated to kill him in the future. He orders his hacker and research assistant, played by Zosia Mamet, to track them down now as teenagers, usually with his back turned to the camera and a hefty helping of ADR. Soon, teenagers Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) team up with a reluctant Cassie in a bid to protect themselves and uncover what truly connects them. Despite Sony going out of their way to establish the film as a “suspense thriller” in promotional pushes, the only suspense Madame Web can muster between scenes is the tepid anticipation to see how the film will squeeze in yet another conspicuous Pepsi advert. It doesn’t help that the cast is checked out beyond belief. Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor are entirely unconvincing as a unit, with lame jokes and put-upon vulnerability suffocating the pleasure in the absurdity of the film. It’s clear Johnson would rather be anywhere else judging from the blase performance she turns in here.  Madame Web’s ludicrous logistical leaps, dodgy visual effects, and aloof performances are oftentimes primetime so-bad-it’s-good junk food, though it can be hard to have fun when every hit of ironic dopamine is sandwiched between uninteresting scenes of prolonged nothing. PG-13, 116 min."
"Feb 24, 2024",negative,Ultimately everything just fell flat.
"Feb 23, 2024",negative," Unlike some (many?), I haven’t grown weary of superhero films as a genre. What I have grown exhausted by are specifically Sony-made Spider-Verse movies that try to walk the line between standalone works while also incorporating just enough Spier-Man-adjacent references to frustrate and infuriate viewers. I wish the makers of Madame Web had simply stayed away from all things Spider-Man (which is virtually impossible, once you understand the full breadth of the story). Instead, they drop in what they think are sly nods and easter eggs that are neither subtle nor clever. Much like the rest of the screenplay (it took four people to write this!), the references are ham-fisted and all-around sloppy, and leave us with the promise of a better sequel that I can almost guaranteed you will never be made. Let me give an example: the film is set very specifically in 2003, and there’s a character named Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), who is probably eight months pregnant. Please feel free to do the math on who her baby is. She’s married to a man (whom we never see) whose brother is Ben Parker (Adam Scott) and who is really looking forward to being an uncle to this newborn—all the fun, none of the responsibility (that’s what he thinks). And no, I don’t consider any of this spoiler territory because the character names are right there on IMDB, and Scott is prominently featured in the trailers. All of this nonsense is a tease that never pays off. At one point, there’s a baby shower for Mary, during which the women in attendance have to guess the baby’s name. The game is interrupted before the inevitable name drop, so I’m thinking that reveal is coming at the end of the film (which it probably was at one point). But no, there aren’t even any mid- or post-credits scenes in Madame Web to tuck away such a choice nugget of web-slinging joy. But of course, anything involving the Parkers is shoehorned into the mostly unrelated story of Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), whose mother (Kerry Bishé) was killed in the rainforests of Peru while searching for a rare breed of spider whose venom might be the key to curing any number of diseases. She is also very pregnant, and in the company of security specialist Ezekiel Sims (French actor Tahar Rahim, most recently seen in Napoleon), who betrays her when she finds the spider and accidentally shoots her before absconding with the specimen. But a tribe of locals with mysterious spider-like powers (and outfits that look a lot like Spider-Man’s duds, if they were made on Gilligan’s Island) show up to try and save her by injecting her with the aforementioned spider venom. The mom dies but baby Cassandra lives and is sent home to live out her years in New York's foster care system. Cassandra grows up to become a paramedic (alongside partner Ben Parker) and after a near-death experience in which she almost drowns, she starts having visions of things that will happen in the immediate future, things she can change if she does something different or gets someone else to change their behavior. She sees herself and other people die, and so she does all that she can to save everyone in her visions. We also find out that Ezekiel is a little more adept at seeing the future than using the spider venom repeatedly, and he envisions three young women in various spider-themed costumes and powers defeating him in a fight. So, he hires a computer expert (Zosia Mamet) to track them down so he can kill them. Ezekiel actually functions as a costumed individual who leaps and crawls and has the general acrobatic skills of a certain Spider-Man who won’t actually exist for a couple of decades. During the course of her day-to-day happenings, Cassandra just happens to run into all three of these young women (minus their powers) around the city, including a rich kid whose parents are never around, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney, complete with schoolgirl outfit); Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who has been living with her immigrant grandfather illegally in Cassandra’s building; and skater punk and general troublemaker Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). Cassandara saves their lives when Ezekiel attacks them on a train, and they are basically stuck together for the rest of the film, although the police seem to think Cassandra has kidnapped them. Like many aspects of Madame Web, it’s a running gag that never pays off. As mentioned, most of the film is about the potential for something cool that we never get. The only time we see the three young women in their admittedly cool superhero costumes are in visions of the future. We’re not even given their future superhero names (for the record, two of them are different incarnations of Spider-Woman in the comic books, while Corazon goes by the name Araña), probably because they don’t want to make fans mad that these are in any way Spider-man related. In broader terms, first-time feature director S.J. Clarkson wants us seeing the Madame Web identity as someone who uses her powers to see the connections between people before the world makes them happen. As the film goes on, Cassandra is able to see further into the future and make more sweeping changes and adjustments to the world-to-come that makes her immensely powerful and able to lead the team of young women to fight crime down the road, presumably enhancing them with venom from this rare spider. Who the hell knows? Placing the Parkers in close proximity to Cassandra seems to serve no purpose, at least not in this story, but the implication is that somewhere down the line this powerful spider might be the reason that this universe’s Peter gets his powers, and not some radioactive arachnid. Again, it’s all about teasing the potential without actually seeing it to any kind of satisfying conclusion. And it makes the entirely of Madame Web frustrating in its best moments and downright infuriating in its worst. I also realized while watching this movie is that, while Dakota Johnson is fully capable of turning in great performances when given great material, she’s not quite capable of elevating mediocre material. She’s as bored and uninvested in her character and this movie as we are, and it clearly shows. Madame Web feels like it was chopped up and re-assembled from another, probably equally poor film, and the result is a wildly uneven, uninspired mess. Did you enjoy this post?

"Feb 23, 2024",neutral,"This movie isn't bad, it held my attention throughout, but it is mediocre. It lacks the kind of compelling action, humor and drama of the better Marvel movies."
"Feb 22, 2024",negative,"Despite its amazing cast lineup, From tonal confusion, to a near laughable script, There was not one single redeeming quality this film had to offer."
"Feb 22, 2024",negative," 
Written by five writers (including Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless of the aforementioned Morbius), Madame Web operates in a similar vein in all the wrong ways. It's not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, instead merely being a cog in Sony's live action Spider-Man Without Spider-Man-Verse, a half-hearted, corporate character rights-based attempt to expand the world of the web-slinging Spider-Man — without him being around — by focusing on characters adjacent to him. This time it's Cassandra Webb, gamely played by Dakota Johnson, who is living in New York City in 2003. She works as a paramedic with the superhero genre's most memorable modern uncle, Ben Parker (because of course she does), while largely keeping to herself and her cat. Briefly played by a wasted Adam Scott before he vanishes almost entirely from the movie, this movie's Uncle Ben is the first of many bizarre and painfully hamfisted references to other better superhero stories. And all of them land with dull thud after dull thud.
 
The more self-contained main narrative of Madame Web begins with Cassandra's mother who died giving birth to her after going out into the Peruvian Amazon in 1973 to research spiders believed to have healing properties. The awkward line explaining this — which was in the trailer and endlessly skewered because of the stilted way it sounds — is merely the beginning of the movie's unending and woefully poorly written dialogue. Much of this clunky verbiage is given to the otherwise solid actor Tahar Rahim, who plays the film's sad excuse for a villain, Ezekiel Sims. He delivers said lines while he tries to search out three teenagers that he believes will kill him in the future. It then falls to Cassandra to save them following an accident at work where she drowns and comes back to life — only to suddenly be able to see through time.
 
While not the most imaginative of premises, this sounds like it could be almost schlocky superhero fun on paper. Instead, it's a slog, as the film goes through the same motions over and over again with no spark to any of it. When Cassandra begins to discover her power, the way this is dragged out is more tiresome than thrilling. Though quite straightforward, the film explains her powers to us multiple times, demonstrating a severe lack of trust in its audience. When Cassandra then properly meets the three youths, Julia (Spokane's own Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), they feel like cardboard cutout characters with no chemistry. This becomes increasingly perplexing as they get ditched multiple times, making it feel like even the film doesn't know what to do with them. The action they do get up to all feels empty — either brief or scattered CGI nonsense. Even a clumsy post-9/11 surveillance angle feels wildly undercooked for all that it is supposedly gesturing toward.
 
If there is one small saving grace, it is Johnson. She has been great in films like the surprisingly stellar Suspiria remake and the regrettably buried Am I OK?, though this film doesn't even let her have fun with its powers. One early scene at a baby shower sees her getting a laugh on delivery alone, but that is soon forgotten in the mess to come. Even if you overlook some of the technical distractions — like entire lines of dialogue that have clearly been rerecorded and are not actually being spoken by the characters — paying attention does the experience no favors either. While much has been made of the looming death of the superhero subgenre, Madame Web is the film that truly feels like it may put the genre in its grave for a bit. But like the film's protagonist, it will likely be resurrected again. One just hopes it has more life than this.

"Feb 22, 2024",negative," The year is 2004, and you are 16. It’s the end of July, so to escape the sweltering heat, you and your friends see a movie at the mall. The movie is Catwoman, starring Halle Berry, but it could be anything. All you want is to be in a place with air conditioning that isn’t your house. You and your friends spend so much on chips and salsa at the mall Mexican joint and cheap jewelry at Claire’s that you barely have enough wadded up cash from your summer job to cover the ticket. In years to come, you’ll have fond memories of those friends, the virgin strawberry daiquiri you ordered, and even the cheap jewelry. You will remember nothing about the movie, except that it was bad. The year is 2024, and you’re 35. It’s February, and to avoid staring at the dead grass outside your window, you go to the theater with friends. The movie is Madame Web, starring Dakota Johnson, even though it should be something, anything else. Maybe it was the only movie that worked with everyone’s schedules, but like, come on. You’re an adult, you don’t want to see Poor Things or American Fiction?  You and your friends have full-time jobs, so you can get drinks beforehand, and even spring for popcorn at the theater. As the film starts, you’re hit with a wave of nostalgia, and it is decidedly mixed. The movie’s effects are terrible. The performances are flat, the character motivations barely existent.  And yet, as you watch, the flavors of restaurant salsa and syrupy mocktails flood your senses. The phantom weight of a tiger’s eye energy bracelet rubs against your wrist.  While the early-adolescent memories Madame Web inspires are good, the movie itself is undeniably a mess of the Catwoman variety. That the film is set in 2003 almost reads like an in-joke, because its whole vibe radiates the “how do we make a superhero movie/why are we even bothering?” ethos that defined comic book adaptations from 2000-2005.  If you’re looking for a nostalgic afternoon spent hooting at an incompetently made movie with your friends while you slam Clearly Canadians and cartons of Hot Tamales in the back row, you’re in for a treat. In all other cases, you’re better off spending your time and money elsewhere. Madame Web follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), an EMT in New York who grew up an orphan after her mom died while studying spiders in the Amazon. After a near-death experience, Cassie gets visions that allow her to see a few moments into the future. These visions bring her in contact with a trio of teens (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor) who are each being targeted by a creep in a suit (Tahar Rahim, trying and failing to force an American accent). It turns out Rahim’s baddie, Ezekiel Sims, is the guy who killed Cassie’s mom and made her an orphan! He’s after the girls because in the distant future, they’ll be superheroes (with powers they currently don’t possess, but whatever) and kill him. The plot threads binding these story beats together are as delicate as an actual spider’s web, albeit woven by a drunk spider. This is the kind of movie that repeats lines three different ways so that you can’t miss the implications of what people are saying, only to jump to a scene where a character drops a piece of exposition that makes no sense.  Characters behave in ways no normal human would. At one point Cassie decides she needs to go to Peru to find herself, and just…gets there seconds later (by now she’s wanted for presumably kidnapping the teens in her care, so how she managed to hop an international flight last minute during a historically heavy crackdown in airport security is beyond me). You see where this is going. Madame Web is “bad movie podcast” bad. It’s “Make-your-own-MST3K” bad. It’s also “Bored teenager with spending money” bad, which can be kind of fun if you’re a) a bored teenager, or b) a bored adult looking to replicate that experience, but with all of the things you couldn’t treat yourself to when you were a bored teenager. "
"Feb 21, 2024",negative," They’ll be laughing at this one for decades. Awkward, sloppy, staggeringly incoherent, there is little evidence to suggest that anyone involved in Madame Web knew what they were doing. The catastrophe extends all the way to the top of the queue. Dakota Johnson, struggling to hide her disinterest from the outset, takes an inherently awful screenplay and somehow makes it worse. Sydney Sweeney wears the look of a performer who forgot to learn her lines. Meanwhile, Tahar Rahim, the charisma-free villain of this cack-handed superhero tale, is forced to compete with some hideous post-production interference. The screen is fine; the projector isn’t broken, and the speakers are correctly fixed – it’s just bad overdubbing. Like, really, really bad. Sony did not arrange an advance press show for critics – I can see why. What, you may ask, is Madame Web? Comic enthusiasts will tell you she’s a mutant clairvoyant, a beloved staple of the Marvel cannon, and a helpful chum to your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. ​For the uninitiated, the cinematic version exists in some far-flung corner of Sony’s so-called Spider-Man Universe – which is to say that this bafflingly disorganised feature has nothing to do with the Tom Holland Spidey pictures. But it might be a distant cousin to the decrepit Venom franchise. Or something. It matters as much to me as it does to anyone else in this baggy, bewildering film. Squint your eyes and - if you’re lucky – you will just about make out the plot. A preposterous epilogue introduces Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé), a poorly sketched scientist researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon. The year is 1973 and a pregnant Constance is obsessed with rare arachnids and their alleged healing powers. Why, exactly, we’re not entirely sure – but everything goes sideways after Constance’s moustachioed explorer pal, Ezekiel Sims (Rahim), shoots her in the chest, steals her magic spider jar and leaves her for dead. Luckily for Constance, the magical Amazon spider people show up (stop giggling down the back) to save the baby. Fast-forward 30 years, and Cassie Webb (Johnson) is all grown-up. Our moody protagonist knows very little about her mum, and why she died chasing spiders in the jungle. Cassie isn’t really a people person, but hey, she’s a New York paramedic – a real-life superhero without the stupid costume. Her one and only friend at work (Adam Scott’s Ben Parker) thinks there’s more to Cassie than meets the eye, and he might be right. Across town, meanwhile, the slippery Mr Sims appears to have used his magical spider power to acquire a vast fortune. Alas, our grumpy baddie is haunted by nightly visions of his own death. Sims, it appears, will die at the hands of three Spider-Women, and so he makes it his mission to find them before they find him. What he doesn’t count on, however, is a stranger messing with his plan and, following a near-death experience on the job, Cassie acquires powers of her own. She can see into the future, which means she knows exactly what’s going to happen to the aforementioned Spider-Women (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced). I’d love to tell you more, but I might die of boredom. ​Some Marvel fans might appreciate the Ben Parker subplot. Mr Scott is, essentially, playing a younger, sexier Uncle Ben from the Spider-Man flicks. However, the inclusion of a story in which Ben and Cassie attend a baby shower for the unborn Peter Parker, ranks among the stupidest moves in comic book film history. Spare a thought for SJ Clarkson, the British filmmaker tasked with managing this sorry, pitiful exercise in blockbuster entertainment. Her film boasts no less than five screenwriter credits (always a troubling sign), and occasionally looks and sounds as if it is being edited in front of us. The relentless product placement is hilarious (three cheers for Pepsi, the film’s fizziest co-star). The action sequences are useless, the dialogue is all over the place, and the grainy special effects appear unfinished. It’s an ugly, toneless film, a superhero feature without charm, without humour, without spectacle. It seems unfair to point the finger at its leading woman – but Johnson is genuinely appalling. She looks fed up here, and guess what? I know the feeling. A film so bad, it would almost put you off going to the cinema."
"Feb 21, 2024",negative," Madame Web is the third entry into a Spider-Man-less cinematic universe made up entirely of Spider-Man characters and the returns keep diminishing. For all of the goodwill that Tom Hardy‘s (inspired?) performance as Venom created, Morbius poisoned Sony’s efforts irreparably. When the Madame Web trailer debuted, the mood around the film soured to mockery. You know the line. When Julia (Sydney Sweeney) asks Cassie (Dakota Johnson) about a man in a Polaroid, Cassie replies, “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died.” Fortunately, Madame Web isn’t the train wreck that Morbius was, but it is not an improvement either. Exposition replaces dialogue, franchise-seeding takes precedence over making characters authentic, and the action is underwhelming. Part of that may be by design. A lower budget means less spectacle and less spectacle helps Madame Web feel different from every other Marvel release. That works in the film’s favour as the stakes are relatively low. After a decade where every superhero climax means the end of the world, the survival of three women feels refreshingly low-key—even if those three women are future superheroes. Paramedic Cassie Webb survives an accident that leaves her with newfound powers: the ability to see forward in time. Cassie wastes no time in exploring her time loop gift and establishing a quick formula. Fail hilariously, quip, and try again. For that reason, the time loop sub-genre is popular to revisit. Whether the loops are about Bill Murray trying to be nice (Groundhog Day), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti surviving a wedding (Palm Springs), or Tom Cruise trying to survive at all (Edge of Tomorrow), the results are usually a hit with viewers. Madame Web risks threatening that streak. The plot, thin as it is, doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Cassie abandons her job with fellow EMT Ben (Adam Scott), using the time she has to unite Sweeney’s Spider-Woman, Isabela Merced’s Arana, and Celeste O’Connor as another Spider-Woman. The only problem? They aren’t those heroes yet, and they don’t see Cassie as anything more than an overworked ambulance driver. As Cassie fights to keep these future spider heroes alive, antagonist Ezekiel Sims (a criminally wasted Tahar Rahim) hunts them down, hoping to prevent a timeline where they kill him. But with duelling time-loopers, wouldn’t they fight each other for eternity? Such is the problem with the sudden influx of multi-verses and time-traveling heroes. Superhero fatigue is in high gear, but that’s not why films like Morbius and Madame Web do poorly. If a story succeeds on its own merits, the status of a shared cinematic universe is irrelevant. Even with the DCEU’s problems, people went to see The Batman in droves. Rushed stories cash a quick buck on Marvel’s popularity, but word spreads fast when people dunk on the movie all weekend on social media. The “with great power…” quote that we all know is tweaked to something clumsier, in the studio-mandated way of giving people the same thing but slightly warmed over with a new ingredient no one wanted. The line drew a laugh from the audience. However, I don’t want readers to walk away thinking nothing in Madame Web works. The practical suits are a nice touch, though it’s hard to ignore that the women wearing them are likely the reason behind the choice. Sydney Sweeney of Euphoria fame is a gifted performer (watch Reality), but none of that is why she’s featured on a one-sheet in skin-tight spandex. It’s a lazy ploy, but one that will sell tickets.
 As endearing cast as the cast is, they can only do so much with the material. The film relies on the vibes of Johnson, Sweeney, and Adam Scott, yet they’re constantly bogged down with ridiculous exposition and running away from garish CGI. Then there’s the impractical camera work. Sudden zooms work in Succession because they reveal a tic or reaction from characters as developments inform a scene. It acts as visual whiplash during most of Madame Web, tearing attention away from dialogue that already sets your mind to wander. The characters aren’t defined particularly well. Not even Johnson’s protagonist. Cassie is our in for the story, but there’s nothing special that binds you to her plight. Scenes of the four women hanging out are satisfying, but only because they derive from the kinship of the actresses’ charisma. Watching the group sing karaoke along to Britney Spear’s “Toxic” is a highlight, but, again, not because of anything the script brings. S.J. Clarkson, who directed episodes of several notable TV shows, handles the reins, making the most of the limited budget. But the script, by Morbius writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, is lifeless. Sony’s universally-beloved animated Spider-verse is one of the best things going on in movies. Tom Holland’s run as the MCU’s Spider-man is equally popular. So why is the live-action villain universe in such disarray? The Venom franchise succeeds because Tom Hardy leans into its B-movie sensibilities whenever possible. Madame Web has no direction. And without direction, all you can expect is flailing. In a year where DC and Marvel have two film releases pending, Sony is putting out three comic book films. Sony should stop diluting their shared Spider-Man universe, but with Kraven The Hunter coming in August and Venom 3 in November, the corporate churn continues. Partially because Sony releases these films to keep ownership of the Spider-man film rights from going back to Marvel. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men. In this Unboxing video, Jason Gorber checks out the Joni Mitchell Archives Volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release."
"Feb 21, 2024",negative," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. The funny thing about watching audiences cool off from big-budget comic book adaptations in recent years is how, if you lived through the very early aughts, it almost feels like things are going back to the way they used to be. After years of Marvel tentpoles dominating the box office, it’s been easy to forget how unabashedly unserious these kinds of projects usually were outside of the handful that put the genre on the map.  But before the rise of the MCU, Bad Comic Book Movies™ — projects that didn’t take themselves or their source material all that seriously — were generally the rule rather than the exception. And while they might not have been great, they were the sort of films audiences knew how to have fun with. It’s only since multiverses became the hot new thing in Hollywood that studios have gotten comfortable even acknowledging (and capitalizing on people’s nostalgia for) those halcyon days when Spider-Man’s webbing was organic. But unlike some of Sony’s other recent Spider-Man features which have been more focused on bringing specific characters and actors back from past franchises, director S. J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is far more interested in revisiting a specific moment in comic book movie history — one defined by iffy costumes, perplexing plots, and a palpable sense of on-screen embarrassment. Set in a curious pocket of Sony’s larger Spider-verse of films where it’s still 2003, and Spider-Man himself doesn’t exist, Madame Web tells the tale of Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), an acerbic paramedic whose life takes a series of strange turns one day when she (briefly) dies while saving a man’s life. As an adult orphan whose mother died in the Amazon while researching spiders, Cassandra has a hard time connecting emotionally with anyone who isn’t her colleague Ben Parker (Adam Scott), or the stray cat that regularly wanders into her New York City walkup.  But after a routine emergency rescue leads to Cassie plummeting to her death, she awakens to find herself imbued with an ill-defined set of precognitive powers, and while she has no idea what to make of her alarming visions, it soon becomes clear that they’re all guiding her toward a trio of young girls. Disorienting exposition dumps in a film’s opening act are almost always a warning sign, but the way Madame Web clunkily juxtaposes a flashback to Cassandra’s past with glimpses into her charges’ futures almost makes it feel as if the filmmakers are trying to keep you from understanding what’s going on. Though his motivations are unclear, it’s simple enough to grasp in Madame Web’s first few minutes that perpetually barefoot explorer Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is eager to kill three masked women wearing spider-themed superhero costumes. It’s clear Madame Web wants you to wonder who Sims’ targets are, and why they don’t just use their powers to stop him in his tracks.  But instead of teasing their identities out, the movie just dumps Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) into Cassandra’s lap about half an hour in at a point when there are already too many other things going on.  Sony’s plan to build out an entire cinematic universe on just the Spider-Man IP alone has always felt a bit dubious, but in Madame Web’s younger leads, you can almost see how the plan could work. Similar to Cassandra, the girls have all been orphaned (at least emotionally), and they need someone to guide them through the madness of being teenagers.  You can also see how the girls’ thinly fleshed-out personality quirks might one day make them an interesting team of Spider-Women, and how Madame Web’s really a story about Cassandra stepping into her role as a mentor to a quippy new generation of heroes. But as present as that narrative intention is, the film doesn’t really set its characters up to feel like real players in a cohesive story, and the girls wind up being pushed into the background — first as they’re introduced as out-of-focus extras in the periphery of Cassandra’s story, and later as she takes the girls under her wing to protect them from Sims by… ditching them in the woods. Between its frantic set pieces in which the camera lens can never seem to decide where it wants to focus, and the way Madame Web’s script briskly bounces between scenes, it’s obvious that the filmmakers are trying to make you feel some of the deep discombobulation Cassandra herself is experiencing. Even though the execution is more than a little off, it’s a clever idea, and to the movie’s credit, Cassandra’s visions of being murdered by a knock-off Spider-Man are pointedly disturbing. But as much time as Madame Web spends telling you that Cassandra’s terrified for her and the girls’ lives you’d be hard pressed to get that impression from Johnson’s deadpan performance and the way she portrays her character as someone who approaches most situations with a pronounced sense of apathy. When you look at Madame Web as a modern comic book movie — one crafted with the knowledge of how much money these things can make — it’s hard to understand a lot of the choices that were made. But the film makes a hell of a lot more sense when you think of it not just as a movie set in 2003, but one that’s trying to evoke the vibes of comic book movies from that era. The signs are there pretty much from the jump, but it isn’t until Mis-Teeq’s “Scandalous” is dropped in during an action sequence that it becomes shockingly obvious how much Madame Web has in common with the 2004 Catwoman starring Halle Berry in terms of both films feeling like doomed misfires from the very beginning. Rather than any of Sony’s previous Spider-Man spinoff films, the confusing way Madame Web reworks Julia, Mattie, and Anya’s origins makes the movie play much more like something out of the era that gave us the first Daredevil movie and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. People like to look back on that point in superhero movie history fondly now because enough time has passed for those films to shift into cult classic territory. But the simple truth is that, for quite a while, big budget cape projects missed as often as they hit, and with Madame Web technically being a follow-up to Morbius and a precursor to Kraven the Hunter, it’s fair to say that Sony’s definitely returned to that time."
"Feb 21, 2024",positive," One of the skewed ironies of the 2010s superhero movie era is that Sony’s Spider-Man spin-offs were greenlit out of a mercenary desire by Sony to craft their own cinematic universe and yet exist as among the most explicitly stand-alone cape flicks of their time. S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is a period piece set in 2003 that was supposed to be more closely tied to the Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland Spider-Man franchise until someone realized the math didn’t math. Rather than go the Texas Chainsaw 3-D route of hoping nobody notices or cares about timeline discrepancies, the film hides its broader continuity connections to an almost comical degree. It also has no illusions of pretension, operating as a wantonly silly and openly comic fantasy closer to “The Dead Zone meets The Terminator” than a conventional four-color actioner. It’s also, okay, it’s not “good,” but it’d be an enjoyable romp if tickets still cost $5 on a Saturday afternoon.  I'd never considered the connection between America's obsession with national/global security post-9/11 and its connection to superhero fandom—something to ponder. Despite the negative reviews, I'm still excited to see this one. "
"Feb 21, 2024",negative," by Walter Chaw S.J. Clarkson’s Madame Web is a rare and specific variety of disaster, which is interesting because it’s largely centred around a rare and specific variety of spider. That is to say, not “interesting” so much as unintentionally ironic or something. Rain on your wedding day, 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife, you know? The mass-appealing, notes-driven, “for dummies,” not-entirely-accurate pop-cultural definition of a literary conceit. This reminds me of the swoony, heartthrob moment where Ethan Hawke defines “irony” perfectly in Reality Bites. I don’t actually remember what he says, though, because I haven’t seen that movie since its 1994 release–about ten years before the events of Madame Web, the screen debut of Marvel mutant Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), who’s named after the Greek archetype who can see the future but no one listens to her and Marc Webb, director of the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies. Just kidding. She’s named Webb because spiders spin them, with an extra “b” to throw you off the trail but not so violently that you don’t know it’s fucking with you. Madame Web (one “b,” because the picture is more invested in making sure you know it’s related to the lucrative Spider-Man franchise than in being such a tedious asshole) opens in 1973, with Cassandra’s super-pregnant mom Constance (Kerry Bishé) tromping around the South American rainforest like Sean Connery in Medicine Man in search of a super-spider when…okay, that’s enough of that. Anyway, 30 years later, Cassandra is a paramedic who can sometimes see the future, but nobody believes her. You might have deduced that by her name is all I’m saying. Madame Web is, on one level, a Powerpuff Girls hangout flick. On another level, it’s that party where you met a girl who was so much sharper than you that you could never entirely figure out when and how she was castrating you, although it was constant and brutal and you learned maybe you were into the humiliation thing but she got bored and now you’re writing about her 30 years later. Every Dakota Johnson line-reading in this film is a balls-shrivelling, meme-in-the-making fusillade of ice-cold, patronizing derision. She is a human wrecking ball of unusual precision. There’s a scene at the midway point of Madame Web where Cassandra reads her dead mother’s journal: “Peptides… More peptides… Ah, here it is: spider-people. Las Araňas.” Then, to her cat, she says, “Have you ever heard of Los Araňas? Me neither.” She pronounces “Las Araňas” like that one remote anchor on your local news broadcast does–like you might if you were being a relentless son-of-a-bitch working something out of your front teeth as you carefully savoured each syllable for maximum “I’m pronouncing this eleventh-grade honours-Spanish correctly, what’s your problem?” She reads on to discover that they can move around like spiders, these Las Araňas, and, her deep blue eyes registering the shock (she is not shocked) of understanding (she already understands), she looks offscreen left and stage-whispers, “Like ceiling guy!” She’s referring to the villain of Madame Web, Ezekiel Sims (French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim), who appears to her in visions walking on the ceiling. The way she says it makes my scrotum retract all the way up into my body cavity. I’ve been spoken to that way before, and those bits don’t grow back, my friends. Dakota Johnson knows this scene is ridiculous. She knows it is housed in a ridiculous film. She is smarter than her own character, of course, but she is also smarter than anyone who worked on Madame Web and most of the people watching it, including me. Comprising the movie’s MacGuffin are three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor) Cassandra must protect from Ezekiel. She does this by catching glimpses of them being brutally murdered in a changeable future, then changing the future. Better might have been her sitting in a recliner opposite Ezekiel in a nice conversation nook and ripping his self-esteem out of his nose like a Pharaoh’s mortician armed with a bent wire made of arched-brow cremaster and silken-garrote condescension. Later, Sweeney’s Julia Cornwall looks at a picture of Cassandra’s mom and says, “She’s really pretty,” and Johnson offers the kind of thin-lipped smile that shuts down bars. I’ve experienced performances like this before, generally by people like Joan Crawford or Bette Davis in the last few steps of their career, when they were cast as psycho-biddies in poverty productions. Performances that are not performances. Performances that are measured in the recoil of every other celestial body in the vicinity from the gravity tides produced by the massive ego-density of artists who have accumulated so much inertial confidence throughout their lives and careers that they are more impenetrable than black holes. Dakota Johnson is as different from you as you are from a starfish. There is nothing the same about how you were raised and thus how you understand and experience the world. I want to be a satellite in her orbit just to observe her and occasionally squeal, “Oh no she didn’t!” when she cuts someone off at the knees with the effort a sociopathic child exerts ripping wings off a fly. I want to be the Carl Sagan to her cosmos."
"Feb 21, 2024",negative," Madame Web is about a paramedic, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), who receives semi-psychic powers, which are sometimey and not under her control. The scenes having to do with Cassie’s visions are confusing to say the very least, since they barge into the narrative with no preparation or context; they’re also edited as incoherently as every other action scene is here. The gist of the story is that Cassie, whose dead mom was trying to find a special spider in Peru, must protect three teenage girls (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor) who are in danger from the movie’s big bad (Tahar Rahim), who has his own future visions in which he sees the girls, in superhero costumes, killing him. Thus does the movie spoil its own ending about twenty minutes in.  Enjoy that glimpse of the girls in their Spider-Woman costumes — for that is their destiny, to be Spider-Women, as this film is Spider-Man-adjacent — in that early vision and right at the end, because that’s all you get in this supposed superhero movie. Most of it is a matter of Cassie and the girls running from the big bad, except for when Cassie pointlessly goes to Peru to find out her mom, who died while giving birth to her, was looking for that special spider so she could cure the disease she knew Cassie would be born with. The sequence seems about as useless as the scenes having to do with Ben Parker (Adam Scott), a fellow paramedic, and his pregnant sister Mary (Emma Roberts), who will give birth, the movie hints, to Peter Parker, aka the Spider-Man most of us know. This movie isn’t really for a viewer who has never seen a Spider-Man film before, but neither is it for those who have seen every Spider-Man film (or even one). The screen is loaded with actors visibly wishing they were anywhere else, most certainly including the dull-affect Dakota Johnson, who narrowly loses the “Calgon, take me away” contest to Zosia Mamet as the big bad’s hacker. (Bored-looking Mamet sits at her monitor watching for the girls and delivering pearls like “I think I got them.”) The saddest/funniest aspect of the whole ordeal, though, is that it seems convinced it’s the first of many adventures with this quartet — the three superpowered girls commanded/protected by Cassie. There will be no such sequels. We will never see these characters again. There will be no great future stories with Madame Web, or Cassie Webb, or Jack Webb for that matter. So the ending is one of those “The end? Nay — the beginning!” conclusions meant to make us thirst for more, when what we’re craving at that point is simple fresh air, or something stronger. Madame Web was directed by S.J. Clarkson, who also gets official screenwriting blame along with three others, and I suppose we’ve reached the point where women can make superhero movies as empty and unsatisfying as men can. Clarkson has been a prolific TV director, and I hope this film, whose problems are probably most accurately pinned on an insecure studio’s meddling, doesn’t squash her career. Tahar Rahim, too, is a better actor than this movie, which destroys his performance with that poor dubbing, would indicate. Nobody comes out of Madame Web looking good except maybe Kerry Bishé, who, as Cassie’s ill-starred mother, at least gets in and out fast. Everyone else has to pull on hip-waders and slosh through this sewage until the finish. "

"Feb 21, 2024",positive," There are also some really unique genre pictures like The Book of Clarence, some very sound family fare like Orion and the Dark and a movie where Jason Statham plays an action hero called a Beekeeper. Trying to turn Madame Web into the next laugh-a-minute disaster midnight movie was bound to happen. We live in a post-meme society, one where any film that’s distinctly flawed but still showing signs of real personality gets shoved into a joke box that labels it “this week’s Worst Movie of All Time.” It’s an exhaustive discourse, as the “Morbin’ Time” effect that doomed Madame Web before it really had a chance. It’s a shame, really, because despite its clear faults, the Dakota Johnson-led spinoff is really one of the more fascinating Marvel movies in some time. Morbius was truly awful; this is not that. Cut from a very particular cloth of risky 2000s comic book movies that likely fell victim to studio meddling, Madame Web feels haphazard and melodramatic in an oddly refreshing way. It’s not really a superhero origin story as much as it is a B-grade sci-fi thriller, and its efforts to canonize its setting into some sort of Marvel future feel so delightfully lifeless and unwilling, like someone dragging their resistant 8-year-old to a piano lesson. The film, on purpose or on accident, shows you how contrived the continuous shared universe mentality is, and it has some (perhaps unintended, but still present and effective) fun with that in a very non-meta way. Don’t necessarily mistake its mistakes for mistakes, we’ll argue. Kevin Feige built the MCU to absolutely avoid movies like this, ones that can fly off the rail at any given moment because of strange decisions and potentially off-putting weirdness due to the unholy blend of unwieldy creative vision, careless studio interference and Michael Bay-approved obviousness of product placement. This movie is his worst Marvel nightmare. Bizarre springs eternal with Madame Web, and that’s kind of nice to have something so baffling in execution and lacking in uniformity sport the Marvel logo. It’s not entirely successful, but there’s not much else like it besides the Venom movies. It’s also got a surprisingly wry sense of humor, as Johnson and S.J. Clarkson mine the corniness of the plot and the very relatable “annoyed millennial unsuccessfully trying to relate to sarcastic Gen Z kids” dynamics (in 2003, sure, but it still hits). Johnson is really quite impressive here, as she’s wholly aware of what kind of movie she’s in and how ridiculous some of it is. Like a pro, she still powers through it by selling the drama in some really shaky dialogue and nailing the punch lines, even when they’re not necessarily there. Some of this movie is dinged from the delivery process, but it’s actually decently intact. If anything, this is really better than most of the recent MCU movies. Madame Web might be really messy and occasionally encourage the wrong kind of audience participation, but if you go in willing to meet it on its wavelength, you might be surprised by how nice it is to watch one of these movies not necessarily know where it’s going or why it’s doing what it is. That’s the joy of risks. They don’t always pay off, but they rarely fail without genuine entertainment value. People will say plenty about this movie, but they cannot call it boring. The first half is pretty excellent, even if it starts to get a little lost in the sauce with the meta-narrative…however, the animation is splendid and most of the script and voice cast are very well-considered. It’s upper-tier DreamWorks, but it doesn’t quite have the conceptual cohesion of something like Inside Out, as great as Kaufman working in this space is. This is exactly what it should be, a rare example of the schlocky, B-grade action movie that strives to be more than a temporary meme soon lost to time. David Ayer cuts down the unnecessary plotting and keeps this humming along at an enjoyable clip, and Jason Statham understands the proper frequency here as well as any actor could. It’s wildly fun in stretches, and being rough around the edges in a good Expendables movie way is more than forgivable. I’d watch more Beekeepers. Josh Hutcherson is a great jerk. This is the kind of movie that would do great business on home video and develop a very loyal cult following and, in like 10 years, would be regarded as a very savvy genre picture that the youths of the time understood more than the folks who didn’t really get on its level. Alas, that’s not the world we’re in anymore, but I sure hope this one finds a second life on streaming because it really is a shame we get a proper successor to the 80s/90s movies like Heathers, The Lost Boys, the 1990s Addams Family movies and Edward Scissorhands that doesn’t immediately find its audience. It’s a movie made by someone who clearly loves the irreverence and aesthetics of Tim Burton, the oblong austerity of Barry Sonnenfeld, the wacky studio comedy vibes of Penelope Spheeris and the buoyant campiness of Joel Schumacher. Plenty of Joe Dante The ‘Burbs vibes in there, too. Maybe this will take off on Netflix or Peacock or something. It’s a good movie and deserved more than what it got being dumped in February with little fanfare. Kathryn Newton, Liza Soberano and Cole Sprouse are all aces. Jeymes Samuel walks a tight rope here between satire and earnest heart, and he does so marvelously. He’s such a confident artist, radiant and grand in the way he envisions his stories and very deft to the touch with the emotions. He’s got an old soul for the old Hollywood scope and booming score that sweeps you off your feet. There is a real dedication present to genre homage while twisting it around to meet his forward-thinking vision. It’s pretty marvelous what he pulls off here, maybe not quite as tight as The Harder They Fall but just as impressive, giddy and resonant. Samuel is a special filmmaker, and this is a very good film that deserved so much more than bad-faith readings and to be dumped in January on a crowded weekend. It’s a definite step down from the insane heights of the first film, but it’s still so much fun and so much more engaging than most of the superhero films made these days. It’s a shame this will be it for the DCEU, if only because you’d rather have unwieldy variance with real risk (hello, Madame Web) involved instead of more sameness. James Wan really did everything he could here to craft a rollicking adventure out of production issues that show the seams in the edit. This really reminded me of a less polished version of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, lacking the gravitas but making up for it in pure, chummy enjoyment. That has to count for something, right? I’m sad to see Jason Momoa’s time as Aquaman end; he was just perfect for the part, but I’m glad he got one last chance to flex his joy in playing the role, even if the vehicle is a bit more dinged up than before. Also, the sunken ship underworld is yet another huge example of why Wan needs to do a Star War. No director right now would be a better fit. I’d bet $5 the pitch for this movie was “Vacation … but with ducks on migration! … but also Finding Nemo … on the quality level of The Secret Life of Pets,” and the entire room stood in applause. It’s okay! Illumination is incapable of making anything but the same perfectly fine, risk-averse family film over and over and over again, which means you always leave reasonably satisfied but wholly static. They clearly just want to be Blue Sky with Minions instead of Scrat, and more power to them. They’ll probably never make a great movie, but they’ll make plenty decent enough ones. 3/4-star movies for days. This was, weirdly, the second-best animated film released in December 2023 about talking birds who must escape evil humans who want to cook them and serve them to consumers… it’s also got the second-best Mike White movie script involving the word “orange.” Go figure."
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," Just like a bug infestation, superhero movies can’t be stamped out. “Madame Web” is the latest attempt by a major studio to assure us that this genre is alive and well. Surely, there are still a few good movies left to be culled from the endless cosmology of comic books. This one has some lively directing and sensible casting entrapped in the webbing of an oddly stripped script. Director S.J. Clarkson is making her feature debut and genuinely tries to focus on a psychological angle, while trying to deliver what Sony wants, namely a costumed action fest linked to the “Spider-Man” franchise. The final result feels like a stretched out prologue with Dakota Johnson putting in effort to prove she wants to be in it. Many reviewers tend to compare a movie like this to ‘90s superhero duds, but here is another example of how that style carries on. It opens in a steamy jungle where researcher Constance (Kerry Bishé) is bitten by a mysterious spider and encounters slinging people known as the Araña (Spanish for spider). Constance dies but it turns out she was pregnant. In 2003 her grown daughter, Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Johnson), now works as a New York City paramedic. She’s been an orphan who likes the idea of staying single and not having children. She is also starting to get plagued by sudden visions into the near and distant future. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the very rich Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) beds society women he meets at the opera but is rattled by nightmares of three girls in spider costumes who kill him. He soon tracks them down to the same subway train. They are Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Luckily, Cassie happens to cross paths with them in time to help them fend off Ezekiel. It is a chaotic time in film when it comes to length. MCU movies are famously stretched out, yet “Madame Web” at 1 hour and 57 minutes feels like a lot of answers or essential plot points were cut out. How are Ezekiel’s three targets all conveniently on the same train? Why do they need to cross paths with Cassie randomly before she uses clairvoyance to find them anyway? Why does Ezekiel have a master hacker, Amaria (Zosia Mamet), who disappears half-way through the movie? Factory products of this sort are hard to blame on one sole person. The screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who also penned 2022’s infamously bad “Morbius,” is another take on a spiderverse character. Reportedly, this was meant to be a ‘90s nostalgia trip but for some reason was pushed into the early aughts, which accounts for the Cranberries needle drops combined with shots of billboards for Beyoncé’s “Dangerously in Love” album.  But there are some intriguing efforts present from the director. S.J. Clarkson tries to avoid depending too much on big CGI effects or overcooked action scenes. “I was engaged by the idea of clairvoyance and how cinematically that can be seen,” Clarkson recently told Entertainment Voice. “I was captivated by the idea of someone who uses their mind. That felt like an opportunity to do something different and lean into psychological storytelling. These stories tend to be about people overcoming something.” Some of the better scenes are the ones where Cassie attends a friend’s baby shower and is rudely interrupted by visions into the future, or moments where she nearly avoids a car wreck thanks to her gift. As the movie continues the inventiveness of the premise fights with the gimmick becoming a kind of inner trailer for what we assume is a sequel. For example, a lot of ads have shown Julia, Mattie and Anya in spider hero costumes forming a new team, but that’s not part of this movie. It’s just Cassie’s vision into what these girls will turn into in the future, meaning the future movie we’re expected to anticipate. Then there is Dakota Johnson, already outshining the movie with her recent media appearances discussing the project with open irony. She’s a gifted actor who has brought sincerity to schlock before as in “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Her approach to “Madame Web” is to bask in the absurdity and look very committed when discussing how her mom was bitten by a magic spider in the Amazon, or looking annoyed when babysitting her rowdy high schooler companions. She looks as if she’s in on the joke with us when she appears in the final scenes, decked in a wheelchair and dark shades, fully transformed into the title character. Her final grin seems to say, “I’m a famous actor hired to play a Marvel character, why not?” Everyone else is on autopilot, including Sydney Sweeney, who gets turned into a shy, nerdy schoolgirl twin of her “Euphoria” character. Tahar Rahim is beyond generic as the villain who looks like those business majors who spend every evening or crack of dawn at the gym, speeding off in a sports car to change into a costume similar to Spider-Man’s, except he’s evil. His grand finale is appropriately bland. It really just takes a falling neon sign to take out this kind of jerk. It’s easy to see in “Madame Web” potential in a director who can do strong thrillers or noirs moving forward and Johnson for a later shot at true costumed, popcorn glory. This is not a wreck on the scale of something like “Cats” or “Morbius.” Instead, it’s a movie that just doesn’t know what to do with the story. If Sony and Marvel simply focus on making a good film, as opposed to obsessively setting up new franchise chains, then we can have fun escapism that at least makes sense. “Madame Web” tries to stay grounded while being absurd, showcasing actors doing the best they can with a genre that is quickly gathering cobwebs and needs some decent sweeping before starting again."
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," A la paramédica Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson) le gusta salvar la vida de los demás. Es parte de su trabajo. Sin embargo, ella misma no se lleva muy bien con la gente y evita el contacto cercano con ellos siempre que puede. Su propia vida da un vuelco un día que cae al río durante una de sus misiones y casi se ahoga. Aunque escapa con un susto, sigue teniendo extrañas visiones y déjà vu. Sin embargo, las cosas se complican cuando tiene una visión de Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) asesinando brutalmente a tres adolescentes en el mismo tren. Gracias a su valiente intervención, consigue salvar las vidas de Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), Anya Corazón (Isabela Merced) y Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney).   Spiderman encabeza sin duda la lista de los superhéroes de cómic más importantes. Es un icono, ya sea en su versión animada o en una película de acción real, y hoy en día sigue generando grandes ingresos. No obstante, era justo mostrarse escéptico cuando hace años se anunció que Sony haría una película centrada en los personajes secundarios de SpiderMan, además de en el propio Universo Cinematográfico Marvel. Las burlas se acallaron cuando Venom se convirtió en un inesperado éxito de taquilla. Sólo unas pocas películas en solitario de Marvel han logrado recaudar 850 millones de dólares. La secuela Venom: Let There Be Carnage no pudo igualar esta cifra, pero 500 millones seguían siendo mucho dinero, sobre todo porque la película se estrenó durante la pandemia del coronavirus. Sin embargo, Morbius, la tercera película de este universo, fracasó unos meses después. Por eso era tan importante que Madame Web volviera a ser un verdadero éxito. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que esto ocurra es bastante baja. Al menos, las críticas vuelven a ser un absoluto desastre. Junto con las adaptaciones cinematográficas de los cómics, a las que actualmente no les está yendo muy bien en taquilla, esto no nos da muchas esperanzas de una recaudación razonable. Es una pena, porque hay elementos positivos que hacen que apetezca ver la película. Empezando por el reparto. En los últimos años, estas adaptaciones se han consolidado como un crisol de numerosas estrellas. La lista de grandes nombres es ahora tan grande que uno no puede evitar preguntarse quién más está en ella.  En Madame Web, sin embargo, a los actores y actrices les cuesta brillar de verdad. Dakota Johnson, que al menos tiene algunas buenas escenas en el primer tercio como una sarcástica paramédica, es la que mejor lo consigue. Realmente decepcionante es Tahar Rahim, que en realidad es un muy buen actor de carácter, pero que aquí está completamente desaprovechado como hombre araña descalzo. Su personaje no es ni amenazador ni trágico. Simplemente está ahí.  En general, los diálogos son terribles. Cada vez que se intenta explicar algo, el equipo de guionistas, formado por cuatro hombres y cuatro mujeres, fracasa en la tarea. Las escenas emotivas, cuando se supone que el cuarteto crece unido, tampoco logran impresionar; el lenguaje es simplemente demasiado poco natural para ello. Rara vez se tiene la sensación de estar tratando con personas reales. Las mejores adaptaciones cómicas de este tipo encuentran el corazón humano detrás del disfraz. Aquí ni siquiera parecen haber encontrado el cuerpo. Si al menos el disfraz fuera algo que mirar. Pero Madame Web tampoco es muy buena como película de acción, ya que carece de las ideas necesarias. Y faltaba el dinero necesario, ya que algunas escenas generadas por ordenador resultaron horribles. La capacidad del protagonista para predecir e influir en el futuro es realmente emocionante. Se le podría haber sacado mucho partido. En la película, sin embargo, esto no lleva a Cassie a hacer planes o a sopesar diferentes opciones. Prefiere la violencia pura y dura, que no encaja ni con la habilidad ni con la caracterización. Este es también el principal problema, incluso peor que la disparatada historia: Madame Web es aburrida. Lo que funciona en la primera mitad y aporta algo divertido, degenera en una bola de acción lanzada sin amor que no hace nada con los personajes y sus habilidades. Quizás no sea una catástrofe absoluta debido a los ocasionales momentos agradables. Pero no abre el apetito para nuevas incursiones en el mundo de las arañas, incluso si la película está claramente orientada hacia futuras partes. Nadie espera una experiencia cinematográfica sofisticada de títulos como éste, pero tal efecto lobotomizante no puede haber sido el objetivo declarado. Madame Web no cree que su público sea especialmente inteligente y quizás por eso ha sustraído todo lo que proporciona al menos un rudimentario alimento para reflexionar. Cuando uno considera cuánto talento se ha desperdiciado literalmente delante de la cámara, casi podría enfadarse un poco, oh si al menos la película no fuera tan miserablemente indiferente. Así que encaja perfectamente con las otras películas del Spider-Man-antihéroe-universo de Sony mencionadas anteriormente.  Y no te preocupes, la película, que por cierto está ambientada en 2003, aprovecha cualquier oportunidad para dejar claro dónde estamos. Así que si disfrutas dándote cuenta de que Emma Roberts y Adam Scott están emparentados con un personaje muy importante del cosmos de SpiderMan en la película, puede que vivas unos cuantos momentos agradables. Pero si eso es suficiente para ti, puedes llamarte justificadamente frugal en el espectro insano. Después de todo, Madame Web presenta una buena alternativa bastante pronto. En una escena, un médico aconseja a Cassandra que se quede en casa viendo películas antiguas. Una gran sugerencia, realmente no hay nada más que añadir.  Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980. Médico de profesión, y escritor de reseñas cinematográficas, fue conductor del programa radial diario “Cineasta Radio” por tres años, colaborador de la Revista Cineasta desde el 2010 y editor/escritor del portal cocalecas.net.

"Feb 20, 2024",negative," The proper metaphor to describe a film such as Sony’s latest live-action Spider-Verse installment, Madame Web, is a building with excessive permit issues that got approved anyway. Coming off the rather lukewarm reception to 2022’s Morbius, the studio has elected to press on with an assortment of standalone Spider-Man adjacent character films that is building to something? Superhero films are in a state of figuring out their identity and their place in a box office that is asking more of them — there’s no use belaboring that point. If there’s a primary failure in speaking about Madame Web, it feels like a film meant for another genre formatted to fit this universe that needs characters to power its machine. 2019’s Joker used Martin Scorsese’s 1976 Taxi Driver and 1982 The King of Comedy as obvious templates in which it anchors its world. It just so happened that Joaquin Phoenix’s performance and just the right amount of comic book lore were able to push it into something interesting. In essence, Madame Web is primarily a small-level slasher film that happens to have spider people in it, with one person, in particular, trying to figure out their power set. The “Peter Parker” of it all feels like a forbidden word evident to the audience and something the film tries to play coy with. (It reverses the aforementioned “with great power comes great responsibility” line). The characters themselves fit a specific archetype other than exhibiting something outside of that, and most of the narrative is spent running away from a relentless villain with an absurd power set. Before even discussing the plot itself, you can see there are way too many masters (including a lot of product placement) being served in lieu of trying to do something different. Set in 2003, Cassandra “Cassie” Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and is a bit of a loner outside of a friendship with her fellow EMT Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Much of Cassandra’s adverseness to the family has an origin that happened years prior, in 1973. Her mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), had traveled to the Peruvian Amazon to search for a rare spider species containing healing qualities protected by an indigenous tribe called the Las Arañas. There is only one issue, and it lies in her then-greedy partner, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who wants all the power for himself. A scuffle ensues, and he accidentally shoots Constance while she’s pregnant with Cassie. Before Constance’s death, there’s a ceremony in which Cassie is birthed and bitten by the special arachnid. One day on the job, Cassie gets into an accident and nearly dies. With this, she vaguely discovers that she can see into the future. It takes much of the film for this power to develop fully, and even then, it’s a bit hazy. Ezekiel also has the same ability as others that you would deduce from Spider-Man lore (super strength, crawling on walls, and apparent neurotoxin). Along with immense wealth, a hacker named Aramia (Zosia Mamet) has NSA surveillance tools. Ezekiel has one mission in mind. He’s plagued with these visions of three Spider-Women that may kill him one day; thus, he has to T-1000 it up to stop that from happening. Director S. J. Clarkson and co-writers Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker set the stage for a plot that wants to be put into anything else but this Spider-Verse. Any overtures to costumes and possible actions that would nail Ezekiel’s fears, in reality, must be believed. While Madame Web looks to convey that he’s this unstoppable killing machine, the (extremely noticeable) differences with Rahim’s ADR make his character more laughable more often than not. With Cassandra somewhat getting a handle on her foresight, she sees that she has to assist three teenagers, the nerdy and awkward Julia (Sydney Sweeney), the intelligent Anya (Isabela Merced), and the I-won’t-do-what-you-tell-me, flip off an ambulance Mattie (Celeste O’Connor). The teens behave the way you’d expect them to — because films like these don’t expect a group of young people to think rationally. Cassie gets tired of playing the caretaker role quickly, as punctuated by Johnson’s no-sell performance. Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor cling tightly to what their given personality is supposed to be and rarely (if at all) move away from that. In the end, the four bond over being directionless — coming from backgrounds where their parents are either deceased, non-existent, or taken away by other circumstances. In that regard, a little piece of camaraderie peaks over many fragmented set pieces linked together by the repeated use of vehicles as weapons. Sony has presented a superhero that can see into the future inside a film that feels like a prequel and assumed it’s earned the trust of its audience to bet on another story without earning it."

A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best answer to our question of the week. 04:10Last week's question we asked, what has been your favorite Deadpool joke out of all of Deadpool media? And that was coming off of the Deadpool and Wolverine trailer that we got during the Super Bowl. We got four answers, so we'll break down this week's honorable mentions before revealing the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to Clayton DeMato, who said, Hey there guys, my name is Clayton DeMato, long time listener. As someone who enjoys to have his balls fondled. 05:38Cornelius Robinson who said, Hey guys, this is Cornelius Robinson and my favorite joke from the Deadpool media is through the movies. When he mentioned that Nickassan and Teenage Warhead and Clauses were in a big house living together all alone. And it was funny how it was almost the studio didn't have any more money for new X-Men members. Which was a meta joke and was returned in the sequel. 06:07and it cracked me up. Yeah, that was a little bit of self-deprecating humor on behalf of the studio. Great joke with Deadpool referencing how only Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus seem to be at the X-Men Mansion all the time. I really did love the follow-up in Deadpool 2 when we saw the cast of X-Men Dark Phoenix in one of the classrooms, like basically hiding from Deadpool. So good. It did make me wonder where in the timeline the second Deadpool movie fit, but yeah, it was a great gag. 06:35It was a meta joke, it doesn't necessarily have to be scrutinized in the larger continuity. Sure, sure, I get that. But great answer Cornelius, our final honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my favorite joke would have to be from the Deadpool 2 teaser where he's changing into his superhero costume. Mostly just from the realism from it, like we all think we'd be these badass superheroes and stuff though, but let's be honest with me. 07:02would take that long just to get into our superhero costume and possibly get the same outcome like in the teaser. So that's my favorite joke just from the realism for me as well as just the Superman theme too. Yeah, I'm not sure how many people remember the teaser trailer to Deadpool 2. It was played in front of the Logan movie. It was essentially... 07:22Wade Wilson walking down and seeing an old man getting mugged in an alley and he runs into a phone booth to change into his Deadpool costume and it just takes entirely way too long. That's the joke. It takes him like two minutes just to change into his Deadpool costume and in the meantime before he can even get out of the phone booth we hear the old man get shot. Great gag. A hilarious way to kick off the marketing for Deadpool 2. I had almost completely forgot about this teaser until Travis brought it up again. 08:18Spider-Man is trying to warn Deadpool of Taskmaster's booby traps and Deadpool goes, ha ha, traps. Because I'm expecting him to say, to be laughing at boobies, but it's simple and catches me off guard. Yeah, and another classic Deadpool style joke where again it mixes the juvenile with the clever. In the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, Spider-Man... 08:43and Deadpool teamed up against Taskmaster. And it was a nice bit of subversion where you think that Deadpool, upon hearing the phrase booby traps is going to laugh at booby. But of course, he laughs at traps. He's like, you said traps. It was a great gag. I never saw the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon. I didn't even know Deadpool was in that. He seems like a risky character for a cartoon. But, yeah, solid joke. Well, the nice thing about Deadpool is that you can make him as PG or rated R as you want to. And it just kind of works. As long as he's quirky and funny, it'll still feel like him. 09:12Do you have a favorite Deadpool joke? I really like the dig at DC that he did in Deadpool 2 where he's like, so dark, are you sure you're not from the DC universe? That was quality. This is fucking worst joke. No, but like I would say mine is in sort of the same scene. He's introduced to Black Tom Cassidy and he was like, hi, white Wade Wilson. And then later on he was just like, you killed Black Tom Cassidy. You racist. I was cracking up. Yeah. 09:42I also really liked the Juggernaut song though. Like that one stick with me for a while. Holy shit balls. Yeah, that was great. Yeah, Deadpool's humor is actually really solid and it makes me really excited to see Deadpool and Wolverine coming out the summer. So congrats again to Sean Curtis for winning this week's No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode when we'll be asking another Question of the Week. And now that that's done, on to the news. 10:42get that news from the studio itself. It's shaping up to be a great cast. Really can't wait to see them as Marvel's first family. And out of all the cast that the Fantastic Four franchise has had so far in live action, this one actually seems the most interesting to me. Yeah, it is interesting. I think it's a great cast. The logo is what I found most interesting. Like it almost makes me wonder if the Fantastic Four is gonna be a period piece. I've heard rumors that that was gonna be the case. And I think that this mid-century logo proves that. 11:12I think they're really gonna set up the Fantastic Four as like Marvel's first superhero family chronologically within the Marvel Universe and have them like maybe time travel into the present day by the end of the film. And why not? I mean, that could work. It worked with Captain Marvel. So. Right. Yeah, exactly. But besides the cast and potentially the setting of the movie, we also got a release date change for the film. It was originally going to kick off the summer season in 2025. 11:42coming out May 2nd, but Fantastic Four has been pushed back to July 25th, which is the date when the Thunderbolts movie was going to come out, but that film has been moved up to May 2nd, so basically they just swapped dates. So now Thunderbolts is kicking off the summer movie season, which I think is good news. I think it shows that Marvel has faith in the Thunderbolts movie to have such a valuable release date. Have they started filming Thunderbolts? Not yet, no. Man, that seems like a quick turnaround. 12:11But I imagine it has fewer special effects than Fantastic Four would need. Maybe. Who knows? A few months prior to that, in February, we're going to get Captain America, Brave New World, which has already started filming and I think is close to wrapping up here. I think this is all great news. It gives the studio more time to work on Fantastic Four, which, you know, is a flagship franchise that needs to be done right in its third iteration. And nothing got pushed back. It's just dates that are swapping. So we can still expect. 12:39something Marvel to come out on those original dates. Yeah, next year. Again, I'm really just hoping for this year to fly by. I know it's gonna be a crazy year with like the election and everything. Just bring on 2025 after The Joker, of course, cause I really want to see that, but yeah, 2025 is gonna be better than 2024, I'm pretty sure. Now I don't want to skip over Deadpool and Wolverine. So we could get to that movie and then once it comes out, then yeah, I'm ready for 2025 already. All right, we'll just skip to Deadpool and Wolverine, then skip to The Joker. 13:09and then skip to 2025. No, skip to Christmas, because you can't skip Christmas, man. That's true. That's fair. What are we talking about? I don't know. But let's go to move on to the next bit of news here, which is that the official trailer for the X-Men 97 cartoon has been released. It was released under a new banner. 13:29called Marvel Animation, which is pretty exciting to see, because I think it signifies that Marvel is going to be producing a lot more animated projects. Yeah, maybe What If will fall under that banner now, that's Spider-Man series, the prequel series that they're coming up with. I forget the name of it. Yeah, that was originally called Spider-Man Freshman Year, but they've since changed the title to Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I'm surprised there's not a home in there somewhere, but that's probably Marvel Animation, I imagine, as well. Marvel Zombies is also going to be animated. 13:59when that comes out. So, lots of projects for Marvel Animation cannot wait. These type of stories do really well, I think, in animation and Marvel hasn't really invested too much in that lately. Their previous animated films weren't very good, but these series hopefully will be. Just like the X-Men cartoon was back in the 90s, the trailer starts off showing us clips from the series from Nali back when that ended and picks up right where it left off. It's cool that the camera goes into the analog screen and basically takes us right back into that world. 14:28The animation is a little bit different in style, but you can tell heavily inspired by the 90s cartoon at the very least, especially in terms of character design, especially in terms of voice. Yeah, it sounds like the voice cast is returning, which I think I had already known that, but it was a nice kind of surprise to hear as well. Yeah, if it's not the original voice cast, they are remarkable impressionists. It's nice to see Cyclops as the leader of the team again. 14:56and really take center stage. Hopefully he proves to a whole new generation of fans that he is the de facto leader of the X-Men because the movies kind of gave him the shaft. The most standout moment for me in the trailer is when Wolverine is charging toward the camera, Gambit jumps on his back and charges his claws up with kinetic energy. I thought that was really dope. Yeah, it was a nice combo move, kind of like a fastball special, you know, if Colossus isn't around or anything like that. Yeah. 15:21I like there was a scene with Storm and she has her new haircut. It's like the ponytail kind of thing and there's just lightning crackling all around her. I'm like, oh shit, the animation is a lot better than in the 90s. Yeah, the ponytail hair here is kind of like a nice compromise between, you know, her long flowing hair from the 90s cartoon and also her mohawk style. I really like the way it looks here. Yeah, same. We see Jean Grey in this trailer who appears to be pregnant. 15:48Which is a surprise because that never happened in the comic books. Scott knocked up Madeline Pryor, who was a clone of Jean Grey. So either this version of Jean Grey is actually a clone or they're just going to make Jean Grey the mother of Cable, which is what I assume they're going with here. I think that's Cable in the womb. Unless Wolverine's the father. Oh, shit scandals. I doubt that they would do that. But if they're making Jean Grey. 16:16Cable's mother. I'm totally fine with that because she basically raised him in the comic books anyway when she and Scott were sent to the future to take care of him. I don't really like the character of Madeline Pryor or like the Goblin Queen or any of that stuff. So I won't miss her if she's gone. It looks like Magneto has taken over the whole school, which is kind of cool. Yeah, that is from the comics. Magneto took over the school around the time of the New Mutants and he kind of turned over a new leaf for a while before, you know, going back to being the villain. 16:46The trailer got me pumped up with loads of nostalgia. I remember loving this series as a kid, especially the first two seasons. The show kind of fell off after that. But the show was always known for seriously tackling the issues of prejudice and things like that. And hopefully this new cartoon really runs with those themes, keeps it as straight as possible, doesn't make it too goofy or anything like that because that's what made the original 90s X-Men cartoon so great. I can't wait for it. The show is actually going to debut pretty soon here in about a month on March 20th. 17:26What was your favorite character from the X-Men 90s cartoon, besides Wolverine, and why? I mean, everyone's gonna say Wolverine, so yeah, that's probably a good caveat.

Clarkson and stars Dakota Johnson, Sidney Sweeney, Isabella Merced, Celeste O'Connor, and Tahar Rahim. The movie is based on an obscure Spider-Man ally from the comic books, a mysterious psychic woman who can peer into the web of life and destiny, and has helped Spidey in several of his adventures. Madam Web is a project that literally no one asked for, centered around a character that isn't even bottom of the barrel. 19:00She's so under and below the barrel that you have to dig to find her. I wasn't anticipating this film, I only moderately enjoyed it and I won't be recommending it. I don't think a lot of people are going to be seeing this movie, I don't think it's necessary to see. So as I give our obligatory spoiler warning for this review, I do so with great ambivalence. If you don't want to be spoiled on Madame Webb's plot, give us a pause and I wish you the best in seeing this movie. 19:31If it sounds like I'm actively discouraging people from seeing the film, you may be partially correct. It's gotten to the point now where the obviousness of Sony's disregard for the source material and the audience is beyond the pale. For those who may not know, prior to the existence of Marvel Studios, the film rights for many Marvel characters were sold to outside studios with Spider-Man going to Sony. It made sense at the time because Marvel was a publishing company. They made comics. They didn't know how to make movies. 20:01But since the mid-2000s, Sony has cranked out a lot of subpar live action films, especially when compared to Marvel Studios, who has obviously had the best handle on their own intellectual property. Spider-Man has fared much better at Marvel than he ever did at Sony, but technically the Spider-Man Home Trilogy films were a Marvel production of a Sony franchise, because to this day, Sony still has the rights to Spider-Man, and they will continue to have them as long as they keep making Spider-Man-related films and don't lapse on their contract. 20:31The only reason average films like The Amazing Spider-Man, Venom, Morbius, and now Madame Web were made was to keep the character from reverting to Marvel. In Sony's eyes, it's better to make a mediocre movie now that no one wants to see in order to retain the potential of making money later. And as a Marvel fan, and as a movie fan, that sucks. And if we have to show the studio that message with our wallets, then that's what we should probably do. 21:01Don't go through any great efforts to see this movie if you already weren't planning on doing so. Yeah, it's definitely not worth your time, I would say. Yeah, I mean, it's not terrible, but you're right, yeah. It's not worth probably the money that you would spend. I would probably say if you're gonna see it, wait until it's out of theaters on streaming. That being said, I'm not gonna bash this movie for the sake of it. I will remain as impartial as I can as a critic. There are some people out there saying that this is the worst superhero movie ever made. 21:30But I think they're forgetting that 2015's Fantastic Four exists. Or Batman and Robin, which was worse than that. Or the Shaquille O'Neal Steel movie, which was worse than that. So, Madame Webbe, I would say, is around the same quality as Morbius, although I personally liked Morbius a little bit more. Madame Webbe is a film that is more divisive than outright horrible. And I'll say that I liked it a little bit more than I thought I would. But in the end, I could take it or leave it. Again, it's a film no one asked for. Yeah, I mean... 22:00I also liked it surprisingly a little bit more than I thought I would because I was expecting the worst movie that's ever been made honestly with the way film critics were talking about it. But I honestly liked it more than Morbius. I'd say I liked it more than Electra. There are worse Marvel movies than this in my opinion. Yeah, go see Howard the Duck, right? Exactly. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's really hard to watch non MCU Marvel movies, because it's obvious that they don't have a roadmap. 22:29You know, how does this connect in any way to Morbius or the upcoming Craven film or Venom? I have no idea. I honestly don't care. Yeah, I really don't care where this whole thing is going. And I kind of get the impression that the filmmakers didn't really care about this project at all either. And even the writers, it seems like none of them had really read the comics. Well, I mean, it's not like there's a huge amount of Maddenweb comics to go off of. You know, this is largely an original origin story for the character. 22:59Yeah, to be honest, I don't know much about the character. All I know from her is what I learned from the animated series in the 90s. Yeah, that was also my introduction to the character. She had quite a sizable role within that animated series, much larger than she ever did in the comic books. Interesting. The movie isn't a total dumpster fire. I think what keeps the film from being so is the director, S.J. Clarkson. 23:21This lady has been a part of every single television show you've ever loved in the last 15 or so years, having directed quintessential episodes of Heroes, House, Dexter, Bates Motel, Orange is the New Black, Jessica Jones, Game of Thrones, Succession, Need I Go On. You know, SJ Clarkson is incredibly acclaimed and talented. And I also think that she set up some incredible shots in this movie, especially in the first act when Cassie is discovering her powers. It's clear. 23:50that the director had an incredible knack for visual storytelling. The problem is that the story has to be good, and Madame Webb's story is not good. A lot of the characters are shallow, the second act is a drag with very little momentum, and I don't care how good of a director you are, there's no way to direct most of the dialogue in this film. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in any film. And what's really tragic is that S.J. Clarkson actually has a screenplay credit here. 24:19So it's not clear where things went wrong, but given the director's track record, I can almost guarantee it was studio interference. Interesting. I didn't realize she wrote this as well. That's a shame if it was studio interference because they really threw her under the bus letting her put her name all over it. Yeah, it seems to me when it comes to Sony and the Sony Spider-Man Universe films, it's like a bunch of non-creative business people making creative decisions that muddle the overall vision. 25:17probably would have preferred to this one is the superhero movie that we were promised in the marketing. Like was this even a superhero movie? Maybe in the sense that there were people with powers and a struggle between good and evil, but the costumes were pretty much non-existent. It wasn't like this, it was a spider-woman team-up film where we got to see these ladies kick ass. Right? Yeah, I don't even know like how the girls got their spider powers. Like what the hell? Yeah, the characters were like pretty much a bait-and-switch I think, which was not cool. 25:46The film felt so small because the stakes were so minuscule. While the film implies that these teenage girls will grow up to become superheroes, doesn't show anything to the effect of them, you know, saving the world in the future or even stopping a crime or doing anything worthwhile besides striking some cool poses. I mean, technically they all kind of saved Peter Parker's life, but it's not even clear in this universe whether or not. 26:11Peter Parker will become Spider-Man. If he does, he's not a very original character considering there's a shit ton of other Spider-People in this universe. And that's one of the worst things about this movie, right? The implications that it has on the larger Sony Spider-Man universe where everybody gets Spider-powers. You get Spider-powers. You get Spider-powers. There's a whole race of indigenous Spider-People in Peru apparently. And you know... 26:36There is some of that in the comics. There's the whole spider society, which I think was one of the worst ideas ever. Like J. Michael Straczynski really started this all when he insinuated that Spider-Man was part of the spider totem and that all of his animal themed bad guys were also representatives of their animal totems. It's kind of a neat idea and concept, but people ran with that shit for years and years. And then it just outstated its welcome. Like you had the sisterhood of the wasps. 27:03and the Spider Society and all this random shit. And it got really lame really fast. I'm just gonna say it now. There's too many Spider-Men, like way too many. I agree with you, for sure. At least within the 616 proper universe, I don't care how many Spider-Men there are across the multiverse. And I think that actually works, especially when you look at a film across the Spider-Verse. But when you have 50 million Spider-Men and Spider-Women in the same playground, it gets a little crowded. 27:31Which is a shame, I feel like, for anyone who liked the Spider-Verse films. Like if they go into this movie expecting like more of that kind of awesomeness, they're going to be sorely disappointed. Oh, for the most part. I really wish that this movie, like those Spider-Verse films, was made for the fans. Because honestly, I don't think this one was. I think this was trying to capture a new demographic for superhero films that really isn't. 27:57as interested in them as comic book readers. I 100% agree. It was like it was trying to tap into like the teenage thriller genre, like the people that went and saw Final Destination. But I think they'll be disappointed when they see this film. Of course, the fans will be disappointed. So it's hard to know exactly who is going to love this movie, if anybody. But speaking of the characters, let's go ahead and get into our character breakdown, starting with Madame Webb, aka Cassandra Webb, who was played by Dakota Johnson. 28:26I actually liked Dakota Johnson here more than I wanted to. I haven't seen her in too much stuff, only in Suspiria, but I was never too impressed with her acting ability. In this movie though, I actually thought she did well enough with most of the material, not just in conveying her burgeoning psychic powers, but also her emotional scenes as well. Yeah, this was also the first time I saw her. I agree, I didn't think she did that terrible. She probably had the best performance in the film next to like Adam Scott. Yeah. 28:55She has this kind of deadpan style to her that I think was really able to tap into the script's humor. I think she sold the comedy actually really well. What little comedy there was in the script. And surprisingly, I believed in the idea of her as a superhero toward the end of the movie more than I believed in her as a cynical paramedic in the beginning of the film. I wouldn't mind seeing more of her as a superhero character if and when she turns up again down the line. 29:22I praise her performance, however, with the caveat that she completely dropped the ball in her final scene with the wheelchair and the strange eyeglasses. That was just a really bad delivery. Absolutely. I'm still really confused by that whole thing. Like obviously she was blinded by some kind of debris, but when did she become paralyzed? How did she afford this like badass wheelchair? And why was she like all smiley at the end? Like the future has been really good, I guess. I don't know. 29:51I remember reading a quote from James Marsden over 20 years ago when he was doing an interview for the first X-Men movie saying that it was really hard to act through his cyclops visor and I think maybe Dakota Johnson just had the same struggles here. Yeah, it's gotta be a challenge. And it's a shame that Final Seem was what the audience was left with because I think the rest of her performance was pretty decent. Good even. 30:13Especially as she goes through her arc, you know, Cassie starts the film as a cynical paramedic detached from others due to her life as a seemingly unloved foster child. I think she resented her mother for being more invested in her research in the Amazon and then dying instead of caring and being there for her. And what's actually great about this aspect of the movie is that I thought the same thing about her mom. Like, I remember thinking in the beginning, like, lady, you are pregnant, do not fight over the spider with the gun toting psycho. 30:43But in Cassie getting her powers and exploring their ties to her mother's past, she learns that her mom did care about her, that her whole reason for seeking out the spider was for the improved quality of life for her child. And I don't know if it's because I'm a parent now, but that revelation hit me like a punch in the gut. And Cassie carried that forward, protecting and then seemingly raising these neglected teens as the mother figure herself, coming full circle. 31:37character of Madame Webb actually has in the comic books. It's called Myasthenia Gravis, and in the books, Madame Webb was born with it. She was born blind and a paraplegic, and she developed these psychic powers, this ability to peer into the web of life and destiny, which is a construct of fate. And in this movie, that is the disease that Cassie's mom was trying to prevent. Yeah, so you could say it's ironic then that her daughter ended up blind and in a wheelchair anyway at the end. 32:05Yeah, like it was faded or something. The web of life and destiny is actually the source of Spider-Man's Spidey-Sense and all the Spider characters who have Spidey-Sense are able to tap into that just a little bit. In the comics, Madame Web worked as a psychic medium who was once visited by Peter Parker, whom she knew off the bat was Spider-Man, surprising him, and she would go on to help him in several of his adventures. She not only had telepathy, but she also had clairvoyance. She could predict the future and she could also astral project. 32:34This movie had an interesting take on the astral projection though, in that she could send out multiple copies of herself who could also interact physically with the environment. That was a little weird. Yeah, pretty unique though. I thought that was actually kind of cool. Yeah, it's an interesting way to not limit her so much if the character is ever used again in future films. Let's go ahead and move on to Julia Cornwall who is played by Sydney Sweeney. This is actually my first time seeing Sydney Sweeney in anything. I never watched Euphoria or White Lotus or anything. 33:30I think she played an insecure teenager fairly well. Stop thinking with your dick. She was not great in this movie. I don't think I am. Honestly, I think she did the best out of the three teenage actresses or playing teenagers. I think Isabella Merced did the best. And that's good news for you considering that she's going to be Hawke Girl in next year's Superman legacy movie. But let's talk about Anya Corazon played by Isabella Merced. None of the characters were written well. Again, the dialogue was so incredibly awful. 34:00But at least I think Anya had the most believable delivery. Sydney Sweeney had to play this shy teenager, which she totally didn't come across as. Celeste O'Connor, who played Maddie Franklin, tried to portray herself as this rebellious teen, which I also didn't think she sold. But Isabella Merced as Anya really just had to play smart. She was the smart one. She had the easiest acting job, and therefore I think she pulled it off better. 34:25Yeah, I mean, she did fine. I don't know if I agree that she did better than the Sidney Sweeney, but yeah, she definitely did better than Celeste O'Connor. Yeah, Celeste O'Connor played Maddie Franklin. This is my first time seeing Celeste in anything, and if I never see her again in another film, I think I would be just fine. Her acting was so bad in this movie. She brought down the entire film like she didn't deliver a single line, believably, I thought, and it was probably one of the. 34:51worst performances out of any superhero movie in the last few decades. But not only that, like her character sucked. Like Maddie was so unlikable and rude and impulsive. And when she tried rescuing Cassie while skateboarding on a piece of debris, I wanted to fucking puke. If we gave away Brothers Awards for the worst moment, that would win it, because that was just ridiculous. What did you think about her backstory? Are I guess any of these three girls backstories? I thought they were good backstories. I agree. I thought. 35:20that made the characters more interesting. What I'm really curious about is how they got their powers in the movie. Yeah, they never address that. They just leave it open-ended, I assume, for maybe a sequel, where they'll get their powers or something like that. But in the comics, Cassie just kind of developed her powers. She's not a mutant, but she just became a psychic, I think, largely because her condition left her with a clairvoyant mind. But Julia Cornwall, who would later become Julia Carpenter, she got her powers through genetic experiments. 36:17It didn't give her spider abilities, but it did give her strength, speed, agility, reflexes. But she later got the additional abilities of Madame Webb's granddaughter, who had been turned into a spider-human hybrid by Doctor Octopus, hence the giant spider legs from her back that allow her to wall crawl. And then Anya, who is known as Aranya in the books, or Spider Girl sometimes, her powers were given to her by a sorcerer of the Secret Spider Society who was trying to save her life. 36:46and she did get the powers of a spider in addition to the ability to summon this exoskeleton armor. And she also carries these spider bola devices that she created that allow her to grapple ledges and snare opponents and can also be thrown as projectiles. So we saw that in the movie too. Man, that's a lot to get through in a sequel if they ever do. Yeah, I assume that if they ever get to those superhero origins, they'll probably all get their powers in the same way. Yeah, from the spiders in Peru, I guess. 37:15Speaking of that, let's move on to Ezekiel Sims who is played by Tahar Rahim. I don't even know where to start. Tahar Rahim is an actor I've never heard of playing horribly a role that is unrecognizable compared to the comic book Ezekiel, a character who in itself is a big ol' sack of mediocrity. Never ever have I cared less about a comic book movie villain. He had no arc beyond his desire to just continue existing. 37:45Beyond that, there were no goals. You know, he's a guy who wanted the spider venom to give himself power. And I guess he did that. You know, he amassed this power and wealth, but like, who the fuck is this guy? Like, why did he want power? What did he plan on doing with it? What was he doing all this time as Cassie was growing up? Like fucking investing in stocks and jacking off or some shit? He was not a good villain. He was barely even a character. You know, he mentioned something in. 38:13the Amazon about his family starving or something like that. And I guess he built an empire after that. But I have no sense of how loaded this guy is. Apparently only has like one employee who works in his apartment. It's like they couldn't find another location for him. They couldn't like show him walking through office space or anything like that. It's like, holy crap, what is going on here? Like he wasn't evil enough. He wasn't interesting enough. He wasn't anything worthwhile enough. And also his acting was not great. 38:42Not only did I not believe any of Tahar Rahim's line deliveries, I don't even think he delivered them because his voice never matched his mouth. It was like most of his lines were 80 yard in post-production. Yes. I actually wondered if that was his actual voice in the movie or if they got another actor to do his lines because I don't know, maybe he had a really heavy accent that was difficult to understand. I could definitely see in a lot of the shadowy scenes and just in the poor editing that he wasn't really actually saying. 39:11the lines we are hearing. Yeah, that may be due to rewrites, might be due to an accent or something. He's a French actor, and maybe he couldn't pull off a convincing Latin American accent, which I think the character was supposed to be. Yeah, who knows? But in the books, Ezekiel is not Peruvian, although he did get his powers through a mystic ritual in a Peruvian spider temple, which is probably why the movie started off in Peru. But like Ezekiel never wore a black Spider-Man suit in the comics. 39:40Where did that come from? Like, I want to know the reasoning behind that. The film never addresses why he looks like Spider-Man. It makes no sense, especially when you consider the implications for Spider-Man and his costume, which he developed and created and conceived of all on his own. It implies that maybe there was some external influence in Peter Parker's costume creation, and that doesn't make sense. Maybe from the Peruvian spider people? Not sure. Oh, that was dumb too. 40:09It was interesting. I kind of feel like when they were trying to explain the character of Ezekiel, they're like, he's kind of like Spider-Man. So they're like, oh, so he wears a suit. Let's just make him look like evil Spider-Man. Ugh. Yeah, that was some studio executives idea for sure. They're like, we got to make it marketable. We got to make it seem like Spider-Man's in this movie. 100%. The final characters I want to talk about are Benjamin Parker, played by Adam Scott, and Mary Parker, played by Emma Roberts. I don't have too much to say about them because their roles were so small. 40:39They're both likable actors who I think were entirely wasted in their roles in this movie. I don't know about wasted. I think they almost kind of added credibility to the film that it would have normally had. I liked seeing them in those roles. I think they're bigger actors than, you know, what those roles called for. They could have gotten away with actors of a lesser caliber, but no, I like seeing them in the roles. 41:01Yeah, it makes you wonder if they're planning to use them again down the line, which is why they wanted to get these bigger name actors. I keep making allusions to a sequel to this movie, but I think it's pretty clear that that's not going to happen. If Madame Web ever shows up again, it's probably going to be in some kind of like team up film, like Sinister Six type movie or something like that, that I think Sony is working toward, but probably not a Madame Web too. Just taking the box office into consideration. Yeah, I didn't even get number one. And this is a Spider-Man movie. That's crazy. 41:43In 1973, medical researcher Constance Webb discovers a rare species of spider in the Peruvian jungle whose venom has healing and strengthening properties. Though she is pregnant, her security escort Ezekiel Sims shoots her and steals the spider. An indigenous tribe tries to save Constance's life using the spider venom, but she dies shortly after giving birth to her daughter Cassandra. Now writing out that scene kind of sounds pretty interesting and cool in theory. 42:11But seeing it done in practice, I thought was kind of ridiculous, especially when you see the indigenous tribe crawling through the trees looking like Spider-Man. It's like, what the fuck is going on here? The CG is pretty bad seeing them leap through the trees. But I honestly didn't hate the designs of them. Like, if you're going to do an indigenous Amazon tribe, Spider-Man, that's how you do it. I didn't like the black webbing that they covered their bodies in. It was like. 42:39black twigs or something. Yeah, or netting, something like that. Some kind of- It was like trying too hard to make it look like Spider-Man's costume. Probably, probably that's fair. I thought it was just kind of an interesting design at the very least. Now when they were talking about the legend of the Aranya people, I forget what they called them, they mentioned a poison touch that Ezekiel Sims, of course, later on gets. What did you think of that? 43:03I think that's a cool idea, Ezekiel does not have that power in the comics, but I think it was a way to make him seem more villainous and more threatening. Back to the story, 30 years later, in 2003 Queens, New York, Cassie works as a paramedic alongside her partner Ben Parker. After helping rescue a man from a car about to fall off a bridge, she falls into the water and has a near-death experience that awakens her psychic potential to see into the web of life and destiny. 43:30I thought that was a pretty cool scene when she first started seeing the web in the water. It was hella confusing, honestly. I did like how the shattered glass looked like a web. Actually there's a ton of shattered glass in this movie that's very web-like. It's kind of like a recurring visual motif. Yeah, I thought that was pretty neat. Especially when it also correlates to what feels like her mind fracturing as her powers start developing. Right, yeah exactly. I do have a question. 43:57Were Cassandra and Ben fucking? No. OK. He stuck in the tip once. It didn't count. He put in a ball. All I know is that didn't really mean anything. Ben tells her that, like, you know, he's met someone, but he never says may. I was just wondering because they had like a weird chemistry between each other. No, I think she was too detached for any sort of relationship. Oh, Cassie began suffering from visions that turn out to come true, such as the death of her coworker, O'Neil. 44:27Meanwhile, it's revealed that since his time in Peru, Ezekiel used the spider venom to grant himself enhanced physicality, wall crawling ability, a poisonous touch, and precognitive dreams. Ezekiel seduces and kills an NSA agent to get access to a person tracking system to find three girls that his visions have convinced him will kill him in the future. I do think you can't really say precognitive dreams considering the fact that his dreams were lying to him. 44:54Yeah, it's hard to say because, you know, according to this movie, the future can be changed. So, I'm wondering if that's what would have happened to him if Madame Webb never came to be or something. Who knows? I have no idea what happened there. Yeah, kind of dumb. Meanwhile, Cassie has a vision on the subway of Ezekiel murdering the three girls, Julia Cornwall, Maddie Franklin, and Anya Corazon. She convinces the girls to get off the train and they flee. Ezekiel pursues them. 45:21but his attention is diverted long enough by local police trying to stop him for Cassie and the girls to escape in a taxi. Cassie drives them to a nearby forest where they discuss the man who moves like a spider. Cassie tells them to wait there as she leaves to revisit her mother's spider research back home. I thought it was a little convenient how easily they were able to ditch Ezekiel. 45:42Really, he was too distracted by taking out police officers. Why not just wait for them to be away from the police considering no one was looking up at the ceiling apparently to see him? Well, the police were shooting at him. He had to take him out. They would have kept shooting at him as he was trying to get at the girls. But they were only shooting at him because he started attacking them, right? Well, and also because he's a fucking dude crawling on the ceiling. I think, you know, anybody would shoot at that. That's where I would. 46:11Back in the forest, the girls get restless and walk to a nearby diner. Cassie learns from her mother's journal about the rare Peruvian spider, the mysterious indigenous tribe, and Ezekiel's identity as her mother's former security escort. At the diner, the girls draw attention to themselves, prompting a local to report the location of their missing whereabouts, leading to Ezekiel finding them. Cassie gets visions of Ezekiel killing them in the diner, prompting her to crash her car into the restaurant to ram him. 46:40Teenage girls, man, you can't leave them alone for a second before they're dancing on a tabletop so impress some boys. I don't know what kind of kid you're raising, but she needs to shape up. I was just saying, it was like bad writing. Like really bad. It was. Cassie hides the girls at a hotel where she learns more about Ezekiel's motives and abilities after communicating with him through a dream. She teaches the girls how to perform CPR, then leaves them to hide out at Ben's while she travels to Peru. 47:08There Cassie discovers a member of the indigenous tribe who tells her how her mother died and guides her through the web of life and destiny revealing that her pregnant mom sought out the spider in Peru to cure her daughter's myasthenia gravis. I do wonder why the guy wasn't dressed up like rainforest spider-man anymore. He was like wearing regular clothes. Like, does the tribe sometimes paint themselves red and cover themselves in black twigs and then sometimes wear regular clothes? 47:35Or I had something happen to that guy in the last 30 years where he was like, you know what? I'm going to move out of the rainforest. Yeah, I wondered the same thing. I think that was a mistake. I think they should have kept with the tribal look. Yeah, I agree, because, you know, they felt very mysterious and mystical almost. Back in Queens, Ben's sister-in-law, Mary, goes into labor on the way to the hospital. Ben's car is caught on camera with the girls and Ezekiel pursues them. Cassie. 48:01Now back in New York has a vision of them being attacked and steals an ambulance to help the girls escape and divert Ezekiel away from Ben and Mary. She takes the girls to a condemned fireworks factory where they set up traps for Ezekiel and call for a helicopter medical evac. Now I'm pretty sure that freaking fireworks factory burned down earlier in the movie, right? Right? Yeah, like how are all those fireworks still there after a fire like that? That doesn't make any sense. 48:26Also, I didn't realize that bottle rockets could shoot holes through brick walls. I got to be more careful with those things. I know, right? Those fireworks were so ridiculously overpowered. I think it was a front for like a mafia artillery cache or something like that, because like literally one of those fireworks took down a whole fucking helicopter, like exploded it. It's so crazy. And like ripping holes through the roof and like it pretty much toppled the whole building down. 48:54It's like, where can I buy these fireworks? Not where we live. You and I have had some fireworks mishaps on our own, you know, like accidentally having them explode the cardboard tube that they're in and like sending sparks everywhere. But I don't remember that being powerful enough to like rip a hole in someone's house. It's sad guys are on fire, but didn't destroy a house. When Ezekiel arrives, the fireworks distract him as the girls make their way to the roof for the evac. Ezekiel follows and the helicopter gets destroyed, putting each of the girls in danger. 49:48ambulances and fireworks and signs. I think that maybe his spidey sense kind of manifests as those dreams, visions that he gets. Sucks to be him then. Yeah. Cassie also falls off the building into the river below where she's blinded by a firework. She's saved from drowning by Julia and Maddie and Anya perform CPR. Cassie awakens in a hospital, now paralyzed and blind, and learns that Mary gave birth to her son, Peter. 50:16Back at her apartment in a wheelchair, Cassie decides to mentor the girls in their future roles as Spider-Heroes and has a vision of them in costume. No, they never named the baby Peter. No, and you know, fans will obviously get the reference. I don't know if general audiences will know that that's actually Spider-Man and Uncle Ben and Spider-Man's mom. Yeah, no one in my family did. I saw it with my wife and daughters and I had to explain to them who those characters were and why they were important. 50:45Seems like they dropped the ball on that front. Yeah. You know, considering that at the baby shower, they played a game where they tried to guess the baby's first name. They could have at least followed through with that by having a scene where Cassie visits Mary and is like, so what did that name end up being? And she's like, Peter, you know, and then the audience is like, Oh my God. You know, that would have been better. Right. Right. And the baby would have been played by Toby McGuire. Right. Exactly. I didn't see this would have flipped out. 51:13Yeah, superimposed Toby McGuire's face on little baby's head. The costumes we saw at the end were not great. I feel like that was the best look we got at them. And I did not love Madame Webbs. It looked really cheap. I don't know if it was just like the lipstick or the glasses or I don't know. Just I didn't like it. I don't like any of them as much as I thought I would. 51:37I liked the costumes, I did not like the headgear on any of them. Especially Madame Web's which looked like a plastic sleeping eye mask. Yes. The costume looked fine though. I didn't like Julia Cornwall's mask. That was weird. Oh, like the chin strap? Yeah. Very strange. But that was the end of the movie. There was no end credit scene or mid credit scene. I think I was half expecting Jared Leto to show up and say it's morbentime or something like that. But I'm kind of glad that there wasn't. Overall. 52:06The movie did have some emotional moments and was competently directed, but I think a beautiful arc regarding motherhood can't save the film from its clunky dialogue, the lack of superhero action, subpar performances, and forgettable characters. I rate this film 2.5 stars out of 5, a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, that sounds about right. I forget what we gave Morbius. We gave Morbius 3 stars? Yeesh. 52:34But I actually think Morbius had a stronger story and a better villain. I actually think Madame Web was about the same quality as the Echo television series that we just reviewed, which we also gave two and a half stars. Yeah, maybe you're right when it comes down to the villain. This absolutely was one of the worst villains in superhero cinema history, hands down. So yeah, around 2.5 seems right to me. I'm not expecting much better in terms of quality for the next Sony Spider-Man Universe film that's coming out later this year. 53:03which will be Craven the Hunter. Yeah, no, the whole radioactive lion blood just still freaking kills me. These Sony film writers need to read the comics. They would have made something we actually maybe would have wanted to see, like a Miles Morales movie or like Prowler, I don't know, something cool. I think a Prowler movie is a great idea. Just make it starring Donald Glover. I'd definitely see that. Oh, you weren't into Hypno Hustler? No, fuck that. 54:00or our newest tier that lets you join our Dynamike Podcast Network.

"Feb 20, 2024",positive," Let’s be honest here, most people had made up their minds on this film before ever going to see it hadn’t they? It’s okay to admit it, best being honest with these things. In fact any film that falls under the Sony’s Spider-Man Universe franchise – with the exception of the Venom films (Tom Hardy is bulletproof) – is likely to find itself fired upon by the web shooters of, well, the world wide web! But for those brave few who dared venture into the cinema, is this “the worst comic book movie ever” or “one of the most ramshackle films ever released”?  Madame Web, adapted from the Marvel Comics Spider-Verse character, sees New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) undergo a near fatal experience, that seems to unlock abilities within her that she never realised she had. Abilities gifted to her at birth. Abilities that allow her to see fragments of the future, and when she sees three teenage girls attacked by a brutal masked man, she must act to save them. Not realising, just how connected all these people really are to her. Including this vicious attacker. So…Madame Web is in so many numerous ways a bit of a tangled messy web indeed (certain lines of dialogue, the odd wooden performance, some logical leaps) and thus will do nothing to dispel all the talk of superhero fatigue and the genre’s nosedive in quality perceptions. But, call it the pre-release overblown anti-hype that Twitter, sorry X (sigh), have relished basking in, but this writer ended up really enjoying the experience.  S.J. Clarkson’s film just had something about it that won us over and is nowhere near the blight on comic book cinema it is being made out to be. Be it the well-worn (so to speak) costumed superhero stuff taking more of a backseat to a rather rollicking slasher-inspired Final Destination-esque horror thriller with some campy detours, or some entertaining characters that you are quite happy to spend time with, the whole mad little experience is endearing rather than tiring.  Madame Web is a bonkers movie that is as imperfect as it gets, from its tangled lore down to its wacky creative and filming decisions but it is also infinitely more interesting than other assembly line super capers for this very reason, and is largely its own thing rather than a tick box venture in universe building. All in all, it is a good night out, with a pigeon-saving, people-avoiding, new kind of hero and a finale that plays out like Highlander’s final set piece had it been sponsored by Pepsi! Chalk Madame Web up as one of those so called “disasters” that a select few (*raises hand) will gladly go back to and enjoy every time (Jonah Hex, Spawn, Howard The Duck) rather than an empty husk of a movie that you forget about as soon as you leave the cinema (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania) or truly a title deserving of worst comic book film ever (Fant4stic).  Maybe we are going slightly mad (it finally happened…), but we can foresee a certain crowd embracing this fun flick down the line. This Madame caught us in her web clearly!"
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," Madame Web (2024) exists in one of those weird places where it is so silly, so ridiculous, and so outrageously inane that it’s almost worth seeing for the sheer calamity of it all. Some may see that as a positive. If there’s one criticism that has remained constant for superhero films (particularly the Marvel/Disney ones), it’s that they have increasingly felt factory produced. More and more, they lack personality. You can’t really say the same about this. As a Sony production, it does contain tons of identifiable traits – but not in the way it was possibly intended. This is not a good movie. In fact, it might be one of the worst comic book blockbusters of recent memory. But hey, it’s better to be remembered than forgotten, right? In style, tone, and execution, this feels like a relic of the past. Back before CGI and special effects made anything possible, superhero films had to work around obstacles to make us believe that people could fly, leap tall buildings, or shoot laser beams out of their eyes. Sure, sometimes you’ll get a legitimate hit like Superman (1978). Other times, you’ll end up with something campy like Captain America (1990). Something tells me that deep down, Madame Web wanted to be the latter. Director S.J. Clarkson (who also co-writes with Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker) inject little hints – whether it be a line of dialogue, camera move, or edit – that makes me wonder if this was meant to be more tongue-in-cheek. At least that’s what I’m hoping. If this was always supposed to be a straightforward origin story, then it fails on all counts. Visually, Clarkson’s direction (in coordination with Mauro Fiore’s cinematography) incorporates dramatic camera moves that are reminiscent of music videos. The frame spins and twirls in exaggerated angles, sometimes going completely upside down. Flashing lights and hyperactive cutting swing us back and forth in time and place. For a story that heavily features a shifting timeline, this approach makes sense. But when it comes to the action, the disorienting style takes away from the cohesiveness. We can’t really tell what is going on, it’s all a barrage of images hurtling at us with little sense of rhythm. The biggest victim in all of this might be the pacing. Because the narrative barrels forward without ever letting us catch our bearings, it feels like it is stuck in the first act. There is a notion that everything we see is a set up for something else, but there’s no payoff to satisfy our suspicions. The writing does little to help things along. The character work is flat and uninteresting, and in some cases, completely absent. We learn that Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a NYC paramedic who lost her mother in childbirth. What she doesn’t realize is that her mother was studying a special breed of spiders in Peru at the time (why a nine-month pregnant woman would be deep in the Amazon to begin with is anyone’s guess). As fate would have it, one of these spiders bit Cassandra’s mother, thus endowing the yet-to-be-born Cassandra with the power of clairvoyance. She can see into the future and can visualize the results (and consequences) of choices made in the present. This gift, unfortunately, comes with a set a problems. Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) – who worked with Cassandra’s mother back then – has also been granted this ability. For reasons I will not describe, Ezekiel has become fixated on killing three young women – Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya (Isabela Merced) – and won’t let anything stand in his way, including Cassandra. Whew, that’s a lot of ground to cover, isn’t it? Essentially, the plot takes on a similar structure as The Terminator (1984), in which Cassandra must protect three lives – all of whom play an important role in the future – from a near unstoppable force. And that’s about it. I wish I could say there was more to it than that, but the film operates strictly on the surface. We don’t learn much of anyone beyond basic attributes. In some instances, their actions defy logic altogether. When Cassandra tells the three women to lay low and not draw attention to themselves, they respond by going to a diner, meeting a group of boys, and dancing on a table to Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” I understand this is supposed to be set in the early 2000s, but was there no other way of showing that? If you were trying to get away from a killer, would your first inclination be to dance on a table for everyone to see?  God bless Dakota Johnson. She is a talented actor who – in the right project – can deliver a performance of warmth and authenticity (see her work in The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Lost Daughter, and Cha Cha Real Smooth as prime examples). As Cassandra Webb, she adds a dash of sarcastic wit that makes the character more interesting than it should be. There has been lots of rumors and speculation over Johnson’s involvement with the film, the fact that she (as of this writing) has not seen it yet, and her “curious” interviews in the promotional campaign leading up to its release. It’s almost as if she can see the writing on the wall, and instead of taking things seriously is out there having as much fun as she can. We see it in her performance as well. Even though the movie has a lot of speed bumps, Johnson at least appears to be enjoying the chaos. Madame Web might appeal to those with a morbid sense of curiosity – just to see what all the hubbub is about. If you’re one of those people, then by all means watch it and enjoy. But for those looking for a superhero movie with good action, well developed characters, and an engaging story, then you are in the wrong place. I’m a firm believer that to know what a good movie is, one needs to know what a bad one is as well. I think we all know where this one lands."
"Feb 20, 2024",negative,"This movie was not good enough for theaters, streaming, or your direct-to-DVD bargain bin. It made Morbius look like Citizen Kane. It dangles Spider-Man references at us like keys in front of a cat."
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," The Sony Universe of Spider-Man adjacent movies continue with Madame Web, yet another baffling and nonsensical adventure of absolutely nothing. While the movie is absolutely not as terrible as most are making it seem, it’s still a story that goes nowhere, until it’s seemingly even more disappointing end game. The lesser-known Marvel Comics character in her own movie, along with some much more interesting characters we don’t actually get to spend time with. Read on for my Madame Web review.  Madame Web is a Spider-Man character made popular by the 90s animated Spider-Man series. The comic character is one of the hero’s lesser-known villains, but apparently was the right choice for Sony to make another Spider-Man villain into a kind of anti-hero. The story of Madame Web tries to make the character into an actual hero, but it does so in very strange and odd ways. The movie is about Cassandra Web (Dakota Johnson), a Paramedic in New York who begins to experience visions of the future after a brush with death.  Despite being a movie about a Spider-Man character that cannot ever mention Spider-Man, Madame Web gets dangerously close. And I can’t understand why. There’s a whole side story about Peter Parker himself. Cassie’s partner on the job is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), a young uncle of Peter Parker. Throughout the movie, Ben is seen taking care of his sister-in-law, Mary Parker, as she is pregnant with a son. Part of the third act climax is also about how Mary and Ben are caught up in this adventure of Cassie’s.  Madame Web also teams up with Cassie with three young women who are other Spiderverse characters from the Comics. The three women, played by Isabel Merced, Sydney Sweeney, and Celeste O’Connor, are characters who will eventually get powers and become various spider-woman characters from the comics. These three characters and the chemistry between their actresses make them so much more interesting than the main lead. More interesting than anything Johnson does in the movie.  And while I don’t want to spoil anything in this Madame Web review, let’s just say that the girl’s history and their story don’t get much importance in the movie. Which is one of the more disappointing elements of Madame Web. A movie that had the framework and potential to be pretty great, but gets lost in its convoluted mess. There are hilarious moments, and some pretty funny back-and-forth between the 3 girls, the ultimate climax feels more like a setup than any kind of resolution to the story audiences just saw. All in all, a disappointing entry into more Spider-Man movies without Spider-Man, that continues to make us wonder, ‘why?!’"
"Feb 20, 2024",negative," It seems a little cruel to dogpile on a movie that has been bashed even before it was released. But for the life of me, I’m having a really hard time coming up with anything kind to say about Madame Web. All those seemingly infinite resources, and this is what the filmmakers come up with? Perhaps this is the beginning of the end of the unshakeable hold that superhero movies have had on the box office for the past decade and a half. Now, to clear up a little confusion about where this movie fits in the superhero genre, yes, it is a Spiderman spin-off and Spiderman is a Marvel character. But no, Madame Web is not part of Disney’s Marvel Universe. Sony holds the licensing to Spiderman and all its spidey off-shoots. When Spiderman does cavort with Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, etc., it’s with the express permission of Sony executives. You don’t get the feeling anyone involved with the film tried very hard. Dakota Johnson sleepwalks her way through the portrayal of Cassie, a misanthropic paramedic whose mother died giving birth to her in a jungle where she was researching exotic spiders with curative powers. Granted, Johnson was given a ridiculous, cliche-ridden script, but had she inserted a little emotion, perhaps a whiff of irony here and there, her performance might have been more memorable. Cassie inadvertently finds herself in a position to protect three teenage girls who have caught the lethal attention of one Ezekiel Sims (who coincidentally had a nefarious connection with Cassie’s mom back in the jungle). Played by Tahar Rahim, (Napoleon, The Mauritanian), he is one of the most lackluster, forgettable villains to stumble across the big screen. Should he rain down hellfire on the girls who he dreams are destined to kill him, or should he buff his nails? Does anyone really care? The entire film seems like one long, tiresome setup for a sequel, a goal that is sadly (but perhaps fortunately for viewers) out of its reach.

"Feb 20, 2024",neutral," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzThe female British filmmaker S.J. Clarkson (“Toast”/”Banshee”), with a number of TV credits, directs this dreadful clairvoyant superhero movie that has trouble getting off the ground. Clarkson co-writes it with scriptwriters Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, and Claire Parker. They base it on the story by Sazama, Sharpless & Kerem Sanga.It’s a Spider-Man spin-off that tells the absurd enigmatic Marvel publishing’s standalone origin story of its superhero heroine, who first appeared in the comics in the 1980s as a secondary character. The role is played by Dakota Johnson as an aloof heroine, seemingly not concerned her dialogue would be a joke if it was funny or that her talent is wasted in such an empty role.In 2003, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a NYC paramedic who has a near-death experience and a sad back story. One day she attains the mental superpower to see into the future and change it. Her first use of these powers is to save three teenagers–Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor)–from being targeted by the dangerous madman Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who possesses spider-like powers. We learn he was in the Amazon with her pregnant mom who was researching spiders before she died. Through his powers, which tie in with Cassie’s, Sims had a strong feeling his powers would one day lead to his death.Everything seems amiss in this dud, from the bland story, the poor editing and directing, and that an action pic could possibly have so little action.If I could show off my limited clairvoyant abilities, even I could predict this stinker will flop at the box-office and with the critics."
"Feb 19, 2024",negative," One of two things are going to happen - this movie will fade away very quickly or stories will be written about it for years to come. I have to believe this is not the film turned in by the director, editor, sound team, and others who had a hand in making it. I have to believe this is studio wrangling at its most brazen and embarrassing. Let’s start by acknowledging that making movies is hard. Really hard. I was reminded of this when a TikTok reviewer, Kit Lazer (a really great follow by the way), posted a video about this very fact. I think, as critics and film reviewers, we sometimes lose sight of this - though we shouldn’t. As anyone can attest, working in a creative space, in an effort to create and entertain, or simply to make art for others to view, consider, and consume is something we, as a society, easily take for granted.In full disclosure, I acknowledge that the first draft of this Madame Web review was full of vitriol. I rarely have been so lost, frustrated, and eventually left with slack-jawed disbelief when watching a major studio’s film. In all ways, this is a bad movie. In some ways, so bad you can have fun with it. And perhaps, this will attain some Showgirls-like level of infamy in the months and years to come. I dunno. I think Madame Web is more likely going to become a punchline to a joke about how you botch a superhero movie. “I hope they don’t Madame Web this one!” or “It’s like when you sit down to watch [movie] and you get Madame Web instead!” Something like that.Anyway, Madame Web is a movie clearly ripped out of the hands of director S.J. Clarkson, who, after directing 22 years of television episodes and series, is making her cinematic debut. I have to believe (I want to believe) that editor Leigh Folsom Boyd would attest, if put on a witness stand, that a different cut of Madame Web existed under her watchful eyes. A talented editor, with a resume that includes the last two Tom Holland-led Spider-Man films, Folsom Boyd could not have turned in this cut. I imagine someone in the sound department sat aghast realizing that nearly all of actor Tahar Rahim’s lines were badly, embarrassingly overdubbed in post-production, so much so that we see shots of him simply not talking, his mouth not synced with the words he’s saying, or random shots of him from behind or the side where we can’t see his mouth while talking. Plus, he sounds like he’s in a booth reading lines into a microphone. This sound mix, and blame whoever signed off on it, is one of the worst in recent memory. I want to believe Madame Web is not the work of these talented creators. Because if Sony Pictures’ brass didn’t wrestle control of this film away from people, and this is what was turned in - I find myself going back to writing the kind of review I truly want to avoid. As presented though, Madame Web is an abomination. It makes no sense. The film has no tone. The gaffes are mighty, the performers either miscast, checked out, or acting in a completely different film. There are at least a couple of instances where lines are repeated, which, as has been surmised online, may be an actor giving two line readings and then instead of picking the correct one, both were left in. I mean, I could go on and on.Basically, this is an origin story introducing Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson). Cassie, as she is known, was born in a remote Peruvian jungle in 1973, when her mother, an anthropologist, gave birth to her in distress after being betrayed and shot by colleague Ezekiel Sims (Rahim in appearance, voice still TBD). Ezekiel steals a spider, long sought after among those who seek such things, and by the year 2003, he has nefarious goals, Spider-Man like abilities and the vision to see into the future.Ezekiel also has not aged a day it seems in 30 years, but we move on.Cassie meanwhile is a paramedic. Her best friend and work partner is Ben Parker (Adam Scott), not quite an uncle as his sister Mary (Emma Roberts) is close to having her first child. We learn she is having a boy, whose name is obscured by popping balloons and a sudden callout to an emergency. Peter. The boy’s name is Peter, in case anyone is wondering.  Let’s start by acknowledging that making movies is hard. Really hard.

This naturally collides with Ezekiel, who himself is having visions of three teenage girls, wearing Spidery outfits, who will eventually kill him. He decides to kill them first. Cassie starts seeing how he will do this. And then, fates align and she becomes a reluctant protector to the three girls, who she has randomly encountered at work, at a hospital, and in her apartment building.The teenage girls - Anya, an immigrant worried about deportation (Isabela Merced), Julia, a rule following high schooler (Sidney Sweeney), and Mattie, a skateboarder (Celeste O’Connor) - are full of sass, questions, and confusion. By the time they come together in a stolen taxi, driven by Cassie, we too, ironically, are full of sass, questions, and confusion.Beyond this set up, Madame Web slings webs of empty fortune. No one seems to be engaged, no one seems to care. The non-ADR line readings in the film feel as if they are being read off of a page at a first-view table read. There is no passion, no enthusiasm for a story and script credited to five individuals, of which two of them - Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - have never surpassed 25% on the Tomatometer for any of their four previous films.Perhaps my favorite character is that of Amaria (Zosia Mamet). Amaria sits at a makeshift set of monitors with access to every “camera in the city” to try and track down where Anya, Julia and Mattie happen to be. She never has a scene where she is not seated in front of the computers and softly pushes Ezekiel into discussing his diabolical plans while she furrows her brow once she realizes she is being paid to help target teenage girls her boss hopes to murder. Nevertheless she persisted.If the massive, blatant product placement doesn’t get you, the rushed, harried visual effects will bring frustration. The incomprehensible story notwithstanding, it is strange that a movie with so many nods and winks to the Sony/Marvel Spider-Man movies never outright connects those dots. However, on the list of issues with Madame Web, that is admittedly way down the list.Here’s hoping the stain of this washes away soon for all involved. But in a world where Morbius exists (written by Sazama and Sharpless, no less!) and the Miles Teller-led Fantastic Four made it to the big screen all those years ago, Madame Web may ultimately represent the nadir of the Sony/Marvel superhero partnership. A movie so bad, it makes you wonder if Sony has such little regard for its audience that they assume anything with a Marvel connection will draw money. Let this be the bottom. Let everyone pause for a minute and think about what they have done. And let’s hope everyone can see into the future and recognize just how embarrassing a movie this truly is. In those reflections, may the blame also fall to the appropriate people. Because…let’s remember friends…moviemaking is really hard work.

"Feb 19, 2024",negative," The build up to the latest Spider-man spin-off hasn’t filled movie fans with excitement, if they’re even aware of it at all. The posters for Madame Web give little away other than the faces of the impressive cast, while star Dakota Johnson gave a dubious description of the film while hosting Saturday Night Live: “Kind of like if A.I. generated your boyfriend’s perfect movie.” That may have been a joke, but given Hollywood has suffered a couple of high-profile box-office bombs already in 2024, producers may be hoping not to be the next punchline. To put it very basically, Sony Pictures own the Spider-man movie rights, but not Disney’s main Marvel Cinematic Universe. Both studios share the character for main MCU films, but Sony also have their own spin-off movies like Venom, Morbius, and now Madame Web. Johnson stars as Cassie, a paramedic who develops clairvoyant abilities. Through these new powers, the socially awkward Cassie must save three teenage girls from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a hunter with a connection to her past.  Another year, another pointless superhero entry. Yes, there have been some hits after 2019’s high point, Avengers: Endgame, both in the main MCU timeline and Sony’s Spider Verse. However, Madame Web is another example of the barrel being scraped in the hopes that audiences will buy into anything with superpowers. The script is painful at times, preferring bland exposition instead of trusting audiences to understand what’s going on.  There is a glimmer of hope in Cassie’s characterisation as a recluse who views her powers as a nuisance, but that quickly fades once she inevitably has to take the plot seriously (well, someone should!). On the whole, it’s an empty cat-and-mouse thriller that might have had something to say had it been released twenty years ago (when the film is set), but now feels like an awkward apology for a franchise starter.  Johnson’s sardonic demeanour may work for some, but it’s clear the Fifty Shades actor would much rather be somewhere else. Equally Rahim, best known for award winners A Prophet and The Mauritanian, is turning up for the blockbuster pay day in a forgettable bad guy role. The three teens – Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, and Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney – all fight against bland material that’s happy to put them in teen pigeonholes.  Perhaps the film’s greatest sin is the lack of connection between the female leads. Basing a superhero movie around sisterhood or found family would have been a fresh way to approach this kind of film, something that the MCU almost achieved with The Marvels. Instead, these women are bunched together for arbitrary reasons that never get built on.  Madame Web feels like the depressing nadir act of corporate movie franchises,  thrashing around for nearly two hours looking for a reason to exist. Bereft of ideas and invention, it’s a prime example of the laziness that has seen superhero movies descend into their seemingly terminal downward spiral. "
"Feb 19, 2024",neutral, Eight reviews this week from Erik Childress and Steve Prokopy run the gamut from good documentaries to surprisingly-not-so-bad to shockingly awful. Where do all of these films fit in? How do you feel about an action film from the director of Underwater with this name (Land of Bad) or the rookie secret service agent trying to save the President with this one (Air Force One Down)? Ewan McGregor takes a road trip with his addicted daughter (Bleeding Love) and Lily Sullivan stumbles upon an alien conspiracy (Monolith). Those documentaries include a scary one about Christian Nationalism (God & Country) and a more inspiring one about the history of black astronauts (The Space Race). Finally in theaters this weekend comes another musical biopic (Bob Marley: One Love) and another Sony Spider-Man adjacent comic book tale (Madame Web) that have their own set of problems.
"Feb 19, 2024",negative," Decades into the comic-book-movie experience, filmmakers are still experimenting with the form. Madame Web, the latest in Sony’s vaguely intertwined series of films connected to the wider world of Spider-Man, is about a woman named Cassie Webb (played by Dakota Johnson) who discovers that she has clairvoyant powers. More noticeably, it’s about an ostensible superhero who approaches perilous danger and supervillain skirmishes with the laconic, standoffish energy one might associate with the ingenue of a Luca Guadagnino movie, not the umpteenth Marvel joint. It’s certainly different to give the superhero-going audience a protagonist who seems uninterested in, and indeed actively exhausted by, the idea of doing good. But that kind of radical passivity can only go so far. Madame Web is allegedly here to offer spills and thrills, while weaving together new strands of a cinematic universe that includes other somewhat deranged Spidey movies such as Venom and Morbius—a misshapen side series sprouting out of the success of the broader Marvel movies. Instead, it gives us Johnson reading dialogue about studying spiders in the Amazon with a tone reeking of “contractual obligation.” As with the Venom films and Morbius, I could never quite decide whether Madame Web’s ineptitude sparked the kind of giggly enjoyment one derives from watching a camp classic. Was the surreal lack of energy from all the actors a wry choice, or was I just watching the sleepiest superhero movie ever made? Supporting actors such as Sydney Sweeney and the delightful Adam Scott normally have a lot of charm, but here they favor drawling, understated line deliveries. As such, it’s hard to ever feel the stakes being raised, even as Cassie (who begins the film as a humble paramedic) starts to explore her dizzying powers of prediction. What does this have to do with Spider-Man, or webs in general? Not too much. Even to a comic-book reader such as myself, Madame Web is something of an obscure character, a sort of human-arachnid seer who pops in and out of the action from time to time. In this film, inexplicably set in 2003, she’s just another 30-something bumming around New York, living alone with a cat. Cassie is an orphan, born to a spider researcher in the Amazon who died in childbirth, but her only superpowers are her killer bangs, red leather jacket, and disarmingly awkward personal style. That is, until she has a near-death encounter while rescuing someone on the job, giving her bizarre visions of her immediate future. This steers her toward three young women—Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who all seem destined to become future heroes, but only if they manage to avoid a creepy, superstrong clairvoyant named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). But what will make them heroes, or why Ezekiel is plagued with visions of them attacking him, is left rather vague. Watching the film doesn’t bring a lot of further clarity. Setting the movie in the past seems to be a choice geared around the hypothetical potential of this cinematic universe—like Madame Web is getting a glimpse into intellectual property yet to come. In her present, though, the action is almost embarrassingly low-key. Cassie is not a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and she’s honestly a mediocre ambulance driver; most of the movie consists of her rushing her teenage charges away from danger. As a villain, Ezekiel is not particularly weighty; Rahim growls every bit of expository dialogue he can, but his motivations are hard to grasp beyond a fear of whatever future heroines these girls will become. For most of the movie, he’s not even really aware of Cassie or her powers. I almost admire the sheer lack of effort on display in the acting, storytelling, and set pieces. To say that Johnson in particular phoned this performance in would be an insult to Alexander Graham Bell. It doesn’t help that every other performance has a strange, stilted energy; even when everyone’s in the same room together, too many line readings feel like they’re being delivered with a Zoom delay. And to be pedantic for a moment, plenty of contemporary Spider-Man movies and spin-offs have been released in the years since 2003, when this film is set, and none mentions the good Madame or her coterie of female sidekicks. So how can the filmmakers pretend that all of this adds up to something audiences might care about? If it wasn’t already clear that superheroic cinematic universes are no longer an exciting idea, Johnson’s involvement feels like a half-hearted wave goodbye."
"Feb 19, 2024",neutral," Superhero fans are a hypercritical bunch, especially when it comes to movie trailers. They dissect every frame and the trailer of Sony’s Spider-Man spin-off, Madame Web, didn’t impress them. Judged to be clunky with too much exposition and risible dialogue, it brought out the meme-writers at their most scornful. The hope was that the film would carry on the winning streak established by Wonder Woman in 2017, when it defied the odds by proving that a superhero movie with a female lead could be a box-office hit. Captain Marvel confirmed the good news by grossing more than a billion US dollars worldwide. And Black Widow did pretty well, too. Then last year, there was a resounding hiccup when Warner Brothers shelved DC’s Batgirl without even releasing it to a streaming service. So there’s a lot riding on this one. In Marvel’s comic books, Madame Web is anything but an action hero. A striking figure of mature years, she’s blind and tethered to a life support system, a throne-like chair at the centre of what looks like a giant spider’s web. Her power lies only in her ability to forecast the future. Not surprisingly, she’s had a radical makeover here. Played by Dakota Johnson, Cassie Webb is in her thirties and has all her faculties, although she hasn’t yet become clairvoyant. She’s a paramedic in New York City when her life takes an irrevocable turn to the supernatural with her discovery she’s now psychic. The rest of the narrative is a barely comprehensible mash-up of Spider-Man themes involving the venom of an Amazonian spider that has potent but unreliable properties. A spider bite is indirectly responsible for Cassie’s clairvoyance, but the movie’s villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), another supporting character from the comics, has acquired extra benefits from his entomological connections. He can crawl across ceilings and generally carry on like Spider-Man’s evil uncle. And his main mission is to murder three women who are fated to kill him in 10 years’ time. At present, however, they’re air-headed adolescents and Cassie finds, to her disgust, only she is capable of protecting them. So it’s a story about bumbling into greatness and, it has to be said, the bumbling bits are mildly funny. Director SJ Clarkson has helmed episodes of Succession, which makes sense. At their most entitled, the three teens give off faint echoes of the Roy offspring. But as soon as they’re revealed to be just a group of misunderstood kids with neglectful parents, the cliches multiply at a dispiriting rate. Things also take a turn to the portentous, which does not sit well with the shamelessly ludicrous nature of the plot. The fact that the writers of Sony’s 2022 flop Morbius had a hand in this storyline didn’t augur well. And so it’s turned out. The film plays like another desperate attempt to keep the franchise flag flying."
"Feb 19, 2024",positive," Almost as long as there have been comic books, there have been movies made about comic book characters.  However, over fifteen years ago Marvel studios upped the ante with the release of Iron Man, setting off several phases and numerous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU.  Over time, these films have dwindled in popularity, due in part to their ridiculous plots, as well as over-saturation.  From Asgardian Gods to Wakandian Kings and everything in between, it seems we have seen it all...or so we thought.  This month Sony Pictures released their fourth movie in the Spider-Man Universe, about a lesser-known character, called Madame Web. Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson; Bad Times at the El Royale) never knew her mother or father. All she had was her mother's research trying to locate an elusive spider that supposedly has healing powers.  Years later, working as a paramedic, she suddenly finds herself in situations where she thinks she is experiencing Deja Vu.  However, she soon discovers her visions are premonitions of things to come and that she can change the outcomes if she acts fast enough.  Meeting three young women, whose deaths she sees before they occur, Cassandra learns their lives are intertwined and has to do with her deceased mother's research, sending her to South America to try and find some answers.  Madame Web first appeared in No. 210 of the Amazing Spider-Man Comic series published in November 1980.  She is clairvoyant and a precognitive mutant who can see events before they happen.  She is typically a supporting character in the comic books, assisting Spider-Man with missing persons cases.  She is a woman with myasthenia graves and is connected to a life support system resembling a spiderweb.  In the comics, she is generally seen as an elderly woman while in the film she is probably considered to be in her mid-thirties.  Since director S.J. Clarkson (The Defenders) chose to cast a younger actor in the role of Cassandra Web, Johnson was a strong choice. (Had she decided to choose a more mature lead, Dame Helen Mirren might have been an excellent option).  Johnson manages to portray Web as strong and confident on the outside while hiding wounds and scars inside.  Web's disciples are played by Sydney Sweeney (Anyone But You), Isabela Merced (Transformers: The Last Night [as Isabela Moner]) and Celeste O'Connor (Freaky).  All three actors are up-and-coming talents in Hollywood and the combination of them with Johnson is electric. They all have great chemistry and come across as a cohesive team. The script is decent with a few cheesy lines here or there but nothing that would make the viewer groan in disgust.  The special effects are done very well, which is a nice change from some of the other recent superhero movies.  Ezekiel Sims' (Tahar Rahim; The Mauritanian) crawling on the ceiling in a spider-like costume seems plausible in this case as the CGI work is very well done. While we won't know why Madame Web is a step up from the other Marvel movies of late, one could speculate it is because the film was produced by Sony.  If that is the case maybe they want to try and give Sony a go at a few of the other upcoming films in the MCU since Madame Web got some things correct.

"Feb 19, 2024",negative," I’m not sure where to start.
By now, you’ve likely heard about Sony’s newest Spider-Verse entry, Madame Web. You’ve probably heard critics from early screenings talk about how bad it is. Watched TikToks about how it’s the worst movie ever made. Seen a Rotten Tomatoes score that looks more like your car’s interest rate than a film rating. Maybe you’ve even heard jokes about how it makes Morbius look like The Godfather. Yet what many of these reviews, commentaries, and videos fail to really understand about Madame Web is just how much work has been put into this project. How much energy and time, and effort it takes to create a film that fails on so many levels. Because make no mistake: Madame Web is terrible. It’s a burning dumpster that’s been dropped from an AC-130 into an inactive volcano filled with moldy fish. It’s not just bad — it’s amazingly bad. It’s the kind of bad that’s so all-encompassing that it can’t possibly be an accident — it’s either the product of conscious decision-making or it’s a cosmic joke where the punchline is a shovel to the head. Things that failed:
The acting. The acting is the kind of miserable, lethargic exercise in dullness that you haven’t seen since The Phantom Menace. It’s the kind of acting — and this goes for everyone — where you wonder if after every take, director SJ Clarkson (Toast, a Game of Thrones prequel that died in the womb)) would say, “CUT! OK, let’s try it again, but with less effort.” The dialogue. The dialogue — well, the script in general — is so rote and cliché-ridden that it actually feels like parody. Every actor is wasted on the absolutely wretched lines they’re forced to deliver. And there are great actors here! Sydney Sweeney has a good bit of talent! Isabella Merced, too! Damn it, Adam Scott is here! Playing … I shit you not … Ben Parker. Yes, that Ben Parker. Does he say the famous line? No, he does not. That line is instead delivered by a Peruvian tribesman who lives in a tree. I did not make that up. Finally (well, not finally, but I’m running out of energy)… the gratuitous product placement. It’s astonishing. It’s almost admirable in its naked blatancy. Every can of Pepsi practically glows. Every bottle of Budweiser glistens with dew. Put it this way — the product placement is so overt and shameless that the villain is killed by a Pepsi sign. I did not make that up either. Nothing. Nothing worked. This movie is a detestable altar of sacrifice to the gods of ignorance and greed, a worthless strip of celluloid that should be buried under a landfill. It’s a thing that should not be. I am less for having seen it. Save yourselves."
"Feb 19, 2024",negative," Madame Web is an $80m (£63m) film with the quality of an unlicensed superhero painted on the side of a carnival ride. It’s desperate and seems embarrassed of itself, the pained shrug of a creative team ordered by Sony executives to keep the wheels turning in their Spider-Man-adjacent universe, all while the actual Spider-Man is out on loan to Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it’s never clarified, Madame Web is presumably meant to exist in the world of Morbius and Venom – where it’s heavily implied a Spider-Man exists, possibly Tom Holland’s, but everyone is legally barred from mentioning it. The film is set in 2003. There is an Uncle Ben (Adam Scott), whose sister (Emma Roberts) is about to give birth to a boy, whose name she knows but physically cannot utter, as if cursed by an ancient witch. Ben is co-workers with a paramedic named Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), whose mother was shot dead in the Amazon while pregnant with her. There’s the line, “When you take on the responsibility, great power will come” – a garbled take on Spider-Man’s famous catchphrase, made now to sound like a translation app gone awry. The film’s script was partially co-written by Morbius’s Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who hit copy and paste on their superhero colonising their powers from the jungles of the Americas. Cassie’s mother was on the trail of a rare Peruvian spider whose venom can “supercharge their cellular structure”. Her security guard Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) shoots her dead and steals it to harness its powers, leading him to nightly visions of his future demise at the hands of three Spider-Women – later a trio of unsupervised teenagers, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), who he’s determined to track down and kill. After a near-death experience, Cassie starts to experience premonitions that eventually land her as the disgruntled caretaker of the girls. In the comic books, Madame Web is an elderly woman and clairvoyant aid to Spider-Man. The film has absolutely no idea what to do, visually, with that kind of power set, so Cassie can either yell at people to move out of the way or hit them with a car. She spends the film switching between both options. The film is obstinate in its internal logic. Cassie’s first port of call after witnessing the future is to visit her optometrist. When she rescues these teen girls, she promptly dumps them in the middle of the woods and drives off, all because she wants to double-check something back at her apartment. Madame Web makes time for Cassie to conduct a CPR demonstration for her new wards, but doesn’t bother to explain how Ezekiel got his hands on an evil Spider-Man suit more than a decade before Spider-Man existed. The infamous bit of dialogue from the trailer that promptly went viral – “He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died” – doesn’t actually feature in the finished product. But there’s plenty of opportunity for Johnson, who delivers every line like she’s trying to catch Ellen DeGeneres in a lie, to say equally bizarre things. “I hope the spiders were worth it, mom,” she says at one point. “Obviously it was bad... she died,” she sighs during another. Director SJ Clarkson, who makes her transition here from television, has a tendency to zoom in dramatically on actors’ faces during dialogue scenes. It’s a trick usually deployed in reality TV to spice up banal conversations. But Madame Web is fiction and has seemingly passed on the opportunity to make itself exciting – instead offering a two-hour prelude to a 30-second trailer for a sequel that will never happen. Ah, well. On to the next Sony project, August’s heavily delayed Aaron Taylor-Johnson vehicle Kraven the Hunter. Let’s see if that one can make a lick of sense."
"Feb 18, 2024",negative," MADAME WEB. With Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabella Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahir Rahim. Screenplay by Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and S.J. Clarkson. Directed by S.J. Clarkson. Rated PG-13 for violence/action and language. 117 minutes. In theaters. Dakota Johnson is a wonderful actress who appears incapable of feigning enthusiasm. As most of the job of a professional movie star involves answering the same stupid questions over and over while pretending to be excited about idiotic shit, her listless, vaguely dismissive junket interviews can feel like a blessed respite from the phony Hollywood hype train. Johnson brings that same energy (or lack thereof) to MADAME WEB, another calamitous comic book movie appearing at what finally feels like the sputtered-out end of the genre’s cultural domination. Like “Venom” and “Morbius” before it and “Kraven The Hunter” coming later this year, it’s one of Sony’s Marvel-adjacent projects. My understanding is that the studio retains the rights to make live-action films featuring characters from the “Spider-Man” comics but not Spidey himself, which is why we’re seeing entire movies devoted to third-tier villains. This is the kind of idea only an executive could love, flooding the market with bootleg knockoffs of a product people were already getting pretty sick of. Everyone in “Madame Web” looks like they’re in crummy mood. The movie unfurls with all the verve of a contractual obligation, while Johnson works her trademark “I’d rather be anywhere else” vibe like we haven’t seen since she went viral for making Ellen miserable. There’s almost a level of performance art to her portrayal of New York paramedic Cassandra Webb, who after a near-death experience begins to manifest psychic powers reminiscent of that old “SNL” sketch spoofing “The Dead Zone” in which Christopher Walken could only see a minute or two into the future. Johnson was the only person involved in the “Fifty Shades” movies who played them as comedies about a woman learning to put up with a rich weirdo boyfriend who gets her off, and she seems to be undermining “Madame Web” in an even more cheerfully destructive manner. Every time Cassandra (see what they did there?) is handed a soda as part of the movie’s obnoxiously omnipresent product placement, Johnson awkwardly rubs and fiddles with the can like she’s never held one before in her life, appearing either unwilling or unable to simply open and drink from it on camera. Its such a bizarre, insanely distracting bit of business – she even inexplicably carries an unopened Pepsi from one scene into the next like she’s cradling a kitten – one can only assume the actress must be amusing herself at the expense of the film. At least somebody’s having fun. For reasons too inane to recount here, she winds up the clairvoyant protector and den mother to three teenage girls (Isabella Merced, Celeste O’Connor, and cartoonishly voluptuous It Girl of the moment Sydney Sweeney) who are being hunted by a freakish billionaire with wall-crawling superpowers and a black Spider-man costume, even though Spider-Man hasn’t been born yet. (More on that in a minute.) This villain is played by Tahir Rahim, the marvelous actor from Jacques Audiard’s “A Prophet” and Hulu’s “The Looming Tower” miniseries, who for some reason has had about 80% of his dialogue poorly re-dubbed and played over shots of the back of his head, as if they’d hastily tried to rewrite the film in the editing room. I’ve seen reality shows with more convincing ADR. Sweeney’s surprise sleeper hit from this past Christmas, “Anyone But You” is still playing down the multiplex hall, a testament to how much shoddy filmmaking audiences – myself included – are willing to overlook for the simple pleasures of watching attractive, charismatic stars fall for one another in exotic locations. (I hope Hollywood takes heed of the “Much Ado About Nothing” riff’s continued success and greenlights more Shakespeare adaptations starring girls with giant gazongas.) Sweeney isn’t given much to do in “Madame Web” besides bicker with the other two teenagers. They all have the same bratty personality and once in awhile non-committedly throw food at each other. While we’re teased with flash-forwards of all three growing up to be the various incarnations of Spider-Woman, this is one of those wannabe franchise movies that’s a prequel to itself, so none of that actually happens in this installment. They don’t even get to wear the cool costumes from the comics. Instead, Sweeney spends the movie in a Catholic schoolgirl outfit, and cinematographer Mario Fiore’s inability to get a single flattering angle of her in it suggests he might be better suited for a job selling pencils. Johnson’s dorky ambulance partner is played by Adam Scott. He doesn’t really have anything to do with the story, but his name is Ben Parker and his sister is about to have a baby. You can probably guess what the kid’s gonna be named, but every time they try to tell you the movie cuts away, presumably for legal reasons. I guess it’s for the sake of this continuity quirk that “Madame Web” makes such a big deal out of being set in 2003, lingering on a massive billboard for Beyonce’s “Dangerously In Love” album and a radio DJ introducing Britney Spears’ “Toxic” as “a new track that’s about to burn up the charts!” Yet at the same time, the rest of the music cues are all early 1990’s hits by the likes of 4 Non Blondes and The Cranberries. I found this almost as perplexing as the soda can stuff. Despite taking place in New York City, “Madame Web” was filmed in Boston during the summer of 2022, which explains why “Queens” looks so much like Downtown Crossing, and why Spider-Man’s uncle lives around the corner from the South Street Diner. You may remember that Sweeney threw out the first pitch on the night that the Red Sox lost 28-5 to the Toronto Blue Jays. (After seeing her on Instagram housing a Fenway Frank, I can understand why our boys in the bullpen might have been a little distracted.) Over the past 25 years, Sean Burns’ reviews, interviews, and essays have appeared in WBUR’s The ARTery, Philadelphia Weekly, The Improper Bostonian, Metro, The Village Voice, Nashville Scene and RogerEbert.com.

"Feb 18, 2024",negative," For the past couple of years, Sony Pictures has tried to build its comic-book series of films with their Spider-Man Universe. They want to compete against the other companies, as well as complement what is being built in the MCU, potentially connecting the two worlds into one giant amalgamation of blockbuster success. The Sony Spider-Man Universe (abbreviated as the SSU) is meant to expand the sandbox of the friendly neighborhood superhero from Queens by creating pictures about some of the supporting characters in the comics, most of which center around villains. Hence, the arrival of “Venom” (and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”) and “Morbius” into our local cinema. It has to be said that these projects have been bankable for what they are worth.  While critically panned, audiences have managed to go out of their way to see these pictures. No matter the disdain from the critics, money tells the whole story. Fans of the source material, or the superhero film craze, have made their impact on ticket sales. Because of such, plans for future side-character action flicks are in play. (“Kraven the Hunter,” which releases later this year, and “Venom 3” coming next.) These films are in such a flux that it is hard to pinpoint exactly where they are headed in the grand scheme. Is there going to be a connective tissue to these films? An “Avengers: Endgame”-like picture that ties them? So far, there’s no hint in sight. They are working as separate pictures that mention the Spider-people only by name, without an appearance. The webbing is quite messy. The latest one to arrive is “Madame Web,” helmed by television director S.J. Clarkson. She’s known for her work in Marvel’s “The Defenders,” “Jessica Jones,” and “Anatomy of a Scandal.” She has already had some experience in this world of superheroes via the aforementioned Netflix shows. Clarkson only directed two episodes in each one of those series. But that counts as background and experience to work with. However, with how the screenplay has been toyed with and manipulated, I believe nobody was ever going to make “Madame Web” function as a proper film to begin with.  With a disorganized premise and no vision in sight, the latest installment in the SSU once again falls flat. This time without an entertainment factor (or social media gag) to tie it with. From the get-go, there are a few issues. There’s a change to the Madame Web character in this film. Instead of having Cassandra Web be a blind, paralyzed old woman hooked to a web-looking support system like in the comics, she is a young paramedic named Cassie, whose psychic powers emerged during a work-related accident. The change comes with the casting of Dakota Johnson in the titular role. She’s a talented actress who has worked with many fantastic filmmakers, from Luca Guadagnino (with whom she has had her best work) to Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Looking at it from another side, no matter what version of the character she played, Johnson couldn’t nail the nature of it all. She didn’t fit in that elevated superhero realm. And that is for the better, as she could do better in more exciting and rich projects than this one. Nevertheless, the film begins with an expedition in the Peruvian Amazon. We see a pregnant arachnologist (Kerry Bishé) and her travel partner (Tahar Rahim) searching for a rare spider whose venom is rumored to cure all diseases. Everything seems to be going as planned until they find the spider. The expected act occurs and gives us the first impression of how plodding the rest of the film will be.  A bite and a betrayal come into play, which leaves the baby an orphan with powers she will handle in the future. The concept of Cassie’s powers is intriguing on paper, somewhat leaning towards a “Terminator”-like territory. The idea of having a person see and change the future as she pleases is not original per se. Yet, the introduction, at least the basics, has some potential. You can turn that into a worthwhile narrative. Now, the problems arise when discussing the concept’s execution. This whole idea is an inexplicable mess that neither the writing team nor the characters can adequately explain. The film then fast forwards to 2003, where we see Cassie work as an EMT.  During one of her shifts, she has an accident that almost costs Cassie her life. In that near-death experience, she awakens her psychic abilities of seeing (and manipulating the future). One of her visions included her coming across three teenage girls—Julia (Sydney Sweeny), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor)—who are in great danger. Ezekiel is on the hunt, searching for the girls. He’s a man cursed by his given gifts and now seeks a way to balance things out. Worried for their safety, Cassie groups the three girls. And tries to find a way to stop the man who wants to kill them. A chase film emerges from this premise. But the necessary tension, thrills, or wit to give the viewer a fun time.  Immediately after this set-up for the main plot point, “Madame Web” goes on a trajectory of plodding repetition, where we have scenes of Cassie experiencing visions and Ezekiel talking to himself about wanting to find the girls before it is too late. These constant exposition dumps intertwined with the running-and-gunning make this film a very frustrating experience to endure. There seems to be a lack of vision in the action set pieces and the narrative itself. One might ask if the team put some thought into these sequences. They feel like copies of what came before but rendered to their most unimaginative states.  “Madame Web” treads the same waters as the pre-MCU comic-book movies of the early 2000s, in the likes of “Catwoman,” “Elektra,” and “Daredevil.” It fits into this schematic not only because of its setting and talented cast attached but also because of its sloppy and messy nature. At the center of this story is an interesting, simple story that a filmmaker can play with. Multiple writers were in charge of writing this story. And you immediately get the sensation that what we see on-screen is a simplification of an amalgamation of more than a dozen ideas. There have been many bad comic-book movie releases recently. The difference between a film like “Thor: Love and Thunder” and “The Flash” and this one is that although they are poorly constructed, you can understand the concept. In “Madame Web,” you can’t even grasp it.  Hector Gonzalez is a Puerto Rican, Tomatometer-Approved film critic and the Co-founder of the PRCA, as well as a member of OFTA and PIFC.

"Feb 17, 2024",negative," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) was an idiosyncrasy long before Madame Web was conceived. 2018’s Venom revealed that star and executive producer Tom Hardy is a bizarre man in the best way possible. Venom: Let There Be Carnage upped the slapstick, puerile tone, and Morbius was a film allegedly best left unviewed (I did). The universe is doomed not to feature Spider-Man (those Disney MCU contracts are mysterious beasts), and their unusual efforts to differentiate themselves from the superhero pack have left them out of touch with popular and critical taste. The worst Madame Web could do was poke a few more holes in the sinking ship, and it’s such an odd swing that it fails to land even that. To be clear: the value of Madame Web and all the SSU is entirely divorced from quality in my book. As a longtime apologist of Fox’s X-Men series, I appreciate anyone working against the notion that superhero movies are bound to the MCU formula, or even a genre, for that matter. The X-Men movies were a mess, and I loved them for their highs and lows. The SSU has been all lows so far, but they’re throwing away narrow notions of superhero movies, too, which earns them a soft spot in my heart. The Venom movies are easier to forgive. They’re charmingly bad, anchored by a committed performance from Hardy that deserves the same beloved status Hugh Jackman earned in his decades as Wolverine.  How did they mess this up? First off, they made it an origin story. Boring, we’re over it, just have a scene where the new superhero’s powers are explained and get to the good stuff. We don’t need Dakota Johnson’s Cassandra Webb running around as a disgruntled paramedic, rejecting thank yous from kids and complaining about New York City traffic. An accident on the job awakens her ability to see into the future, which tips her off that three teenage girls are going to be murdered by a leeringly evil man with spider-like abilities (Tahar Rahim), and her intervention leads to the movie-long discovery of her powers. Only by the end is she truly Madame Web, and boy is it a slog to spend that much time on a plot everyone knows like the back of their hand. The good news is that there’s fun to be had along the way (mostly unintentionally). The script is a mess of blunt exposition that leads to some hysterically undeliverable lines, which is somehow topped by every single word out of Rahim’s mouth feeling like it was delivered in a sound booth far away from the set and entirely divorced from the tone of the scene. But what really exemplifies this film’s self-inflicted tomfoolery is a cat. Cassandra is a stubborn loner, you see, which must have made the writers think of Breakfast at Tiffany’s. So they give her a stray cat she calls Cat, as a fun reference. They mercifully resisted casting an orange boy to play the stray (you can’t outdo Orangey, the legendary cat actor featured in Breakfast at Tiffany’s). Instead, they cast an unmistakable rotund chonker to waltz onscreen and lap up some milk. Two things here. One, why would you cast an overweight cat as your stray? There’s no good answer to this one. Two, many adult cats are lactose intolerant, and even if the kitty can keep it down, cow’s milk doesn’t provide the nutrition they need. Cassandra may as well have given the cat a bowl of the film’s ubiquitous product placement, Pepsi, for all the good she was doing it. Or maybe the film is implying that she doesn’t care about the cat at all and is purposefully inducing diarrhea or bulking up an already big boy? Don’t worry, the movie isn’t that smart. They just made a minor plot point make no sense, a small thing amid major plot points that make no sense.  The other inexplicable, self-inflicted wound is the casting of Dakota Johnson. Her low-key, borderline petulant presence makes absolutely no sense as a burgeoning hero, and whether this incongruity is a positive or negative will entirely come down to personal taste. For me, she operated as a salve that nearly healed the whole thing. She never feels like she wants to be in the movie, and the most verve she brings is when she’s seemingly playing with the material, talking down to the very movie she’s leading. Johnson has long been making promotional work performance art (remember her takedown of Ellen DeGeneres?), and with Madame Web, she’s seemingly targeted this playful disdain for industry requirements on the ubiquity of superhero movies. Or maybe that’s just wishful thinking on my part, and she just delivered a terrible performance. Either way, the performance is hilariously off-kilter, as jarring and strange as all of Michelle Williams’ work in the Venom movies, hence, making it of a piece with the rest of the SSU. The SSU just happens to be awful, so bad some raise up the films as fun-bad. I’m not quite there on Madame Web, but I bet there’s a slightly worse cut of the film that could nudge me over the edge."
"Feb 17, 2024",negative,"At best this movie feels like it exists to tease a more interesting film and drop Spider-Man Easter eggs. In execution the characters are all underdeveloped, the performances wooden, and the few good ideas waste."
"Feb 17, 2024",negative," Sony’s fourth Spider-Man spinoff “Madame Web” was doomed from the beginning. Made in conjunction with Marvel, the superhero film features a passionless Dakota Johnson in her worst performance since the “Fifty Shades of Grey” trilogy. The story written by director S.J. Clarkson and three cowriters including the team responsible for “Morbius,” “Gods of Egypt,” “The Last Witch Hunter,” and “Dracula Untold,” is filled with ridiculous dialogue, and we get a second-rate villain played by Tahir Rahim who mutters his badly dubbed lines. You don’t have to be a clairvoyant to catch the warning signs, just watch the trailer. Paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) saves lives when she’s not being saved by her coworker Ben Parker (Adam Scott). After he rescues her from a submerged vehicle, she awakens with superpowers including clairvoyance. Cassie sees snippets of the future which begin as weird moments of déjà vu. When she begins to realize what’s happening (in “Groundhog Day” do-over style) her second sight puts her in the path of three teenage girls about to be murdered. The teens played by Sydney Sweeny (“Euphoria”) as nerdy white girl Julia Cornwall, Celeste O’Connor (“Ghostbusters: Afterlife”) as skateboarder Mattie Franklin, and Isabela Merced as brainiac Anya Corazon, are seen in Cassie’s visions donning cool Spider-Girl suits while battling the story’s villain Ezekiel Sims (Rahim) who wears a black Spider-Man suit. Cassie saves the girls, who don’t know each other when they come together on the subway, the scene filled with lackluster CGI. The saying, “A hero is only as good as its villain” is a cliché, but there is truth to that line in “Madame Webb.” Rahim, a good French actor whose breakthrough performance came in 2009’s “A Prophet” is dreadful as the story’s barefoot, dapper-dressed antagonist Ezekiel who speaks in an annoying low gravel. Rahim is in competition with Johnson for the film’s worst performance. “Webb” takes place in 2003, as evidenced by Britney Spears’s “Toxic” which spurs the girls to table dance in a roadside diner while expressing their love for the new jam. This is just before Ezekiel shows up trying to kill them AGAIN, only to be saved by Cassie. The song “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes would have worked better in the scene and it falls in line with the timeframe. When Cassie discovers an old photograph dated 1973 of her late mother Constance (Kerry Bishé) with Ezekiel in the Amazon jungle, she travels to the site where she encounters the leader of Las Arañas, a group of Spider-Men who travel across the treetops and we learn more of the Webb’s backstory complete with betrayal and a mythical spider. The film opens with the Amazon scene before jumping 30 years to NYC.  Apart from the bad and insensitive dialogue, Cassie asking her partner Ben (who can’t wait to be an uncle) if he wants to get shot in Queens has spurred an online backlash, the origin story’s biggest problem is that it’s 2-hours of setup followed by the credits. The film’s ending should have happened 45 minutes into the film leading to a fully realized Madame Webb mentoring the teens as they become Spider-Girls preparing to battle Ezekiel for the rest of the story. As is, we get glimpses of a much better film in Cassie’s visions showing the young women in great-looking costumes battling an older grey-haired Ezekiel. Pepsi’s product placement is so conspicuous that the film’s climax involves a fight scene on a giant neon billboard for the cola. “Madame Webb” follows Sony’s spider-verse spinoffs, “Venom,” and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” plus the Jared Leto vampire flick “Morbius,” all of which are better than this hot mess.  Adam Scott, Mike Epps, Zosia Mamet, and Emma Roberts as pregnant Mary Parker (cue the music) are wasted in the film, the silver lining is at least they are not subject to much of the horrible dialogue. I like Dakota Johnson; she’s given us many terrific performances including 2022’s “Cha Cha Real Smooth” but she is miscast as Cassie and for most of the film she delivers her lines with a lack of enthusiasm. I don’t blame her. The song “Bury a Friend” by Billie Eilish serves as a harbinger of bad films. It was featured in the trailers for “Madame Webb” and “Night Swim.” On the small screen, it has the opposite effect, as the foreboding track fits perfectly as the theme for HBO’s “True Detective: Night Country.” MAILING ADDRESS: 2003 8th Ave., #300, Fort Worth, TX 76110PHONE: 817.405.9318EMAIL: hello@fortworthreport.orgOur MissionWe pledge to produce high-quality objective local journalism that informs public decision-making, addresses the quality of life of our community’s citizens, holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers’ stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood.

"Feb 17, 2024",negative," Yikes! I’ve made a habit and a living from pulling the wings off the more pitiful creatures caught up in the Marvel and DC Universe, but arriving at Madame Web with Fortinbras timing some two days after its release, I find the carcass stripped clean by critics and audiences alike; this is a bad movie we can all agree on as the nadir moving forward. This is multiverse, meta-verse, cobblers-o-verse stuff from Sony, licencing the Spiderman universe from Marvel but somehow not having the rights to show the main character; ie a worthless property. I remember the speculation when all this potential with IP was initially being unlocked, they’d say; imagine a film about Miss Monneypenny! But who wants that? She sits at her desk and flirts with the male staff. That’s all she does; make her do anything else and she’s just not Miss Monneypenny anymore. There’s absolutely nothing in Madame Web’s universe to make it worth exploring for supposed fans of this genre. So set your self-serving gobbledygook threshold to overload and let’s get stuck in. Instead of the aged psychic grandma in the comics, this Madame Web is Cassandra Webb, a spunky NYC ambulance driver played by Dakota Johnson, the daughter of a woman who had her health restored by mysterious spider-men after giving birth in the jungle in Peru in 1973. Why a heavily pregnant woman in 1973 would be in a jungle investigating spider people might seem like an issue until you set eyes on Tahar Rahim, so good in A Prophet, now looking like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Manuel from Fawlty Towers and speaking the same kind of English-as-she-is-spoke, except the words never come out of his mouth. ‘You have no idea of the torment and torture of dying all over again…can you imagine how frustrating it’s been trying to identify someone you’ve only seen in a vision?’ Sigh. What’s gone so wrong for SJ Clarkson’s movie? So, it looks like they planned this movie as a religious nativity scene around the birth of Andrew Garfield’s Spider Man, then re-did it around Tom Holland’s incarnation of Peter Parker. There’s continual compelling visual evidence through sound and music that it’s 2003 and not 1993, for all the difference that makes. There’s time-specific adverts for Pepsi and Beyonce and characters discuss how Britney Spears’ Toxic has just come out. Webb’s co-ambulance driver is Adam Scott from Parks and Rec but he’s so old now he’s playing Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben so that Madame Web can help him with his mad rush to the hospital for the birth of Spiderman. Madame Web also goes to a baby shower for Ben’s sister Mary (Emma Roberts) and has prophetic visions of the future that may not come true. Meanwhile Ezekiel Sims (Rahim) has a vision of a gaggle of costumed and accessorised Marvels/Justice Society/Who cares? spider-girls killing him, and is tracking down the young women and kill them first. All you need to know is that Madame Web’s badly-edited deja-vu visions enable her to change the future, save the girls and kill the baddie. Madame Web wins out in annoying fashion because although she claims she can’t control her powers, she gives every scene a do-over when she doesn’t get what she wants and the audience have to watch the same action over and over again with different outcomes. Similarly, the film-makers seem to have had several do-overs at adjusting the time-period, characters and storyline here, with tell-tale dialogue not synchronised with the images. Sydney Sweeney is amongst those buried in the jumble; Johnson can’t do anything as a character who spends her recreational time staring at her own birth certificate in an effort to remind herself (and us) of who she is. Nor can Johnson do much with a scene in which Madame Web rescues the girls by stealing a taxi and driving it through the window of a restaurant, an act which fails to arouse any consequence in a fakey New York that looks like it was smooshed together from old photographs and adverts. ‘He can climb on walls, how is that even possible?’ the hipster spider-girl team ask about Ezekiel Sims, opening up another confusing question; I thought Peter Parker was trying to protect his own identify, rather than the existence of all super-heroes ever. Perhaps that’s why his birth takes on an almost Biblical reverence here, with Uncle Ben as Joseph? It’s hard to find the right words to close out this gibberish gumbo of remixed, re-hashed lore but somehow Madame Web provides it in the climax. ‘When you take on responsibility, great power will come.’ Sony had Madame Web written by the guys who wrote Morbius, they were so pleased with how hard that turd flushed; I wouldn’t trust them to empty my bins, and yet here we are. The verdict is in; file Madame Web along with Elektra and the most annoying, confusing, unwanted cash-grab spin-offs at the end of the comic book era. I’m blaming the distributors. Nothing else to see except this and Memory so as depressing a double bill as I can remember. Interesting to see the bullet Sydney Sweeney dodged. Actually, the three kids were impressive, thought the superhero costumes plain awful. Who in their right mind could have greenlit such nonsense? This is pretty much a prequel and Dakota Johnson just looks plain puzzled to be in it. The whole alternative future notion is quite clever but gets boring quickly. At least I saw them months apart, but they’re both bleak but in different ways. Being able to see a minute into the future is like a cheat code rather than a super-power; no chance of losing out while you’re resetting every time things go against you, so, like Spiderman’s fluid, her powers dry up whenever she really needs them. I think constant recutting has rendered this film as gibberish, I genuinely can’t imagine this getting green-lit on that script. It’s also worth noting that all the MCU and DC hate is directed towards female led films, indicating that male fan-boy angst is driving the collapse of these franchises. Interesting gender perspective.  Did they hammer Black Widow as well? It looked like they re-shot stuff to bring in that other element. It wasn’t much of a concept and giving a glimpse of what the teenagers could do was like a credit sequence. Just awful. So much manoeuvring. Yet I genuinely didn’t get who these girls were, or what this had to do with Peter Parker being born, or why there were no other superheroes apart from Ezekiel Sims, it was like reading the manual for a product you can’t use, written in a language you barely speak. They can have that quote for the poster. I’m both a big Marvel and Dakota Johnson fan. I found this awful. Just. Awful. There are a couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like Artificial Intelligence wrote it, which is not a compliment. The marketing folks were more than “devious” when it came to the trailer, but they had to do something to make it look watchable – don’t want to spoil anything for those who venture forth. Now to be sure, I don’t think it is the worst superhero movie ever made. I think the best way to sum it all up is it looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is actually set in, which also is not a compliment. Dakota is so much better suited to Cha Cha Real Smooth and Peanut Butter Falcon-type roles. A superheroine…nope. Felt like an Elektra period Marvel movie, compromised, ham fisted product. Johnson good in the films you mention, but has an impossible role to play here. That chat either the spider people was awful, and the stuff between Rahim and Zozie Mamet was absolute cringe. Did they change the time period after it was shot? I couldn’t work out exactly what had gone wrong, but something did. Pulling Kraven the Whatever he was from last year suggests it’s a turkey as well. You can’t tell from the trailer quite how off the rails this goes. Not good. You comparing it to Elektra was all that was needed to sink this ship.
Even Psychic Grandma could have foretold that Sony would screw this up! Why couldn’t Sony have just made a Psychic Grandma movie, that’s what the fanboys want. Maybe not with her in it, but set in that universe? Oddly enough, that’s one of a blizzard of problems here. Madame Web has intimate do overs, so can’t lose as a superhero. Of course her ability to use her super powers comes and goes, just like how Spidey’s web fluid runs out at key moments when the narrative suits. It’s kiddie stuff. Out of curiosity, was there any dumb sinister six stuff here? No vulture? No morbius? Have they given up on the dream of a sinister six movie without the guy the sinister six are supposed to fight? No nothing. I’m sure there are better placed than me to get the easter eggs that are usually jammed into this; I was out the door before any post/mid credits malarkey, but apparently there’s none. It seems to be about establishing this all girl spiderman alternative team but they don’t seem to have names, character or even costimes; the way they appear in the trailer is somehow outside the scope of the film. No venom, no anything, I can’t even see what a fanboy would get from this. Maybe on your second watch, things will click into place. To be honest, all the bad press had me kind of interested. And the trailer actually looks kind of interesting. But still pretty sure I’ll pass. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes. All images are copyrighted to their respective owners.

"Feb 17, 2024",negative," Madame Web, Sony’s latest entry in its ongoing Spider-Man universe, is a tangled mess. Not winkingly fun enough to be camp, it’s an embarrassment of dull action, sloppy plotting, and a protagonist who seems like she wishes she were anywhere else. Dakota Johnson (Persuasion) plays Cassie Webb, a New York City paramedic whose driving skills are her greatest skill before she becomes clairvoyant. Her second sight activates after she nearly dies on the job, granting her visions that first feel like déjà vu, then evolve into her seeing a mysterious man attacking three teenage girls. The seeds of Cassie’s power come from the Peruvian jungle, where her late mother, Constance (Kerry Bishé), decades earlier searched for a spider that could cure various illnesses. Upon learning the amazing arachnid also grants people wall-crawling powers and super strength, a colleague, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim, Napoleon), double-crossed the pregnant Constance, shooting her and stealing the spider. Red-suited spider men laughably drop from the jungle canopy to help but only manage to save the baby, along with a suitcase full of convenient photos and journals. Flash-forward to 2003, where the adult Cassie has a work partner named Ben Parker (Adam Scott, Severance) who’s excited to be an uncle—the only Spidey-related tangent the film has. Meanwhile, Ezekiel has become wealthy but obsesses over a recurring vision where the teens kill him once they develop special powers and their own spider gear. “Every day that goes by, my appointment with death grows closer,” he says. That holds true for us all, although it’s not clear what Ezekiel does with his precious time beyond sit in a high-rise, drive a Corvette, and growl at Zosia Mamet (Molli and Max in the Future) as a tech-savvy underling. After fate places Cassie in the girls’ proximity, Cassie intervenes when Ezekiel, in a spider suit, crawls on subway ceilings and more without anyone noticing. New Yorkers are notoriously blasé, but come on. Set in Queens, New Jersey, and the Peruvian jungle by way of filming locations in Massachusetts and Canada, the film’s screwy geography is the least of its problems. Four credited screenwriters—Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, and director S.J. Clarkson—barely develop the story or these characters. They don’t even bother to have Cassie do proper CPR, which is a key plot point. (She just does chest compressions, not the breaths the American Red Cross recommends.) Johnson has become known for her dry, deadpan delivery in interviews, but that demeanor here reads as if she’s tired and miserable. As the teens, Sydney Sweeney (Anyone But You), Isabela Merced (Migration), and Celeste O’Connor (A Good Person) bicker between table-dancing at a diner while they’re supposed to be lying low. The action, such as it is, often involves Cassie driving a stolen cab or ambulance. The film cares nothing for continuity or basic common sense, with her driving the same smashed-up cab before and after popping down to Peru. Clarkson (Anatomy of a Scandal) films Cassie’s visions at varying speeds, repeating the same moments until Cassie realizes she’s seeing the future. The less said about the wispy, weblike special effects, the better. The context of Madame Web as a film is more interesting than anything onscreen. The Ringer this week and NPR previously covered how Sony legally must churn out something related to Spider-Man every few years or lose the movie rights to the friendly neighborhood web-slinger that Sony has held since 1999. Sometimes that generates pop culture magic, such as with the recent Tom Holland-led Spider-Man trilogy or the animated Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Other projects, such as the Tom Hardy-led Venom films, have a B-movie goofiness that’s hard to resist. Madame Web essentially kicks the rights issue down the road until another project like this year’s Kraven the Hunter arrives, further enmeshing Spider-Man within Sony’s clutches. Although Spidey can’t legally untangle himself, viewers at least can tap out—and should. Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better."
"Feb 17, 2024",neutral," Madame Web would be fun if it was a lot better or a lot worse. It’s nowhere good enough to be a first-rate superhero movie, nor is it bad enough to be an amusing Batman & Robin-style trainwreck. The story takes place in 2003, and indeed the film feels like the comic book fare of the early- to mid-2000s – stuff like Elektra, Catwoman, and The Punisher, when filmmakers were still trying to figure out how to bring second-tier characters into the live-action realm. And since it’s an origin story, the plot ends at the spot where most people will wish it began. New York City EMT Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) inexplicably begins getting glimpses of the immediate future after a near-death experience. Her visions involve three teenage girls: Juila (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya (Isabella Merced). They’re in peril from Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a guy with spider-like powers who has had his own premonition that they will one day kill him. Cassie attempts to rescue the girls, while simultaneously figuring out how her abilities tie into his. If you guessed he was in the Amazon with her mom researching spiders before she died, you’ve obviously seen the trailer. The screenplay for Madame Web is atrocious. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless also wrote Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, Power Rangers and Morbius. Their track record is obviously not great. Sims is a flat, uninteresting villain with paper-thin motivation, the dialogue is frequently awkward, and when the girls become costumed crimefighters at the end, no explanation is given for how that occurs. Superhero origin stories need strong characterization and tight plotting to make viewers care about the build-up. We know we’re not going to see the familiar Madame Web and the Spider-Women until the final minutes, so if we aren’t invested in their genesis, the result is empty.  Surprisingly little action takes place in the movie. When it does, the editing is confusingly choppy, thereby robbing it of excitement. Director S.J. Clarkson’s idea of style is to have the camera flip over during the middle of fight scenes, a technique that reeks of desperation and becomes tiresome. The concluding battle is particularly messy, with shoddy CGI and a corny bit of product placement that finds everybody brawling in front of a Pepsi sign. Actually, product placement is ubiquitous. A Calvin Klein billboard factors prominently into another scene. For all that’s bad about Madame Web, a level of entertainment does exist, thanks to the actresses. Dakota Johnson is terrific, giving a funny, self-knowing performance. She seems to recognize how dumb the story is, and her turn as Cassie almost plays like sarcastic commentary on it. On their side, Sweeney, O’Connor, and Merced work up fun chemistry as the teens. Each provides her character with personality, despite the bland script. Collectively, they keep the movie from sinking into bottom-barrel Marvel fare (i.e. Morbius and Fantastic Four). The four leads are easily the best thing here. They could headline a grade-A superhero movie or shine in an intentionally goofy entry like The Marvels. Instead, they’re trapped in a poorly written, stiffly directed dud. What a waste."
"Feb 17, 2024",negative," It gives me no pleasure to report this because we could use some fresh and original superhero adaptations on the big screen these days, but the Dakota Johnson-starring “Madame Web” is one of the worst comic book movies I’ve ever seen. Everything about it seems flat and artificial and contrived, from the limp dialogue to the annoying special effects to some surprisingly uninspired performances, given the talent level of the cast. Even some of the actors come across as if they’d rather be anywhere else but in front of a blue screen, pretending to fight a lackluster and ill-defined Marvel villain while straining to be heard over all the audio pyrotechnics. “Madame Web” kicks off with a cheesy and poorly shot prologue set in the Amazon in 1973, with Kerry Bishé as Constance Webb, a nine-months-pregnant researcher desperately seeking to discover a legendary spider with magical venom that could unlock, I don’t know, the cures for diseases and the mysteries of life and all that jazz. When Constance finally finds the spider, she is betrayed and shot by her hired security expert, one Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim). Constance dies while giving birth to a baby girl. Flash forward to 2003 and Queens, where Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is working as a paramedic, with a bewildered-looking Adam Scott as her best friend and partner, Ben. (Ben! Hmmmm. Or maybe not hmmm.) Now, we know it’s 2003 because we see a terribly photoshopped billboard for Beyoncé’s “Dangerously in Love,” and Britney Spears’ “Toxic” is prominently featured, and at one point Cassie says, “I gotta get home in time for ‘Idol,’ ” even though nothing about her cynical, hardbitten character would indicate she’d be a fan of “American Idol” or even own a TV. With the “Fifty Shades of Grey” star doing her best to let us know SHE knows this is all camp nonsense, Cassie starts to experience jarring and often violent mini-flash-forwards to the immediate future. These constant visions are rendered through the use of a split diopter lens as well as some audio stingers that result in some of the most grating sequences I’ve ever experienced. Each one of these scenes should come with two caplets of Tylenol. In this same timeline, Ezekiel is experiencing his own visions, in which he is killed by three future Spider-Women. In “present day,” they’re still teenage girls who have yet to become superheroes. Ezekiel’s plan is to kill them NOW before they can kill him LATER. Celeste O'Connor (foreground, from left), Isabela Merced and Sydney Sweeney play teenagers destined to become Spider-Women who need the protection of Madame Web (Dakota Fanning). Through a strange series of coincidences that might not be coincidences, Cassie meets the trio and vows to protect them. Celeste O’Connor is Mattie Franklin, Isabela Merced is Anya Corazon and Sydney Sweeney is Julia Cornwall. They are all paper-thin characters  required by the script to behave like absolute idiots and constantly put themselves in danger even when they know some sort of ceiling-crawling maniac is trying to kill them. After a series of clunky, poorly choreographed and fake-looking battle sequences, we get a tease to a sequel that most likely will never happen. If we’re lucky. "
"Feb 17, 2024",negative,It collapses so pathetically that studio executives might as well have dialed 911 to rescue it. 
"Feb 17, 2024",positive," Sony is taking another crack at making a Spider-Man movie without the titular character. Venom and its sequel were decent. Morbius was a guilty pleasure that was lambasted by critics. So, where does Madame Web rank? A bit closer to the latter. Madame Web follows Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), a New York paramedic who, after a near-death experience, discovers she can see pieces of the future and even change the outcome. As she’s struggling to learn how her new ability works, Webb comes across three girls who are being hunted by a mysterious man with spider-like abilities. The man is Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a wealthy researcher who stole a rare spider from an isolated Peruvian tribe in a remote region of the Amazon. The spider gave him powers but also cursed him to repeatedly see visions of his death. And that future death would supposedly come at the hands of three girls played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor. In order to prevent his death, Ezekiel decides to use his powers and fortune to track down the girls who would grow up to become Spider-Women and kill them before they get their powers. Seeing Ezekiel murder them in several visions, Cassie resolves to protect the teens until she can find a way to stop Ezekiel. But the key to her future turns out to lie in her past, specifically, her mother’s journey to and death in the Amazon.  With a 14 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s clear critics (and audiences) don’t think highly of Madame Web. It’s corny, the writing is, at times, nonsensical, and the editing can be downright nauseating at times. The effects, one of the key components of any superhero film, have moments in this movie that give Madame Web the appearance of a rough cut rather than a completed project. This is most apparent in the climax, which takes place atop an exploding fireworks warehouse. This is a film that will fall to pieces at any point with even a shred of serious thinking (how can a wanted paramedic afford to charter a private plane to Peru on short notice?). It’s inexplicably set in 2003 but seems to feature technology more common in 2024, especially where Ezekiel’s “woman in the chair” hacker/assistant is concerned.  Johnson does her absolute best to give a charming performance in a film burdened with such nonsensical and cliche writing, but there’s only so much she can do. She clearly has the acting chops to deliver a strong performance in a dramatic role, as shown in Cha Cha Real Smooth. Some of her efforts shine through, but most of Cassie’s standout moments are swallowed by the storm of mediocrity that makes up Madame Web.  Parks and Recreation fans who accidentally stumble into a theater to watch Madame Web will be pleased to see Adam Scott playing Cassie’s EMT partner. He’s perhaps the best part of this film, and all he had to do was channel his inner Ben Wyatt. Madame Web feels like an early 2000s superhero movie outside of its own time. And that seems to be Sony’s vibe with these “sort of” Spider-Man movies without everybody’s favorite web-slinger. But whereas Venom and its follow-up made decent money, Morbius floundered. And Madame Web will likely flop. What remains to be seen is which camp Kraven the Hunter will fall into. For what it’s worth, this critic had fun watching all the aforementioned movies. Masterpieces? No. Enjoyable for what they are? Possibly. For a select few, that will be enough."
"Feb 17, 2024",negative,"Not to pile on but sadly this film repeatedly fails to find its legs, all eight of them... A disjointed and chemistry-less origin story that barely draws from the original. The most fun part is the incredulous discussions you'll have after. "
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present. One of the great blunders in recent Hollywood history involves the executives at Sony Pictures, circa 2000, rejecting a deal that would have given them the rights to every superhero in the Marvel Universe. The comic book company had just filed for bankruptcy and were in desperate need of a cash infusion. So, when Sony exec Yair Landau was sent to inquire about their studio obtaining the rights to Spiderman, Marvel chief Ike Perlmutter had an alternate proposition for him – take all our characters for $25 million. When Landau reported the offer to his bosses they rejected it, saying, “No one gives a @#$% about any of the other Marvel characters. Go back and do a deal for Spider-Man.” This deal was closed for $10 million. As for the rest of the characters, apparently a great many people gave a @#$% about them. Ever since realizing their mistake, Sony has been trying to jump on the superhero bandwagon with various incarnations of the webslinger as well as films focused on ancillary characters in his universe, which they have the rights to. The result has been misguided efforts like the overblown “Venom” (2018) and its sequel, the misguided “Morbius” (2022) and now, the absolutely awful “Madame Web,” a mess of a movie that is at times so incredibly inane it may have a future as a cult classic. Jump ahead to 2002 and Cassie (Dakota Johnson) is a New York City paramedic who has always been, socially, a step behind everyone else. On a call one day, she has a near death experience which unlocks some latent psychic abilities. Now she can see the future, something she has in common Ezekiel who has come to the Big Apple to track down Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeny) Anya Corazon (Isabel Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor). He has foreseen that these three teenagers will kill him, and he wants to beat them to the punch. Fortunately, Cassie can see what is to play out and comes to their rescue. Overplotted and underwritten, the film contains some of the most simplistic dialogue in recent memory as well as character actions that make little sense. Johnson does her level best to bring a bit of fun to this and she’s the best part of the movie while her young counterparts accord themselves as well as they can. However, even the most skilled thespians would be unable to salvage this lifeless, desperate product. I don’t require an Aaron Sorkin-like script or perfect plotting from a superhero movie but on the other hand, I expect more than the nonsensical mess concocted by four “writers” presented here."

"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Four people worked on the screenplay for Madame Web (2024) and every one of them should be ashamed. It wants to bill itself as a psychological thriller with action and adventure, but it feels like the longest commercial for medication that helps you remember where you put your keys. It’s difficult to imagine someone not sitting down after drinking heavily and saying, “how can we maintain a connection to Spider-Man without actually saying ‘Spider-Man’?” and other drunk people threw out a bunch of ideas after skimming a Wikipedia article and consulting a dirty sock, and voila, a germ of a parasite of an idea formed and Madame Web was born. In deepest darkest Peru, Constance Web (Kirby Bishe) searches in vain for a rare spider whose venomous properties could be the key to solving disease forever. She has selfish ulterior motives for finding and potentially wiping out a species of arachnid for an untested chemical property that is literal years away from being tested in humans, while risking disease and permanent injury to her unborn child, but that’s a flashback for another time. Her guide or sherpa or assistant or himbo tagging along for the malaria, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahuim), double-crosses her and steals her prize. Constance is mortally injured but her child is saved by a secret tribe of spider people, with the promise that the child will return to the hidden jungle when she’s ready to learn the truth. I can think of no bigger “Screw you, Colonizer” than making a child work for answers to questions she doesn’t know she’s supposed to ask. Thirty years later in 2003, Cassie is a paramedic with the social skills of a jutting tree root. She was raised in the foster system and holds a grudge against her mother for having the audacity to die in a forest. Cassie is getting flashes of déjà vu and visions of terrible events to come but lacks the self-awareness or common sense the Good Lord gave a box of hair to do anything about it. Through poor judgement and basic incompetency, she finds herself in charge of three impulsive and unattended teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor, Isabela Merced) and must keep them alive by abandoning them in a forest, abandoning them at a motel, and ditching them with a friend so she can do some research, which involve going through her mother’s 30-year old research things and looking thoughtful. Then she does a turn and burn to deepest darkest Peru – last minute on a paramedic’s salary – matching 30-year-old photographs to the ever-changing wilderness to get the mystical answers she seeks. Meanwhile, Ezekiel Sims has somehow become very wealthy, but frankly isn’t any smarter. He has also acquired “spider-person” powers like strength and walking on ceilings from the spider he stole from Constance. How? No one has time for villainous origin stories when we have an entire hero’s origin story to screw up. He also sees his own future death at the hands of three women in spider costumes. He sets out to stop these women now (yet, in their past) by using advanced CTV technology. How this knowledge is obtained using a stolen NSA key card with the weakest system password any 12-year-old could have hacked isn’t mentioned because those are details clever screenwriters come up with. Ignoring that taking action on a future event automatically changes how the future plays out, Madame Web plods along for nearly two hours. If you’re expecting to discover how the three spider women become spider women with extra legs, the power of flight, and electrical webs, this movie isn’t it. Madame Web is not a movie anyone deserves, and Sony slipped this to reviewers mere hours before its premiere. It’s the sort of passive hand off that’s not a sign of great confidence. Dakota Johnson, known best for some of the most lackluster “erotic” scenes ever committed to film from fan fiction, doesn’t just sleepwalk through Madame Web, she’s in a vegetative state letting the action happen all around her. When her character is feeling motivated, it’s only to run – run to the car, run to the ambulance, run through the warehouse, all to be just a bit too late to be effective. The choices Cassie Webb makes barely serve her reckless behavior as a paramedic, but we’re supposed to believe that from this mess of a human will be reborn as the great mutant pre-cog, Madame Web. No, we won’t, thanks. Madame Web force feeds the kind of mid-century morality that says single women will prove their worthiness to society if they refuse to get married and have children, see The Sentinel (1977). In this case, Cassie ends up sacrificing fundamental pieces of herself to become dependent upon the next generation of Spider People (her “children”). This plot twist to bring the movie in line with comic canon completely ignores the previous 110 minutes, while also ignoring the entire set up of the film. If you allow yourself to get angry now, you can save yourself the price of a movie ticket and the gas. Since we’re at it, let’s talk about the music. If you’re going to set a movie in 2003, maybe have music released in 2003. That’s what made other loud action movies like Bumblebee (2018) so much fun, by using relatable, identifiable music from the era. There are six pop tunes in Madame Web: “Dreams” by The Cranberries (1992), “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes (1993), “Bitch” by Meredith Brooks (1997), “I Think We’re Alone Now” by Tiffany (1997), “Scandalous” by Mis-Teeq (not released in the US until 2004), and “Toxic” by Britney Spears (2004). I can pull the Billboard top 100 for 2003 and blindly pick more appropriate songs like “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence or “Miss Independent” by Kelly Clarkston. Like everything else, it appears not even the barest effort was exerted for the music, and since music sets the tone for scenes, all of it felt off and awkward. Finally, I want every single one of you to apologize to The Marvels (2023), because despite the pile-on due to the cast, the director and the screenwriter (all women), it was an enjoyable 105 minutes and told a complete story. Not Madame Web, though, and because it didn’t tell a complete story, there is the implied threat of future movies. It’s disrespectful. Madame Web is rated PG-13 for mild swears, lots of spiders, many instances of the bird, explosions, truck accidents, ambulance accidents, people falling, people getting poisoned, childbirth, and more spiders."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,"So pathetic, it makes someone want to go back in time and give the execs who keep commissioning these movies arachnophobia."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,I owe an apology to The Marvels. [Madame Web] was one of the most painful theatrical experiences of my entire life.
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,Too many writers revising rudderless material so that Sony can keep hold of the rights to this IP and share in Marvel Studios' profits when linked to Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. 
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Barely 10 to 20 minutes in, it is easy to see the bleak future of the two-hour movie - and the franchise that might be on the anvil over at Sony. It goes nowhere. The dialogue is ham-fisted, the action amateurish, the visual effects rudimentary and the final outcome disastrous. As for the acting, the less said the better. And that certainly isn't for want of effort. The actors strive very hard indeed. The strain shows. With an overload of inanities to deal with and tide over, the cast - besides Dakota Johnson, it includes Sydney Sweeney and Tahar Rahim - is hard-pressed to pull the proceedings out of the fire. There is little humour going around. Most of the film's attempts at being funny fall flat and the bursts of energy that peppers Madame Web are too overly affected to be effective. Dakota Johnson, she of the three 50 Shades films, is saddled with a role that approximates the character's arc in the film - until the very end, she struggles to figure out who and/or what she can be if she were to put her mind to it. In her original comic-book avatar, Madame Web is an aged, sightless wheelchair user endowed with powers that help her see the future in time to be able to stop or alter unwanted events. In the movie, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Johnson) is a New York Fire Department ambulance driver who is constantly racing against time. An accident triggers a startling change in her. She experiences disturbing visions of the immediate future that alarm and forewarn her. Unlike the Cassandra of Greek mythology, three girls she decides to help against a malefic force believe her helpful prognoses. First up, Cassie saves (very casually, if not unintentionally) a pigeon from a death foretold and then moves on to bigger creatures and lives as it dawns upon her, with a bit of help from a figure hidden in her past, that she is no ordinary 30-year-old woman. The villain, played by Rahim (the French actor has never been so shoddily treated by a movie script), can crawl on ceilings, swoop upon his prey at will and emit a fatal neurotoxin from his hand, but neither he nor the film has a way of wriggling out of the web of mediocrity that they are caught in. Madame Web is dead-on-arrival fare. Disney's Marvel movies, when things tend to go right, often deliver levels of entertainment that can keep audiences invested in the make-believe world that they conjure up with all their might. In Madame Web, nothing works. Nothing at all. An overwhelming dullness creeps into everything that Sony's Columbia Pictures-produced film rustles up. Most of the action In Madame Web takes place in New York in 2003. The period movie feel that Director S.J. Clarkson and her production designers seek to impart to it - to help the audience get a sense of the time and place, Pepsi cans of a certain vintage, a giant Calvin Klein hoarding through which the heroine drives an ambulance and a poster announcing Beyonce's debut album are thrown in - seeps into the overall look and texture of the film and not always in a good way. Madame Web is stylistically obsolete and technically sloppy - it is at most times reminiscent of the time when Hollywood superhero movies were only beginning to find their way forward and paving the ground for a spate the MCU fare that now crowds everything out. Madame Web opens in the Peruvian Amazon where Cassie's pregnant mother, Constance (Kerry Bishe), is on an expedition to look for a rare spider with healing abilities. She is betrayed by an evil associate, Ezekiel Sims (Rahim), who wants the spider for himself. Constance dies but not before being bitten by ab arachnid and giving birth to Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb, who acquires psychic powers thanks to the beneficial venom that passed on to her. The rest of the film has neither bite nor bang as the baddie, who, too, foresees his death in a vision and sets out to eliminate the three teenage girls who he knows will cause his demise. The girls are just, girls but each possesses the potential to be a Spider-Woman. Still in their teens, they are well away form acquiring any real powers. That is where Cassie comes in. She has visions that reveal troubling events of the immediate future. She babysits the three girls - Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) - babes in the woods who need all the handholding that they can get from Cassie - through the tough situations thrown at them by the crawling menace that Ezekiel turns into. If one were able to say that all this is fun while it lasts, Madame Web might have just about passed muster. Since it isn't, the movie is exhausting, pointless and totally bereft of the kind of flashy - and superficial - craft that superhero movies usually ride on. It is all very well to rustle up a female-centric superhero movie but all that Madame Web is likely to do is give all that are involved with the making of this forgettable movie a bad name that will be difficult to live down. It would be regarded as the worst of its kind had it not been competing with Morbius, the Sony Spider-Man Universe monstrosity that preceded it."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," En un año en el que no estaremos tan saturados de cintas de superhéroes, Sony Pictures ha estrenado la primera película de este género del 2024: Madame Web, protagonizada por Dakota Johnson y dirigida por S. J. Clarkson. Si algo es cierto, es que desde que el primer avance del filme, de inmediato surgió una gran polémica. Miles de fanáticos argumentaban, por medio de redes sociales, que la película se veía de mala calidad, como si hubiera contado con escaso presupuesto. Del mismo modo, aseguraban que era ilógico contar la historia de un personaje secundario de los cómics de Spider-Man, sin tener al propio Spider-Man en la trama. Ahora que la película de Madame Web finalmente ha llegado a los cines del mundo… ¿será que acaso los fans siempre tuvieron la razón? El universo cinematográfico de Spider-Man (sin Spider-Man) de Sony Pictures ha dado mucho de qué hablar, desde que inició en 2018, con Venom. Y es que pareciera que todas las películas que conforman a este universo compartido, tan sólo están hechas para que Sony pueda mantener los derechos del arácnido en el cine. Venom, Venom: Carnage liberado, Morbius, y ahora Madame Web, se han sentido como productos vacíos, sin alma, que no tienen realmente nada que contar. Más adelante, este mismo año, tendremos Kraven: El cazador, además de la tercera entrega de Venom. A estas alturas, tal vez ya tengamos una idea sobre qué esperar de estas cintas. Madame Web, ambientada en el año 2003, nos cuenta la historia de origen de Cassandra Webb, una paramédica que desarrolla habilidades psíquicas. En su búsqueda por encontrar la raíz de sus poderes, el destino la conduce hacia tres adolescentes en peligro, quienes, en un futuro, también tendrán habilidades sobrehumanas, sin que ellas aún lo sepan. Perseguidas por Ezekiel Sims, un hombre que mantiene una misteriosa conexión con la protagonista y que, al igual que ella, también puede ver el futuro, Cassandra protegerá a las jóvenes a toda costa. Por desgracia, una vez que el segundo acto arranca, y nos presentan a los personajes de Julia Cornwall, Mattie Franklin y Anya Corazón, todo se va en picada. Es nula la química entre las cuatro actrices, y en todo momento resulta inverosímil la situación que las mantiene unidas. Dakota Johnson intenta hacer lo más que puede, con el poco material que le es brindado, y consigue brillar un poco, más que nada por su carisma y su humor irreverente. Ella es quien carga con toda la película. Por su parte, Sydney Sweeney nos entrega un papel enternecedor y amigable, pero que cae en lo sobreactuado. Isabela Merced y Celeste O’Connor simplemente están ahí, sin aportar nada en lo absoluto. Lo que resulta aún peor, es el antagonista, Ezekiel Sims, interpretado por Tahar Rahim. A pesar de que entendemos el porqué de sus acciones, jamás se nos explican sus motivaciones, o la razón por la que es «malo». Sólo se trata de un villano plano y unidimensional. El guion no se preocupa en darnos una construcción de personajes adecuada, del mismo modo que nos entrega unos diálogos de pena ajena. Forzar referencias a Spider-Man, por medio de los discursos de los personajes, además de caer en lo risible, no se siente para nada orgánico. Por si todo esto no fuera poco, uno de los aspectos que pueden ser más criticables sobre Madame Web, es la publicidad engañosa con la que se promovió la película. Sin caer en spoilers, sí es importante aclarar que, tal vez uno de los momentos más esperados del filme, no sucede de la manera en la que los avances lo prometían. Eso puede desembocar en una enorme decepción. Madame Web es una película que verdaderamente no tiene razón alguna para existir. Su ritmo es torpe, desorganizado y caótico, dando como resultado escenas que carecen de lógica, con saltos abruptos y cortes sin sentido en su montaje. Se nota a leguas que el metraje fue editado una y otra, y otra vez. El argumento central de la película tenía cierto potencial, pero se terminó optando por el camino fácil. Al final, tenemos un producto genérico y sin esencia, que no cuenta con un solo momento memorable, ni siquiera durante las secuencias de acción. Para todos aquellos que disfrutan del cine de superhéroes, puede resultar alarmante el declive que ha tenido este género en los últimos años. Sin duda, Madame Web es una clara muestra de ello. Marvel Studios atraviesa tiempos difíciles. DC prefirió reiniciar de cero todo su universo. Ahora, Sony Pictures, con su saga de antihéroes y villanos de Spider-Man, no parece tener un rumbo fijo. Este universo cinematográfico arácnido no tiene ni pies ni cabeza, y por instantes, pareciera que ni siquiera Sony sabe qué es lo que está haciendo con sus propias producciones. ¿Acaso ya perdieron por completo el camino o será prudente seguirles dando oportunidad de mejorar?

"Feb 16, 2024",negative,"The cast is this film’s only redemption, but even they can’t salvage a dreadfully bland script. Beyond the writing, there are pacing and editing issues for days. "
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," After the incomparable success of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on every conceivable level, Sony Pictures decided to dig deeper into the Spider-Verse, this time pulling out a character that most mainstream moviegoers know little about and make her the focus of their next big motion picture. So, instead of a movie about Hobie Brown, Spider-Byte, or even Spider-Rex, we got Madame Web.  As for the characters, only Cassie and her buddy Ben (Adam Scott) are somewhat fleshed out, while no one else receives any type of character development beyond what the film requires for a specific scene or moment. Everyone either needs to be saved, or they are the villain. Or they are Ben. Other than that, they are filler. Johnson and her Spider-Stans do a decent enough job and are committed to the material, but Rahim as Sims is one of the worst screen villains in the last few years, which is saying quite a bit considering we were just subjected to MODOK in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Dar-Benn in The Marvels, and Atticus Noble in Rebel Moon. Sims is a third-rate Saturday morning bad guy straight from The Wacky Races who literally screams “Where are my spiders?” while waking up in a cold sweat. "
"Feb 16, 2024",neutral,"I’m not sure veteran television director SJ Clarkson feels fully in control of her debut feature, but she deserves kudos for keeping in as much of Johnson’s compellingly quirky performance and compiling a pitch-perfect collection of bangers..."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," The Sony Picture Universe of Marvel Characters, elegantly abbreviated as SPUMC, has been suffering tremendously as it attempts to pad the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unfortunately for Madame Web, the attempt to parallel the success of Spider-Man through alternative means has teed itself up to forever live in infamy by spinning a story nobody asked for. Sony's decision to greenlight Madame Web in the state that it was is astounding. The fact that the entire filming process was complete, edited, and somewhat promoted proves that studios are willing to create content for the sake of using Marvel's sake -- even in vain. What exactly was the motivation here, besides spitting on the Spider-Man legacy? Was it worth pouring a life-changing amount of money into Morbius For Women? The entire concept of Madame Web is inconceivable, but the execution is shockingly poor. Then again, who exactly is Madame Web for? It's pre-Peter Parker and yet miscalculates the birthday of Tom Holland's webslinger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Look, superhero movies aren't for everyone, and that's understandable. But would it kill Sony's creative team to fact-check the timeline they assumedly wanted to align with? Screenwriting has become an incredibly fluid art form, yet those credited on Madame Web's screenwriting team may want to remove this specific title from their portfolio altogether. Every scene feels like an absolute chore to get through, and there's nothing particularly interesting about how the screenplay is written.  The most meme'd line from the trailer, ""He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died,"" isn't even in the movie itself.  Line deliveries are lifeless and flat -- no member of this cast could be bothered to sincerely engage with the script, and their apathy is more than present. It's as if lead actress Dakota Johnson had a completely different idea in mind when her agent booked her for a ""Marvel"" movie. She works through Madame Web as if she's in a daze, and is already thinking about how she can redeem her career after agreeing to take such a dismal role. Madame Web is  Marvel-adjacent and serves as another ill-fated attempt at repackaging characters that haven't been locked under Disney's domain.  That being said, Marvel's ongoing quest to remain relevant outside of its more-anticipated properties didn't exactly stick the landing.  It's sincerely puzzling as to why Sony insisted that Madame Web was even made. It holds no stake in Sony Pictures' regretfully-growing Marvel sub-universe, nor does it bear any deeper significance for Marvel's mainline movies.  It exists for the sake of existing and in the most pitiful way. Everything about Madame Web effectively works against its favor; an incohesive plot, questionable dialogue, an apathetic cast, and cringe-inducing CGI elevate a predictably bad movie into an even more abysmal one. If there's one thing about Madame Web, it's that it's the perfect movie to pirate through an incredibly shady second-hand torrent site. Save your money, and skip this one completely.  1/10."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," After a couple of Venom films and a Morbius, I’m not sure if Madame Web will bring any valuable weight to Sony’s Spider-Man-less Spider-Man universe. Granted, Tom Hardy has pulled in high numbers with his wild take on Eddie Brock, and who knows, maybe the upcoming Kraven the Hunter will spin this web of missed opportunities in a more vital direction. However, as it stands, for all the merit that could come with a film designed to be relatively standalone and focused on strong female characters that would ideally appeal to a teen girl audience, missing the mark in so many ways does no one any favors, and likely keeps Peter Parker swinging in a different direction. While anyone at least a little comic book savvy (or those who remember their Spider-Man cartoons well enough) likely recalls the character of Madame Web as being a blind, elderly woman who sits in a fancy chair and passes along cryptic clues to our favorite web-head, this is a film that wants to go over how someone rose to be in this position. Set in 2003 (a loosely applied date, as several elements suggest this was not always the year the movie was supposed to be set in), the goal of Madame Web is to establish how a paramedic-turned-clairvoyant will lead a team of Spider-Women (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor) to take on various bad guys. Why we need a whole movie to establish this, rather than get straight to it, emphasizes one of the key issues in this film and why it feels like a regression for 2024 comic book/superhero movies. Having to go through the motions means watching Madame Web stumble through a series of scenes we’ve seen in plenty of these movies by now. Whether it’s the opening sequence where Dakota Johnson’s Cassandra Webb is born that is straight out of Blade, the awkward realization of having new powers that recalls Daredevil, or the eventual teaming up of seemingly unconnected characters being sought after by another, akin to X-Men, we have all the usual beats in place. Now, of course, many of these films, good and bad, all lift many of the same plotlines to get through their origin stories. Madame Web, sadly, opts to clumsily take its turn, not unlike Fantastic Four (pick one) or Ghost Rider. It’s evident from the get-go, as we are quickly introduced to the film’s villain, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), whose entire performance appears to have been badly redubbed. Add to that a poorly rendered CG spider, and my hopes for this film to at least top Morbius were quickly dashed. Cut to the film’s 2003(ish) present day, and you have Johnson and Adam Scott’s Ben Parker (aha!) doing their best to at least have fun banter before things take a turn. There’s probably something to be said about a paramedic whose abrasiveness and desire to be left alone is only countered by a strong sense of duty. However, that’s undone by the movie’s inability to show Cassandra as a hero we actually want to root for. At times like these, one would want to at least be able to say something along the lines of, “For all its flaws, Johnson holds onto her dignity,” or whatever, but that’s not the case here. Detached in a way that suggests “this isn’t the film I signed on for,” Johnson hits a few necessary beats early on, only to become a character either annoyed by those around her or making a choice to leave the annoying characters around her to solve the mystery of why said irritants are being targeted. It makes her an odd superhero, and Johnson joins the other cast members by delivering lines in the style of “fifth attempt during Zoom re-recording” sessions. This film not only feels like a throwback to the days of lesser superhero films that sat alongside what Raimi’s superior Spider-Man movies had to offer, but it also fits in by being seemingly embarrassed about having ties to a comic book that suggests having to use names like “Madame Web” (which is never said in this movie) and wearing “goofy” costumes. Director S.J. Clarkson, making her directorial debut following a long list of TV credits (including Marvel’s Jessica Jones), finds scant moments to inject any real sense of style here, with only Ezekiel’s more villainous form (a non-Spider-Man costume that looks an awful lot like a black-suited Spider-Man) getting a few instances that stand out thanks to camera rotation. While one could say this is a movie aiming to be a more street-level superhero flick, it feels more like a busy comic book thriller with no real sense of what to do with its $80 million budget (an awful lot of time is spent with characters inside vehicles). Perhaps more could be done if this film wanted to either be more fun by way of its ensemble cast or harness the ridiculous energy that comes from a plot borrowing choice ideas from both The Terminator and The Dead Zone. Sadly, Madame Web does none of these things. It’s never morbin’ time in these parts. Even a random trip to Peru (where Cassandra ditches the teen girls she’s supposed to protect) doesn’t yield anything beyond yet another expository sequence. Ezekiel Sims, similarly, doesn’t get to live up to his awesome name, as he’s nothing but a force for evil. His over-the-top terribleness that quickly establishes him as a dangerous threat never amounts to anything more in the form of showiness. So, the film leaves us with Johnson, who is mostly out to sea, a dryly funny Adam Scott in the film’s 6th most important role, and, for some reason, comedian Mike Epps, who doesn’t get to say anything funny. In between are the three young women with very little to offer and Emma Roberts as a pregnant Mary Parker to allow the film some fun in making its audience do the math to figure out how an unborn Spider-Man fits into all of this. There’s no joy in watching a film like this, as nothing good comes from it. I haven’t even mentioned that for all the nonsense being fed by this story, it’s also pretty lifeless, meaning it becomes a slog pretty quickly. But with that said, what else can I expect from yet another attempt to build something like this without much desire to deliver anything more than a demand fulfillment sent down by the studio? I can go along with the idea that plenty of people worked hard on delivering a final product, but it’s a shame to see a movie with so little “movie” to actually offer. Worse than generic, Madame Web feels like an obligation come to life. With performances that lineup with the best sleepwalkers, iffy attempts at excitement via psychically-tinged action sequences, and a bland story designed to build toward a by-default more interesting concept to work with in a sequel that will unlikely happen, there’s just nothing here. Nothing has made me interested in seeing more of what this particular web-line in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe could deliver, and seeing yet another superhero movie that dares to sell audiences on a diverse, female-led story lose the thread on what works doesn’t help at all. This film is far from spectacular, as it’s a tangled mess."
"Feb 16, 2024",positive," This week I’m recommending three new films: a superhero film, a rom-com, and a father-daughter drama; plus four streaming gems including a landmark of American independent cinema, civil rights and Palestinian documentaries, and an experimental dance film. "
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,It’s bad. It never gets any better. Then you go home. That’s the whole experience.
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," The death of the comic book movie genre is being greatly exaggerated, despite the fact that Madam Web is one hell of a motive for its murder. There’s an oft-repeated sitcom joke where a character has to find something good-but-small to praise in a horrible play or movie that their friend did. “The lighting was atmospheric,” they’ll say. The lighting sucked in Madam Web. Any compliment is a lie. It is palpable what a horrible time everyone had making the movie, a wildly unpleasant experience that can only be topped by having to watch it. Only us Spider-Man nerds care, but the original Madam Web was a silver-haired, blind fortune teller in a wheelchair who dressed exclusively in a spider-emblazoned slanket. Somewhere in the multiverse, Helen Mirren got an Oscar for bringing that version to life. In this one, Dakota Johnson is Cassandra Webb, a character whose defining characteristic is that she’s unlikeable. That’s not a shot at Johnson – although it’s also not not a shot – so much as it is a literal fact pointed out by other characters in the film. Those other characters include Ben Parker (Adam Scott). That’s right, the film serves as the origin story of Spidey’s father figure Uncle Ben, whose defining characteristic is reminding everyone that the second season of Severance is overdue. Set in 2003 for – and this is very important – absolutely no reason, the nonsensical plot sees Cassie granted the ability to kinda sorta see versions of the future because her mother got bit by a magic spider in the Amazon while dying during childbirth. She has a vision of Ezekial Sims (Tahar Rahim) killing three teenaged girls: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced). Their defining characteristics are shy, sassy, and shy-but-sassy, respectively. Why is Zeke trying to off some young’uns? Because he too has magic Amazonian spider mojo that shows him a future vision of the three women as superheroes that toss him off a building to his death. It may be interesting to discover how they become spider-themed adventurers, so the movie never goes there. It does spend a lot of time with Zosia Mamet in front of a wall of monitors telling her evil boss where to find the ladies. And it also shows the origins of Spider-Man’s defining mantra. Only instead of “with great power comes great responsibility,” a jungle wizard says “when you take on great responsibility, great power will come.” Which is (A) just really, truly, absolutely not true and (B) almost the logical opposite of what that message is supposed to be about. Everyone. E-v-e-r-y-o-n-e in the movie gives a horrible performance. None worse than Rahim, whose every line of dialogue was clearly redone in post. It’s genuinely quite funny how he only talks when off-camera or when it is too dark to see if his words match how his lips move. There’s a really upsetting scene where the girls dance on a table to Britney Spears’s “Toxic” for a bunch of what appear to be frat boys. The finale takes place in a fireworks factory, and said fireworks are shown blowing holes in brick walls. The Pepsi ad placement is so blatant, it’s a sign of restraint Madam Web doesn’t stand over a defeated villain and say “Should have had an ice-cold, refreshing Pepsi-Cola.” Alison Willmore at Vulture says “In some sequences, Johnson gamely gives Math Lady meme face as her character, Cassandra Webb, first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers she’s developing. In others, she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that she’s appearing in a real stinker. Girl, give us nothing! No, seriously, there’s no point in doing anything more.” Rosa Parra at In Their Own League says “The trailers sold me on an action-packed film where a group of women were going to be kicking ass! But instead, I got a movie about Cassandra Web becoming a guardian to the teens and her journey in dealing with her powers— and the teens were massively underutilized.” Emmanuel “E-Man” Noisette at The Movie Blog says “From the cringy Spider-Man references and absurd logic of its characters, this film immediately becomes one of the more forgettable comic book movies of the year. This felt like a troll job to spite fans who are tired of these Spider-Man-Less films.”"
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Produced in association with Marvel, ""Madame Web"" follows in the critically mauled wake of ""Venom,"" ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" and ""Morbius,"" the last of which qualified as the worst of the bunch. Until now. Is ""Madame Web"" bad enough to put a final nail in the coffin of increasingly feeble superhero epics? The jury is still out. But it is second to none in the dark art of boring you breathless. The usually frisky Dakota Johnson is stuck in this 2003-era origin story about the soon-to-be Madame Web, aka Manhattan paramedic Cassie Webb, now struggling with her newfound power to see the future. As a clairvoyant, how could she not predict the disaster ahead? Cassie is not alone in her identity crisis. There are other potential super divas gearing up, including ""Euphoria"" breakout Sydney Sweeney as nerdy white girl Julia, Isabela Merced as Latina mathlete Anya, and Celeste O'Connor as Black skateboarder Mattie. Flash-forwards show them in various stages of Spidey cosplay doing lame things it took four screenwriters to concoct. Basically, they're dodging the villainous Ezekiel Sims (a strangely bland Tahar Rahim), who holes up in a penthouse making mischief with a nutso techie (Zosia Mamet). For background, the film opens with a spider research trip to the Amazon in which Ezekiel kills Cassie's pregnant mom (Kerry Bishé). But don't worry: spider venom saves the infant Cassie. Meanwhile, Ezekiel is haunted by visions of these future spider girls who are keen to take him out. He insists they must die. Cassie has other ideas, which she carries out with the help of fellow paramedic Ben Parker (a barely used Adam Scott) whose pregnant sister-in-law is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts). Any relation to Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man? One guess. The tangled plot resists deciphering as it forces a connection between characters that defines implausible. The actors are stuck with unplayable roles. Johnson's sexy deadpan and aura of mystery can work wonders in such films as ""Cha Cha Real Smooth,"" ""A Bigger Splash"" and ""The Lost Daughter."" But Cassie is a nothingburger part that would stymie even a young Meryl Streep. Who's to blame for choking the life out of ""Madame Web""? The obvious suspect would be the director. But British firebrand S.J. Clarkson, a gifted TV director (""Succession,"" ""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""Dexter""), is reduced in her misfire of a feature debut to keeping the actors from tripping over the truly atrocious dialogue. Better luck next time. The real culprit here is the greed manifested by studio suits who keep hawking cheap knockoffs. ""Madame Web"" feels like a random collection of half-baked ideas thrown into the air and allowed to land, with the cynical assumption that we'll buy any lazy hack-work that is Spider-Man adjacent. Kill me now. And there's no end in sight. You should know that the SSU has two future installments — ""Kraven the Hunter"" and ""Venom 3"" — ready to go in this year alone. That is definitely more like a threat than a promise. ""Madame Web"" comes in at under two hours, and that's the best thing I can say about it. Even the thought of a sequel would be cruel and unusual punishment."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Like any true daughter of Hollywood, Dakota Johnson is a professional who understands that you have to work with the material you’ve got. Her breakthrough role as Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies was a triumph of never holding herself above lines like “Punish me! Show me how bad it can be!” or the requirement to bite her lip so frequently she must have needed ChapStick after every take. But even Johnson has her limits, and Madame Web, one of Sony’s attempts to build out its own Spider-Verse, blows so far past them that you can practically guess which scenes were shot last based on the degree to which its star has given up. In some sequences, Johnson gamely gives Math Lady meme face as her character, Cassandra Webb, first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers she’s developing. In others, she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that she’s appearing in a real stinker. Girl, give us nothing! No, seriously, there’s no point in doing anything more. Cassandra — Cassie to her friends, which include her EMT partner Ben (Adam Scott) and the trio of teenage girls she ends up trying to help — is one of the deeper cut characters that are pretty much all that’s left for Marvel and DC movies to dredge up at this point. Aside from a late-breaking and wildly mangled ability to be in multiple places at one, Cassie’s powers, which develop after a near-death experience, involve an ability to see the near future. It could make for an interesting exercise, pitting someone with knowledge and foresight but no physical gifts against Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), a proto-Spider-Man villain who can climb walls, punch hard, and poison with his touch. But Madame Web, helmed by prolific British TV director S. J. Clarkson, can’t come up with a remotely exciting way to pit these two against each other. Ezekiel wants to kill three high-schoolers — the meek Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), the requisite STEM girl Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and the rebellious Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) — because he’s plagued by prophetic dreams in which the three, costumed and superhuman, kill him. Cassie’s own visions are rendered in smeary bursts that are hard to make out, and even after she reluctantly becomes the girls’ protector, she mostly only anticipates new and not especially cool-looking ways to run away. Madame Web is draggy through most of its middle and inept by its end, but it’s also the kind of bad movie that is difficult to describe without making it sound awesome. For instance: It is set in 2003, as signaled by a Dangerously in Love ad and mention of Martha Stewart’s legal woes, for no obvious reason aside from the fact that it needs Ben (full name Ben Parker) to not yet be an uncle to his future Spider-Nephew. And yet — the movie plays bewilderingly coy about who Ben is. He refuses to say the name of the woman he’s started seriously dating (presumably May), and just when his pregnant sister-in-law Mary (Emma Roberts) is about to reveal her baby’s name, Ben and Cassie are called away to an emergency. The movie takes place in New York, but Cassie does manage to take an effortless mid-movie jaunt to the remote Peruvian jungle to visit the place where the scientist mother (Kerry Bishé) she grew up resenting died. While there, she communes with some indigenous Spider-People who may be the stuff of legends, but who conveniently speak English, before popping back to Queens for the big finish. The climax, by the way, takes place in an abandoned factory prominently labeled with a neon Pepsi-Cola sign (there’s a lot of Pepsi product placement), but filled, for reasons unknown, with boxes and boxes of fireworks. Superhero movies aren’t going away, but there’s a Schadenfreude in watching Madame Web and getting the feeling that the once-dominant genre is full-on dissolving like reality does toward the end of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It’s not just that studio execs obviously reworked the film to the point of incoherence, with Johnson herself freely admitting that the finished script was nothing like the one she signed on for. It’s that there is no evident vision to Madame Web at all, no sense of why anyone involved wanted to make it aside from the compulsion to keep milking this IP for whatever last drops of profit can be squeezed out. I wouldn’t say it’s joyless, because no film can be entirely without joy when it has Johnson hating on children and saying the line “Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom.” But it’s an $80 million project with no reason for existing aside from seeding spinoffs with the younger characters that are unlikely to actually happen. The more these movies have to serve as marketing campaigns for future installments, the less pleasurable they become as experiences in themselves. With Madame Web, at least, there’s no pretending that something good is coming down the pike. When Johnson settles into the “thinking hard” face that’s Cassie’s main expression, you have to wonder if she’s actually just considering firing her agents.

"Feb 16, 2024",positive," BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE **1/2 (107 minutes) M
The music is great but the flow is stilted and much of the dialogue incomprehensible in the loving biopic Bob Marley: One Love.  Some strong stretches manage to capture the peace-loving spirit of the father of reggae, such as the concert he staged during a violent election period in Jamaica. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard) also brings us into how and why Marley created reggae. There’s no question how convincing a job British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir does in his portrait of Marley as a loving family man and a star largely unaffected by ego as he gains global popularity.  Regrettably, the rambling, episodic nature of the storytelling is coupled with a commitment to cultural authenticity that, even more regrettably, results in some fast-talking, heavily-accented performances that are tough to decipher. The film could have done with subtitles, an option that will no doubt be available when the film enters the stream on Paramount+. Perhaps it’s best to wait till then. MADAME WEB *** (116 minutes) M
If you were to believe the thermonuclear attack launched by the world’s motion picture critics against Madame Web you could be forgiven for expecting this Marvel film to be among the worst entries of the superhero genre. If anything, Madame Web turns out to be a rather pleasant and enjoyable surprise, a well-made and well-paced origin story for a band of female superheroes who exist in the Spider-Man Cinematic Universe. (So it’s one of those hybrid Marvel films where Sony owns the rights to the characters – for those who care about such matters.) Dakota Johnson (she of the 50 Shades trilogy) puts in an above-average performance as Cassie Webb, a New York paramedic who grew up as a foster kid. Knowing little about her scientist mother who scoured the depths of the Amazon searching for a medically valuable spider, Cassie discovers she has some Spidey-type powers as well as a touch of clairvoyance that tends to kick in at opportune moments. Cassie’s quest is to protect three young women (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O’Connor and Isabela Merced) who are destined to be masked guardians in the future, provided they can survive the competing quest of a villain who wants to kill them all so he can be left alone to exploit a rare spider venom. OK, the plot isn’t exactly William Goldman but it’s still a heck of a lot more coherent than a lot of other superhero films that have not drawn anywhere near the same degree of critical ire. So, never mind the critical mauling the film has received: Madame Web chimes in as a superhero lark that sits well above the dreck offered up by the genre in recent years. INSPECTOR SUN AND THE CURSE OF THE BLACK WIDOW *** (88 minutes) PG
Think Agatha Christie meets A Bug’s Life and you’ve got the gist of Inspector Sun, a brightly animated comedy-mystery lark wherein the titular detective, a seven-legged spider with Poirot-styled pencil moustache, tries solving a rather complex murder case on board an art deco flying boat as it wings its way from Shanghai to San Francisco in 1934. Fizzing with one liners and a cast of insect and insect-adjacent characters (remember, spiders are not insects!), Inspector Sun is a lovingly rendered throwback to old-style film noir mysteries and the clichés they rode upon. It’s replete with retro references adults will likely appreciate more than kids. Fortunately, he has Janey (Emily Kleimo), a more-than-capable jumping spider assistant to help him work through the blizzard of clues surrounding the untimely demise of crime boss Dr Bugsy Spindlethorp (Scott Geer). As the genre conventions dictate, chief among the suspects is, of course, his ex-wife Arabella Killtop (Jennifer Childs Greer), a sexy black widow spider who steps comfortably into the role of femme fatale. The dialogue is crammed with quick jokes, many of which might fly over the heads of young kids who, to be honest, might also struggle to comprehend a plot that, while well-thought through, is perhaps a few degrees more complex than it needs to be. You have to listen fast to catch all the lightning-fast exposition. Still, it all comes together in the end with a terrific action finale in San Francisco Bay beneath the yet-to-be-completed Golden Gate Bridge. Director Julio Soto Gurpide, working from a screenplay by Rocco Pucillo, ties everything together with panache. They don’t scutter about in the crawlspaces of the plane but instead occupy a beautifully designed parallel world to the humans, complete with its own corridors, cabins and dining rooms. FALLEN LEAVES * (81 minutes; subtitled) M
In writer/director Aki Kaurismäkia’s thoroughly boring rom-com Fallen Leaves, slow-witted working-class drones Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) try finding love in a colourless Helsinki. What is clearly intended as a quiet little romantic charmer is actually inert and wholly uninteresting, its straight-faced performances and supposedly dry wit failing to bring the ditty to life. Think of it as an arthouse sedative. NYAD ***1/2 (121 minurtes) M
Two superb, Oscar-nominated performances from Annette Bening (best actress) and Jodie Foster (best supporting actress) drive Nyad, the bittersweet tale of flawed heroism following sexagenarian athlete Diana Nyad and her steely resolve to swim from Cuba to Florida. Some 30 years after her failed attempt at the endeavour she decides to reinvigorate her body and her mind by trying it again – ove and over. Summoning her best friend and longtime trainer Bonnie Stoll (Foster), Nyad sets out to defy stereotypes about the elderly by getting into shape and heading into the critter-infested  ocean with the help of veteran navigator John Bartlett (Rhys Ifans). In a splendid, warts-and-all portrayal Bening reveals Diana Nyad as both a defiant figure and as a ego-driven brute, expecting everyone to service her enterprise. The film is drawn from the book Find a Way by Diana Nyad and is at pains to shows how dogged determination and sheer stubborness are both sides of the same coin."
"Feb 16, 2024",neutral," If there’s a rule to be aware of when it comes to Sony’s
so-called “Spider-Verse” movies, it’s this: If Spider-Man isn’t in it, it’s
likely to disappoint. That applies to Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Morbius, and now Madame Web. Although all these
properties have comic book sources, none has translated well to the big screen.
This is in part due to poor writing but is equally the result of a general lack
of direction on the part of Sony which, outside of its partnership with Marvel
Studios for the Tom Holland Spider-Man series, doesn’t seem to
understand the characters over which it has stewardship. Madame Web is
another example of a comic book movie no one was clamoring for. Two things come to mind immediately when considering this
production. The first is how disjointed and haphazard the storyline is,
frequently employing sleight-of-hand to resolve conflicts. It is evidently the
first chapter of a longer story since three of the four principals never develop
their super-powers (which are hinted at in flash-forward dream sequences) and
exist predominantly to fill “damsels in distress” roles. The second is how
juvenile the dialogue is. This is especially evident at the end with a
voiceover pronouncement that would have been at home in a Saturday morning
cartoon.  Like Argylle, Madame Web makes for a better
trailer than a full movie. That’s because the central premise – a superhero
whose power is the ability to see short distances into the future and thereby
alter the timeline (if she wishes) – is ripe with possibilities. None, however,
are effectively explored. Maybe that’s the trap of the origin story nature of
the narrative. It’s so busy introducing characters and establishing situations
that there’s no time to do anything more than dispatch a feeble villain in a
perfunctory fashion. One of the reasons why Madame Web doesn’t work is
because there’s rarely any tension. For an action film, even one falling into
the superhero subgenre, the dearth of excitement is a death sentence. Although it’s refreshing to see studios continue to uncover
female action heroes worthy of screen exposure (this one follows The Marvels
in that regard), it’s disappointing to find how shabbily treated they are.
Perhaps Madame Web might have worked better had it narrowed its focus to
a single character – in this case, Cassandra Web (Dakota Johnson). The addition
of three teenagers in need of protection – Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney),
Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O’Connor) – muddies
the waters. This would-be series might have been better served by delaying
their inclusion until a potential sequel. Speaking of elements that were not in the final cut of this
movie, it’s evident that some connective tissue with the Spider-Man movies
was sloppily edited out of Madame Web. The footprints have been left
behind – the character of Cassie’s best friend, Ben (Adam Scott), is
unquestionably a younger version of Spidey’s Uncle Ben and the baby born during
the course of the proceedings is Peter Parker. It seems likely that these
things were acknowledged in the script at some point but were elided from the
final cut. Those who watch the names scroll by at the end will learn the truth;
Adam Scott is credited as playing “Ben Parker.” (Mary Parker, Ben’s sister-in-law
and Peter’s mother, is also in the movie, played by Emma Roberts.) Madame Web opens with a short prequel set during 1973
in the Amazon jungle. It introduces the mother of the film’s main character
(played by Kerry Bishe), a scientist studying rare spiders. After discovering
an amazing new species, she is attacked by her alleged bodyguard, Ezekiel Sims
(a dreadful Tahar Rahim), who steals the spider and leaves her for dead. She is
rescued by local tribesmen who are able to keep her alive long enough to give
birth to Cassandra.  Thirty years later, Cassie is a New York ambulance driver.
After being involved in a near-death experience, she begins having episodes in
which she can seemingly see into the future. After determining that she’s not
hallucinating, she begins to tinker with her abilities. Meanwhile, Ezekiel, now
possessing powers gained from the spider’s venom, is having recurring dreams of
his death at the hands of three women. He uses stolen AI to locate them and plots
their murders. When it comes time to execute his plan, however, his murderous intentions
are foiled by Cassie, who has a vision of him killing Julia, Anya, and Mattie,
and acts to save them. Sadly, Madame Web fails to rise above its pedigree as
a lesser superhero movie. It does nothing to convince viewers that there’s
value to be found in a story not featuring a marquee comic book character.
There’s a growing sense that Sony is overreaching by plumbing the bargain bin of
the IP for which it owns the rights and trying to force-feed the public with
characters like Venom, Carnage, Morbius, and Madame Web. We’ll never know
whether a well-crafted, riveting Madame Web might have made this an
early-year box office gem because that’s not what director S.J. Clarkson has delivered.
Her vision – or at least the one Sony allowed to reach the screen – is a tired,
infantile exercise in exploring the worst tropes of origin stories. "
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," ""Madame Web"" is a movie filled with ambulance action, table dancing and - this is more like it - a tribe of Amazonian spider people. Very Indy-ish, and very promising. But then there's also an infestation of product placement of the most shamelessly brazen sort, and you marvel that studios give a thumbs-up to this sort of thing and then wonder why their movies die on the vine.  The movie's title character, played here by Dakota Johnson, first appeared in Marvel's ""Amazing Spider-Man"" comics in 1980, and she's kind of interesting — a blind pre-cog who can see into the future and possibly change it. She's very super in her native format. Not so much in this movie, though. Here she's almost completely pre-super, and largely preoccupied with looking after three bratty young acolytes (Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced) who, as we eventually see (and instantly guess), are on their way to becoming fully suited-up Spider-Women later on in what Sony Pictures and Marvel's movie arm must have been hoping would mark a return to the long-ago glory days of the Spidey franchise. But as an attempt to kickstart a new Spiderman dynasty, the movie falls seriously short; the story is virtually all intro, with not a lot of payoff in Spidey action. None, actually — although we're clearly in Spidey's world here, the celebrated web-slinger never puts in an actual appearance.  Judging by the critical hostility that has greeted ""Madame Web,"" the possibility of future adventures now seems iffy. But the movie does indicate a way forward for this sort of picture in a time of mounting superhero fatigue among moviegoers. (Presumably people who've paid to sit through such widely reviled films as ""The Marvels"" and ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" the piddling ""Morbius"" — another attempted Spider-Man spinoff — and the awful ""Eternals."") Introducing three fresh young super-women into the Spider-Man universe would seem like a surefire way of reigniting interest out in the youth market. And it would help mightily if the producers could hold on to Dakota Johnson for any future installments — her air of serene self-possession in the face of all the movie's limp CGI and lunkhead dialogue (""When you take on the responsibility, great power will come"") is wonderfully calming. If she's not appalled by the movie's mad editing and muddled plot (two of the picture's three writers also worked on ""Morbius""), why should we worry? The story begins in Peru in 1973, where a woman named Constance (Kerry Bishe) is researching a tribe of spider-worshippers. Assisting her, for reasons unclear, is a treacherous character named Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who is bedeviled by a recurring dream about three young women he's convinced will one day kill him. Better he kills them first, he figures.  Constance, who is pregnant, gets bitten by a spider and later gives birth to a daughter she names Cassandra (Johnson). The little girl grows up to be an EMT, and we first meet her wheeling around Manhattan in an ambulance alongside her partner, Ben Parker (Adam Scott). There is a lot of racing about from one emergency to another, and since Cassie can see into the future — and must then relive what she and we have already seen — the movie begins to feel padded.  Soon we re-encounter Ezekiel, who's also in New York now and busily monitoring the movements of Cassandra and the three girls with whom she's become encumbered (for reasons purely misterioso). Ezekiel and a sidekick named Amaria (Zosia Mamet) are employing the usual sort of all-seeing computer setup to locate the three young women. They eventually find them taking part in a big action scene down in the subway, where everybody gets to meet a sort of Evil Spider-Man (actually Ezekiel in a black-and-red supersuit), who is of course in a homicidal mood.  The story sprawls. Cassie is at pains to announce her concern for the safety of the three girls now that Ezekiel is on their trail; but then she'll run off to South America or someplace, leaving them on their own — and leaving us to cope with all the commercial shillery rearing up around what seems like every corner. There's a sudden Beyonce billboard visible in one scene (Beyonce is signed to Sony's Columbia Records label). And when we take a break to attend a cookout with Ben and his pregnant sister Mary (checking off their familiar Spidey-world names), we can't help noticing that everyone is drinking Pepsi-Cola — a warmup for the movie's big finish, which takes place atop a huge Pepsi billboard on the bank of the Hudson River. I'm not making this up.  In order to really work, the movie would have had to give us a look at the three fledgling Spider-Women learning their trade and having their first crime-fighting adventures. Did someone really think it best to hold off on providing that sort of basic audience pleasure, to save it for some future installment that, as now seems entirely possible, no one may ever request. "
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,"Congratulations, Sony. You outdid yourself. You actually made a movie worse than Morbius. Madame Web is another obvious case of Sony churning out a movie to keep the Spider-Man property."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," The Ben Affleck version of Daredevil hit screens on Valentine’s Day back in 2003, so it’s fitting that Madame Web not only is set during that particular year but also opens in theaters on the same day 21 years later. Heck, all that’s missing is a hit Evanescence song on the soundtrack. I bring this up because Sony’s latest excursion into its Marvel Spider-Man–adjacent cinematic universe is the most second-tier, early-2000s comic book yarn that’s seen the light of day in ages, and this includes both the Venom entries and 2022’s Morbius. Director S.J. Clarkson has delivered a glossy, hyperactive jolt of colorfully unvarnished absurdity that could almost be fun if it wasn’t so poorly plotted and obnoxiously dumb. The film comes tantalizingly close to being an unintentional parody of the superhero genre, and that happy accident almost makes watching the resulting mess worthwhile. What Madame Web does have going for it is that it is fairly well cast, rarely slows down, has some nice visual flourishes, and doesn’t take itself too seriously. Dakota Johnson’s seeming disdain for the material nicely fits her lead character of New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb. She brings a sharp sense of humor and a cutting wit that makes much of this nonsense tolerable. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O’Connor are also rather good as the teenage trio Webb protects from harm, while Adam Scott is having the time of his life as Ben Parker, a name that should be familiar to fans of everyone’s favorite wall-crawler all over the world. Granted, the same could be said about Daredevil, and yet two decades later, that piece of goofy schlock is still considered something of a disaster, and for good reason. But one thing it undeniably has over Clarkson’s equally brain-dead slice of super-powered hokum: a great villain. Two of them, actually. However, Michael Clarke Duncan as a suitably threatening Wilson Fisk and Colin Farrell as magnificently out-of-his-gourd Bullseye both deserve to be in a much, much better motion picture. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea what happened with Tahar Rahim’s performance as Peruvian madman Ezekiel Sims. Though Rahim is a sensational actor, known for his superlative turns in A Prophet, The Past, and The Mauritanian, it sounds like almost all of his dialogue was done via automated dialogue replacement (ADR), as if he were starring in some 1970s Italian spaghetti Western or giallo. His character’s motivations are never explored and rarely explained (and certainly not in any detail). Sims’s superhuman abilities seem to change whenever the plot requires them to, making him not so much a threat as a vaguely unthreatening Terminator clone. And what is that plot? Webb is an orphan who, 30 years after her traumatic birth, suddenly gains furtive Groundhog Day–like glimpses into the future that she can’t control. This leads her to Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Merced), and Mattie Franklin (O’Connor), three teens from different worlds who have been marked for assassination by a determined Sims. Sims has been having nightmares of them growing up to be vigilante superheroes who, for reasons he does not know, break into his Manhattan skyrise and throw him out the window to his death. Instead of waiting for that to happen, he decides to kill them while they’re still in high school, and Webb is the only one who can stop him. Or something like that. It honestly doesn’t matter. Simms wants to kill the girls. They don’t want to die. Webb tries to gain control of her prognostication abilities to keep him from doing it, and in the process learns how her mother (Kerry Bishé) was betrayed and then murdered while researching spiders in Peru. There’s not a great deal more to it. The story and screenplay, credited to five different writers (including Clarkson), is all over the map. It makes playful references to the superhero-who-shall-not-be-named (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), although as he’s nothing more than the bun in Mary Parker’s (Emma Roberts) oven, this isn’t a surprise. But the film also doesn’t do a thing to flesh out any character other than Cassandra Webb, and this includes Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Heck, if someone revealed that Sweeney, Merced, and O’Connor ad-libbed all of their dialogue, I’d be tempted to believe them. But that’s the least of the film’s structural problems. Not to be a broken record, but why is Sims the way he is? If this Peruvian spider is so well known around the world, why did no one other than Cassandra’s mother go look for it (including after her death)? If Julia, Anya, and Mattie end up being spider-powered superheroes within a few short years, why does all of New York lose its collective crap when Spider-Man comes along after they’ve been doing their thing for probably at least a decade? What exactly are the rules regarding Webb’s abilities? Some of these questions are important, others arguably not so much. But the fact that all (and several more) are given not so much short shrift but no shrift at all is an issue. A few implausible occurrences here and there and a small cadre of narrative shortcomings aren’t a deal breaker. But an onslaught of them? One right after the other? To the point where it becomes borderline comical? That’s too much of an ask. Which brings us back to those not-so-fondly-remembered 2000s catastrophes like Elektra, Catwoman, Fantastic Four, and the aforementioned Daredevil. There was talent involved with each from a production standpoint, they all had game casts, and the same can be said about Madame Web. But the latter falls into a similar trap of mediocrity they all became ensnared in, and it’s a shame Cassandra Webb didn’t see that regrettable turn of events coming, because then maybe she could have done something about it — like canceling production before it even began.

"Feb 16, 2024",negative," Not unlike a burger at Arby’s or whatever KFC was doing with the Chizza, Madame Web is a quizzical aberration of capitalism. Of course, meme culture makes you morbidly curious. No, it’s probably not been prepared with sanitary methods in mind. Yes, it will make your tum-tum hurt. Madame Web is the latest entry in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, or SSU. You know the MCU? The DCEU? This is that. For Sony’s Spider-Man movies. But they can only include Spider-Man proper now — as in, say, Spider-Man: No Way Home — when the MCU sphere is also involved. If that gives you a headache, the SSU was once known as the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, or SPUMC. They pronounced it spum-see. Kind of like the C. diff that would inflame your colon after eating a promotional tie-in meal somewhere for Madame Web. You may have read elsewhere that Madame Web is an objectively terrible but subjectively delightful slice of camp cinema — or a bad movie that mostly knows it’s bad, leans into said badness and achieves a level of entertainment in spite of itself. No. No, no, no, no, no. Madame Web is just bad. The SSU has camp. It’s called Venom. And it’s also called Venom: There Will Be Carnage. In those films, you’ll find outsized melodrama, exaggerated excess, bromantic chemistry and the endlessly delightful sight of Tom Hardy cooling his overheated genitals in a hoity-toity restaurant’s lobster tank. A third one is coming later this year. It should be fun. Meanwhile, Madame Web instead offers the following: a lead performance from Dakota Johnson whose clear and charmless contempt can’t be cut around however exhaustive and nauseating the editorial efforts; three supporting performances from Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O’Connor that wouldn’t pass muster in the smallest of community theaters; a villain whose voice someone hated so much it has been largely overdubbed by a man who sounds quite ill and nothing like actor Tahar Rahim; and a by-committee screenplay that tiptoes around very specific Spider-Man references like “Uncle Ben,” “Peter Parker,” “Uncle Jonah” (LOL) and “With great power comes responsibility.” At least co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, returning from the shockingly preferable SSU entry Morbius, appeased the lawyers. And in the SSU, those lawyers seem to be all that matter — from the ones who enforce Sony’s rights to non-Spider Man characters from Spider-Man comics to the ones assisting on the financials for Q1 2024. Madame Web is ultimately a bunch of names and numbers on a ledger — one likely to turn red, if there’s any justice left — and it musters a similarly exciting energy. It’s a meal like the one Brundlefly would consume in David Cronenberg’s The Fly, whittled down to goopy, enzymatic mush by vomitous acid. There are at least a couple of interesting things about Madame Web. First are the panic switches seemingly pulled in post-production to align its 2003 setting with the birth of … well, let’s call him Petrus Parkus. You know, the character played by that very famous actor, Todd Netherlands? Very cute to believe anyone from this movie will ever play these characters again at all, let alone alongside an actor like Todd Netherlands.  The second is the tension established among Johnson, Sweeney, Merced and O’Connor. Oh, it has nothing to do with their fright at becoming the prey of mean ol’ Ezekiel Sims (Rahim, if in appearance only), who prowls around New York like an evil Spider-M … sorry, Arachnid Male. Neither does it have to do with the concern about their prophesied or present-tense superpowers. Instead, it has everything to do with the optics of when to drop their representation for roping them into this debacle. OK. Maybe that’s unfair to their reps.No one made them sign on for Madame Web. That’s what makes Johnson’s pissy press-tour persona even more puerile. She chose this. All right, maybe lines like “OK, so this guy’s hands somehow release an acute neurotoxin” or “But I don’t have a neuromuscular disorder!” weren’t in the original script. But her character was surely named Cassie Webb. In a movie called Madame Web. Which is adjacent to Spider-Man (but only adjacent … good job, lawyers). With mediocre source material comes modest expectations. Besides, doesn’t Johnson — among the most vapid, juiceless A-list performers there is — need to give more than one performance somewhere above average before something is truly below her? Johnson’s good-faith effort begins and ends with the same-old pee-shiver face every actor makes when playing someone with precognitive abilities to see the future before it happens. That’s Cassie’s superpower, unlocked after the perpetually put-upon paramedic plunks her head on the windshield of a taxicab plummeting off a bridge. It’s kind of like a less gory Final Destination, a franchise whose finest sequence this film seems poised to reference. But no. That vehicle has a better 2003 Final Destination-ish film to appear in. Anyway, the same peptides that will later propel the heroism of Petrus Parkus pump through Cassie’s blood, too, and her accident also unlocks long-dormant secrets about her mysterious birth. Of course, those secrets would be less dormant had Cassie browsed her dead mom’s treasure chest at any point in the 30 years of her life before this film takes place. Sims has spidey sense, too. He’s got the moves like Parkus will one day have, but he’s also been cursed to see his eventual fate at the hands of Julia Cornwall (Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Merced) and Mattie Franklin (O’Connor). In 2003, they’re just teens who dance on a table at a diner to Britney Spears songs, as American diners were wont to let teens do back then. Later, they’ll become superheroes … if Cassie can keep them alive in a film that can hardly keep its sense of time, science or legal issues that would prevent a kidnapping suspect from peace-ing out to Peru (as a maniac with inexhaustible surveillance resources hunts her, no less). Two years before YouTube debuted and four years before anyone had an iPhone, a subway rider watches horizontal video on a mobile device. Julia, Anya and Mattie leave a campfire burning to dance at that diner and wouldn’t you know it: Cassie does not return hours later to find a conflagration worthy of national news coverage. Budgeted at $80 million, Madame Web might be the most expensive CPR training video of all time. And it uproariously sends Cassie to Peru for a full week of self-discovery while Sims ostensibly continues to track the girls in New York using omniscient satellite powers. At least the pop-song soundtrack is chronologically sound. But with Madame Web, if you wake in the morning and you step outside and you take a deep breath and you get real high, you’ll still scream at the top of your lungs, “What’s goin’ on?” Johnson will be fine after Madame Web. Sweeney will be fine. Adam Scott and Emma Roberts, who turn up for thankless paycheck roles, will be fine, too. Cry neither for Sazama and Sharpless, who are almost certainly on retainer for several more rounds of C-list Spidey-character scripts. Instead, feel the worst for director S.J. Clarkson — a 20-year-plus veteran of prestige TV who has seen several big-ticket projects come her way and never materialize, and who will almost certainly take undue blame here despite a keen visual knack for kinetic energy that gets lost in all the chopping. “The best part of the future is that it hasn’t happened yet,” says one character. There’s no real good spin on Madame Web, but that might be the best Clarkson can hope for."
"Feb 16, 2024",negative,"The whole movie is like eating something you thought would taste good, but is so soft and mushy and flavorless that you realize there is really no reason at all to keep eating. (It would be an insult to tofu to call the movie that.)"
"Feb 16, 2024",negative," While Madame Web immediately became a meme after its first trailer dropped, I have to admit I was quite intrigued by the premise. A team of Spider-Women comprised of Hollywood’s biggest leading ladies all woven together by a psychic web? Sign me up! Unfortunately, what we get with Madame Web is a lackluster origin story devoid of much action, powers, or sense. Dakota Johnson stars as Cassandra Web, a loner of a New York City paramedic who finds that “when you take on the responsibility, great power will come,” in a new play on the iconic Spider-Man line. The responsibility? Protecting three young women from a mysterious rival who wants them dead with her newfound clairvoyance. There’s Sydney Sweeney as the meek Julia Cornwall, Isabela Merced as the independent Anya Corazon, and Celeste O’Connor as the rebellious Mattie Franklin. All four of them share the same experience as abandoned women who don’t have real family to rely on. It makes sense that this leads them to become a found family of sorts, but the story lacks the emotional depth needed to be believable. While this quartet seems like a match made in leading lady heaven, the girls are sidelined for most of the film. Cassie is often having them hold tight for three hours in the woods while she runs around trying to figure out what’s going on or disappearing mid film for an impromptu trip to Peru that explains her past. These types of transitions feel lazy and reductive.  Tahar Rahim plays our generic bad guy Ezekiel Sims who strangely sounds as if he’s been dubbed over in every scene. He has no real motivation as a villain other than a vision that the future Spider-Women are going to kill him. We don’t know when or why and it all comes together rather dully. It’s particularly disappointing because the most thrilling moments are when we get to see the girls with their Spider-Women powers, which are only seen in his vision. We never see them use powers in this film, let alone see how they get them. The film does do a nice job of creatively tapping into Cassie’s visual web of powers, as well as the trendy 2000s. In one scene, she rewrites history by crashing a stolen taxi into a diner in a sequence soundtracked by Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” The most interesting aspect of the film is the minor storyline focused on the Spider-Man universe we all know and love. We meet Uncle Ben (Adam Scott) and his very pregnant sister-in-law Mary (Emma Roberts). There’s hints of Ben dating someone new — future Aunt May anyone? — and Mary goes into labor delivering a healthy baby boy. They don’t come out and say it, but we all know it’s a baby Peter Parker! The end of the Sony film is a mad dash to connect the film to the character in the Marvel Comics that finds Cassie suddenly blind and paralyzed, giving off a Professor X energy as she welcomes the girls as her metaphorical daughters. It’s so on the nose that it becomes cheesy. That cheap quality is a running thread with most of the film as it is full of moments that are laughably bad or awkward due to the set ups and dialogue. All in all, Madame Web wastes a strong cast with a half-baked story, weak dialogue, a pointless villain, and no real development of a majority of the characters or their powers. While I would love to see this cast of Spider-Women actually get a chance to shine, this film may be too bland to start a franchise.

"Feb 16, 2024",negative,People will wish this was made by Warner Bros. so it'd be abandoned for a tax write-off. 
"Feb 15, 2024",negative," Wow. Well, this is definitive. We all knew that superhero movies were breathing their last, and that recent flops The Marvels, The Flash and Ant-Man 3 had signalled the inevitable end of it all. Yet, still nothing can quite prepare you for this latest (and surely final?) instalment from Marvel’s “Spider-Verse”. In its sheer mind-boggling awfulness, it represents (to paraphrase Robert De Niro’s Al Capone in The Untouchables) the death of the superhero genre, the burning of the superhero genre to the ground and then the returning in the middle of the night to piss on the superhero genre’s ashes."
"Feb 15, 2024",negative," Madame Web (Estados Unidos/2024). Dirección: S.J. Clarkson. Guion: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S.J. Clarkson. Fotografía: Mauro Fiore. Edición: Leigh Folsom Boyd. Elenco: Dakota Johnson, Sidney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Isabela Merced, Celeste O’Connor, Tahar Rahim, Emma Roberts, Zozia Mamet. Calificación: apta para mayores de 13 años con reservas. Distribuidora: Sony/UIP. Duración: 117 minutos. Nuestra opinión: regular. La última escena de Madame Web, el film ambientado en el “universo del Hombre Araña” que se estrena hoy, podría ser una de esas películas paródicas al estilo de Scary Movie, que tanto éxito tuvieron a principio de los años 2000. Si en lugar de reírse de los modos y formas del terror la idea hubiese sido burlarse de las películas de superhéroes, la existencia de Madame Web tendría más sentido del que tiene como un intento fallido de exprimirle hasta la última gota al género que está en caída libre. El film protagonizado por Dakota Johnson es una acumulación de malas decisiones y desvíos incomprensibles en una trama que desperdicia todos los elementos que el proyecto tiene a su favor. Para empezar, el hecho de que la historia transcurre en el mismo mundo narrativo en el que se desarrolla el cuento de Peter Parker, uno de los personajes más conocidos y queridos de Marvel, podría haber sido una ventaja para la nueva aventura. Sin embargo, cuando se cuenta que Cassie Web (Johnson) trabaja como paramédica junto con un tal Ben Parker (Adam Scott), que está a punto de convertirse en tío por primera vez, el guiño para los fanáticos del superhéroe arácnido por venir -hasta se habla en un momento de la responsabilidad de tener grandes poderes-, es tan insistente que termina por aburrir. En su primera mitad, el film se apoya en el tono del thriller, un estilo que le sienta bien al personaje central, una mujer acostumbrada a la soledad y poco interesada en establecer vínculos emocionales cuya vida cambia radicalmente cuando, tras un traumático accidente, empieza a desarrollar el poder de la clarividencia. Y es en ese punto en que la fantasía y los elementos sobrenaturales toman el mando de la narración hasta chocar la nave. Desconcertada por las visiones del futuro inmediato que se manifiestan más allá de su control, Cassie se ve involucrada con tres chicas adolescentes, Anya (Isabela Merced), Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) y Julia, interpretada por la conocida -aunque aquí resulte difícil de reconocer-, Sidney Sweeney, tan solitarias como ella. Encargada de proteger las vidas del trío, la protagonista empieza a descubrir su propia historia y el lazo que la une a Ezekiel Sims, el villano que hará todo lo posible por cazar a sus nuevas pupilas. Interpretado por el actor francés Tahar Rahim (La serpiente, Napoleón), Sims es quizás uno de los villanos más planos y menos interesantes de todo el universo Marvel, y al endeble desarrollo del personaje se le suma un evidente problema con el audio de sus líneas de diálogo, que parece haber sido grabado fuera de sincronía con la imagen. A medida que la trama avanza -sería más apropiado decir que tropieza-, la verosimilitud del relato se reduce al mínimo, al punto de que cada escena se vuelve un muestrario de frases hechas, declaraciones vacías y fracasados intentos de sumarle épica a una historia que no la encuentra por ningún lado. La participación de actores carismáticos y talentosos como Johnson, Scott, Rahim, Emma Roberts y Zozia Mamet, las últimas dos tremendamente desperdiciadas, termina por transformar a Madame Web en una larga y escasamente creativa publicidad de la marca de gaseosa que aparece repetidamente en cámara. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.
